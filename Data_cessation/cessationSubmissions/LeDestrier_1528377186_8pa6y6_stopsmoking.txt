3 months cold turkey. Feeling fine.

So I'm going on 2 months now and it has been surprisingly easy. Smoking for 12 years. I usually smoke heavily under stress and I'm going through a stressful period right now, so thought it would be extra difficult. But it's amazing how little time the body needs to recognise the stuff as poison again. 

Perhaps this is obvious but recognise what type of smoker you are. For me it was all about the environment and situation I was in. I only smoked in certain situations, si I limit myself from those situations and people. I cant stress enough the value of vaping though. If you miss that deep hit to the lungs, you can still get it from the vape. I certainly don't miss the smell and that awful feeling about what I'm doing to my poor lungs is just gone.

Don't wait to try and and give up. There's no perfect time. But have a good think about what method will work for you. Good luck!

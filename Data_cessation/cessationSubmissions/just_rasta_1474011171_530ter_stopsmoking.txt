Cant go to toilet since i stoped smoking :(

Anyone else had this problem? I wasnt smoking last 3 days but also couldnt go to toilet, guess its natural lacsative.Tried coffe but didnt work, so i smoked one cig this morning and it worked... 
Can i smoke 1cig a day to keep my digestion working or im just lying to myself?

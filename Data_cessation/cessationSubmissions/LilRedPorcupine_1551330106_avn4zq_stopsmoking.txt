Just moved money from my savings to my checking

So I could buy a pack.


I quit Dec. 21 2018. Cold turkey. I had a good month and a half with out a cigarette. Combatting the cravings like a boss. Putting the money I would spend on smokes into my savings. Feeling great about my progress. But then, some stressful life crap happened and I just didn’t have the fight in me so I bought a pack. And now it’s back to half a pack a day or more. 

I’ve never felt so helpless against this damn addiction. I’ve worn out my friends and my support. I feel ashamed and broken. 

I guess that’s why I’m coming to this community. I need fresh inspiration. I need to find the fuck I once gave. I’ve fallen and I need oomph to get back up. 

This is not the first addiction I’ve battled. I’ve got some experience with addictions but damn, smokes are a beast of their own. Their grip on me is foul and toxic. 

I’m able to recognize my triggers and identify why I crave (coping with scary emotional baggage that’s surfacing because of a new relationship). I know I need to displace cigarettes with a healthier way to cope, but like I said- my oomph is depleted. But the self hate hasn’t. 

Has anyone else been here? Is there hope for me? Anyone have any words of encouragement?

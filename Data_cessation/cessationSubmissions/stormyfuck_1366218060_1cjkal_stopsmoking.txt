Has anybody else had really crazy, intense, vivid dreams since they quit?

I'm on day 10 and every night for the past week or so I've had these crazy dreams. My boyfriend mentioned that it might be caused by the new lack of nicotine. Anyone else experienced this?

I should also mention that I haven't really had dreams for about a year/year and a half before this, so it's been pretty weird. The end of the world is a common theme in them.

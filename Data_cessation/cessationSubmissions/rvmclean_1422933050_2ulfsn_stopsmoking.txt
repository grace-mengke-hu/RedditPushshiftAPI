Not replacing smoking with another bad habit.

People told me when I quit smoking that I would end up replacing it with another bad habit. I know some people that start dipping to replace smoking which is pointless in my book. I decided that I'll just increase another habit while I quit. I already have a bad soda habit which is next but why create a new bad habit. Instead of forming a new bad habit. I just drank a soda when my craving were bad to treat myself for not smoking. I only needed it to get me through the worst of it and was able to bring my soda intake easily back down to my old levels if not lower because I became more concious of my soda habit. I did succeed in not creating another bad habit. 


Also I used to chew on things all the time when I smoked but I have chewed anything since I quit. Can anyone explain that?

First "win" on Day 2

My friend I sit next to in class yesterday commented that I smelled like cherries instead of cigarettes. I didn't even realize that smelling like cigarettes might have bugged her. She admitted it had but she didn't want to make me feel bad. She's 7 months pregnant.

Yay, cherries!

Two Years!

I quit smoking two years ago today. I used to read this sub everyday looking for motivation or inspiration or whatever. I haven’t lurked for quite a while, but I just wanted to come by and say thanks to everyone!

I smoked for probably 25 years before I quit cold turkey. I’m not sure what changed for me - I think I just got tired of feeling like shit all the time. The first few weeks were pretty miserable, and then the next few months took a concerted effort and constant focus to stay disciplined. But at some point, I realized I wasn’t a smoker anymore. And then some time later, I realized that I’m not even an ex-smoker. Now I can’t imagine doing that anymore. I went to a doctor appointment and when they asked if I used tobacco, I didn’t even have that pause of thinking about how to answer!

I am surrounded by people who use chewing tobacco at work, and I guess I feel sorry for them. Because I know what that nicotine addiction is - and I know it is completely up to them to overcome it. And I remember being in the middle of that addiction and not even having it in my mind that it was possible to quit. 

My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer about 5 months after I quit smoking and passed away in misery about 5 months later. It was a very rough year for me, but I didn’t smoke. 

If I can quit, I believe anybody can. I was someone who had just accepted that I would always have that addiction. Until one day I just stopped doing it. And then I just kept not doing it until it wasn’t difficult to not do it anymore. 

Anyways, I have best wishes for everyone out there who wants to make that change - you can do it!

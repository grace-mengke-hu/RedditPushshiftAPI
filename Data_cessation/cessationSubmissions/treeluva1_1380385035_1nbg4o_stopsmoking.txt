Just got over a couple weeks withdrawal from 3 year opiate use - my continued health improvement requires I quit smoking -

Little background info - I started using opiates when I was diagnosed with MS over 6 years ago. After a few years on opiods, I was able to switch to MJ for pain management. Much better than the narcos.

I started using opiates again because I didn't believe I was an addict in recovery, I mean, I used them for necessity right? So I wasn't an addict in my mind. How wrong I was - it precipitated a 3 year habit that just came to a close two weeks ago.

I started thinking - am I truly free from addiction? The introspective part of withdrawal is a killer - I will still use mj so I can have a normal life with MS, but what does the tobacco do? 

Nothing but hurt my overall health decline. So until I quit tobacco, I am an addict still getting a fix -

I am quitting Monday morning - Sunday will be the last day I smoke. 

I am here in hopes I can reach out for support from like minded / situation individuals. /r/opiatesrecovery really helped me get thru my wds... I don't know why admitting to being an addict helps, or why talking with others eases the wds for me, but it does.

So hello there - I am a nicotine addict. I just kicked opiates and finally feel so good after 2 weeks of hell, I want to quit smoking too.

Monday is my day -

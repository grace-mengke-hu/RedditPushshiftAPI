Struggling to quit during college, anyone gone through this before?

I've been wanting to quit for some time now, but this semester at school is the busiest I've ever been.
It seems impossible to go through through the mental fog with all the assignments, projects, and tests going on. 

Doing well in school is very important to me, but the fear of my grades dropping because I couldn't focus on studying has kept me smoking for the past few years. 

Perhaps my reasoning is silly, but I'd like to know if anyone out there has some advice, or if someone has managed to quit through the stress of school.

Here is my story

Ok, guys, I've been a smoker for almost 8 years.

In the last half of the year I've started to make a lot of healthy choices in my life ( learn to follow my intuition, surrounding myself with positive people, do only things that I love). The only result that I've got was : love for myself.  I've begun to bathe in good thoughts and positive vibes.
The urge to kill myself with ciggarettes tried to lessen . And I obsessively told myself everyday for a couple of days " You love yourself so much, why you keep putting that shit in your mouth !? Please, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

And I've stopped. I finished the pack and not bought another one. I didn t had headaches or any other withdrawal symptoms and I still hang around with smokers. 
It' s easy when you finally find out that you don't need ciggarettes and the most important thing that you will find out  is that

You will not get bored, you'll still be cool, people that love you will still love you, NOTHING IS GONNA CHANGE, except the fact that you will get rid of an hightly unhealthy habit.

Lots of love,

Andreea

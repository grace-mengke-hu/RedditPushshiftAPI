I need help quitting.

Background; I am a 21 year old woman who has, for the past month and a half, developed a pack a day smoking habit due to various stressors. I’ve been on and off smoking since age 13, and nothing really relaxes me like a Marlboro Red. Absolutely nothing. I chainsmoke. I’m far too young to. Yet, it’s so soothing. I am already beginning to cough a ton. Not as bad as it could be, but when I do not have cigarettes I become quite moody. I have no idea how to stop. It’s become a part of my routine, and I need help.

I don’t think cigarette withdrawal is deadly, but I do know that it comes with difficult symptoms. What should I expect and where do I begin?

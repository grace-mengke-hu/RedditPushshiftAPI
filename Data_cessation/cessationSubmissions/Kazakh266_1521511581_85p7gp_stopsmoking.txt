Quitting using weed and tobacco?

I'm currently trying to quit smoking. Only been smoking for a couple months but i figure i might as well  try and nip it in the bud before it becomes to much of a mammoth task. I've tried quitting cold turkey but ended up buying a deck the next day. Am I better off weaning myself off it by gradually smoking weaker mixes or just trying again cold turkey? Also anyone with any experience quitting using weed please share your experiences. I can't really do a 1 for 1 substitution as i only really have the opportunity to smoke during the night.

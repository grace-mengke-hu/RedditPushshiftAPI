The Emperor protects, you just need faith.

Even a man who has nothing can still stop smoking.

There is no such thing as non-smoking, only stages of addiction.

Success is measured in money. Yours or the tobacco industry's.

Success is commemorated. Failure is merely remembered.

Burn the heretic. Kill the mutant. Stop smoking.

Addiction grows from idleness.

No man died smoke-free has died in vain. 

Life is the Emperor's currency, don't smoke it away.

It is better to die smoke-free, than to live addicted.

Day 2... So easy that I'm confused.

So I've gone through most of Alan Carr and it must have worked... I'm odd because I still have a pack of cigarettes in my pocket, with no intent to ever smoke them. I guess I'm making things harder for myself so that in the long-run things will be easier. (Go through hell now and whatever fire I end up in later will seem like nothing). So far I'm enjoying quitting, shit was hard for the first 24 hours though. (Btw I was a pack a day smoker/15oz of 3mg a day vaper).

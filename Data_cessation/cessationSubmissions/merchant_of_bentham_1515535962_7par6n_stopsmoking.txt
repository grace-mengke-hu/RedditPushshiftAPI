Cold turkey vs. slow quitting?

I've never really quit smoking for a very significant amount of time and am wondering what your experiences with different methods have been. 

Is it easier to quit cold turkey? Or to slowly ease off and eliminate smoking from certain times/places? Or another way that I haven't thought of here? For example, I have the worst time not smoking when I'm either driving by myself, or at home alone in the evenings.  I just get so bored and popping outside for a few minutes seems like a nice break. 

Love to hear what you have to say. I'm gearing myself up to quit, and anything you can tell me would be fantastic.

6 months!

I am so happy to log on and see that star with a 6 in it.  It seemed impossible 180 days ago, but now I rarely even think about smoking.  Thank you, /r/stopsmoking.  I don't think I could have done this without this sub, and my life is so much better without cigarettes.  

And to all you new non-smokers:  Hang in there.  It is SO worth it!

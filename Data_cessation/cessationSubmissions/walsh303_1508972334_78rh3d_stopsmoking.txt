I'm getting a cold!

I've been waiting to get sick because I always quit smoking when I'm sick so i can get better more easily.  So starting right now I won't be smoking, but  once I'm better is going to be the real struggle. Everyone I work with smokes,  so it's difficult not to. I won't be vaporizing because it does absolutely nothing to me.  Wish me luck fam.

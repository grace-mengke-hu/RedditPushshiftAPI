I decided to quit, I'm anxious, so I have a question.

So just a little bit about me, I have severe anxiety and that is what pushed me to ask his.

&amp;#x200B;

I started smoking (tobacco bongs) to somewhat cope with the side effects of starting ssris.   
I did this for a few months, and 7 days ago I decided enough was enough. Since stopping I've been coughing up really dark brown phlegm. I tried searching the good old web but only saw things saying that it's normal for it to be yellow to dark green, nothing about brown.   


  
Is it normal for me to be coughing up phlegm of this colour? I'm really hoping it is, because thanks to the anxiety my mind keeps jumping to lung cancer.

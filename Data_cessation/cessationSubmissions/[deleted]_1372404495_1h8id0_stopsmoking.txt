82 days... this is the longest I've ever gone.

I've always failed around 50-60 days, for some reason that time was a big hurdle for me, but this time I made it. At 82 days right now (just requested a badge, didn't know about this sub), and I'm feeling great. I can run 3 miles (avid jogger) now without stopping, and sex is seriously ten times better.

The only hard part is the writing. As a writer, I randomly crave just having a cigarette in the middle of my writing to think over my plot and where my story is going, etc. All lot of famous writers smoke, so it's a bit hard not being in that stereotype, as silly as it sounds.

Going to start checking here more often, didn't know this sub existed, but happy it does!

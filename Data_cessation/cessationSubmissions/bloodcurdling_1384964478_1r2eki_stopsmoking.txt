Day two.

This is my first post, but I've been lurking for quite some time. As the title says, this is my second day of not smoking. 

I've smoked half a pack (sometimes more) a day for the past five/six years. I've had enough. So, I got a small pack of nicorette gum (I have a 100pk on it's way from Amazon) and yesterday was my first experience with it. I had to work too and found it a lot easier to avoid the smoking patio than I thought. Cravings were mild the entire time I was at work.

As soon as I got home though and after dinner, the cravings got a lot worse. I figured this would be the case because I really enjoy smoking in the evenings on my back patio. 

The entire day I had 7 pieces of gum and consider it a success. 

My question for everyone is this: How do you keep yourself busy during your favorite times to smoke? I'm a full-time student and while homework does keep me busy, there is still a lot of downtime. I also read a lot but I'm still in the mindset that it's normal to take smoking breaks. I feel like the main thing is just avoiding my back patio and doing whatever I can to take my mind off the cravings. 

Also, iPhone apps? I downloaded My Last Cigarette in the app store ($.99) but is there a better one out there?

e-cigs?

I've smoked for over 20 years now, and am fed up with it...I bought a disposable Blu e-cig and take a puff when I feel I need it...but I really, really miss smoking. I know that e-cigs aren't meant for "smoking cessation", but I really wanted to replace it with the Blu and then quit from there. Any hope for me? What kind of experiences with e-cigs have you all had? Thanks in advance. :)

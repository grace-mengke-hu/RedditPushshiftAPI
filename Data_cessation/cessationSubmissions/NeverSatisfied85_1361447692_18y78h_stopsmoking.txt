Quiting NOW

Been stateside for about 2 years. Started smoking while abroad (4 years ago).  My wife has been trying  to get me to quit smoking for a while now.   After finding one of my old imported cigarettes that she hid away god knows when, I knew it would be the perfect last cigarette.  I put all my marbs in a bowl and doused them with bleach water.   Then smoked that last imported cigarette in complete silence with a mexican coke.  It was very satisfying all the more so because it marks a new beginning of both promise and difficulty.   Wish me luck.

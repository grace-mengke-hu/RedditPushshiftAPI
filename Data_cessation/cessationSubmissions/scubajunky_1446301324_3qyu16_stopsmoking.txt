Insomnia Tips?

Day one is over for me, but I slept terribly last night. I didn't fall asleep until 2am, woke up around 8am. I tossed and turned the entire six hours. I'm really exhausted. 

I have an old prescription for sleeping medications. Has anyone used prescription or over-the-counter meds to get to sleep in the beginning?  

Any other advice that worked for you? 


Thank you!

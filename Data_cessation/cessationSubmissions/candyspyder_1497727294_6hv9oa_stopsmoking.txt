Smoking a blunt

My husband and I quit together and he smoked a blunt last night with his coworker after their shift. 

I personally don't care if he smokes or not - especially if it's cannabis related. I'm just curious if using a blunt wrap "counts" since there is a little bit of nicotine still in the wrap. He says he's having cravings. This is probably a dumb question lol sorry

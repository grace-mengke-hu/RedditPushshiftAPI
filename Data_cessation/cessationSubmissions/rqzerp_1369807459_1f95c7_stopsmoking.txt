Distraught by the fact that I always just torture myself for a week or two and then just start over :(

First off, ignore the badge, I'm "off the wagon" ([or is that on the wagon, damn you Seinfeld!] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wx77L9_D84)).

But yeah, I finally get the motivation to quit and keep at it for a week or two and then fail. I've been trying to quit again but I feel like I'll just torture myself for a bit and then start smoking all over again :(

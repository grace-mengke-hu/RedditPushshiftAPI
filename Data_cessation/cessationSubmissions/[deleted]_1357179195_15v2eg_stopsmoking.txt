as of 9pm today, I haven't smoked in 4 days... would like to rant though

I'm very proud of myself. I've been smoking for 6 years, and a pack+ a day for the last 4. My huge obstacle that I'm still working on is that my mom, who I live with, is a moderate to heavy smoker (depends on the day) and she smokes in the house... living room, her bathroom, bedroom, the kitchen, not to mention in the car with the windows closed (?)

 She has refused to make any concessions to me, won't stop smoking in common areas of the house when I'm in them, no matter how many times I've asked her to please, if I'm busy in the room she comes into, to wait until I leave. I've pretty much holed myself in my room all day today after coming home from my boyfriend's for new years, just to avoid the smell of smoke. 

So far I've been really good about smelling smoke and seeing someone smoking, seeing cigs, lighter, ashtrays, not being an irresistible pull to smoke again. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to issues with my mom, and I know I'm going to encounter these situations in real life as a quitter, but it really irritates me that my mom can't even roll down a damn window in the car or wait till I've left the room to start smoking. 

So, fellow quitters, any advice for my situation? My personal solution has been to avoid being around my mom, but that can't always happen (as much as I'd like it to sometimes, hah) When I come home stressed from work, smell smoke and see a pack of cigarettes on the counter, it's honestly hard to resist having one. But so far I've done great, and I hope I can keep it up. Congratulations to all the other quitters of Reddit also :)

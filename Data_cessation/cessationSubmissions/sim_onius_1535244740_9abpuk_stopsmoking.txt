Cold turkey while being ill

Became ill 4 days ago and decided to spontaneously go cold turkey. Has anyone tried quitting after having been ill? I nearly had no cravings by now and am afraid that the cravings will hit me even more the upcoming days as Iâ€™m already feeling a lot better. Smoked between 5 and 10 a day. Has anyone quit in a similar way?

Doc says I have to quit

...of course that is what doctors say. I am getting a surgery this month because of chronic sinusitis. Smoking makes the condition worse, and will prevent proper healing after surgery. I have not been able to smell anything and this surgery will help me smell & taste again. Doctor says I have to quit. So this is it, no more excuses, I am choosing for a life where I can enjoy the taste of nice food and the smell of flowers instead of smoke and doing harm to my health. Here we go!

So, tomorrow is the day.

I've been smoking since I was sixteen (2006), in 2008 I quit, and lasted 10 months, started up again, trying to cope with stress, quit again in 2010 for another 10 months, started up again for the same reasons. This time I am hoping to do it for good. I have a high chance of getting in the military, and for my trade, have been recommended to be able to run 5k, with out being too out of breath, that day I was told that, I decided to see how far I could run, and ran 3k, and felt like shit, so I decided it was time.

I'm tired of always going broke because I "just need another pack, I'll make it last this time". I'm tired of feeling like shit after every cigarette, and i'm just tired of smoking as a whole. 

For those who will say "why wait until tomorrow? Why not now?", i'm practically about to head to bed for the night, so i'm going to have one last smoke before that, and start by trying to pass on what I consider to be "my most necessary cigarette of the day"; the morning smoke.

Sorry for the wall of text, wish me luck, and hopefully I'll be on here as much as possible whenever I need guidance.

Something is different about today

I'm on my third day today and I woke up in what seemed like a different universe where things are just slightly better than before. I was expecting this day to be the hardest based on what I've read but it's actually been quite the opposite. This has been my day so far:

Woke up in the morning and realized that the pressure in my chest is gone. I did not feel that immense tightness throughout my body that only a cigarette could cure, nor did I want one. 
I drove to my class, still no cravings (my car is my biggest trigger), and I felt as if the world looked brighter and the air smelt amazing. I've never been able to smell air...is that normal?? Because I love it! My coffee tastes better and I'm just in a euphoric mood for some reason. It's the kind of feeling you get when you meet someone new or get an A on an exam or someone random gives you a compliment on a bad day.
I just feel good. 
Also, I've had about 2 cravings today but they passed very quickly and were not very intense. 
I'm not naive, I know that this will pass and I will have both good and bad days but right now I will rejoice in this beautiful moment because I've earned it. 

Edit: I've been an every day smoker for the past 10 years for anyone wondering.

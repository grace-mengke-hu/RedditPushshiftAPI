200 days!! Just wanted to say thanks :)

Coming here and reading what everyone else is going through has been so helpful, so, thank you guys!   
  
I smoked for about 7 years and tbh loved it, but now that I'm 200 days from it I feel SO MUCH BETTER, physically and mentally. I never thought I would get here. Rooting for everyone~!

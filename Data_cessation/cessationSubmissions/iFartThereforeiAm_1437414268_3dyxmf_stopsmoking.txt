Video games to enjoy or avoid when quitting smoking?

I'm sitting here on my last night as a smoker, enjoying my last few beers for a while and playing Wolfenstein the new order. This game is harder than I thought, I keep dying and combined  with long load times, I keep getting frustrated and going for a cigarette. 

This got me thinking that even though I have the day off tomorrow, I won't be able to play this game because I will get too frustrated as a non smoker dealing with withdrawal. 

I look forward to playing this game in a month or so, but till then I'd love to find a relaxing but interesting game to play in the early days? It's winter where I am, so it's both a perfect time to quit smoking and to stay in and play video games.

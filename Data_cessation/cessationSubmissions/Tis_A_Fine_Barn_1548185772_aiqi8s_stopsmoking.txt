I am happy with the decision to quit smoking. When you're only a few days/weeks into a quit, then you don't feel happy. You feel miserable about it. I'm here to tell you that for me, 88 days in, I am happy I made that decision. Quit now, and you will too. Presenting #059 Arcanine. See you tomorrow.

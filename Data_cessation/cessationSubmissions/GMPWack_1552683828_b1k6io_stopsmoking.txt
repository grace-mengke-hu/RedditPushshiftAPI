I just started doing bike deliveries for Postmates and Uber Eats!

I’ve been quit for a year and change now (I’ve lost count in my head). I just bought a bike and was going to start riding again after about 12 years. I decided to start Uber eats and postmates to make a little extra cash after work. 

Yea, my legs hurt like hell right now, but if I were still smoking, I’d be coughing up a fucking lung and probably would have given up an ok stream of income.

Fuck you cigarettes! You are not standing in the way of my money!

One month. Eleven days. I got the best reward.

Quitting cigarettes has been tough. I switched to vape... and i'm down to 3mg nicotine. And switching to 0mg soon. 

Im a karaoke dj and a good singer. My voice has changed throughout the years and i knew smoking had something to do with the loss in range... but i didnt know how MUCH. 

sunday night i was running the show, having a great time because there were just a few old guys in the bar and we were just singing the most RANDOM songs. i love those nights.  Then i realized... after six nights in a row of singing my guts out... my throat didnt hurt. Not one little bit. 

I told everybody i was going to try a song i hadn't sung in ten years... but i might turn it off if i couldnt do it. (Celine Dion: All Coming Back to Me Now) 

I strained a liiiitttle on the key change but other than that i nailed it. It felt amazing. I was happy with the idea that i would be able to maintain what voice i have left... i had no idea i'd be able to sing BETTER. 

Im not one to brag about myself... but i got really emotional after i was done... and really enjoyed the applause from my guys. 

Not one puff. Ever. Again.

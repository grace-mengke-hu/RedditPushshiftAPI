Day 2. I have a good feeling about this time!

So I have the stop smoking app for android and every time I want a cigarette I stare at those percentage bars and tell myself that they all get reset to zero if I smoke and I will have to start all over again.

I don't think that is actually how it works but by refusing to verify it I'm happily quitting with some assistance from delusion. It isn't easy and I'm having a hard time distracting myself.

I don't want to leave the house because that makes cigarettes easier to get. But I'm bored AF here.

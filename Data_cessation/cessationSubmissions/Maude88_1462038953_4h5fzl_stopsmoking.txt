I got drunk last night.

When I stopped smoking a couple of weeks ago (nearly three weeks now) my worst fear was that when I had a drink I would get an over whelming to smoke, so I haven't had a drink since I stopped smoking .... until last night. I surprised my self that I didn't even think about having a ciggi. Well surprised with my self :)

Started Caring Again

I noticed I started caring and having more time after quitting smoking even just on the fifth day. I used to feel a sense of apathy about it, but now the only reason I would smoke would be drinking, waking up, or too much stress.

Fortunately I have my music and just am keeping myself busy.

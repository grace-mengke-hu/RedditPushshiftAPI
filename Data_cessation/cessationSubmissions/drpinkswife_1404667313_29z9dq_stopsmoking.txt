So here's more shit I didn't think I'd share...

So I've been seeing this therapist. In the couple of months that I've been seeing her, we established that I've been under more stress in the past two years that I've ever been in my entire life.

So when I went in a couple weeks ago and told her I quit smoking, I could see the 'you've got to be fucking kidding me' look on her face. It's not a look I'm unfamiliar with. I tried to quit like 15-20 years ago and I actually had people say 'now's probably not the time' and 'I don't think it is a good idea'.  

Point is, there is never a 'good' time and it's always the 'right' time. Because in two weeks my stress level has gone down, purely chemically. My life hasn't gotten easier. I'm working on it. But I needed to do this now.

Fuck...start the five minute timer..... here we go again. At least they have lessened. Fucking brain...just one...just one...don't deprive yourself...poor you. So yeah, point being, I'm not going to smoke today.

This started off in such another vein and then the monster showed up.

I'm not going to smoke today! :)

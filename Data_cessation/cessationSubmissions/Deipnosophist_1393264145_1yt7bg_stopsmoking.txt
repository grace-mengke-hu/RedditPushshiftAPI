Questions regarding the use of Ecigs

hey all, i'm new to this sub. I recently purchased an awesome electronic cigarette for only $50 that came with a concentrate smoking attachment as well. I am extremely excited about this piece of equipment and to start my life without cigarettes, but I am worried that I may strengthen my addiction to nicotine in the process. I told the guy working the shop that I am smoking a little over half a pack a day of Marlboro 27s and he recommended I buy the juice with the strongest nicotine concentration. I haven't had a cig or even craved one in 4 days, since I bought the device. 

So where from here? Has anyone had success using this method?

10 days strong - remember punks: we aren't quitting, WE'RE DONE!

I've been lurking around here for awhile, and subbed in the hopes of getting some motivation to quit.  

After finding a PDF link to Allen Carr's book about 2 weeks ago, reading the first 30 or so pages, I decided it was finally time to quit. 

My girlfriend and I were both heavy-ish smokers, smoking about 10-20 cigs a day; started when we are 16ish.  We've been smoking for about a decade each (I'm 26 now). 

I gotta say, quitting with someone has been a huge help!  There's been several times over the past week where I would've broken down and had one if it wasn't for her.  It sounds and does feel super cheesy when you ask someone to "be your support system", but the truth of the matter is that having someone to talk about your feelings, bitch about cravings, and just generally complain to is probably the only reason I've made it this far.  

For example, I was cleaning my car and found a cig under my driver's seat.  I didn't smoke it, but for whatever reason, I jsut didn't throw it away.  I kept it in my car, as kind of an "emergency thing"...i don't even know what i was thinking.  Anywho, I told my GF about finding it as just kind of a story, and without skipping a beat she went straight to my car, found the cig, brought it to me, and broke it in front of my face.  

Needless to say, I love that girl, and she showed me that I was not practicing being a non-smoker...I was someone in the process of "quitting".  Keep your head right folks, WE ARE NON SMOKERS!

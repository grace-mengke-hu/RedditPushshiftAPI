Craving BAD at work after eating

Hello fellow quitters. I'm on day 2 (not sure why my badge says day 1) and I've had it pretty easy to be honest.

Yesterday went off without a hitch, a few small cravings that went away after a few minutes. The usual times. Especially when I get in the car to go to/from work. 

Now today hasn't been so nice. I've been craving a cigarette since the time I woke up this morning. Tried getting up from my desk and walking around earlier to help curb it. But now I've eaten lunch and I *always* smoked a cigarette after lunch. Just feels right. Not sure why I can't shake this craving right now.

Just wanted to throw this out in to the world because today I'm not smoking no matter how crappy it gets. Hope you all have a smoke free day as well.

Hello All.

Hello everyone. New to this sub so i figured I'd quickly introduce myself. I've smoked off and on since I was about 14-15 or so. I'm 26 now and have "quit" multiple times along the way. last time I quit I was good for about a month until my fiancee lost her job and I picked it back up again. I then stopped June 30th this year and haven't been back at it.
To be honest, this quit hasn't been that bad. I've always done cold turkey because I personally believe that getting it all out of your system in 3 days is the best method (nothing against vaping, medicine, patches, etc... just my preferred way of quitting). I've been exercising more and chewing a crap ton of gum like I did with my last quit.
Other than that I hope everyone is doing well and that whatever you choose (smoke or not) you're happy with it!

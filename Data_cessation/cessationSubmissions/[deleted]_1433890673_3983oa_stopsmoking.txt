Day 1 again.

Hi fellow quitters, 
So today is my day 1 after starting to smoke again 3 months ago (haven't reset my badge yet) and this time quitting is a whole lot different than the last time 2 years ago. 
At first it felt a lot easier since I don't have the haze I had the last time, nor do i have any cravings at all. But there is this empty feeling inside my head/stomache and it's starting to get me insane. It's like a constant itch in the center of my head I can't scratch, just a void in me as if something's missing. I tried everything but can't distract myself from it as it's constantly present no matter what i'm doing. 
If anyone has an idea how do get rid of it or how to better cope with it, i'd greatly appreciate any suggestions.

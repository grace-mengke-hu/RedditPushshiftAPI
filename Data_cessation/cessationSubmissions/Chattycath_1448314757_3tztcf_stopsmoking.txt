Day 1....I can do this!

So today is Day 1 and this AM the cravings were really bad and yet I'm still here smoke-free.  If I can be sober for 5 years, I can quit smoking as well.  My husband is still smoking (which is his deal not mine), and one co-worker quit last week.  I'm glad I'm on here which is a lot of support.

Quitting smoking. Should I go cold trukey or reduce smoking and then quit?

Hi everyone,
I have been a smoker for almost a decade now and I know for a fact that my stamina levels are not the same as before. I am worried about my health and I have been thinking of quitting smoking for a while now.
I thought of going cold turkey but the people I consulted told me that it could have some bad effects on me and that got me very confused. So, this post is about me asking you how to go about it?
Should I reduce cigrattes to a minimum and then quit or should I go cold turkey?
P.S. It would be very helpful if anyone knows about what kind of bad effects does going cold turkey have if any.
Thank you :)

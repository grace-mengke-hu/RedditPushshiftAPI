Quitting immediatly after starting

So heres my story.
I have this. http://www.ecigsempire.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=Hookah-Stix
I smoked it once or twice a day for about a week
i didnt know it had nicotine
i want to stop cold turkey. Am i going to have withdrawl symptoms because i dont really feel like i need it. Is that very low concentration of nicotine?
and if i do have withdrawl how bad will it be and for how long
Sunday i took about 10-20 hits
monday probably 5
tuesday probably 5
yesterday 3 maybe
saturday maybe i tooklike 10
Also i dont inhale, i suck into my mouth and let it sit for like half a second and exhale
im just paranoid because i dont want an addiction

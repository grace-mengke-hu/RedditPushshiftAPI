Final Decision

Hi All, So I have finally came to the decision that I want to quit this filthy habit. So far the most I've done was 2 weeks. I hate to be in this anxious state and being a pain in the *** to anybody without a particular reason. Do you guys have some tips and tricks for that? I've identified smoking as a hold up for my personal growth, but it's damn so hard to get rid of it, it always "call" you back. Also, what is killing me, that I am always this super annoyed person to be around, people don't deserve that! Any help or thoughts would help! I'm starting in the next 10 mins again - last death stick.

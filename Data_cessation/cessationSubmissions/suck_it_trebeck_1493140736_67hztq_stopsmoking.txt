For the depressed and anxious

Would anyone here be interested in a program that teaches you to overcome mental illnesses using scientifically verified exercise programs? This would include exercise programs, meditations, and diet plans all specifically tailored to a depressed or anxious person trying to supplement the help they already have. Any thoughts are welcome.

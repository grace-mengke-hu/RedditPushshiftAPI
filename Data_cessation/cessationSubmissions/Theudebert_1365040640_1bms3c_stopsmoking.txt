Today sucked . . .

I was and still am headachy, tired, nervous, foggy, craving etc.  Didn't get nearly as much work done as I had hoped.  But I didn't give in, and I'm not going to give in to the urge to smoke.

However, I am letting myself indulge in a double Jameson, just to take a little bit of the edge off of what has been a miserable day.  So far I'm proud of the progress I've made in quitting smoking and cutting down my drinking.  It'll be nice to wake up tomorrow with a clear conscience.

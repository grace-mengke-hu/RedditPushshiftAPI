Drinking at home, depressed, and thinking about those sweet, sweet 72's...

So I'm on the verge of realizing my 2 year relationship is a failure, my professional career is the equivalent of a high school dropout at the time of dropping out and I'm feeling a little lost in my direction of life.

While I'm not going to ask anyone to counsel me through the things I should be in control of, I was wondering if you fine people would bombard me for a short while of how caving in to a smoke is stupid. Feel free to insult me over it.

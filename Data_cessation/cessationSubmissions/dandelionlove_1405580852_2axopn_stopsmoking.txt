I want to hear your stories. What made you decide to quit, and how did you quit?

I know I can search endlessly on this subreddit for things like this, but I want to give anyone who hasn't had an opportunity yet to share. Also, it will be beneficial to me as I am considering quitting. I'm just curious; I'm glad I found this subreddit. I hope to have a badge soon.


Side note: How do you decide on a date? I don't know when would be too soon or too far away. I've tried spontaneously quitting which failed MISERABLY. So I'd like to hear about that too.

Congrats to everyone!

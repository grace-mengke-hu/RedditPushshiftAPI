Day 5 Smoke free-I can taste things!!!!!

Day 5 smoke free with only a few slip ups. My quit smoking app tells me I've not smoked about 150 cigarettes which is very disturbing. Also a few things I've noticed!!!!

-I am not out of breath while walking fast or going up stairs!
-I can taste everything!
-My breath has improved!
-I am sleeping better and through the night!
-When I broke down and had a smoke, it wasn't that great and left a horrible taste in my mouth.

Again only the first week but things are looking up!!!!!

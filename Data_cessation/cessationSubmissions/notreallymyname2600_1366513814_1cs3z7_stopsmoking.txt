day .. 11/12 of quitting cold turkey

it hurts damnit.  like.  everything HURTS.

I quit smoking pot + cigarettes at the same time, so everything in my life is wrong and I am overreactive to everything and all I want is for it to stop.

I've alienated nice people, I've made an ass out of myself in public, I'm a raging jerk - I just want it to STOP STOP STOP.

and i hear that day 14 it gets a bit easier, so i'm trying to tough it out - i don't actually want a cigarette, i'm fine w/ not smoking, i just want it to stop hurting.   they're already starting to smell gross.    I had a bong hit today - and promptly had a 3 hour long panic attack that was horrible and wouldn't stop till I came down, which is a good thing because it's my preferred substance - just not any good for me anymore.

I quit because i'm anxious - like anxious to the point where I spend a lot of time thinking about wanting to die - and there was no way to make progress on that while consuming two substances daily that cause anxiety.  I'm sticking with it because I don't want to die.

just.  fucking hurts.  and i want it to stop already.   i took two days off work this week to give myself time to deal and i'm considering taking monday too.   going to call my psychiatrist tomorrow and see if she can fit me in next week to help me out w/ dealing with this.

like.  i want a hug damnit.

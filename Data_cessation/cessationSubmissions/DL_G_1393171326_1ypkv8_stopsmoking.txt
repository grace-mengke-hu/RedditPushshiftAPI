I've been wanting to quit but...

I'm 19 years old, I've been smoking since 15 I've seen doctors in the past year that tell me I don't have any noticeable problems with my lungs yet and I want to kick this habit before something noticeable does happen. I've tried multiple times before but so far it's boiled down to me just smoking a lot less than before and unable to quit. I used to be a pack a day smoker, my first step to cutting down has been not smoking in the apartment I live in anymore and that's made it to where a pack will last me about 5 days.

 The main thing that's making this difficult is that one of my roommates (I live with 3 others and only one is a smoker) still smokes inside. Most of the time the stench that wafts in from his room just nauseates me but sometimes it makes me get up and go outside for a cigarette. I currently have no way to relocate myself as this is my only living situation available to me.

 What I'm really looking for right now are tips on how to quit altogether whether slowly or cold turkey, anything would be helpful right now.

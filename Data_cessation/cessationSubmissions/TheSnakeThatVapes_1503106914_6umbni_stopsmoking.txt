I DON'T Want Nicotine Substitution, I WANT A Cigarette

So I "quit" smoking about 2.5 months ago. I use this term loosely as I've had a couple drags from probably around 5 cigarettes since then and about 2 cigars.

I started trying cigarettes at 14 and started smoking considerably at 16. I loved it, every single break at school, before school, after school, at parties, with my buddies. For me a cigarette is a socializing opportunity as much as it is part of my reward process. I work very hard in school and smoking is/was my biggest pleasure.

I'm now turning 18 and over these last 2.5 months I still want to smoke. I vape every time I get cravings yet it's not the same, I don't want the nicotine, I want the smoke, the beautiful taste, the feeling of going outside and opening up a pack.

I am beyond aware of all the risks, especially from starting so young which is what got me to *try* to quit. In fact I got a chest X-ray because of lung pain. (No cancer.. yet, nothing to do with my smoking it was bacterial related) But from my rationale point of view how can I tell myself I can never have a cigarette again for the rest of my life? I can not fathom the extent of this personal limitation. Human motivation revolves around reward systems. It feels like I'm incapacitating myself every single day. 

I don't feel anything from "quitting" except a constant yearning for a real cigarette. Every day that passes by is just more annoyance and it just seems futile.

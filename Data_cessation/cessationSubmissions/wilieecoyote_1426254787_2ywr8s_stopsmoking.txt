Today is Friday the 13th, 66 days without a smoke!

Had been a smoker for 10 years or so at the rate of 10 to 15 cigarette a day. Went cold turkey on January 6th around the middle of the day. The craving has stopped and I think its over!!!

Also TIL: I did not know how to spell cigarettes without a spell-checker till now!

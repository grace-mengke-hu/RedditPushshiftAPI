Day 12 no cigs, day 23 no weed

Soon approaching day 13, day 24

But my sinuses are really fucked, though I feel they are repairing but very slowly. 

What's been happening I've been losing understanding whether I'm a little insane or am I still withdrawing from cigs ? It's my 21st birthday today and I've been spending it alone. My father comes with bunch of life advices and it just gets on my nerves and I tell him ''Not like we have heard that shit millions of times in our lives''... I just want to discuss some ideas and not listen to advices every fucking stupid day. This loneliness is fucking stupid yet better than hanging out with idiots and destroying my health.

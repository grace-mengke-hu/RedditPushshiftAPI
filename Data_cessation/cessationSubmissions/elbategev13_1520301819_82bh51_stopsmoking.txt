Non-Smoking Partner Bought a Pack of Cigs??

I've been dating my partner for over 2 years and have not had a cigarette in almost a year (thanks a lot to this subreddit!). He has never been a smoker. When I was smoking, he might bum one off me if we'd been drinking a lot but to my knowledge he hadn't had one since I quit. 

This week, he bought a pack of cigarettes because he said he was craving one. I'm so mad! They're not my brand, but they're still in my house and he still told me about them. 

I also feel like once you're buying your own cigarettes, you're that much closer to actually getting addicted to nicotine. 

My cravings have been worse now that I know I could so easily smoke one- without even going to a store or spending money. But, I value my quit way too much. Like, I'm realizing I value it more than my relationship. Have any of you had a partner that picked up smoking after you quit?  I'm trying to decide what a reasonable boundary would be. I know I can't date a smoker and also continue not smoking.

365 Days!

Mama, I made it! 

One year today since I quit smoking. I’ve never felt better. I wake up every morning without coughing up nasty green mucus, my chest doesn’t hurt anymore when I wake up, I no longer wheeze when I laugh too hard, I can walk up flights of stairs without literally feeling like I was doing to die. 

I haven’t smoked 7,317 cigarettes. I’ve said $3,200 bucks as well! Quitting was one of the hardest things I have ever done but the best decision I ever made. It IS worth it!! If you are struggling, keep your head up, keep yourself busy and don’t give up. ♥️

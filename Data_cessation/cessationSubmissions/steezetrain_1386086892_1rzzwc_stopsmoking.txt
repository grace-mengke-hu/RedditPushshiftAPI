1 year today!

It's been a long time since I've had any cravings, but I'll be damned if I don't walk into a smokey bar every now and then and still miss the comfort that cigarettes (key word) USED to give me. 

To all my fellow quitters out there, you can do it. I quit cold turkey and have since seen so many improvements in my life. My sense of smell/taste, my athletic ability, my overall happiness. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's totally worth sticking it out.

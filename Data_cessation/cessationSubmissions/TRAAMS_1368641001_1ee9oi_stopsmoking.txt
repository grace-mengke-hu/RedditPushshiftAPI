6 days free; ecig?

I had my last cigarette 6 days ago after a 12/day habit. I decided to quit cold turkey but I bought a V2 ecig (1.8% nicotine cartridges). I puff on the ecig at random, and it FEELS like I only do it out of muscle habit and not because I am craving a cigarette. 

The third day of "freedom," as I have begun to call it, was misery for me. It felt like the worst hangover of all time. Achey, exhausted, cold sweats, migraine all day, etc. The 4th day, I woke up feeling refreshed and better than I have felt in a while. It was quite strange and unexpected.

I want to believe I am over the physical nicotine addiction and that is what I was going through on the 3rd day. Over the past 6 days, I have gone through almost 2 cartridges of my ecig (and not one puff on a real cigarette). They claim one cartridge is equivalent to 20 cigs. 

Am I still weening off nicotine, or have I kicked it? My worry is that the ecig is prolonging my addiction and I will have more days like the 3rd day terror. But if I am still addicted, what in the world was going on that third day? I can step down the ecig to 1.2%, 0.6%, then 0% nicotine over time. Any advice or 1st hand experience would be very helpful and appreciated. 

Cheers!

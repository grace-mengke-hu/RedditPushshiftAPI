The.. Worst nicotine withdrawal ever.

Hello good and strong people of Reddit. 
I am a 19 year old college student. Who went through, and is still going through I think the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life. 

I was a heavy nicotine addict. I dont smoke cigarettes, but i was heavy on gum and vape. One day I decided to quit cold turkey, but i did not think the withdrawal would be this bad. It was horrible. 

For the first three months, I went through the worst depression and anxiety ever. It was so bad that I could not physically get out of bed. Constant thoughts of suicide The anxiety made me breathless 24/7, and i must have sweated out a full lake worth of water. My brain was on fire, i could not hold my head up. With that much stress, I instantly developed Ménière's disease, which I've never heard as a symptom of quitting. The Ménière's was so bad that i couldn't walk straight. My mouth started deteriorating and my tongue looked like the dry desert. I had really bad neck pain and muscle aches, and migraines that lasted Weeks at a time. The withdrawal was so bad that i became unable to even realize the fact that this was happening because of nicotine withdrawal, my brain wasn't able to process what was happening. I was genuinely convinced I was dying. I quit college and moved back to my country so I can die with the family. It was That bad. About 3 months later, I kind of regained my consciousness. Then realized I had a horrible nicotine withdrawal I still have Ménière's and body aches and tinnitus. But no crippling depression. I think i lost hearing in my right ear. Also, my sides are hurting like hell. Oh and I got a complete physical, there is nothing wrong with me. That got me thinking. Did all that really happen because of nicotine? It's so hard to believe that. Did any of the redditors here go through the same thing? Can someone sympathize?

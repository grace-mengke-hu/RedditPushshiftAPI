First day without smoking.

I have been toying with the idea of stopping smoking for a longer time now. This week, I started a relationship with a girl, in which I’ll be needing every cent of my money to be able to visit her. Naturally, first thing that came to my mind was quitting smoking, as it makes up more than half of my monthly budget. 

I’m really weak-willed person, but I’ve got to make this work. Once and for all. 

So today I just stopped smoking after my last cigarette in the pack I had. I haven’t stopped tapdancing with my foot ever since then, and had constant urges to smoke. This is going to be hard. Having a coffee without a cigarette was weird, and I drink a lot of coffee. I hope I’ll be updating you guys in a month, when I’m supposed to meet her again that I had no cigarettes since today.

It's time to batten down the hatches.

There's a storm brewing that's a bit belated.

The last week or so I've been having some wacky thoughts of "needing a cigarette" . It's all fine and dandy except I've not smoked in 3 1/2 years! In today's case I misidentified hunger for smoking. But i think any old triggers are popping up. Im not worried that I'll light one up. Im just shocked how strong the triggers have been.

Interestingly, I've heard of that thing about stuff happening in 3s . And just didn't think it would happen. Haha ðŸ’©

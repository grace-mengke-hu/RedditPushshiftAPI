Just finished reading AC Easyway for the 100th time

I have read and gone through so many one week quits with Allen Car's book. Usually my record is just a few hours without it, except for one stint that I went 3 years without smoking. As usual, I'm hoping this time is the one. That I have learned every lesson I can from quitting smoking applied the resources and tools from the book. 

I have gone all afternoon without a craving. I generally don't crave very much. I feel a slight withdrawal, but nothing really fixes that issue so I will keep up with the quit. 

Does anyone have any tips on keeping smoke free long term? Especially those of you who have quit using Allen Carr a few times.

Six months of lurking here and I'm finally ready...

I've been smoking on and off for roughly three years. Not nearly as addicted as some people here, at least that's what I told myself... but I still struggled with quitting. I told my girlfriend I had quit but every time I got drunk without her I bought a new pack. This morning was the fourth day without a cigarette and I convinced myself that it would be okay to have just one. Took two drags and it tasted like shit. I have two packs with a couple missing in my closet right now and I'm going to throw them away when I leave for work. I'm tired of feeling guilty and weak. Tired of scrubbing my hands so that they don't smell so terrible. I've tried e-cigs but they don't really help much. Maybe posting here will finally be enough to stop for good.

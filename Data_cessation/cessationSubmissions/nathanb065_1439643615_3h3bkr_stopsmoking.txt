How do I get over the hump?

I vape at the lowest nicotine level. I went from 30 cigs to 3 or 4 a day. Every 5 days or so, however, I relapse, buy a pack, and chain smoke like I did just 3 weeks ago. 

I need advice on how to get over these 3  cigarettes as I feel they're the gateway to buying a new pack. 

It's scary trying to drop a habit I've carried with me for 9 years...

Just made it to a week! after almost 8 years of smoking.

I am thinking its seriously going to happen this time. It has been a little over a year since i have quit chewing. Not sure how many of you are familiar with the army but i get to spend this fine 1st week anniversary while on a 24 hour CQ shift! so... proud to say that I am sucking with out sucking.

Finishing day 8....

I think I’m finishing day 8- for those that have been following my posts the last few days- today was the hardest day of all mainly because of the stress from work.  I almost broke about 6 times during the work day.  I even pulled in to a gas station, sat in my car for minutes, banging my head against the headrest, yelling my mantra.  I didn’t smoke.  I have a pounding headache.  Thinking about work tonight I found myself mindlessly pacing my house looking for my cigs.  I’m still thinking “it would feel so good to take a nice long drag on a Winston.”  But I know this is the nicotine trying to hang on to me.  I’m not going to let it win.  I’m better and healthier for it.  I AM a non-smoker.

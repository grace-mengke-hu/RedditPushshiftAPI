Quit smoking by surprise!

Just a quick rundown of how I quit smoking. For the past couple months I've had quite a bit of pain from a broken tooth, so I set up a dentist appointment to check it out. I knew it was in bad shape, but to my surprise they suggested surgery right then, and an hour later I walked out with a bone graft and explicit instructions to not smoke.

This was on the 7th of this month, so I haven't smoked for about 3 1/2 weeks. I've tried quitting before, but the negative effects of lapsing this time have made it a lot easier to refrain (chance of the surgery not healing properly and the bone graft failing). I'm already at the point where I'm not having many cravings, and I think this time it'll be for good. 

Side note - I haven't experienced any great improvements in my health, mood, sense of smell, energy, etc.... feel pretty much the same. Has anyone else experienced the same?

I plan to stop again within the next few months...

I originally quit and reached around 9 months before starting again...

My quit day is Friday. I'll be either vaping or using nicorettes (they worked amazingly last time).

I'm sorry that I started again, a load of bad things hit me all at once but now, for some part, life seems to be just pacing out smoothly again and I'm praying I won't need cigarette's to stabilise myself when things get too bad.

When can I smoke again?!

This thought rushes trough my mind from time to time. Im now on my 4 week and it feels awesome. But deep down there is a demon lurking, that just wants to have only one puff, just because there is enough time from the last cigarette gone and now im in control. Or so do I think. How can i change this demon and my belivies that are deep down buried and can come up when im the lowest?

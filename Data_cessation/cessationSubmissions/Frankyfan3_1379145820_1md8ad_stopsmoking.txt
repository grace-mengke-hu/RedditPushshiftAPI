I feel like I'm winning

Less than 2 weeks in, & a night out on the town happened. There were delicious cocktails, live music, expensive food.... And I didn't have to smoke. I didn't even want to after my 3rd drink. They were sooo tasty too, without all that gross stuff mucking up my taste buds
It was so liberating to pack my purse for the evening & not have to make room for a pack & lights. I kind of felt like something was missing when I was getting ready since I'd taken them off my mental checklist & I'm still getting used to that, but quickly realized/reminded myself I would get to enjoy more of my evening without them. I was right. 

You guys were right! I spent a few mins on the drive (I wasn't driving) perusing your posts & I really helped me focus on why I've become a non-smoker. 

Before, I was half mentally preparing myself to accept failure if I gave into temptation while getting ready. 
BUT I wasn't even tempted.

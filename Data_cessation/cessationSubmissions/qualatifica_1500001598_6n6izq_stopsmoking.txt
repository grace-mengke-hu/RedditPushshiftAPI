Just finished day 4.

I have found that the patch is making it much easier than previous quit attempts but I was sad about quitting today. I know it's good and I'm proud that I've made it 4 days..... but I miss it. Like I've lost a friend. I know it sounds weird but I'm not sure how else to describe it...Sticking to it anyway.

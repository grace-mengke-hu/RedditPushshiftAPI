Gained 20 lbs since quitting. Tempted to start back up.

It's been almost three months since I've completely quit and four months since I started cutting back on smoking and I've gained almost 20 lbs. I know I've started eating more, obviously a lot more. And now the urge to start back up so I can easily lose the weight is getting stronger every day.

Edit:
I have decided to try and work at losing weight. Thanks to many comments on here I know the easy way is the dumb way and I have cut back on calories slightly as well as started some light exercise. The past three nights I have gone for 30 minute walks and today at work I decided to stand as much as possible and limit my sitting to 2 minutes at a time and I ended up only sitting for 6 minutes(not counting my lunch break). Thanks everyone for the encouragement!

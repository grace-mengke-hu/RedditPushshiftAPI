I want to quit but I'm not sure if now is the best time

I managed to go a full week cold turkey while I was on vacation last week, and it was so much easier than I thought it would be to quit, and had full intentions of quitting when I came home. I got home Friday night and within 45 minutes I had a cigarette in my mouth. I'm in college right now and my classes are really stressing me out, and I have a few big, life transitions coming up soon. I'm also not in the best head space right to deal with a lot of these things as is, but have to do them anyways. I feel like quitting right would only cause me more problems. Ideally I want to stop after school ends this spring when my stress levels aren't as high, but I also feel like I might be using this as an excuse to continue smoking. What do you guys think, any advice is appreciated.

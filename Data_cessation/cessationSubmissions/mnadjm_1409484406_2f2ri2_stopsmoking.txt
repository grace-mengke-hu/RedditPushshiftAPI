Smoke free 3 months and 13 days!

I quit smoking for 5 years, using patches and reading Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking. 

1 year into my start up 2 years ago company with all the stress it brings, I started foolishly to have a cigarette with my beer while I was on a business trip in NY. I felt well I'm away and after 5 years I can have one cigarette with my beer. Well I was an idiot, cause soon I had cigarette as soon as I had beer or wine. At the end I ordered wine with my meals so I could justify my smoking. Very childish I know and I'm 40.

I decided life will always be stressful with my company, family, mortgage etc and I don't want to hear myself breathing when walking slowly and I want to play with my kids in the park. I went back to Allen Carr's book, patches and downloaded Smoke Free app so I can tick daily achievements. The NHS program wasn't very useful, I know they give patches, one week you pay and one week they pay. But as I was travelling for business I couldn't follow their schedule. 

I just had a trip to Italy, didn't have to get out of house as soon as I wake up in the morning for a cigarette. I didn't want my kids see me smoking. I didn't have to excuse myself from breakfast/lunch/dinner from family to go for a smoke. 

I tell you, it hasn't been easy, I have had my weak moments, mostly involving being out with friends and alcohol. But I told myself never again.

So I thought of sharing it here and hopefully my experience can be useful to you if you are at start of your journey and/or if you are 5 years in. 

Just say never again and don't get arrogant like me after 5 years having cigarette with your beer. 

Best

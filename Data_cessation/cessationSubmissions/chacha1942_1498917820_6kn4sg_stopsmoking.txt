Is there a stop smoking crisis line or skype channel for real time support?

I intend on using this community for support.

Any and all encouragement is welcome.

Sometimes the pangs are seemingly more than I can handle.  Curious, is there a crisis line or Skype channel one can reach out to for support in real time?

Thank you so much.

Relapse after 20 days

So I managed to go 20 days cold turkey, but particularly this last week I have been craving like mad and today I finally caved and bought tobacco. I'm pretty much unemployed and homeless in a new country, where I only know my (smoking) wife, so there were plenty of little things that chinked the armor. Basically I think I started doubting my own decision to quit and that doubt eventually eroded my resolve. 

Now I don't know how to deal with the relapse - throw out the tobacco and go straight back to not smoking? Take a break and try again in a few weeks when things hopefully have settled down a bit? The dumbest part is that I have gone without for so long that I don't enjoy the cigarettes at all, I can't even inhale properly without choking. 

It feels pretty shitty, but I still feel motivated to quit as I love the feeling of clean lungs.

I just found this sub and wanted to share my milestone!

I quit 9 days ago and knew that a night out could be my undoing. On Saturday (day 7) I managed to be at a party, surrounded by smokers and didn't fold! It was an incredible feeling to not even want a cigarette. Little victories like that make it easier to keep going for me.

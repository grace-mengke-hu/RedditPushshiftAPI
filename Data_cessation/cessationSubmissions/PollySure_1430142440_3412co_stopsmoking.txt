Waiting for the other shoe to drop

I spent 16 years as a smoker and tried to quit so many times, but it was incredibly difficult and I'd always give up after a few days (if I even made it that far). This time is different. It's easy, like TOO easy. It's weirding me out, I am terrified that the other shoe will drop suddenly and this will get as hard as it's been in the past. I try to not focus on those negative feelings and praise myself, but it's strange. Has anyone experienced something similar? Maybe I'm just totally ready, finally?

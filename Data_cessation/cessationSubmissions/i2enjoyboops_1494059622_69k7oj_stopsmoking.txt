Quit Day: May 27th, Noon.

I plan to have a goodbye ceremony with my last planned smoke on May 27th, in the woods, alone.  I've been planning to quit since last year when my daughter was born.  It's going to be my birthday present to her.  I've never been able to quit for myself so here's hoping I can quit for her.  I've drastically reduced the amount of cigarettes per day this last year from lack of time and ability to get away but they have also been my reason to walk away for a few minutes.  My biggest fear is what is going to help me chill out when I'm having a stressful moment with the kid?  Any ideas for a quick stress reliever?  Something I can go to the basement for less than 5 minutes to do while my husband takes over?  I am still going to need my minute breaks to decompress and come back happy mommy I just don't know how.  Also trying to talk myself into positivity about quitting a 22 year pack a day habit.  I really do enjoy smoking unfortunately.  I don't smoke around the kid but I still smoke in the car when she's not around.  Getting in the car and lighting up is a big joy for me, especially now.  Any ideas about what to do about that would be greatly appreciated.

Edit:  Idk if anyone will ever see this edit but whatever.  I did quit.  I didn't do it on the 27th and I didn't go into the woods by myself.  I still had 5 smokes left so I smoked them up on the 28th and it's been a week now.  It was still the kid's birthday so I'm ok with it.  Yesterday was the hardest day yet but I didn't smoke.  I freaked out about spilled soda and wanted to murder a worker at a grocery store but I didn't smoke.  Fuck Breaking Bad season 4 with all the damn cigarettes.  That's not really a spoiler is it?

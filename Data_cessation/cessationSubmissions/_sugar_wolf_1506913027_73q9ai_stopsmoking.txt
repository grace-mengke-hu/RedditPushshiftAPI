Help! really struggling

So I quit over the summer. Then this fall I had a break up and used that as an excuse of course to start again.

I have really stressful months ahead of me with school and I have probably quit and started again 6 times over the last month.

As soon as day 2 or 3 hits and it's crazy busy my mind just goes blank and I buy a pack.

I don't know what to do anymore - I really want to fucking quit.

I guess it's good I'm reaching out here and doing something about it. 

Any suggestions or tips are much appreciated.

Stop smoking for at least 18h

I am Quiting 1 day at a time!

At the moment that means focusing on "manageable periods of time.

I have achived 18h and over on two separate occasions in last couple of days.

Today I will shoot for at least 18h (but maybe more).

Cigarettes leave me sick, anxious, unable to concentrate, insular and needy.. The payoff for quiting is quick and obvious. I feel clear headed, focused, feeling healthy and empowered. 

The only reason I smoke is due to my hopelessly misguided neural pathways and a brief moment of all encompassing visceral intoxication.

Right now its hugely helpful to be strong and experience relief over  short periods of time.

Ultimately I will stop for good, but that is not my focus. (for now)

I will not smoke until, at least 6 am tomorrow morning.

My work will flow more eaily this afternoon and social engagements and my social engagements will be a pleasure tonight. 

Wish me luck!!! :)

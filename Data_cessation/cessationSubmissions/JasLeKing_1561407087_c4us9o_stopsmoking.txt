2 months ... Daily cravings !

I have made it 2 months. 11 days. Not one smoke. Yet, the daily thoughts of having a smoke is beginning to wear on me. I had read it gets easier.  Which it has on some days. However, on other days I think about how just one would take the edge off.  Shit starts to get real.

I truly want to stay smoke free. I have made it this far. Week 3-5 seemed to be really easy. I was like shoot, I got this. And now the past few days have been ARGHHH again. It puts me in quite a mood. 

I don't post a lot here however I have read a lot of posts from others and appreciate your emotional support. Thanks for reading.

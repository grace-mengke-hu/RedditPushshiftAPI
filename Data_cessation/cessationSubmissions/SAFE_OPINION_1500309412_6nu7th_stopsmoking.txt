Quitting alcohol for a month starting yesterday

I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds himself shamefully incapable of resisting smoking when drunk. After making a series of bad decisions on Saturday night, the kind that make a person feel embarrassment and regret for days thereafter, I am now quitting alcohol for at least the next 30 days, and am quitting cigarettes at the same time.

Wish me luck, or join me!

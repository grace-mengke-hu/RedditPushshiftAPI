First day

so today is my first day without cigarettes. I tried about a week ago and failed miserably but this time I am chewing nicotine gum and regular gum and it takes the edge off. I tried allen carr before and that did nothing but the gum seems to be helping a lot. I was disappointed because easyway seems to work for a lot of people. Anyway, this is day one and I wanted to post to commemorate it.

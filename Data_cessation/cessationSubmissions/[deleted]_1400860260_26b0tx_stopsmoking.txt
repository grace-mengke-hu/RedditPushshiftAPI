How do relapses work with my "quit date?"

I officially quit smoking on January 5th.  
  
On February 15th, I had a very emotional conversation with a friend of mine while drunk, and due to the stress of the situation, had a smoke. It was awful, I didn't get a buzz, and I regretted it.  
  
I've been dealing with a pretty bad relapse of depression, combined with some other issues with my personal life and finances, and last Saturday, after being mistaken for a coworker who is 75lbs heavier than me and who has been repremanded due to his poor hygiene, I cracked and had a cigarette. Later that night, I was berated by a customer for 45 minutes. I had another smoke.  
  
I haven't had a cigarette since Saturday, and I'm not really craving one, but I don't want to pretend that I "quit" in January if what has happened since counts as an actual relapse and not just a fuckup.

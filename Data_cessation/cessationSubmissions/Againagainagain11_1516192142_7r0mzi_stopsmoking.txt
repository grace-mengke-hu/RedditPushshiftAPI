Day one of vaping

I've quit cigarettes, but not nicotine - I'm vaping. I've stopped cold turkey before but it was pure hell and I always went back.

Can anyone tell me what I expect from switching from cigs to vaping? I think I'm getting less nicotine this way. Not vaping much and weak ejuice. Feel anxious, a bit depressed, a bit annoyed.

Thanks.

Edit: thanks for your answers. It's nine pm and I made it through the day. I did eat an awful lot of food today, though. And I think I can taste it better.

1 day completed. Mixed bag of emotions. â˜ºðŸ¤•

Obviously I am ecstatic that I went one day without a smoke. I had access. My flat mates are smokers as are my colleagues. I felt so happy coughing up phlegm because I know that is the healing process. I enjoyed the mild headache like one enjoys the ache after a long run. But about an hour back , hour 22 after quitting, I threw up. Still puking and retching. Don't feel like smoking but really do feel sick. Any advise ?

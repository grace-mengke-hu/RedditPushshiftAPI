I'm trying to breathe life back into r/Stopdipping

It seems to be an abandoned sub as the moderator activity was 1 year ago, but there are a few individuals that post there on occasion.   I just discovered it a few days ago.

I attended the 7th Annual Smokeless Summit this summer, and help people quit nicotine everyday on www.killthecan.org.  We're the biggest website out there dedicated to quitting chewing tobacco, and we're always willing to help out those that want to be free.  I will try to be impartial of the quitting methods, but I am biased towards ktc as it works for me (872 days quit).

I just thought I'd stop by and introduce myself.  Quit on quitters!

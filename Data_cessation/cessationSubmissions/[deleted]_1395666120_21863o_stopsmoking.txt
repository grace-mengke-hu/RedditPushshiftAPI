12 hours smoke free, questions about cravings.

It seems like everyone else here gets cravings and "beats" them by not giving in, and the little slip in the cigarette pack also says they come and go in 3-5 minutes, but now and every other time I've tried to quit, there is no end to it. I just feel fucking terrible from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed. I know the answer is obviously just don't give in, but what am I doing wrong? Why do my cravings never go away? 

Also, I've been thinking about buying mint leaves and a cigarette roller, has anyone had success smoking mint cigarettes?

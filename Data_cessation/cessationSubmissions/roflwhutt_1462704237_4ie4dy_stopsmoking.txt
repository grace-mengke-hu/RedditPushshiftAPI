Okay, let's go for it

I've downloaded an app and i've just lightend my last cigarette in the backyard with the sun shining down on me. Better weather even makes it harder, but it'll be my first test.

This is my first serious attempt for stopping with smoking since ever. I've never really tried serious quitting but I'm having a caugh lately and im in my young-twenties - this aint good. 

I've smoked a pack per day and went from bad to worse ever since i've lost my first family member..

Wish me luck - I'm going to need it.. 

Any advice is welcome because right now i'm done with smoking.

Counting from today!

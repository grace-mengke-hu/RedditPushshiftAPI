I messed it up already :/

Guys I messed it up already :S

I had this one cigarette on new years eve and thought ok you were drunk, shit happens from now on - no more. Well I messed it up after my office christmas dinner while all the others went out all the time for their cigarette, I was sitting inside all the time or went out with the non-smokers for some fresh air. However, on the way home I had some time to kill and went to the store. The cravings were quite intense. First I just bought another beer, but then I went back thought "Screw it I buy some - I will threw away the pack after I smoked just one" - Silly me... smoked at least two, took the train home, smoked another one... felt miserable because I smoked, smoked another one... and so on... now there's a pack and a lighter at home again and I had to reset my smoke free app. (Not a nice feeling to see that you have to reset almost 10 days, all the badges earned disappearing and the savings to go "poof".) 

Right now I wish I never started with this crap... :/ 

Guess I have to write to our badge-bot again. 

Cheers to all of you struggling and thanks for all the advice here. I guess I will be here for a little longer...

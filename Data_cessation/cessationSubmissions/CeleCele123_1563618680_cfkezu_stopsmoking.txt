Two weeks

I'm on two weeks now without a cigarette. It would been a month if I didn't had that one cigarette two weeks ago, but I try to get over it haha. My body feels much better now, I can take deep breaths, I don't smell etc. But, mind is still craving for nicotine and nothing seems to help. Last time I had withdrawal on 16th day and I'm coming close to that period now. I don't want to fail again, so when will cravings stop and what will help me get through it? Cheers.

Help needed in smoking cessation.

Hi I have been smoking for last 10 years now. I want to stop smoking but I fall back to it within few hours of deciding. I haven't seemed any help as none is available. People I talk to think I am not motivated enough . Maybe I am not but I want to kick this habit. Everytime I have tried to quit I get this sensation of bloating and constipation which is very distressing to me. Can anyone point out strategy to stop smoking and also avoid constipation . Please , I ll be very grateful to u fellow redditors. I am writing it out here as I have no one to turn to to help me out . People are judgemental .

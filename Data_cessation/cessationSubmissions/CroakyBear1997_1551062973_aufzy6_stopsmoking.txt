Slip-up at 9 months

I made it 295 days without nicotine, and I slipped up and bought a tin tonight. I told my support system about my slip-up before it turned into a relapse. So, people starting this journey, know that you have to stay vigilant against the addictive mindset! I reflected on why I slipped-up and it’s due to anxiety. I’ll be reaching out to my counselor Monday morning. Tomorrow will be day 1 for me. Good luck guys!

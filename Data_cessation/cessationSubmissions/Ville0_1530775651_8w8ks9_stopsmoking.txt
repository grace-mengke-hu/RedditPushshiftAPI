Sleeping difficulties

Is anyone else experiencing these sleeping difficulties? Last week I didn’t sleep that well. Well no biggie it happens. During the weekend I stopped my NRT and now I can’t sleep at all! Like 10 hours this week. 

I’ve been smoke free for 21 days now. And I used to be a good sleeper no matter what. Now I wake up 5 in the morning for no reason at all and can’t get to sleep at before 1 or 2 am.

This is the only reason I would like to start again but maybe this passes

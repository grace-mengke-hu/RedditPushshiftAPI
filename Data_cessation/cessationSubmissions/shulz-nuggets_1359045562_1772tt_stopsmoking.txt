Day 1.5, already struggling a bit. Anyone else experience this?

It's as if my brain has split down the middle: one side is the nicotine saying "just go buy one more pack, it'll make you feel better" and the other side is my Allen Carr fueled minset of "no, fuck you nicotine, I'm done with you." I'm sure this is common, but it's almost making me looney with the back and forth, back and forth. One minute I'm extra motivated and the next I'm on the verge of walking to the mini-mart. Any advice or strategies to deal with this? How long did it take until it subsided? I'm going to go on a run this afternoon which should take my mind off it for a while, but DAMN! This is fucking hard!

Look at all those zeros!

1,000 days may seem like a lot if you just quit, but 95% of the hard stuff was in the first two months. It has been effortless for a long time now. 

I was wondering how many hard days I had to go through to get to easy. I don’t think it adds up to much. Even the most difficult days weren’t hard the *entire* day. It just feels like a long time when you’re in the middle of it. 

I think the time I spent learning about nicotine addiction and getting my head straight, greatly reduced the amount of time I spent having cravings.  The wealth of info at WhyQuit.com was invaluable, as was the unbrainwashing of Allen Carr.

Hang in there. It’s worth it.  It’s wonderful over here.

Early Smoking stage .... help

Hello Stop smoking

I once again turn to my reddit friends for help. I caught myself binge drinking and went to stop drinking and got immense support. I did not want to quit and wanted to be occasional drinker and I am doing very good. I drink one or two drinks with friends once ish a month .

But but but I just started smoking .... like 3 weeks ago! I used to have a smoke here and there ( once a year kinda deal!) but I was very stressed lately with life and work, I just started "stress smoking". I just realized today, I just smoke 5-7 cigs a day whenever I am stressed which is every day now. I just started with this horrible habit so I want to stop right now .... Please help me :( 

I tried handing all my cigs n lighter to my bf last night but I just took break at work and went to nearest gas station and purchased another pack :( then I went for a smoke and felt so darn good. There are so many addictions in this world as it is, I do not want to be slave to another one! What is the best way to go cold turkey ? :(

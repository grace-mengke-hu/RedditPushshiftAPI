Stopped smoking in Feb. I feel like I'm now an official non smoker!

Someone on here once described the smell of a cigarette as standing outside a nice restaurant when you're not hungry. I understand that now. My resolve has never been stronger and my willpower at an all time high. Work ethic has increased. Taking more action and winning at life in general. Everything smells great. I now relax by putting on some clean clothes, sitting outside on a nice day, cup of coffee/tea. Rarely think about smoking. This was the most difficult thing I have ever done and defiantly the most rewarding.

FINALLY QUITTING TODAY!

Hey reddit. Quick story. I am turning 23 next month and I have been smoking since 18. I'm not a badass who has done it before 18 cause I didn't care too. But I have been doing roughly a pack every other day, occasionally a pack a day, since 20 and that really added up. I keep reminding myself that I could quit and sometime last year I tried. It lasted 2 days and I was back at it.

I keep telling myself that it isn't that hard but this time I went public with it to all my friends and family and now to you guys. I specifically come to you guys cause the success stories I read encourages me to quit and today is officially day 1 of 'NO MORE SMOKING'

I know this will be an extremely tough journey but with all the support I will look for I know I can do it. My question to you guys,
"Should e-Cigs be an option to quitting cigs?"

My concern is that if e-Cigs help me quit smoking normal cigs will I then become addicted to e-Cigs and need help quitting that?

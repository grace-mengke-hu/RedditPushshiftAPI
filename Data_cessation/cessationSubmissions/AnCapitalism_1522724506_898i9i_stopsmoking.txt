Relapsed

Hey community. I am 23 years old, M, and recently made it 40 days before I began smoking again. I've been smoking 7-8 cigarettes the last 3-4 days. I started taking an occasional cigarette with friends about 10-14 days ago, and then it has climaxed this week ahead of a (now over) court date. I'm looking forward to sharing more tomorrow and getting a one day badge Wednesday :) God bless You all.




If any of You have recently began using again and wanna stop, let's talk about what that's meant for us!!

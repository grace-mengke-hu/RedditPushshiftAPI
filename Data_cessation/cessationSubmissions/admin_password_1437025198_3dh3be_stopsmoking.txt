Here we go again..

So I've been smoking roughly ten years now, I really hate it, I've tried to quit many many times always falling back into my habit. I'm not sure this time will be a success but I am determined to try once again. I'm using nicotine patches this time to try and make it a little easier, any tips would be appreciated!

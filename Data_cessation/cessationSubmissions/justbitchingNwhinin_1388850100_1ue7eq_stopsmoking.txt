Quitting again, having a hard time of it

I'm not tempted to smoke, it's just wow... my muscles ache, my joints are stiff, I've got a sore throat, I feel weak... fuckin sucks and i just wanted to whine to somebody and figured you guys wouldn't be like "Shut the fuck up!"

Anybody remember if mucinex or just going for a walk helps clear shit out of your system noticeably?

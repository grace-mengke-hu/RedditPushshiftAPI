“Way No Ciggies.”

Last June I ended up extremely ill and I quit smoking; right after coughing up blood in borderline scary volumes.. (had been smoking for 6 years)

Anyway I’ve been “Way No Ciggies” for the last 8 months. There were certainly some struggling times where I considered caving; but everytime I was buying a case of beer and looked at the tantalizing colors of the pack, I remembered “Way No Ciggies” and I couldn’t buy it. 

I just went through a break up and have definitely been stashing away some swelling emotions. I went to the store and bought cigarettes and a 40oz beer...

I just broke the last three cigarettes in the pack and smoked the last, they still feel foreign. 
I’m starting at day 1 again I suppose.

For a moment I thought lighting one up again would just fix everything, but as soon as I choked down the first one I realized I still felt the same; if you’re sad, you’re sad. Ciggies won’t fix that.

Just wanted to share this here, I’m not a very active subscriber of this sub but thanks.

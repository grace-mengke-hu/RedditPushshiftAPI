Failed on Day 43, Bought a Pack & Smoked

I feel like a failure, after smoking again tonight after 43 days. I believe it was God's will that I stop, so with that in mind, I was able to quit cold turkey. Now I fear what's to come since I did the opposite of god's will & smoked.

I rationalized &told myself this was better than drinking or getting high on drugs. I took something I heard throughout the day & used that as an excuse to smoke.

It wasn't even satisfying, & I felt a bit sick when I finally took a drag.

Feeling awful, & want to quit again, but I don't know when I'll be able to try again.

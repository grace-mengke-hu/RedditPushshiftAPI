4 days

56 yr old here. Smoked for 41 years. A few half assed attempts..This time.  Trying with determination.  My son started 2 years ago (aged 19) . He gave up a week ago. I promised to do so as well. 
It has been 4 days. I have smoked a dumpy from my cars ashtray.  Tasted horrible.  But. Have not bought any. 
Feel I can do this. 
I am so inspired by you all. 
I will keep you posted. 
Thank you!

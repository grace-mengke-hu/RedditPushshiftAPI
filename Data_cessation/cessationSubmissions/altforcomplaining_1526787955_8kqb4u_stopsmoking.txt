decided to quit after a year of smoking, determined to be healthier

i'm 16 years old, and started smoking everyday when i had just turned 15, and recently i've been getting chest pains and feeling shortness of breath and I think it's most probably linked to cigarettes, and I've decided to quit before i do any more damage to my body, it's going to be difficult but i'm ready to better myself, wish me luck.

3rd time must be the charm

Tonight I will smoke my last cigarette. I have managed to quit before for periods of 3 months and 1 month, so I know the capability is there.

This time I have my parents following through with quitting as a family and preventing my father from loosing a leg due to his life long smoking.

Luckily I have only been smoking for about 7 years and I know I can reverse most of the damage because of this. I know I have to slow down on the pints and weed since they are both triggers and the last few months I have gotten both of those under control too.

2018 is going to be a amazing year!

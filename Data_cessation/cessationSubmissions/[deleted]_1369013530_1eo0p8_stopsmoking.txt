Almost a week in..

Hello r/stopsmoking. I know it's probably common place in this subreddit, but I really do want to extend my sincere gratitude to all of the non-smokers who have continued to encourage others (and myself) to make what seemed like an impossible step into the future of being free from cigarettes. 
I'm still in the first steps, but I've been doing well with the support of my girlfriend who smoked her last one with me. The only difficulty I'm having is the random times of stress or anxiety that are keeping me from completely moving on. It's the only time that I somehow have convinced myself that smoking has helped me get through and that I don't know what I can do to rewire myself to handle stress. 

So, any quitters have any suggestions?

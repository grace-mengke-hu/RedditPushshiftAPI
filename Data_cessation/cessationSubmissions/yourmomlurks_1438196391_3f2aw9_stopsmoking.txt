Greetings from Day 4ish

As I'm going through my journey, I've been planning a post (still pending) to this community.  Planning a post motivated me to stop and take notice of what was going on during my quit, and reflect on how I would communicate it.  Soon I'll be ready to share what I learned in the first month (mostly pre-quit).  

Today I just want to spend a little time sharing what day 3 and 4 have been like, for those of you who are struggling with Day 1 or 2.  

**TL;DR:  It gets better.**

History:  Mom was a smoker until I was 13.  I picked it up at age 21 and didn't realize I was addicted till I tried to quit (duh).  Never took it seriously until new (now ex) husband put his foot down when I was 25.  I went on the gum, and had to go on the patch to get off the gum.  Cue 7 years of no smoking, with the very occasional pack, to the point where I could have a pack in the closet for a year and simply not touch one.  About 2 years ago, I slipped back into it during life stress - if I'm being honest it was an act of rebellion against my mom and my boyfriend (yeah, at age 33 - we all have times of immaturity).

Recently: 5-8 American Spirit menthols/day, tapered down from 10-12 at peak.  I learned from this very sub that American Spirits are the devil - they deliver much more nicotine than "regular" cigarettes.  No wonder my previous favorite, Nat Sherman Classic Mint, stopped being so enjoyable.  

Today: 14mg patch per day, wearing for full 24 hours.

**Notes from Day 3**
I'll get into details in another post, but at first with the patches I was supplementing them with either gum or a lozenge.  Do not try this at home.  Starting Monday, I was patch only, so that's why the numbers may seem funny on how I'm counting.

Here's what I learned:  I have a whole sturm and drang going on with my high-pressure job and having to find time to get my car repaired because someone hit it in the parking garage.  Around 3pm yesterday, about 10 things had happened all at once that really put me in a foul mood and got the addict brain to start thinking..."How can I get away with a cigarette?  I really neeeeeed a cigarette right now!!"  

I realized right away that something to plan for and vanquish is *needing to react to stress with nicotine*.  Before, it was a cigarette, lozenge, or gum.  Addict brain says, "Because this, then that."  Unbelievably, this was the first time I realized this, despite many quits!  Now, I have to train myself to respond, "Because this, then...nothing...wait and calm down."  

The pattern is so ingrained, even quitting advice tries to substitute something for cigarettes.  Because this, then gum/lozenge. Because this, then carrot sticks.  Because this, then exercise.  Because this, then drink a glass of water.

Trying to find the perfect substitute to distract myself was taking my power away; the power to tell my mind and body, "This isn't hunger.  This isn't thirst.  This isn't a need that requires a reaction.  This will pass."

I would say substituting is a good strategy for the first part of a quit, but plan to get rid of the mindset as soon as it is achievable without risking failure.  Upon reflection, since I never got rid of the equation in my mind, over the years that equation would cause me problems.  Because a friend died, I smoked a few packs of cigarettes.  Because I had work stress, I smoked a few packs.  Because my current relationship was rocky in the beginning, I slipped all the way back into full blown addiction.  No more *because this, then that.*

**Physical Stuff**
Yesterday, Boyfriend pointed out something interesting when I was talking about my symptoms.  What a tricky drug nicotine is.  While my lungs are healing and getting better, my body actually feels like something is *wrong.*  My chest hurts and feels tight.  How messed up is that?

My primary symptoms of withdrawal are a tightness in the jaw and switch-flip rage.  Yesterday, the jaw portion was maybe a 4/10.  Bothersome but doable.  I only had the switch-flip rage once as above.

**Notes from Day 4**
I kept my used patches in the wrappers, because I want to dispose of them all at once so the dumb dog doesn't do something stupid.  I counted them this morning, six used ones, one on my person, and seven to go.  Then I'll step down to 7mg.  One of the main things I am changing about this quit is not taking shortcuts.  I am sorely tempted to stop early and tough it out because it's going well with the idea of being done faster, but I also know that is 100% the way I get overwhelmed and have 'just one.'  Make a plan and stick with it.

I'm worried about Saturday.  Saturdays are my Me day.  Boyfriend does a Daddy/daughter thing.  I'm an introvert, so this is my me-only recharge day.  My food choices, my hobbies, my thoughts, my podcasts.  And, in the past, my "smoke as much as you want without judgement" day.  Boyfriend has been really stellar at keeping me physically active, and is also a natural storyteller and entertainer so I'm never bored.  So I'm worried about Saturday.  Gotta make a plan.

As a former French inhaler, it is so nice to have white boogers again instead of tar balls.  No wiping my nose and having tar everywhere.  No stinky hands.  I have a rental car for a week and it's so nice to not have to plan cigarettes around a no-smoking car.  

The jaw bother is a 3/10.
Lungs are also a 3/10. 

Just a little bit better than yesterday.

On the patch front, I personally found the vivid dreams very enjoyable.  I have the luxury this week of sleeping in and going to work late, and the dreams were amazing!  This morning's dream wasn't that great.  So good news if you are on the patch and the vivid dreams bother you...Day 4 seems to be when they die off.

Hope you're doing quit club right now and you find this post helpful!

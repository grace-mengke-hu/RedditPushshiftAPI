Gorgeous cigarette pictures

There are none. But what I did was google for a pic of the most disgusting butt filled soggy ashtray I could find and made that my phone and computer background pic. Works pretty well when I get a craving. Gross. Funny how your brain can trigger the reminder of what something smells like just by looking at a photo. Wet ashtrays as we know, don't smell like lilacs or bacon. 

Try it. Go ahead. You just might not like it. And it might help you too.

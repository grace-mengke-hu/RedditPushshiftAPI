Unexpected craving quenched by old craving trigger

I'm close to pushing 3 weeks and it's been a while since I've had a real pushing, won't go away craving.  The craving trigger is kind of odd but it was going to a pinball arcade.  It's old hobby of mine and it's been a while since I've been.

But after getting into it a few rounds I was really craving a cigarette (as I would usually do and then go play some more).  Earlier on I found that if a craving popped it it'd usually go away in a couple minutes especially if you could find something to distract you.

Well this gameplay distraction was the trigger so that wasn't really working lol.  It was annoying enough I couldn't concentrate on playing well so left earlier than I probably would have liked.

I was kind of hungry so I stopped by a burger place on the way home.

Now usually after eating was a craving in it's own right.   Obviously I had to get over that a while ago and now this time a full stomach left me not even wanting a cigarette.   Strange.

I doubt the start of this is relatable to many but thought it might be worth sharing a story on how your own personal trigger might pop up unexpectedly but maybe having a bite to eat might shut your brain up after all.

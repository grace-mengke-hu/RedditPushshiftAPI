5 Days in.. but seem to have lost my sense of taste!

Pack-a-day smoker that woke up the morning after the turkey day hangover and decided I was not going to buy another pack. I went (instead) to the local vape shop and got the "black friday hook up" (on an asipre k4).. So far it's keeping me off the cigs (win) but I have noticed that my taste buds are basically not working. It's like my sense of taste just disappeared.  I noticed it yesterday afternoon..  any one else experience this?  How long did it last!?

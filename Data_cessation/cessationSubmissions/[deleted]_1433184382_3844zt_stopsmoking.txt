An odd realization last week

So I'm what you might call a "light" smoker on and off for about 2 years (has it really been that long??). Started off with 1-2 cigarettes a week, escalated to 1-2 cigarettes a day, longs. 

Particularly stressful/drinking days might go up to 4-5, but never much beyond that. 

I decided to quit not too long ago, mainly because I always viewed smoking as a casual thing and not so much an addition. Boy was I wrong. 

The cravings are real, and I'm surprised to see how much smoking can affect (read: elevate my mood). I'm relying on nicotine gum (2mg) for now to help stabilize my mood and get my mind off things. 

But that's not what I'm writing about. Last week, I caved and bought a pack of Dunhills after a week or so of quitting. 

I smoked half, and promptly threw the entire pack out. Why? Because it didn't feel that great! It tasted kind of gross, didn't help my mood at all, and made me feel slightly dizzy. 

I don't know if that was an off day or what, but whenever I get a craving I just think back to that moment. yes, I might crave it sometimes - but no, it won't make me feel much better at all. 

Plus, I'm saving $15 a pack! I guess those ridiculous taxes are finally paying off after all. 

Cheers to everyone on the journey!

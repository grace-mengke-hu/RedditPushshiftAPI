Started smoking again after 2 months smoke free :(

I went 61 days without a single puff, but after some emotionally stressful recent events and good ol' seasonal depression, I broke and started smoking again, which only made me feel worse. I'm going to start going to the gym and redouble my efforts. For all of you out there struggling after a few weeks, DON'T CAVE! Its not worth it.

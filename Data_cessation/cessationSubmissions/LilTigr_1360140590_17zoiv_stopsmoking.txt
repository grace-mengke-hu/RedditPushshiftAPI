Quit today.. Day one of many!

I'm not a big smoker, maybe two or three cigs a day, or half a pack when I'm out for drinks on the weekend. But I'm going to stop completely before it gets worse again, I used to smoke a pack a day. My boyfriend said he is stopping with me as well, so at least I will have motivation. Last time I quit, I got horrible sores in my mouth, but they went away after I started smoking again. I'm terrified of this happening again, because they are SO painful. We shall see! I'm 20/F if anyone is interested in corresponding or just needing a buddy to talk to!

This post helped me beyond words can say..

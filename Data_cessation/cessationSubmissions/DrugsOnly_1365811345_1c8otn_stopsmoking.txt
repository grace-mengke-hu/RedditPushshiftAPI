I can smell again!

It's been 5 years and I worked my way to a pack a day, but about two weeks ago I started taking chantix. Instantly the chantix started to work  and I could only smoke about 5 of cigs a day. Now I can't smoke a cig without it tasting horrible. I've switched to an Ecig (reensmartliving) and only smoke it now to have something in my mouth or to make smoke tricks. I've done a lot of drugs in my life, hence the name, but nicotine is the most addictive drug I've ever tried, over cocaine, over mephedrone. I'm happy to finally be on the upper hand in this battle.

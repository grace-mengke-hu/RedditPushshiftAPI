One day in, this time hopefully for real. I'd like to hear your experiences with using e-cigs.

I started picking up a heavy habit last year as a sophomore in college.  I was a heavy pot-smoker/vape connoisseur, and the act of smoking was a godsend stress-relief for those countless, long nights spent studying.  Unfortunately, the habit is getting out of control financially.  Also, I can feel the toll in shortness of breath and the darkening color of my teeth, which had poor enamel to start with.

I can't cold-turkey it with the stress of school and research right now alongside quitting several other addictions, so I decided to take the plunge with an e-cig.  I got the vaporfi; it's... unsatisfying, but it's keeping me from going insane so that's good.  I've heard many stories of people getting off cigs starting with e-cigs, but I'm curious to hear to experiences of getting off the e-cigs afterwords.  I don't want to be vaping forever; I would say fairly confidently that in spite of the constant shit-studies published about presence of carcinogens, it's not doing the same damage as chainsmoking on a daily basis, but I'd rather not just replace the addiction.

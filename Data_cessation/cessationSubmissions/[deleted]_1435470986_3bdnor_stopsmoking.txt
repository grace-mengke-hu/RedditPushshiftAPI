365 days cigarette and nicotine free. Damn it feels good. Thanks to the forum for your encouragement and support over the past year. I can honestly say I won't to going back to the evil weed.....Cancer never phased me (I live with HIV Dementia) but emphysema terrified me. I don't want to spend my last days on earth gasping for air wishing I was dead. I will never run a marathon but I can now comfortably go for long walks and climb stairs without losing my breath. CHEERS!

20 day quit diary

I've been quit for 20 days now. I've kept a record of each day at chroniclesofaquitterblog.wordpress.com. to give others an idea of what to expect. Some days were worse  than others, but overall it's been easier than I expected. To make this as helpful as possible please add your experiences in the comments and feel free to share with anyone you think it may help. Good luck to everyone on this journey

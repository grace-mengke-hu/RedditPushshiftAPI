Questions after One Month Smoke-Free

Should the depression and fuzzy-headedness have gone away by now? When I first started, I was amped up to quit and was riding a wave of victorious happiness about it. Soon after, withdrawal symptoms started to kick in and, while they made me upset, I was usually able to deal with them. 

Now, after almost a month of not having touched cigarettes, I still feel a bit depressed. It's still harder to concentrate than it was when I was smoking, but I'm not actually craving cigarettes anymore so I can't blame it on intrusive thoughts. Has anyone else experienced this?

I'm only 19 and I HAVE to stop smoking

I don't know. I have a real problem. It's only been a year since i've been able to buy cigarettes legally, and I'm a pack-a-day smoker. It's costing me a fortune and doing a number on my health. I've read Allen Car's Easy Way to Quit Smoking and quit for about a day, but I went out and bought a pack the next day. I feel like I could stay on track if I could get just a week or so under my belt, but the allure is too great to resist. Perhaps I need to re-read the book more thoroughly this time. I want to stop, and feel I could, but I can't stop seeing myself as a smoker. Any words of advice?

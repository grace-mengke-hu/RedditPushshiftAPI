Just starting to quit

I've been coughing so much lately, I just can't handle cigarettes anymore. I tried quitting once before, but I only lasted about 3 weeks before breaking down and smoking again. It was also less about quitting for me, and more because my Mom and best friend  both constantly tried to tell me to quit and I did it to shut them up more than to help myself. 

This semester had been a stressful one for me, and I sometimes would go through 2 whole packs a day, but I hate the way I feel all the time right now, no cigarette is worth living in constant discomfort. This time, I'm quitting for me.

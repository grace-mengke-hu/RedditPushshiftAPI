Anyone in here quitting vaping?

So I've quit cigs and have only been vaping the last month or so, and even though that's progress I know vaping still isn't healthy and ideally I'd be nicotine free. It almost seems harder to quit vaping for me personally though because the negative health effects aren't as obvious or in your face as regular cigs. So has anyone here quit vaping and if so what improvements did you notice? Just looking for some motivation to adopt that quitting mindset again because with vaping I usually trick myself saying, "ehhh, its not THAT bad, I'll quit eventually but I'm fine for now."

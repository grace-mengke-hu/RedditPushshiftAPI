Conflicting methods with Chantix-please help me sort it out.

I’m on day 4 of Chantix. No bad side effects. Just the vivid dreams, but I had those already because I also take Seroquel which causes them. I do know that cold turkey is the best way to quit and I quit for six months that way but for reasons I went this route this time. Onto my question. 

I’m hearing conflicting things about how it’s supposed to work. My doctor (and what I’ve read) say that I’m supposed to continue smoking and the Chantix will make it so I don’t want to and so I will stop. Right now (I’m only on day 4) I still have the urge to smoke, but the cigarettes seem to taste bad now and after I smoke one I feel like I smoked two back to back. Not sure if in my head or if it’s the drug. 

I’ve also heard that Chantix is used for the side effects of withdrawals though and that one should set a quit date and the Chantix will help from there. 

So which is it? I don’t have a quit date or anything. I was hoping I would lose the desire like in the first scenario, but now I’m wondering if it doesn’t work like that and I continue to have the desire and just quit while the Chantix helps me better succeed with that? 

I hope that makes sense. Can anybody share how it worked for them?

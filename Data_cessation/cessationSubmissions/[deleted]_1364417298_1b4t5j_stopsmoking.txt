Ten days.

So hey I'm new here. I've been an off again off again smoker for roughly 7 years now the longest I've managed to go without was 3 months. Currently I'm sitting at ten days.

I quit for a number of reasons. The prices rising now and then, health, etc. 

However, while I've managed to stay off of cigarettes I still get the urge two or more times out of the day. I've managed to alleviate this by dipping if the urge pops and I've gone from 4-6 pops a day down to one. Currently I've got a little more than half a can and an unopened one sitting around. For awhile I tried snus which did nothing for me but dipping has at the least offered immediate relief.

While I'm glad that I've gotten off smoking so far, I can't say I'm entirely proud of my efforts considering I substitute one for the other to help with the withdrawal. I'm hoping over the course of the next month or so I can get off nicotine entirely.

Thanks for reading!

My plan to quit smoking.

I've recently been having awful coughs and mucus build up so I decided to quit smoking. (This is the first time I felt any REAL negative effects on my health due to smoking). It's been about 3 years since I started and I'm currently 20 years old. I smoke about a pack a day, which is alot for anyone. There are some days where I smoke less, and some where id like to smoke more, but I just try and stop myself. 

Anyways, I've been looking online, and I think a good way to start would be to lower the amount of nicotine going into my body gradually, until I stop completely. I would like to be completely done with cigs by January, (New year's resolution), but if for some reason that seems like too short of a time frame, I'll try and go a bit longer. 

I started looking at other means of getting nicotine, and they're all not pretty. Nicotine gum gives weird dreams and cause reported cases of heart problems and sweating. Same thing with patches. Also there's this pill that literally makes you go insane for 2 weeks but is guaranteed to stop you from wanting a smoke. Anyways I decided that all of these sound extremely awful and too risky for me, so I think I will try to start vaping.

This will give me control of how much nicotine is actually going in, and it's supposed to be much healthier than smoking real cigarettes. 

I have no plans to visit the doctors, but if you think it's a good idea to get a real opinion from a professional, then I will. But for now, nothing super serious is happening to me, and I'd like to see how far I can go on my own.

TL;DR

Would like to quit smoking. Planning on switching to Vapes to have a better idea of how much nicotine I'm smoking, and gradually lower the dose until I can go on without any.

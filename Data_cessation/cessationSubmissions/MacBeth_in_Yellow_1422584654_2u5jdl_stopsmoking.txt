Got prescribed Wellbutrin, slowly cut back my cigarette intake by half without even realizing I was doing it. Oh, and I'm on Day 3 with no smoking.

Yeah, I'm amazed. I've been smoking since 1993, minus about two years when I managed to quit for a time. So needless to say, I'm pretty much a compulsive cigarette addict and have been for years.

As part of my treatment for depression, my doctor switched me over to Wellbutrin last August, and I discovered one day that my cigarette habit went from almost a pack a day to about half a pack and I didn't even think about it. It just sort of happened.

I finally decided to call it quits this week because, hey, I'm probably not going to get a better opportunity to do it. I'm still getting cravings several times a day, but they aren't overwhelming and I've done well with distracting myself.

This is not the longest I've ever gone without smoking, but it is perhaps the easiest time I've ever had dealing with the nicotine fits during the first week of withdrawals.

Neat.

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for the outpouring of support. I'm really impressed by this subreddit; I seriously had no idea what to expect in making this post. I do very much appreciate the pats on the back, thoughts and so forth. I still have a *long* way to go, but aside from a few "something-isn't-quite-right" moments during the day, I'm doing surprisingly well.

Oh, and I just requested the badge. I understand they're pretty cool.

First day of a new me!

I've tried (halfheartedly) a few times to quit cold turkey in the past, but just got way to irritable and would fail after a day. 


But yesterday I saw that nicotine patches were on sale at my local drug store and realized it was time. I want to be done with wasting money, ruining my health, and constantly smelling like an ashtray. I know it's not going to be easy but I know I can do it - I have to do it! I threw out the rest of my pack, picked up some low calorie snacks, and started a 30 day yoga challenge too (I'm hoping it'll help with mindfulness). I'm just going to take it day by day. That's all we can do, right? 


Keep being awesome everyone! We got this!!

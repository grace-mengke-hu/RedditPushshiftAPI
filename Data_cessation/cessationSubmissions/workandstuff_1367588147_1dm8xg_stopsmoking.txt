My first 24 hours

Hi stopsmoking,

I'm kind of proud of myself. I just finished my first 24 hours smoke free since I began smoking. (Every other quite attempt has been weaning down but always ramping back up before being smoke free, or going ~8 hours without a cigarette)

I'm uncomfortable at best, but managing. I keep reading online though that I'm not over the worst of it yet. I wanted some advice from other redditors, what do I have to look forward to in terms of symptoms in the immediate future?

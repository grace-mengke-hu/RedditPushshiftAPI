Sure picked a hell of a time to quit somking.

Basically, I'm going through a really tough break-up where my entire future is no up in the air, and i'm not sure what I want to do. From the moment it happened I wanted to go to the store and buy a six-pack and a pack of cigarettes because I felt like I "need a smoke to figure this out." But coming here has been helping. This is the longest I've gone, cold turkey, in 11 years. Just wanted to get this off of my chest.

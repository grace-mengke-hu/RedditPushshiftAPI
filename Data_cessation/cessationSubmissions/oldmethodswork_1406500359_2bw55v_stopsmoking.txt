Non-Smoker Stamp Idea

It suddenly dawned on me that we should be allowed to get a non-smoker stamp put on our license. This would be totally optional, and it would indicate to tobacco outlets that you can not purchase nicotine, even if you are of age.

How many times have we given into just one craving? I know it won't solve every problem because you can still bum one off of your friends. But shouldn't we have every resource possible available to us?

Log entry 1. Day 1.

So I've been wanting to quit for sometime now.  I'm 25. I've been a smoker since I was 19. Well last year has been the worst year.  I got dumped for another dude to a girl I thought I'd marry. Kept making excuses to quit. This year rolls around and I think I'm down on my luck.  Well 3 months ago I started talking to a girl who is an absolute awesome person. She is my cousin's boyfriend's sister.  Following me?  Good.  Ok. Anyways, we are perfect for each other.  I live in a super small town in louisiana so women that are my type are rare. It's been 3 months and we have not even kissed.  I'll make attempts and she'd just turn away saying she was just shy.  (Back story: she's is *extremely* shy.  It took a whole month just for her to say anything to me).

Well last night we were laying in her bed and I tried again. She turned away again.  So I ask why?  Thinking it's me because I don't exactly have the best self confidence.  Her answer was simple..."I really like you but you smoke.  I thought I could deal with it but I can't. I don't wanna kiss you because I've dated guys who smoked and dipped and I didn't like kissing them".

She also mentioned how I'm constantly talking about quitting and I never do.  Well this morning I decided to do it.  She said she'd help support me if I needed.  I got the gum.  It's fucking terrible.  Taste like someone took cigarette ashes and added a little bit of mint and molded it into gum. But I did it.  It's been about 12 hours and I haven't touched a cigarette yet.  Hopefully I can quit not only for my health but also so I can finally get a smooch from a girl sent from thy holy flying spaghetti monster ;) Wish me luck!

Day 3

My sister came over to get my kids for a sleepover. I had not told her I quit. Forgot about it and she offered me a smoke. Strongest craving I have felt so far. I said yes in my mind like 20 times. Talked myself into it. One would not hurt. One would be ok. I deserve this. Everything I could think of to convince myself to do it. 

"No thanks. Over 2 days clean."
That shit physically hurt to say. But I got it out. Somehow. She left with her smokes later on. And I smell like Hubba Bubba bubble gum. I'm still here. Still clean. Saying no is tough but it can be done guys. Keep moving forward. 

Btw--I rewarded myself with like 10 pieces of chocolate for that. I deserve it lol.

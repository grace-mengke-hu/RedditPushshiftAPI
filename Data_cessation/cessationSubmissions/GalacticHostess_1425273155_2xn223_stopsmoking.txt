I haven't quit yet, advice for when your trigger is your job?

I tried my first cigarette in June of 2012, it was a moment to where I made a choice to have a drink or take a smoke.(note high stress situation), barely made it through a pack in all the months up to the job. It really wasn't that interesting to me.
I started working a new job in November of the same year, and the stress of retail made me go through a pack a day ever since.

I get emotionally drained being a cashier and on top of all the drama in that job, I have to smoke before, after, and I am itching to run out of the building on my break to have a smoke.


I have noticed its taken so much more away from me than just money. On top of the time lost I could have been doing productive things like art, my anxiety seems so much worse. I tried cutting back but with all the stress at home and the idea of being at work for mid shifts I had a meltdown and called out this weekend because of the panic attacks.



I put in for vacation time this month, with the sole intent to be starting cutting back, so by the time I am off I will not purchase or smoke a single CIG. I can try the first week confined away from my job to deal with my initial withdrawals.

But what about when I go back?

5 days without cigarettes. My journey, struggle, and how I feel so far.

Hello everyone! I'd like to first introduce myself. I'm 25 years old and have been a smoker since 16-17 years of age (about 9 years of smoking). I had numerous quitting attempts in the past that either lasted a few days or hours. My previous attempts failed because the cravings got the best of me. I quit 5 days ago and this time it's different! Whenever I think of cigarettes, I don't crave them, I actually feel nauseous and sick. 

The reasons for this post are as follows:

1. To share my journey and experience that led to quitting.

2. To log my progress for my own use and others that are in a similar situation.
3. If I ever feel weak or about to relapse, I could read this post to remind me of the way I felt when I first quit.
4. To empower others and myself to keep going strong about bettering ourselves.

My previous attempt to quit smoking was about 2 months ago. I am married and my wife also smokes. We decided that we need to quit for the sake of our health and the health of our 3 year old boy. We quit together on the same night. I don't remember how long we lasted but it was the worst time of my life. Not only did I have cravings, we were fighting constantly. Worst of all, my son had to endure living with 2 fiending addicts for a few days. Ultimately, I began to smoke behind my spouse's back. This made it even harder because I was only able to smoke when I was away from my wife. This led to constantly devising plans to leave the house. Spending time with friends that don't exist or staying out later than usual. I'm sure she suspected an affair. Looking back at this makes me laugh at how stupid I was.

Last week, I was browsing reddit as usual. I stumbled on a frontpage askreddit post about a book that you would recommend to others. Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking was one of the top comments. Immediately, without any hesitation whatsoever, I went on Amazon and bought it for overnight shipping. Previous to reading that reddit post, I had never heard of this book. I had never even considered using a book to quit. I'm sure just like many others, I had previously just tried to quit cold-turkey. This only made me want to smoke more and made me into a grumpy, angry monster.

So, I got the book the next day and thought that this will be another one of those things that I'll use as a doorstop. Boy, was I wrong! I started reading the book and everything just clicked. The first night, I read about 60 pages of the book. The second night, I read about 20 pages. The third night, my addict mind started playing tricks. I started to tell myself that I wasn't ready to quit. I didn't read any pages that night. One thing about the Easyway is that the first rule is to not attempt to quit or cut back until you finish the book. The forth day reading the book something changed. I don't know what it is, but my mind was made up. I considered myself a non-smoker even before finishing the book. Mind you, I was still smoking like a chimney. **Ironically, I decided that the only thing stopping me from stopping smoking is the book itself.** I sat down for about a couple hours, only taking breaks to smoke, and finished the entire book in one sitting. As soon as I finished the book, I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I knew that my next cigarette will be my last. 

**For the first time in my life, I enjoyed a cigarette.** I didn't enjoy the taste or feeling that I felt from it. On the contrary, I hated all of that. The reason why I enjoyed that cigarette was because I knew it would be ***MY LAST CIGARETTE EVER***!

**Day 1**: I smoked my last cigarette at around 9 am on May 26th, 2014. The rest of the day, was a mix of feelings. I was happy, excited, and elated, but also, sad, empty, and depressed. I understood that all the negative feelings were just caused by my physical withdrawal from nicotine. I didn't try blocking thoughts of smoking. I actually welcomed them. I went to sleep knowing that day 2 will be worse, but I was excited to experience them.

**Day 2**: I woke up with a throat ache and stuffy nose. I tried taking a deep breath and it hurt my lungs. I went into the shower. The thoughts about smoking started. Immediately thinking about smoking caused me to cough. The cough caused me to think more about smoking which caused another more violent cough. This went on for about 10 minutes in the shower, until I vomited. The entire ordeal lasted for only a few minutes, but the cause of it was years of beating my body up. This was my body fighting back. I began to quietly cry in the shower at the idea of destroying my body for all those years. 

**Day 3**: I haven't mentioned this yet, but I'm a 4th year medical student. For all these years, I thought that I had uncontrollable anxiety. I am a very sociable individual and have no trouble talking to strangers or superiors at work, but there are times when my anxiety was so bad, that I had out of body experiences. The anxiety was usually triggered when a physician asked us students a question and I *thought* I didn't know the answer to it. Day 2 was different. I went to work feeling confident. For the first time of my medical career, I didn't have to chew endless amounts of gum or spray cologne to hide the smell of cigarettes. **I felt free**. I could concentrate on the task at hand instead of worrying about what my attending physician would think of me if he/she smelled the smoke on my breath. Not only did this previously cause me anxiety, I also spoke with a very low voice to make sure that my breath didn't reach their nostrils. This led to many occasions when I said the correct answer but was not heard because another student said it even louder than I did. I had an epiphany that day and immediately called my smoker friend that also suffered from crippling anxiety to tell him the good news. After work, I went straight to the gym and got myself a membership.

**Day 4**: Withdrawal symptoms are quieting down and becoming less noticeable. I noticed a few things about myself. My hands and feet in the past have always been sweaty and cold in the winter or summer. On day 4, my hands are warm and the tips of my fingers and toes are red. The blood supply is being restored! I worked out for an hour and a half at the gym with a personal trainer.

**Day 5 (today)**: I feel so great that I just had to share it with the world. No one else wants to hear it. In fact, my wife is actually angry that she is not able to quit and is not putting any effort in reading the book. Every time I talk about how I feel about quitting, she rolls her eyes or makes a face and goes to smoke a cigarette. So, here I am posting on reddit. 

**TL;DR: Almost every part of my life that had previously given me anxiety and stress, turned out to be directly linked to my nicotine addiction.**

If you actually took the time to read my post, thank you so much for showing interest in my story. I'm happy to know that there is a community like this and to be a part of it.

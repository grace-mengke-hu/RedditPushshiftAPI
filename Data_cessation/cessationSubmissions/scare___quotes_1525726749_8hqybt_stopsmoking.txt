Hopefully inspo for someone: Skipped the brutal, 2-month-long cough this year, after quitting for 12 months

Hi r/stopsmoking,

Figured I'd pay it forward a bit, and am hoping this can give someone else the inspiration to go another day without smoking. I quit last year, after I developed a cough so bad (in around early March) that I quite literally fractured the cartilage of my rib during a coughing bout (the diagnosis is "costochondritis", if you're interested). The cough stuck around for about 2.5 months, causing me agonizing pain and a deepening of the cartilage fracture every time I had a particularly bad fit. I couldn't sit up straight or hunched, lay down, roll over in bed, have sex, exercise, reach up or down to grab things, nada. Every year prior for the past ~5 years I had developed a cough in early spring as well (likely due to a combo of allergies allowing for the entrance of whatever virus was en vogue), which usually lasted around 2 months and was always quite bad through the duration, but this was the final straw. I always told myself it was just a virus/poor immune system and that smoking alone couldn't possibly be the reason I had a hacking, deep, painful cough for much longer than anyone I knew (except other smokers... the denial is strong), but that year, figured that I'd be willing to give absolutely anything a shot just for the chance to never encounter the rib pain again.

So, I quit. This year, my "allergy/virus" combination lasted a week and a half. We're now into May, and through my typical sick season, so I feel comfortable confirming: smoking caused my yearly intensive illness. My doctor confirmed.  If this sounds like you, and you're tired of being ill, know that in your future, your symptoms will likely be lighter and your recovery time much, much faster if you stop now. Good luck!

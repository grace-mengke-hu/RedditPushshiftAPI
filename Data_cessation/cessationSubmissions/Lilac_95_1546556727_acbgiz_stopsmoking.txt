Smoking when I get too drunk

I really wouldn’t call myself a smoker but it seems whenever I get really drunk, and I mean really drunk, I end up accepting smokes from friends who offer them to me. I have no desire to smoke when I’m sober, and am usually a pretty light drinker so this really doesn’t happen all that often at all (New Years was the first time I’ve done it in two years, and before that I’d only done it maybe three times) , but I always regret it horribly and get very stressed out about it. I’m not really a big drinker and when I do drink I try and count how many drinks I have and know my limits, but sometimes I just mess up. I know this sounds silly because it really does happen quite rarely but I don’t want it to happen at all as I’m scared even the few cigarettes I have had have done damage , does anyone have any advice on how I can stop doing this?

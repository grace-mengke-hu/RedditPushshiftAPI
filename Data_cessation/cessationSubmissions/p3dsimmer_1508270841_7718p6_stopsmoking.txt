Day 1

About to pick up Easyway and attempt to finish it in one sitting. I'm smoke free since midnight this morning. The cravings aren't too too bad I guess. I just keep telling myself how much money I've saved ($10 so far) and I keep remembering Alan Carr's advice. 

But I'm so fucking hungry. So I'll go heat up some leftovers. 

I remember quitting years ago and I lasted a couple months. I hope this is the real deal. 

Chat with ya on day 2.

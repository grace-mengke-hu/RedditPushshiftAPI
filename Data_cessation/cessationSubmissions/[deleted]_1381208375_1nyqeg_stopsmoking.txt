Cold Turkey: Day 22. I broke.

I'm typing this after just putting out my 4th cigarette tonight. I'm not giving up though...I feel terrible, but I won't feel defeated. I just feel set back. All the good things I've felt and all the benefits I've accrued haven't been for nothing. It's still a nasty habit and I still regret this move. I showed weakness....but not defeat. Fuck this habit. Addiction is a strong thing. But I am stronger. I am stronger. I am stronger.

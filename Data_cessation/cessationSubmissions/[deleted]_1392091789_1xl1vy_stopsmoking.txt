Nearly 100 days, but I'm afraid I may not make it

I never did smoke a lot, but when I did it was usually while driving. Now by walking to work and some other minor lifestyle changes, I've successfully gone just over 3 months without... but the big test is coming up - a 4 hour drive to my folks next weekend. Any advice on how to deal with it / non-tobacco options for the drive?

Does It Get Easier?

Hi folks. 

Bit of a bio to start.. I'm 24, a bartender and smoked 20-40 a day for about 7 years. 

4 days ago I decided to stop smoking. I'm just starting day 5 now but the withdrawal is becoming more and more difficult. 

So far - 
Headaches, anxiety (which I've never ever had before), coughs, mood swings, jumpiness, lack of sleep and all I seem to think about is smoking just one cigarette. 

Just wondering is there any estimation on if/when this will pass? I'm going completely stir crazy. 

Thanks so much in advance guys! 

Ps- not on any gum, patches, vapes etc. And honestly don't want to be. If I'm stopping, I'm stopping for good.

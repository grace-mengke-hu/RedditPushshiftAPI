Blood circulation is improving dramatically.

I've noticed similar sensations to an arm or leg being asleep regaining blood circulation. I went to get a deep tissue massage yesterday and it was like I had never had a real massage before that. 

The scariest part of smoking for me is noticing all the health improvements begin to surface that I hadn't realized *needed* improving as a smoker.

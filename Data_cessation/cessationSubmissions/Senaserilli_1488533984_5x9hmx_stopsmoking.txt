4 days

Sorry for my english.
I am not smoking for 4 days. 

When i stop smoking, i can easily notice the diffirences in my body and mind. I stopped it before last year, and it lasted only 3 months. 
When im not smoking;
I respect and love myself even more.
I can focus better on myself.
I can breath deeply and it feels so good.
I am more productive.
I am enjoying the taste and smell of things and thats making me very happy.

But still, i am still thinking of smoking. Even though i now the amazing side of not smoking, i still want it so bad sometimes. My mom is a smoker too, and thats a challange for me too..

Can you give me advice or tell me what did you went through?

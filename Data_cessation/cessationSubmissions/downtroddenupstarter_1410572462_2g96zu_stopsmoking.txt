So 23 days, 21 hours and 53 minutes in

And I'm still staying strong.  Thanks to this subreddit for giving me the support I needed while I was lurking.  I had a rough day today and gave cigarettes a serious thought if only for their self-destructive qualities, but I held on.  It still feels odd to take a deep breath without expecting a cough or a stuffed nose.  Every stopsmoking noob reading this: you can do it.

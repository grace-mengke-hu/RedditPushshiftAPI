Help my 65+ year old mother stop smoking?

After enough nagging her, my mother has finally stated she was going to quit smoking. On July 3rd, she'd get her SS check. On July 4th, she'd go out and buy a nicotine patch.


She has been smoking for over four decades. She's smoked Virginia Slims Menthol Light 100's since as long as I can remember. She smokes about a pack a day, and smokes each cigarette slowly (8-10 minutes each).

I know I am going to have to play a big part in helping her quit, and I am trying to think of strategies and motivators she could use.

Do you know of any online resources that would appeal to her?

Any tips to make the change easier for her? 

One thing I want her to start doing is changing her smoking habits, before she actually quits. I've read a lot of stuff on quitting smoking in the past (just through exposure to the materials; I have never smoked), and one of things I often hear is that a difficult part of quitting is the  way it's embedded into the lifestyle. This is definitely big because she works at home and doesn't get out of the house much, so she is always surrounded by the things that would make her want to smoke.

For example, every morning when she gets up and goes to the bathroom, she has  cigarette. When she boots up the computer and sits down, cigarette. When she has a cup of coffee, cigarette (this is a big one). How can we break up these things before she actually quit-quits?


Also, she quit once before, decades ago, for 36 whole hours. I don't think she has a lot of faith in herself. I think she feels her age holds her back a lot. How can she stay motivated? If she relapses, I seriously don't think she'll try again.

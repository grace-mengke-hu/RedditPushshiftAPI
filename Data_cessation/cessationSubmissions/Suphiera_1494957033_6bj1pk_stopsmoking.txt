Reasons I'm quitting - Can you also give me yours?

I've listed these out a million times before (or 6 times to be exact) but this time, with you guys, I'm hoping they'll stick -

1. You're invincible, until you're not - Just because I don't have a smoking related disease doesn't mean i'm not on that path with 12 a day
2. I want to smell better! I want my hair to smell of shampoo and the perfume I'm wearing - not of smoke and sweat and dirt I get cover in from standing outside
3. I NEVER have any money left at the end of the month and I barely spend on anything else as much as cigarettes
4. My partner who was only an occasional smoker, has started smoking more and I hate that I might have caused that.
5. I can see the number of health problems my father, who smoked a pack a day for over a decade previously, has. There's no such thing as quitting too soon
6. My social life revolves around smoking. Non-smokers findit hard to chill with me
7. I hate myself after every smoke. I feel guilt and shame. I don't even have any reasons to smoke anymore, I just keep doing it.
8. I would like to make vacation plans with my family (who dont know I smoke) without worrying about how I'll get my fix
9. There are a lot of better ways I can reward myself - and i'll have more money to actually do that
10. I ust got diagnosed with Hypothyroid - my body is off its rocker anyway - as it makes it journey through healing - smoking is just not an option

I'm so glad I found this thread. Going to log everyday to look at that number next to my name and know I'm not in this alone.
Can you guys give me your reasons to add onto my list please?

Today is he first day

I'm quitting smoking after 13 years. 24 year old female. I've tried before and it never works. Now I'm going to ween myself off with a vapor cigarette. I've tried cold turkey and it never works. So I figured I would try this way. I've also quit drinking about 70 days ago. Told myself if I can do that I can quit smoking too. So when that evened out for me I'm now moving forward with this plan. Just keep going one step at a time. Gotta make myself a better person. I gotta keep moving forward and better myself!

Btw sorry bout typos I'm on my phone.

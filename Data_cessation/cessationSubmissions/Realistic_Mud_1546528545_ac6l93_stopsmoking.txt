29 days

I made it to 29 days. Tomorrow is a month. I am still addicted to nicotine. I am using 21 mg patches and 2 mg chewing gum. I probably chew 8 2mg gums a day. I need to come off the gum and switch to regular sugar free gum. Luckily I haven't been having cravings. I use to smoke with the patch on. That's how much I was addicted to cigarettes.

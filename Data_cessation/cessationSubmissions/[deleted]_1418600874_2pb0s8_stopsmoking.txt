My father smokes and can't stop

He is 46 years old and has been smoking since his 20's. 

Four years ago he stopped for one year, but began smoking again after trying some cigars, saying they were different from cigarettes.

In the last few months he tried to stop 4 times, but was never succesful in doing so.

The one thing that made him stop smoking a few years back was running, but after getting a new job he "didn't have time for it" anymore.

Can anyone help? I really want my father to be a grandpa and be able to see his sons growing old, and can't imagine what would be of me if something happened to him.

I partner thinks I quit smoking but I didn't.

I'm in a bad place. I quit smoking but went back. My partner thinks I'm still not smoking. However, I have been smoking without my partner's knowledge. If my partner found out it would cause a big problem in our relationship. It's time for me to start using the patch and nicotine gum again until I am off them.

I don't know how you guys feel about vaping but, I've been off of cigarettes for almost a month and I've not felt better in years!

Vaping isn't the perfect solution and I know that but, once I tried vaping I haven't even looked towards a cigarette. I went from a pack a day to 6mg nicotine and had about two days of withdrawal...now I vape 3mg of nicotine. I'd do anything to get off of cigarettes. I feel so much better and I sleep better, its amazing.

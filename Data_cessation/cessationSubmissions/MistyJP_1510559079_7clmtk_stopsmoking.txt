Struggle

I am finding it so hard day 4 of not smoking. Woke up in the middle of the night. When that happens I used to just go for a smoke. So tonight I am really struggling as that is all I can think about.  Can't see seem to get back to sleep so that is worse.  Did anyone struggle at night and if so what did you do

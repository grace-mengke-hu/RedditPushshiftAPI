Quitting smoking and weight gain.

20 year old female, been smoking for 4 years. Gained some weight while pregnant... and now I know why. I didn't smoke when I was pregnant... gained a stone and 2 pant sizes now I'm a size 14. I dont gain weight, I eat what I want, I like my pizza every 2 -3 weeks. I like my wholemeal sandwiches for breakfast with egg mushrooms and stuff. I hate salads, I will never eat salad nor some wholemeal grains. I dont mind the exercise... but that puts me off. Knowing i will need to eat this stuff to lose weight after I gain it from quitting smoking. I am terrfied of looks, of not looking good enough, sag, fat, bad figure, puts me down I get very depressed and suicidal.. so I'm not sure what to do. I want to quit smoking to be more healthy... but the weight gain is sommething I will not be able to mentally accept. Ive always been skinny and when I turned into size 14 that was the first time I was ever happy with myself and I seriously dont want to change that. WITHOUT eating salads and just an egg for breakfast or sausage for dinner. I dont like diet and stopping myself from what is the best in life and the only thing I enjoy which is nice food. I hate the idea of gaining weight when I stop smoking.... I hate it.

Haha universe, I win this one.

I've been posting updates on my OP since I quit, been going very well. Smooth sailing. Then... today happened.

1) I didn't get paid. Yadda yadda international bank wires etc money is stuck in limbo oh sorry you got bills to pay and three little kids to support? Make it work til Monday-ish.

2) So I did, pulled grocery money out of thin air and went to buy groceries. Walk into the store and it's wall to wall valentine's day. And I start crying. Because I wasn't ready for it. I'm a widow and this is my first Valentines on my own. So, I holed up in the ladies room until I got myself back together, did the shopping and started heading home and then.. 

3) Car breaks down. In the exact middle of a bridge. People behind me can't pass and are honking and screaming at me. I'm blocking the fricking bridge. An hour and a half and a tow truck ride later I arrive home with melted groceries to discover...  

4) my neighborhood is without electricity because ???. 

Three hours later my power comes back, to the detriment of my groceries and what do I do? That's right, I come here. To post this. Because as many times today that I wanted to smoke I didn't smoke. And I'm not going to. So throw whatever you've got at me, universe. I'll never smoke again so it's your move, cosmos, your move.

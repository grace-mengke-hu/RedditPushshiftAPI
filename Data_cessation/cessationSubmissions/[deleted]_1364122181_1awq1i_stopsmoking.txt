Trying to quit cigarettes again, after my longest clean spree ever. :/

So I went for about 80 days, my longest clean time EVER from smoking cigarettes, and then I fucked up because I tried a bunch of shrooms and at some point during my crazy hallucinogenic trip I told myself, "It's okay to smoke cigarettes because I'm a writer."

Yeah, that was dumb. I smoked for two weeks, a pack a day, like I never even quit. My lungs feel like shit, I have a terrible cough, and I'm coughing up some nasty stuff.

So I'm quitting again as of now, had my last cigarette on the way home earlier. I hate cigarettes. So much. But they are so freaking addicting!

It's hard because at work, there is a smoke break room where I know I can get free cigarettes if I go in there. I usually go in the normal break room where smoking is not allowed, so I'll be going back in there.

Any advice? My greatest worry is just being around it for the next three days, but since I work those days I know if I can stay away from that break room, I can do it.

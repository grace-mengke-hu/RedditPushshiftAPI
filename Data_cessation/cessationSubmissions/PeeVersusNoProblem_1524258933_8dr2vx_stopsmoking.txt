22 days, and cravings are suddenly popping up pretty much constantly. Does this settle down?

After the first few days, I was actually pretty good.  Now that I'm at about 3 weeks, for some reason, I feel like I'm having 3-4 craving episodes per hour, and its getting really hard to deal with.  Do these go away?

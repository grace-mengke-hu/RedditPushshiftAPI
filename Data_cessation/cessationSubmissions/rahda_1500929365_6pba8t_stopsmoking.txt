I forgot how hard quitting was

I remember it sucking. But the intensity that felt like hell's deepest fires actually stopped. And now I do have moments of craves, but those are mental and easy to get through. It gets so much easier that you actually get a little foggy about how challenging it was. Just putting that out there for those thinking about quitting or in the early stages. 

There will come a day where you don't think about smoking. There will come a day where you forget just how terrible it felt in those early days. 

My journal entries reminded me with all the explicits and insane thoughts. But my brain is forgetting the real difficulty. Now I remind myself with my journals or visits to old threads here of just how bad it was so that I don't ever get the funny idea to pick it up again. =)

Bow Chicka Wow Wow.

69 Days. I don't even remember feeling better than I do now. To everyone just starting out, hang on, it only gets better. To those who've failed and tried over and over, keep at it, i tried 3-4 times before getting this far. And to those with hundreds and thousands of days showing up on your badge, thank you for inspiring me to keep on going.

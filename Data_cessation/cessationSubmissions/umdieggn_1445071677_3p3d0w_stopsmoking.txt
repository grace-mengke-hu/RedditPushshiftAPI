Day Four. My method

Probably somebody tried it also this way. If I get the urge I simply think: Why do I crave a cigarette, I am a nonsmoker... 

Or if theres some feeling of emptiness: Why do I think this is new (the feeling when you realise you got nothing to puff on) ), this is not new, I lived like that for years before I even started, and it didn't bother me. 

So far so good guys Stay strong everybody.

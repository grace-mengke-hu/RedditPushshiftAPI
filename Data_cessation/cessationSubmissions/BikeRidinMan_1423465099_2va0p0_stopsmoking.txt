I (obviously) can't stay in lurk mode.

I gave it a good try. Honestly. SS draws me back like a moth to flame. I've been on Reddit for 6.5 years; this is by far the best sub I've been a member. I keep reading posts by the new folks, in particular the folks that relapsed and have returned, and feel compelled to help them. IMO this place has a life of its own. I'll be around for awhile longer. Carry on, thanks for having me and don't smoke!

6 days in. Addiction thoughts are trying to set me back.

I'm finding it easy to handle the cue-induced cravings distracting myself with other stuff, but my addiction keeps trying to rationalize those craving. Things like "cmon, you're young, everyone smokes when they're young" or "you can stop later, you won't be doing any harm" pop up in my head all the time.

Then I remember how good I am starting to feel with all the mucus cleaning up, how nice I smell and how I'll be able to breath easily in just a few weeks and I keep going. It'll get easier. I know.

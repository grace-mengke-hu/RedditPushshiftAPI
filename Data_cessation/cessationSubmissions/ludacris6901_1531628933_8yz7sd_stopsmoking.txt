1 year smoke free

Why would you live in a world of constant withdrawal symptoms? Thats what you do when youre addicted to Nicotine. You immediately enter physical withdrawal on your last exhale and then *think* you need to smoke again roughly an hour later.

I have successfully quit for 1 year cold turkey as of today. I smoked a pack a day for 19 years. I wanted to stop by here and say there is life after nicotine. There is a DAMN good life after nicotine. Also, the cravings go away completely. Yes. Completely. 

Please, I urge you to quit. There are NO benefits to smoking at all. Believe me, i smoked all day every day since i was 14. If i can help you quit in any way please let me know. 

Here are some intesting stats since my quit:

5840: Cigarettes not smoked 
91.25 Life Ragained. (Days)
486.25 hours (Time spent NOT smoking)

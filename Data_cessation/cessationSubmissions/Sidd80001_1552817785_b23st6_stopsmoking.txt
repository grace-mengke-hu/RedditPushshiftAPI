No cravings

For the first time since my quit almost 39 days since my last smoke I never ever thought of smoking today.. Now I proudly say I am a non smoker and enjoying my life.. It gets better guys trust me I have faced hell but today I'm like enjoying my freedom and happiness.. Body recovers and so does our habits.. Love u all and God bless!! ✌️😘✌️

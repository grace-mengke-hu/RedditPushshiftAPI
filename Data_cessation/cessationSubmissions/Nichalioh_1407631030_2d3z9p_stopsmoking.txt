I resisted temptation today whilst face to face with one of the reasons I started.

I started smoking 7 years ago when I got my first job in a kitchen, I don't know if it was the extra money or a nice break from the stress and heat but I was hooked from the off. Today I had a work trial in an extremely busy kitchen and was shadowing a guy who smoked. Despite having intense craving for one when we were at our busiest and even sitting outside with the guy I shadowing while he had one, I resisted the urge. This made me proud of myself as self control has never been my forte, also I got offered the job so it's win win.

Nicotine - a powerful drug

Can we all agree how powerful, addictive, and all-consuming nicotine can be? I am closing in on one month smoke free. I am so proud of myself, but holy shit this has been extremely difficult! I still think about smoking everyday. Most nights, in my dreams, I have a cigarette in my hand. When Iâ€™m walking down the street, enjoying the fresh air, I still feel envious of the guy that passes me holding a smoke in his hand. Donâ€™t get me wrong - I am enjoying all the benefits of being smoke free - but WOW! Itâ€™s been the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever done to stay away. We are powerful for quitting such an addictive drug! We are amazing! I feel empowered, and super capable having done this. ðŸ’ª

update / starting day 9 no cigs / day 5 no nic

I can breathe more deeply and my throat is clear. I'm not coughing anything up, but I see a lot of folks do cough up stuff when they quit but for some reason I'm not.
Still doing my 0mg nicotine vape. Did the nicotine gum for a few days but gave that up. I wanted the nicotine out of my system.
I'm taking Zyban ( buproprion hcl ) I was taking 150 mg twice a day, but I was experiencing some of the side effects, so now I'm taking 100 mg twice daily.
Mornings are really tough. Every morning I really want a cig bad, so I take the zyban and wait for it to kick in and I vape for a while.
So, let's see, 8 days down = 160 cigarettes not smoked.
I think I can do this!

EDIT: How come I'm not coughing? Should I be?

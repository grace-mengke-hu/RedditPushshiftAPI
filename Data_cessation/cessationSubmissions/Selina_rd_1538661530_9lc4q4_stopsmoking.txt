How long until the cravings stop?

I’m on nicotine patches and expect to be for 8-10 weeks, hopefully weening myself off nicotine slowly. I have to keep reminding myself that I’m a non smoke since the habit to have one whenever I need a ‘break’ is so strong. How long until the cravings stop and I start to ‘forget’ to have a smoke?

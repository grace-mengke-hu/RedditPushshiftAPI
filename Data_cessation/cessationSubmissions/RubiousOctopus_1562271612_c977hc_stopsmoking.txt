No regrets

Geez, I can party all night long now, drink like it's my job (non-alcoholic though, and inb4 no, I didn't start drinking more after quitting smoking to substitute it), and now, even almost subconscious I don't consider smoking as the cherry on top anymore (which seemed eternal-life-level-impossible before - quitting two things at once for good, so one doesn't trigger another). I salute my liberation.

I chugged second one.

"WTF? It doesn't help."

"Maybe I'm still a smoker after all and tolerance level didn't drop yet after just one month?"

Third and fourth came one by one after some time.

It didn't help.

"Well, the fuck why four cigarettes almost in a row should help a non-smoker?"

"The fuck why I did it then?"

"Am I smoker again now?"

Second time in my life I experienced the sensation of the first cigarette. It was fucking disgusting. It didn't help.

Going second month. June was hard, some shit happened now and then, but I made it through thanks to Allen. Carr taught me to fight with ease - without fighting. I have no physical addiction anymore, and no psychological as well.

I thought so before today.

I exhausted and burned out so hard I was literally paralyzed and almost had a natural panic attack. Had one of those moments a few years ago prior to leaving my previous job.

When you quit, shit doesn't stop to happen, and it's

# AWESOME!

Why?

Basically, there are two types of shit in life: one you can change if you want and the one you cannot (or seems like it). And when you learn to cope with shit sober, without nicotine, tobacco, or any other *substance*, more and more shit becomes unimportant or otherwise solvable. Now, when you ignore or solve something, all the credits go to **yourself**, not to the doping. You really start to build self-confidence, capability and tranquility.

Turns out, just quitting smoking is not enough. Who knew?

You got used to rely on the doping before, now you need to get used to rely on yourself, self-confidence will not build itself.

At some moment you realize doping will not help you a slightest bit, only harm. Harm you, your life, your plans, your performance. You will feel it, feel it in such a way, that powered by your new rebuilt self, the both your mind and body will actually reject the substance.

Raise the bar, find your limit, and reach it **yourself**.

This was the problem today. I quitted smoking and built self-confidence to solve everyday and middle-level shit only so far (which felt like end-of-the-world to former me though).

I didn't build the confidence to leave my zone of comfort this far and face life-changing shit yet.

I smoked because facing life-changing shit **myself** without the doping wasn't in the menu during my last visit.

**P.S.:**

No, I'm definitely not a smoker, I wasn't one for over one month until this exact moment of writing this, I wasn't one when I was smoking today. I know it now.

It's not "ah shit, here we go again" - I am still non-smoker.

It's not an attempt of self-justification after breaking the deal.

Call it what you want.

I don't regret it at all, I don't regret meeting those four bastards at all. They **enlightened** me. I learned something valuable today.

I understood this **craving** that stays forever. Now I know it in detail. I understood why I became a smoker once.

I became non-smoker, it's time to become self-confident.

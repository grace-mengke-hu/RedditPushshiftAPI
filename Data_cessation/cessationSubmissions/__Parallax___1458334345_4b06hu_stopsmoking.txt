501 days

How I did it: timed it so my last smoke of the evening was my last one, period. When I woke up I did everything I usually do, but without smoking. Felt uncomfortable first few days, then just a little bit weird for a few more weeks. Still smoke weed (vape actually) and drink like I used to. I think I had an easier time with this than most people, if only my other issues could be resolved this easily.

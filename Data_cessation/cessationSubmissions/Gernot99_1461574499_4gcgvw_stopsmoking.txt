60 days badge looks AWESOME! recap of 2 months of not smoking...

not bad, 2 months without a cigarette, without even a puff, cold turkey. quite proud what I have done so far, but lets stay realistic, cravings are still there, brain still trying to trick me into having a smoke, need to stay strong not to lapse.
but how have those two months been? Pure happiness (apart from the tough initial cravings). I feel happier, I feel healthier, I feel more energized and less tired. furthermore I did not even have the slightest cold in 2 months despite some crazy weather here in Europe. So not smoking must be good for my immune system too, apparently!
I have been able to stop from smoking a pack a day to zero without using any subs, I haven't been smoking 1200 cigarettes in the last two months, I saved 350 EUR, I resisted 179 cravings and  I have not spent 100h smoking. what does that say? If I could do it, EVERYONE can do it. so c'mon guys, lets do it together.

hope this thread helps those ones who currently struggle...

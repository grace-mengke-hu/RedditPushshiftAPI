How do you know when you are ready?

I have been thinking about quitting smoking cigarettes, I'm just not sure if I am ready. How do I know?

I am about a pack a day smoker and a little more when I am drinking.

I just want to quit the whole deal. I quit once ct for basic training, well, forced to. Obviously my mind was too focused on other things at the time to even think about cigarettes.

I am single, live alone, and my whole family smokes, only real support group I may have besides here is at work. However, they are on the E-cigs. I have already decided I will not jump on that. To me it's trading one nicotine delivery for another.

Maybe me actually posting here is my clue I am ready?

Whats the best way to go about it? Just do it?

Thanks!

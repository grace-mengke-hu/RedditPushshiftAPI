Smoked after 6.5 months without

I need to update my flair but I just wanted to post here because it helped me a lot before. I had quit March 31st and a week and a half ago I went out to a bar in a different town and they allowed smoking inside, after a few drinks I ended up having one, then another and then bought a pack that night. I've been smoking since then :( I was running 2 miles a day and working out and eating right and tracking my calories and it's like everything went down hill so fast. Already having trouble breathing again and I'm broke for the first time since March. Quitting smoking saved me so much money and I never had a lot of money but while I wasn't smoking I always had some in my bank if I needed it and now it's like back to counting change.

Anyways today I'm done with it. I'm not trying to stay broke and I'm ready to get back to being healthy because it was the best I've ever felt in my life. Thanks again to all who post here and the support here and I know it's obvious but always be careful of the "I can just have one" mentality.

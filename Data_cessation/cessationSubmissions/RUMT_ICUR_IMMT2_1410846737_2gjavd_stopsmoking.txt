I had a mindset epiphany!

I'm trying this, and it's working! Instead of the withdrawal pangs reminding me I haven't smoked, I'm associating it with...well... a high or a buzz! Hah! If you're quitting, focus on the feeling. It kind of feels GOOD. I give credit to Alan Carr's book for planting that idea. I don't know about the rest of the book, and I don't know if he said that explicitly. But he does say the pangs are kind of "pleasant". I was weirded out by that. I got thinking that they are kind of nice. I'm drunk on withdrawal, and it is making quitting kind of fun. This is a total framshift from "Oh my god, this is going to last a week???". It's now " Oh my god, this is going to last a week!!!!" Weeeeee.

Today is the day!

I have been trying to hash out a quit date for a few weeks now. After work in the shower I had the thought why not now? I'm cleansing my tired sore hot body why quit there? 2 years ago I quit using heroin dammit I can quit smoking my last and greatest vice as well. Whilst mass unsubbing down the list I happened to glance towards the existance of this subreddit and seems like the pieces are falling into  place. Quit date: Wednesday June 14th 18:00 2017

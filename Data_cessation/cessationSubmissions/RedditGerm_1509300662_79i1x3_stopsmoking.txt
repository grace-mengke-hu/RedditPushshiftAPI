Question regarding Smoke Free App

Hi, 

Since a lot of you use the Smoke Free App to keep track of your progress, I thought this might be an appropriate place to post.

Could someone let me know if it's possible to customize the home screen widget to display the time smoke free in "days, hours and minutes"  instead of just "hours"?

I'm on Android btw. 

Thanks in advance.

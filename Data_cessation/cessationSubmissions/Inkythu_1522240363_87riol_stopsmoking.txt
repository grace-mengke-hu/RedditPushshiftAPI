Help

Hey all, first time posting on this. Background story here. Started smoking when I was 18 after a super depressing year, I was explaining to one of my friends about how I felt and he said tobacco helped him calm down and relax. So I started off around 1-2 a day and its slowly gotten worse, i'm 21 now and I finish a 25g pouch every two days.

I've tried stopping and lasted about a week but I started feeling terrible again and started again. I want to quit before I turn 22 in around 7 months. Any tips? Any help would be appreciated thanks guys.

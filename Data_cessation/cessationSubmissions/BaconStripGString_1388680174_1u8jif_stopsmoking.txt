First day back at work. It's like quitting all over again.

I started feeling like I could hit cruise control on this quitting business and then I got to work today for the first time since before Christmas. It feels like quitting all over again. Plus all the people I used to smoke with are coming around asking if I want to take a smoke break with them. My wife is huge support at home but she's working. I'm just telling myself that I promise not to smoke TODAY at work and I will deal with tomorrow then. Anybody else having the same issues?

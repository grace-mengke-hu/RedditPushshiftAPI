6th day without smoking (on the patch tho)

Very pleased so far. Cravings have been super mild and maybe even non-existent the past couple of days. I plan to follow instructions exactly as recommended. Five more weeks of step 1 patches. Surely there's enough research behind those recommendations that I shouldn't assume that I'm special and can cut down sooner and still have success once I'm off the patches. 

Am I still actively nic addicted? Yes. But I really really really want to never smoke another cigarette as long as I live, and cold turkey just wasn't going to work out - last time i tried I made it to day 2 and it was so intense I started having suicidal urges. So, yeah, NRT or not I'm very very pleased to be smoke free.

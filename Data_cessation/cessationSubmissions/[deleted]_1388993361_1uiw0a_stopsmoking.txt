I'm trying to quit for the first time, and I'd like a little advice.

I tried to quit by going cold turkey (which made me feel like I was going crazy; kept that up for three days before I decided that isn't for me!). So now I'm gradually reducing the amount I smoke (and plan to be completely done smoking by January 18th!). People with experience quitting: what worked for you? Gum? E-Cigarettes? Cold turkey? Any advice you can give me is really appreciated, thanks!

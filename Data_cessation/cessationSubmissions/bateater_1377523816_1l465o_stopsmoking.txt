9 months in and still coughing. WTF

Hey guys, so I'm having a weird problem that I'm not sure if it's related to my stopping smoking or not. I am now 9 months free (292 days) of smoking, where I smoked for roughly 5 years. My problem is in the morning mainly and sometimes through the day I'll still cough, it's not a hack but a normal cough as I would call it. Is it possible my lungs are still getting stuff out of them? I'm really not sure what's going on. Thanks for any advice you can give.

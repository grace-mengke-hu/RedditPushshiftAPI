I am 48 hours smoke free! Feels strange!

I quit smoking 2 days ago and everyone around me is skeptical about  me beating nicotine addiction. I'm not using patches, gums, e-cigs or whatever, I just watched a bunch of videos on youtube, including the Easyway one. I'm 21 and this is my second time trying to quit; first time I lasted 3 days only. I'm eating a lot and my appetite has increased a lot, which is good for me since I'm a skinny guy and a couple kilos more wouldn't hurt me. 
This whole experience is quite strange because sometimes I can't perfectly remember the taste of cigarettes and I feel like I'd try one just to refresh my memory; but I know that that's my body talking and craving for nicotine.
This subreddit is being really helpful to me and reading this posts keep me extremely focused on my goal. So thank you!

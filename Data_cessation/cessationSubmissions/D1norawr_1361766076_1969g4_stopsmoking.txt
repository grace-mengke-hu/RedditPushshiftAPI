Day one. How do you guys deal with anger and annoyance?

It's going to be extremely hard for me not to snap at people for a little while. As a software developer, I can see myself teaching a co op and not being able to hold my emotions when they do something I'll have to fix later.

How have you guys/girls dealt with not snapping at people or being annoyed all the time while quiting?

Why didn't I quit sooner?

I wanted to.  I knew I didn't like it.  Smoking hurts.  It stinks.  It ruins your health, and if you don't want to go that far (like a lot of smokers) it certainly *hinders* your health shall we say.  It requires a LOT of attention, ... can I smoke, when to smoke, need to smoke, how to smoke, money to smoke etc. etc. etc.

So why didn't I quit sooner?

What I know is, I am glad I did, it wasn't that hard and I wish I'd done it sooner.  I cannot do that, but I sure can encourage others to quit today and not tomorrow or the next day or the year after that.  There is no good reason to smoke, and a hundred good reasons to quit.  It **does** feel like giving something up at first, but you soon realize it's all about what you gain.

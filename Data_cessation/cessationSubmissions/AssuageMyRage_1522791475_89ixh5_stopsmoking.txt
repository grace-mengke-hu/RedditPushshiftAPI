Cravings returning after one month of quitting

I quit smoking a month ago and had pretty bad cravings for the first two weeks. For the last two weeks I haven't had any cravings at all, in fact I have barely thought about cigarettes at all. 

That changed about two days ago and suddenly I am having really bad cravings for no apparent reason. Surely all of the nicotine should be out of my system by now right? It's weird and feels like I only quit yesterday.

I fell in :(

After having tried lots of times before, I gave it a go again. I didn't smoke this whole day until 15 minutes ago :( I am really determined and I really really want this, and actually the day hasn't been so hard. I've been positive about my decision and confident that I could do it! Then I just had a fight with a good friend half an hour ago, and without even thinking, I just picked a cigarette and smoked it. I smoked 2/3 of it until I thought how stupid it was and I quickly stopped and threw it away......but now I just feel like I have to start all over again. I really feel like I can't do it now - I'm so disappointed in myself :( 
Does anyone have any suggestions of what I should do if I come to this point again? It's like all the good reasons for quitting just isn't existing anymore - I choose not to even try to think of them, and it just happens. It's how I have failed the other times too .. 
Damn. This day won't count as a day now, right? It will be as hard as day one again now. I hate myself. I really want to quit so bad :(

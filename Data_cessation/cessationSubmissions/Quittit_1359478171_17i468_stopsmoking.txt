The most helpful little phrase while quitting. 

While this is sort of silly I suppose, when I decided to quit smoking for about the 10th time, it was prompted by something other than the usual financial or "just not wanting to do it" reasons. This time, I'd been swayed by a movie, sort of. I watched "Looking for a friend for the end of the world." and after doing so thought about all the neat little examples of finding someone who is genuinely your perfect match, blah blah blah. Then, later that day, I met a girl while waiting on a shuttle to take us from campus, she was cute, so I stuck up a conversation. We had a bit of a wait, so after a few minutes of conversation I lit up a cigarette, and at one point, when the wind took a little wisp of smoke towards her, she did that thing people do. You know, where they overtly wave their hand in front of their face, saying, "That's disgusting." Shortly after we parted ways, and I haven't seen her since. I'm not saying that it's all because I smoked, but for the number of times i've heard the opposite sex say, "smoking is such a turn off." It's not just likely, but in fact probable that there was a girl, at some point, who that was the deciding factor for, and what if that girl, or the next girl, is the Kiera Knightly to my Steve Carrell. So now, when I want a smoke, I just remind myself, "Remember that girl," and I think of freedom from smoking, and no yellow teeth and that pretty young girl waving smoke from her face and I can do it. I can last a little longer, I can avoid it for another day. I just remember that girl. I'm saying this because maybe pouring that belief into your own mantra may help you, as it did me.

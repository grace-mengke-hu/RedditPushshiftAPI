Decided to quit after cousin told me she "wants to know what smoking feels like"

I started smoking when I was around 15, my grandma was a heavy smoker and I'd sneak in to her room and steal a few sticks. When I went to college it got worse. I would smoke 1 pack a day sometimes even more than that. I am now 19. I dropped out due to mental illness and have to be supervised. Parents got rid of my stash and told me to quit.  

But of course I can just walk to a nearby convenience store and buy a pack without raising alarms. I mistakenly thought smoking was the one thing that was keeping me sane. Until I saw my 14 yr old cousin smoking right behind that store. She was with her then-boyfriend who's a lot older. Suddenly all that panic set in, I went off on her, telling her the same advice even I did not follow. "Nice girls don't smoke" and all that. She said she wanted to know what it felt like. That was the same excuse I had when I smoked my first stick.  

It brought me back to my senses. It's been 2 months since I last smoked. But I hate myself for introducing her to that habit. That seeing me smoke may have caused her to start as well. I really want to quit but I also want her to stop before it's too late.

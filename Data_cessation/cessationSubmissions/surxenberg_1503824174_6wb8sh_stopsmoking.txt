85 days - the cravings are completely gone.

I just thought I'd drop by looking at my favorite quit smoking community. I also just realized that I haven't had a craving in days, weeks? I don't even remember. You know, that small 30 second flash where you think to yourself "a cigarette would be really nice just now"? It's gone. I know it'll come up every now and then but it does become less and less frequent and less and less intense. 

So, to all of you battling with your 1st week of nicotine withdrawal, I promise, the shitty feelings WILL go away if you bite through it.

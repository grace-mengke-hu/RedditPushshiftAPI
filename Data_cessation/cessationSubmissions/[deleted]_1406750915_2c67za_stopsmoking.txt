2 kids and twins on the way!

I've been smoking for about 8 years now, I've tried qutting multiple times, but can't seem to shake it. With my family growing, I fear I won't be around long enough to watch them grow, and prosper. Any helpful advice you wonderful people of 
/stopsmoking can give? I don't really want to take medication, I don't even take it when I've got a cold. Thanks!

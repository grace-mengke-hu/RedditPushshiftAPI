4D 9H going strong cold turkey.

The constant nagging in my mind is slowly subsiding. However on Day 3, I had the most terrifying craving experience. I am not sure to even call it craving. It felt like craving + panic attack + just sheer terror. For 2 hours or so, shaking, sweating, hard to breathe, heart beating so fast felt like it was going to explode, crying and just felt terrified and not even sure terrified of what.  I was in the military and I've been through some shit, but never this terrified. I hope this episode never comes again, I can handle the normal craving but this was something out of this world. But I stuck it through. Let's do this everyone!

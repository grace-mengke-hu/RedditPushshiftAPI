Day 10, overcoming the early jitters.

Today marks the 10th day of my resolve to not smoke anymore. Had a few cravings here and there throughout the week but nothing that I cannot overcome. The worst one till now was on the second day (I accidentally posted on r/smoking about that, deleted the post later on). Anyway, things that have helped me till now when I yearn for it:

- Pacing around while chewing gum

- Random conversations 

Hope I continue with this.

Obligatory first post. Quitting right now.

I have had it with this smoking shit. What the fuck is wrong with me. I used to be such a nice person. I was clean. And now I am this filthy beast of a smoker. I need to get rid of this shit. It is a pointless act I do multiple times everyday. What is this madness. 


That is it. I will stop this right now. My brain, register this act right here. You are never going to compel me to smoke. Never going to give me the urge to smoke. You are immense in your power. So do what you do best and fucking help me. Help me quit this smoking. 



I am starting a new life right now. One which does not have smoking in it. One which is cleaner. One where I don't have yellow nail beds. One where I don't die a miserable looser. I am going to be a fabulous winner. I will conquer myself. I will conquer my life. As of now. I AM A BETTER MAN.

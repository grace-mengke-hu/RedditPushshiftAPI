I just checked my 'timer' on my computer, it's been exactly four months.

I've posted here before but I'll post here again. I've been a pack a day smoker for about three years and I've finally managed to quit and according to [this timer](http://daycalc.appspot.com/02/18/2013) exactly four months and zero days ago. To everyone who's still struggling: Stay strong! To everyone who is on the verge of quitting and continuing: If I can do it, you can do it.

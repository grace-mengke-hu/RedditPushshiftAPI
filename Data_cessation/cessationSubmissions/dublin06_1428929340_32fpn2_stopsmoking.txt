If I fail now, I fear I'm done for good.

The last 47 days have been amazing. It's so fucking awesome to be not thinking about when I can get my next nicotine fix. On my way to Uni I realized I was looking forward to catching up with friends I hadn't met over the weekend, rather than rushing to my usual spot and having a smoke before heading to class. I'm unable to put that feeling in words, but it really is AMAZING to be free.

My smoker buddies see I'm happy as a non-smoker to stand beside them and not light up. Nobody offers me a ciggy anymore. I've been at at least ten parties over the last couple of days without having lit up. I guess it's all just too good to be true. 

That's where these random cravings mess up the picture. Once in a while, I seem to want to have something burn through my throat and all the way into my lungs. What kind of a person in their right mind would want something like that? But when things get stressful, that is all I want. It is in these random moments that I feel extremely guilty about all the praise I've been getting. Mind you these are the same people who scoffed when I told them I wasn't smoking anymore. However the same people at various random moments, have told me how awesome it is that I've finally quit. 

In moments of weakness, I cannot help but wonder, if I ever start smoking again, in spite of all these random praises from friends, this uplifting attitude I seem to carry now, then there will nothing left for me to hold on to and pull myself out of the smoking pit the next time. Nothing at all. I would have given the excuse that people around me need, to say 'I told you so'. I would have demeaned the health benefits I've noticed over the last couple of days. I would have simply 'nothing' to quit for, other than quitting. That, /r/stopsmoking, is something I'm really scared about. More so when I read these random posts from people who quit for months, relapsing. It just seems so damn easy to fail.

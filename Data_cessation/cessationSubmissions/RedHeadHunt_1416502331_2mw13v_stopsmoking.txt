I just found this

I did not know about this sub, I will be 6 weeks without a smoke on Saturday. This is after smoking for 9 years. 

I thought I would join in the support here. Yesterday was a big day. I went for my first 16 hour day in the Kitchen (I am a Cook) Without a smoke. It feels great. Today will be my next 16 hour day. It feels liberating.

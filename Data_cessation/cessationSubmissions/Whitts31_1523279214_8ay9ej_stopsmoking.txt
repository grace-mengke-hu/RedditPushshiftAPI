Why am I becoming more dependent on the next one?

It might be stress or it might be that I'm not mentally there atm however I am really being consumed by smoking.

&amp;nbsp;

Social smoking turned into something that I'd do after a bad day at work, which subsequently has turned into me smoking 10 cigarettes-a-day. IT SUCKS!

&amp;nbsp;

I'm relying on them more and more day to day and I can't resist. No one will question me in the shop and my friends have asked if I need help, which I will always deny.

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe its now my 'safe' thing to do?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not wanting people to feel sorry for me - I don't need that. I need to just stop.

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice? Thank You &lt;3

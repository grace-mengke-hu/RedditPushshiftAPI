"Afgelopen", my root command to the little monster in my brain. What's yours?

"Afgelopen." It's a Dutch word my dad used when I was a kid. It means, the end, the matter is closed, no arguing. 

I mention it because I am closing in on 60 days being smoke free. I have a weak spot after day 60. I know, from experience, I have to make an inner shift to reach day 90 and be free. I have to say goodbye to smoking permanently. No going back. I have fallen there before.

Like /u/my_vape_self says, I need a strategy. 

I am enlisting a root command, a word that has personal emotional meaning to my psyche, right from childhood. "Afgelopen". It's a root command to my brain. I will say it if ever I waver. "Afgelopen." The matter of smoking is closed. No arguments. No looking back. No regrets. The work is done.

What's your root command? It might come in handy at any time in the quit process.

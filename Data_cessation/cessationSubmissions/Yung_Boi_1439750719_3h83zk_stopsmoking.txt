Brief reflections on 4 months quit

Today marks four months without nicotine. Here's what I have to say:

-- The cravings DO go away. how frequently the pop up decreases every week. For the past month, I've had literally no desire to smoke.

-- Cigarettes stop smelling good, and thank god for that. I was afraid I was always going to be a "smoker at heart" meaning, I was always going to love cigarettes. I loved the way they smelled and tasted. For a while after quitting I'd go places where there were smokers just so I could enjoy the smell. I'm now repulsed by it, like normal humans are. Thank god for this. It has made sticking with my quit so much easier.

-- I have begun to regret my time as a smoker. I know regret doesn't help, but I can't help but feel this way. I was a very active smoker for a few years and maintained good health, before I suffered an injury that I never mentally recovered from. Smoking ruined my cardiovascular health.

-- It is easier to breath now, but not as easy as I thought it would be. I'm sure this will keep improving over the next few months and I'm holding my head up high. 

-- At about the one month mark, my physical endurance completely disappeared. Walking up the stairs was a pain. My heart skipped around and was totally out of control. This scared the hell out of me. Luckily, it all normalized at about the three month mark. I'm attributing this to the healing process. Don't freakout if you have a similar experience.

--(NSFW) my sexual health is crazy better. My erections are harder and last longer. My ability to please as well as receive pleasure is twice as good, literally.

-- Now, my heart health is astounding. Even when I was a highly active and healthy young guy, I was prehypertensive. It truly is highly genetic in my family. We easily become hypertensive. Even as a fairly active, 180b 6'2 23 year old smoker, my blood pressure was high. Resting was usually around 140/90. My pulse was around 65 to 70. Even before I started smoking doctors would tell me I was prehypertensive. I'm pleased to say this is no longer an issue. As of late my resting BP has been hovering around 115/80, and my resting pulse has been around 50. yes, *fifty.* I'm feeling the healthiest I've felt in years.

-- My tinnitus is almost completely gone. I had tinnitus from years of practically living at punk venues as a teenager. My tinnitus is 20% of what it used to be as a smoker.

-- I seldom have headaches anymore. I attribute this, as well as my tinnitus going away, to better blood circulation and oxygenation of the blood.

-- Quitting is far easier than I thought it would be. There is not one benefit to smoking. All the benefits are completely imagined. They are simply you trying to justify your addictions. Break the addiction, and the once "benefits of smoking" becoming comedically bullshit. All of them.

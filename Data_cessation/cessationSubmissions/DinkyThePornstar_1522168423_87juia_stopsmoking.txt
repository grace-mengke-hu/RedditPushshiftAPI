I... I have money in my checking account at the end of the month.

Paid my rent, utilities, put my standard deposit into my TFSA and FIRE savings accounts, and... I have money in my checking account at the end of the month.

In the last month, with my birthday on the 23rd, I did have one smoke: a Cohiba my buddy brought me from Cuba. Don't know if that counts or not, I'm not crazy enough to inhale that, but I haven't spent a penny on tobacco in over a month.

I think I might open up a special savings account where I take all the money I would have normally spent on smokes and put it there. Thoughts on what I should buy with it first? I'm thinking a Switch. Having a tangible reward for quitting sounds pretty cool.

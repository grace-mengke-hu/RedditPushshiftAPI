I quit last night, now what?

First of all thank you guys for sharing your stories and struggles. You all have influenced me more  to get off something harmful to myself then anyone in my life. Fucking strangers keeping it real. 
 So I work swing shift, was doing my thing (browsing Reddit) and the fellas go out to smoke and asked if I was going. I stood up, handed one dude my pack and said, "I'm done." No questions asked. They knew I was too, but I struggle so much because of my addictive personality. But I don't think its about that anymore. For me it was boredom and routine. I'll spare the details of those two things. What I'm asking is, when you where at the spot like I am right now, what do you do to break your routine? Today is day one and I have to do something different to not think about smoking. How did you change your mind set when you had cravings? (Like I am now so I'm stalling by writing this hoping the craving goes away but its not really.) Wish me luck cuz this as cold as a turkey can get.

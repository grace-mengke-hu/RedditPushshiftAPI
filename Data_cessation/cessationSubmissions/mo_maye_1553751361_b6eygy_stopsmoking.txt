Went to smoke my last...

Just crawled out of bed to smoke my last and final cigarette...tomorrow is Day one. I went to open the door and SNAP! Broke that little bastard almost to the filter. I took three pitiful drags and reflected on the monstrosity of the sign. I guess it’s time. I’m dreading the withdrawals, I work 40 hours a week + in the process of opening a new business (no weekends for now). If you’ve got any pointers on how to survive and work through the next 5-21, days, id I’ve to hear! 

Stay strong out there non-smokers!!!!!!

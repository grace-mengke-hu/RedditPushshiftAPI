Withdraw symptoms getting worse. Help

 Analog smoker for 18 years. Went to vaping two years ago. Noticed my body was doing weird things as I chain vaped. My nerves through out my body would feel jolted and I would have constant pressure in my head. These would result in panic attacks. I went from 1.8 to 0.6 no problems. Last 5 days I went to 0 so I can kick it and my body is doing things that are freaking me out more. First my poop has turned into a brownish orange sludge that is making me constipated. I'm waking up drenched in cold sweat and with stomach discomfort in my colon/pelvic area. My anxiety is through the roof. I feel very strange and it's scaring me. Is this normal? How much longer do I have to go through this?

Feel so shitty. Full of anger and hate

I past the 2 Month mark recently. It gets better. Really slowly. But i have so much anger and hate inside of me. It scares me. Iam sometimes yelling at my son and wife for no reason and beeing so mean and disturbing. I cant beleave this. Should i go and get some help?
Also, iam not able to work. Iam a programmer and i can concentrate for 10 minutes and than the craving sets in. Allways. It is so frustrating.

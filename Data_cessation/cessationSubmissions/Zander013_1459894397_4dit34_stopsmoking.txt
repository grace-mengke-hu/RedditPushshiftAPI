Finally broke 90 Days

So this is my 3 month update. im happy to have stopped smoking i have mostly gotten rid of the habits i had that were from smoking like leaving a room or goin outside to smoke. when i had craving those urges were also there just to follow the same routine that i had when i smoked.

so far after being smoke free so long i saved almost 600 bucks after smoking about a pack a day or 2 depending on my activitys. i spent that on my gf for our upcoming anniversary she just doesnt know it yet. (shhh)

over all im really happy to be smoke free and have been trying to convince my mum to also be smoke free since shes been smoking since before i was born so im kinda concerned for her health i would like to see her old and gray.

thanks all for reading this and giving me awesome tiding on my first to posts.

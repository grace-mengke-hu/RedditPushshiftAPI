How long until it feels gross again?

So i have been smoking for nearly a decade now, and have "quit" multiple times. However in the past I noticed that after two or three days if I tried to smoke again the smell, taste and even the feeling would make me feel sick. This time I went for about two weeks before cheating, and I did not find any negative effects from the cigarette. Why would this be, and has anyone gone through something similar?

After 2 days clean, I’m in urgent danger of relapsing.

I’ve been doing the work, every strategy in the book, and I finally hit the 2 day milestone.  

Now I’m hit with such a strong craving that I’m nearly convinced to smoke what I have left in my pack. 

It’s messing with my head that I can’t allow myself even one moment of weakness. 

I’m here as a last resort. Just in case anyone can tell me something that will convince me not to do this.

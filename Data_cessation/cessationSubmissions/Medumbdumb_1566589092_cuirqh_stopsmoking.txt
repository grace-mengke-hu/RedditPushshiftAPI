I stopped smoking in January but just recently stopped juuling two weeks ago, so I’m nicotine free as of two weeks. Anyone have digestive issues from withdrawal?

Right now I’m dealing with digestive issues from withdrawal. Constipation, bloating, cramping, gassy, and really terrible farts lol. Anyone else dealt with this and anyone know when these issues will subside?

I’m happy to finally be nicotine free after about 17 years. I just hope the digestive issues calm down.

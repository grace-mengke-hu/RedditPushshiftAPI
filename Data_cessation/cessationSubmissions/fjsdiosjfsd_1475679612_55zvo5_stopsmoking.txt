My brain keeps unconsciously scheduling my next cigarette

This is full day 2 for me (last smoke was Monday night). I noticed last night while watching TV that it kept occurring to me, "I have something important to do when this show is over." Then I'd realize that my brain had figured out when a good time for my next cigarette would be, without me even consciously thinking about smoking. I kind of miss breaking up my day with smoke breaks, but am also realizing how much damn time I wasted squeezing in cigarettes every hour or two.

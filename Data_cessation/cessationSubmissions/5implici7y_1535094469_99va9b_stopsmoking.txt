3 Months Today!

I dit it. It's now three months that i am totally free. I feel so much better i can't even put into words. I kinda did a very readical change, quit smoking, stopped eating animals (full vegan), started doing way more sports and very intense workouts. i am not gonna lie - i feel like i've been reborn. I feel so vital, free, healthy.

THIS WAS THE BEST DESICION i ever made and i think the only next times i will be so proud of something will be the moment when i go on my knees in front of a woman or when i will kids in some years whatever. 

if you are not sure if you'd should stop - do it right away. 

I've been smoking for 8 years - at least 15-25 cigs a day. After i stopped the first 3 days were absolute nightmare. But after that it was pretty easy. Id say every "big 3" is hard - 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months. i dunno why, but that is how it was for me. looking for 3 years now.

stop smoking - you won't regret it, after a few days - trust me.

9 days in: First day I've felt good since quitting

Smoker of three years here. First post in this sub, seems like a great community. 

Never made it past day 7 before. As many posters here have pointed out I think it's really important to avoid alcohol like the plague for a few weeks after quitting. The last few times I went cold turkey I fell off the horse by going drinking the next weekend after I quit. Not this time. 

I've also seen a few posters point out the horrors of day 8. Is there some sort of physiological reason behind this? The smoking dreams started for me the night before last, and yesterday felt like one huge craving all day long. So glad it's over! 

Anyway just to let everybody who has just quit know, depending on your own circumstances, life does in fact get back to normal and it does get easier after a while. Keep at it ;)

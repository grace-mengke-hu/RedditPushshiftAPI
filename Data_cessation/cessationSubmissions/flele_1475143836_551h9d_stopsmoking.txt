To anyone fearing the cravings won't ever fully stop

They will! It's been 500+ days for me but I could have posted this way earlier. The only time I am reminded of smoking nowadays is when I see a post from this subreddit on my front page. So if you are in the early days or months of quitting and can't see the end of it, just [hang in there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz-o1DZAXOI). Soon you'll be able to look back and know that it was all worth it!

Disclaimer: I quit cold turkey and avoided all forms of nicotine like the plague so this might not apply to less rigorous forms of quitting

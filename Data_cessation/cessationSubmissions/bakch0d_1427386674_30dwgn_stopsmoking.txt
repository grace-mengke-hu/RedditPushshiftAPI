Bumpy ride on day 2 but it's done and today is such a good day to not to smoke

Wow, so day 2 for me was way harder than I had thought. I mean, it kind of came as a surprise because I was expecting day 3 to be bad but for me day 2 was kind of horrible. Here are a few notes from yesterday:

* Cravings ... OMG ... so many. I did not count but basically my head was constantly going "smoke smoke smoke." My solution was to basically keep drinking cold water and browse to /r/stopsmoking and read posts of people who are winning everyday. 

* Dizziness - It was like I was high. My body was too happy with the excess Oxygen it got. 

* Chills and shivers - I was cold and shivering. Went out for like a 15 mins brisk walk session in the parking lot. 

* Slept early because I was tired of fighting my urges. But sleep was nice and deep.

Thanks again to this awesome community, honestly, I don't know what I would do without you guys. Now on to Day 3 - I am ready and my energy levels are high. Today is such a good day to not to smoke !!

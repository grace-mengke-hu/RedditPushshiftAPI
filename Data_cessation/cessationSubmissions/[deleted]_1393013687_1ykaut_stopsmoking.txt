So I've been off cigarettes for just under 1 month now, but I'm going out on a big night out tonight for the first time since =/

I quit mainly because of health reasons, I wanted to lose some weight and felt going to the gym, working out and doing cardio would be my way but leaving the gym and having a smoke is just ridiculous.

As much as I love smoking it's been really easy for me some how to quit, very few cravings if any.

But I'm just thinking now when I am out most of my friends I'll be with are smokers and I know once I get drunk I will want to smoke and instead of being annoying and bumming all night I might just buy some and start 'quitting' again tomorrow? I feel although it might just be me still being a slave to cigarettes but I know in my head it's going to make my night so much better and fighting the urge all night is going to be a serious downer.

How have you all managed to deal with only smoking on special occasions ,not even social smoking just the like couple of family reunions or big work parties during the year.

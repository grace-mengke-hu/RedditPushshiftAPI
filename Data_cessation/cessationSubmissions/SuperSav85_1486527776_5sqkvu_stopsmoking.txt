Quit Day is Friday, need advice on dealing with Enablers in the family

Hey guys been lurking here for a few days now as I build up the mental capacity to hit my scheduled quit date on Friday.

I've been smoking since college about 10 years ago and have tried and failed to quit more than 5 times over that decade.

What usually makes me fail are moments of anger or depression and I am usually always near a family member who smokes when it happens and they just sort of talk and talk and pressure me to have a smoke to calm down.

Luckily I won't be around most of them anytime soon, but I am worried about the biggest enabler in my family, my mom.

I would keep my distance but due to work schedules I have to see her at least twice a week or more to pick up my kids.

Long story short, does anyone have any advice about how to best handle it so that I don't fall off the wagon again? I would really love it if I could be done with this smoking for good this time.

Thank you for reading and any advice

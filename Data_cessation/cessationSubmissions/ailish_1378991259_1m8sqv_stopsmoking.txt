How do you deal with people?

I am on day two, and I'm really feeling the irritation.  I warned everyone at work, and asked them to have a little patience with me.  All I do around here is help people.  I cover their 50,000 breaks a day.  I jump in and pick up their slack when they are overwhelmed.  I listen to them go on about their problems.  The one time I ask for something in return, and god forbid.

Today this woman I work with was having a misunderstanding with another coworker.  I could see exactly what was happening, and I tried to explain it to her.  Just to help everyone involved.  Maybe I sounded like I was criticizing her?  It's possible considering the mood I'm in, but I certainly did not intend to sound that way.  Now she's all pissy and won't speak to me, but even better she's going on to other coworkers about what a bitch I am being.  

I do nothing but help this woman out all the time.  I cover her to go to the bathroom 1000 times a day because apparently her bladder is small or something.  I teach her new things about HER job because she is slow to pick up on certain things.  I jump in and and help her when things get really busy.  Now the ONE TIME I ask for help in return, she can't even get past the first time I apparently was a little short (and I don't even think I was being short, but she apparently thought so).

SOOOO.  How do I deal with this shit?  My nerves are extremely frazzled right now as it is.

help with setting quit date (using champix)

Hi all. Im 36, and have smoked since i was 13. Its time to stop! I picked up a prescription for Champix yesterday, and from what doctors said, and from reading up about it, the method seems to be to set a quit date 1-2 weeks from when you start taking the meds. My dilemma is that I have a festival I am going to with some old and dear friends I haven't seen for a couple of years, and I know I will be drinking with them. With all the warnings on drinking on this medication I am a bit scared to start, but at the same time i don't want to delay my motivation to quit. I don't want to be ambivalent about my quit date, but I can't seem to work out an action plan! Any advice?

I did it and with the help of Mushrooms.

So I started smoking about 5 years ago when I was 19. Started off with just a few cigarettes on nights out, fast forward 5 years and I was smoking sometimes two packs a day and on nights out it climbed up to five or six packets in 12 hours. Absolutely crazy amounts. My biggest problem was restlessness, cigarettes always gave me something to do, it was this gap that was being filled that made it so hard to quit. I must have started trying to quit 2 years ago and each attempt ended the same, one day of willpower.. and suddenly I'm smoking. 

Almost like I sleepwalked to the shop and bought more. I couldn't understand why I couldn't stop, I always ended up with more or made an excuse to quit later.

Recently I decided to try to quit using magic mushrooms, I write down my intention on a piece of paper and myself and my friends went hiking. I smoked 3 cigarettes in the entire 2gram trip, each one getting closer to the last one until finally I had my last cigarette and said goodbye.

It has been 15 days since my last smoke, I can't say I feel cravings or if I ever did? It's just been a feeling of 'a smoke would be great' but far from unbearable. Today was the first day where I forgot I was ever a smoker. It feels so good to be on the road to health with a head that seems to have severed the connection to cigarettes after such a light mushroom trip.

Just thought I would share my story for any interested.

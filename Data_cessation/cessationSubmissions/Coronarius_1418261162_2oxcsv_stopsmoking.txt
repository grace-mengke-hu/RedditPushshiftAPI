28 years old, quit today after 13 years

Hi, fellow quitters!

I'm proud to say I stopped smoking today. I started when I was 15, smoked 20-50 per day for the last 8 years or so, generally never went longer than a few hours without a puff. I extinguished my last one about two hours ago and that is going to be it. Allen Carr's Easy Way, however repetitive and interjectory it may be at times, set me in the right mindframe, and I'm happy to be free. Excelsior!

Question about Vape-pens...

So I've been trying to quit for about a week now. I didn't smoke actual cigs, but I was smoking up to 10-15 rollies a day. I'm not really having any nicotine cravings, but I miss the oral fixation aspect of rolling a cig, and then just the act of puffing on it. 

I wanted to see if anyone had any good experiences with the vape-pens. I don't even think I'd get oils with nicotine in them, I just miss the motions of smoking. 

I wanted to see if anyone had made the move from cigs to vapes with success before I dropped ~fifty bucks.

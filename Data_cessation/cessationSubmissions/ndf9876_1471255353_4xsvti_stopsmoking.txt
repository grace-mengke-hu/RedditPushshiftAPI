I quit - 2 weeks ago!

So 2 weeks ago to the day, I gave up smoking tobacco and bought myself a vape device. This was on some advice I read from an app, which in turn cited evidence from The Lancet about NRT increasing the chances of a successful quit attempt. I've tried to quit cold-turkey before, but always relapsed.

So, 2 weeks in and I am using a 6mg liquid and it's obviously taken all the cravings away. I can't stand the thought of having a "real" cigarette, I'm happy enough that I'm done with that part of my life.

Anyway, the plan is to go with the vape from 6mg, to 3mg, to 0mg by December (so I get the nicotine addiction done with, then wean off the hand-to-mouth, psychological side of things). I do not want to be beholden to nicotine in any form, but I recognise that for me, this method is working. 

I know there is a fair amount of disapproval regarding vaping and NRT in general here (judging from what I've read) but I consider myself a non-smoker now. At the very least, I'm no longer inhaling carbon monoxide and tar!

Some of the success stories here have been great; as part of my quitting "journey" I wanted to post up here and share with everyone - as well as wishing everyone success in their own smoking cessation attempts. It is hard, and weird, and not easy, but I believe life is all about choices. Choose not to smoke, and think about how badly you want that choice.

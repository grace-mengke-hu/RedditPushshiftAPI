2month breakthrough

Today makes 9 weeks but last week I had a huge breakthrough. Since I quit I could not stop thinking about cigarettes. I always wanted one and they were the answer to any negative emotion I felt. In my mind it was because I never said goodbye,as odd as that sounds. I threw away a pack and a half in my cold turkey adventures. A friend of mine was smoking a cigarette and just offered me a puff. I had been given a full cigarette maybe 2 weeks before when my cravings got too bad (never smoked it) and the same friend had jokingly offered me a puff before which I always denied but I took it and took a puff. It was interesting because it was perhaps the first time I didn't need/want/crave a cigarette. I felt like a new comer trying cigarettes for the first time.It wasn't gross, I did not cough, but with that uninteresting little puff...I said goodbye finally to cigarettes. I had a huge smile on my face and my friend thought I was in love with cigarettes again. Complete opposite. The smile was knowing that after 2 months, though I still enjoy the smell of cigarettes, I am happily a non smoker with no desire or even thought of a cigarette.

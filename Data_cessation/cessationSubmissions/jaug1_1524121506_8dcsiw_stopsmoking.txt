One month today!

After 15 years of smoking I managed to quit for four years and then stupidly took it up again at the start of this year. Within a week I was back to being a pack-a-day smoker.

I live and work in a dangerous place so it was easy to justify *needing* them to deal with stress or that they *help* me work longer and more focused. Except none of that is true and hadn’t been for the preceding two years of being in the same place. The truth was, once I’d let nicotine back into my system, it was painful to go without it. Not anymore! 

It had been so long since I last quit, I’d forgotten how bad smoke smells on other people until I started to notice it again during my recent withdrawal.

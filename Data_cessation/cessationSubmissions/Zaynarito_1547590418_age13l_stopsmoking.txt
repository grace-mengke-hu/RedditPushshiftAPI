Is it cheating to quit smoking and use a vape for a few weeks?

I smoked 20 cigarettes/day until 8 days ago. The first thing I did at 5 am is get up and make a shot of espresso and have 2 cigarettes and go to the gym. Now I wake up and have espresso and gym without anything until I drive to work, I’ll start vaping.

I got a gift from a friend in my office building - a nicotine vape. He recently quit and got himself the same vape. It has been a tremendous help for me. 
But I feel like I’m cheating. 

I just want to use it for 3 months and go on quitting with nothing to rely on.

The problem is e-liquid contains propylene glycol, diacetyl, etc... and more nicotine in one cartridge than a pack of cigarettes.

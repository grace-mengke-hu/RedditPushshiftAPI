I’m just not ready

I want to be ready so bad, I hate it, I need it, I want it, I love it. I’m just not. I’ve been more ready than this before, I’ve quit cold turkey for 2 months before, I just don’t have the will power right now, I just don’t, I’m trying to hard to find it and it’s at an all time low

New to here, but had my last smoke 10/6/18

So my last cigarette was oct 6 of this year, I have since quit weed, haven't drank since before quitting cigs, and have been keeping my sugar low. But I still have MASSIVE waves of depression at times, where it feels like nothing is ok. Anyone else have experience with this?

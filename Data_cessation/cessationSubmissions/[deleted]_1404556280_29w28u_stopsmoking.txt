Three days!

I'm using my vapor cigarette less, which is a good thing.  Yesterday, I thought I really wanted a cigarette and my husband kept saying "no, you don't because you're not a smoker." So, I took one hit of his cigarette and NOPE. Turns out, I didn't want one at all. Ick.

So, I guess I'm a non-smoker. Doesn't everyone always say that if you can get past the first 3 days then you're over the worst of it? Here's hoping today goes well.

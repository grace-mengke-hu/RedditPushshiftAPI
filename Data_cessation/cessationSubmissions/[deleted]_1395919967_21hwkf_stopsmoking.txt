Watch your back

I started playing with cigarettes at the age of nine, and was smoking them properly by 10. By 35, I was a 40-a-day man. At that point, I gave up completely for two years; one of the best things I ever did. Foolishly, I then drifted into occasional “social smoking” three or four times a year. Sure enough, over the next decade or so, this slowly, subtly became seven or eight or 12 times a year; once a fortnight; once a week… I kept telling myself that this was at least better than smoking every day. Inevitably, though, about six months ago, I had to admit that I was a full-time smoker again; not on 40, thankfully, but still on 15 a day too many.

I am now just over a month into giving up, and feel wonderful and full of energy I didn’t even realise I had lost. I’d like to say thanks to all the other quitters around here; just lurking in your uplifting midst for the past few weeks has helped enormously. And I’d also like to remind anyone who has got this monkey off their back never, ever to take it for granted. It’s a cunning fucker.

A thousand days...

Thanks /r/stopsmoking. You have no idea how much that little timer in the corner helped me stay accountable for my own actions. 

To the people still wanting to quit, realize that it is in fact as simple as that: just quit. It's the nicotine that makes you believe that it is somehow this insurmountable task, while all you have to do to get rid of the habit is simply not do it for a long enough time. After being a pack-a-day smoker for 7 years, I personally have had no issues ever since about day 10. This amount of time can be different for everyone, but realize, you'll forget you were ever a smoker faster than you think you will. And let me tell you, it's worth it. Hope to see everyone join me on this side of the fence soon.

Oh, and, if you quit using nicotine substitutes like patches, gum, or a vaporizer, great for you! However, a substitute is exactly what they are. You are unnecessarily prolonging the dependence you have on nicotine, which in the end makes it that much harder to actually break the habit than simply quitting altogether. So, if you're just starting this journey, I personally would dissuade people from grabbing for these.

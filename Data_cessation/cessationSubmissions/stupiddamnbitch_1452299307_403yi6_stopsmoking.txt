Going in to the convenient store..

I put off going into my normal convenient mart (Sheetz) since I quit last Friday.  I finally went inside today because I wanted to jump on this powerball bandwagon. I put a mint in my mouth and walked in and bought my 3 tickets and walked out. No ciggs bought. Nice to have extra cash on hand due to not smoking!

I will not fold.  I will not smoke.

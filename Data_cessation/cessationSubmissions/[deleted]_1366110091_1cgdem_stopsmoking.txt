Personal record! And an unbearable cough... any suggestions?

Hey all,
I'm proud to say that today is the eleventh smoke-free day for me, a personal record since I started smoking roughly five years ago (and decided to quit about a year ago)!

However, I have this obnoxious cough that will not go away no matter what I do.  
Are there any tips ya'll might have to reduce the cough?  
Or does it normally go away pretty quickly?  

I'm a college student and I feel especially rude coughing through every class.  Thanks in advance for the help!

New here and really need advice

Hi folks. Quit from about 5 a day (which I guess isn't much) to zero cold turkey 5 days ago. Had absolutely no withdrawal symptoms for 4 days. Couldn't sleep last night, and a mild anxiety this morning blew up throughout the day into a depressive kind of apathy with a high heartbrate. I really thought I was gonna smoke but I got through it. Thing is, i've got exams coming up and I really need to study. I pretty much wasted today. Should I delay the quitting process? Get a vape or something? Anyone been in a similar position?

I've had issues with anxiety and depression in the past and after getting sober I've been much better. This is the first time I've felt like that in a while and I guess I'm terrified it won't go away again.

Cracked after a few years. Back to square one and moving forward.

Cracked about a week ago and had one after the bar. It'd been over three years since my last one. That one turned into three on a trip with some coworkers and one more last night.

Time to start over. Having a beer, and looking forward to my first day without a cigarette again. I'm not falling back into this shit. I worked my ass off to quit a two pack a day habit and I'll be damned if I'm going to be derailed by a paltry 5. 

Any of you just starting fresh, let's go! To anyone thinking about picking one up, it ain't worth it. Best of luck folks, I just needed to put this down someplace and I hope you have a good one out there.

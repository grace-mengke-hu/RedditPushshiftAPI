Still a battle

Well, I'm nearing 200 days and I can say that when I started there was something different about this time. I knew I would not partake in ANYTHING that involved inhaling as in previous attempts at quitting, those very allowances brought me right back to full-time smoking. Whether it was vaping or hookah bars or somebody passing a joint around, I would always allow myself that "treat" in the delusion that it was not smoking but, in reality, it was. I've visited the sub here and there as I find the posts helpful. One milestone has been that the thought of a vacation did not immediately bring me to visions of smoking and that is a big step. The cravings are definitely shorter and easier to disregard but they are still coming. Stay strong.

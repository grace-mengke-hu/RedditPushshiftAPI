Day 5

Rolling deep into day 5 and the 4th day was the hardest but I woke up today and I feel like I have a whole new grip on the task at hand. I have so much more energy too and I have been so distracted by smoking that I neglected my home and myself! I spent all afternoon cleaning my home and I feel incredible for it. All the times I distracted myself with smoking can now be used to accomplish the tasks I always ignored. 15 + years of coping using cigarettes and now no more. Deep breaths and mantras for the win! Not another puff, I've had enough &lt;3 \^.\^

Its my birthday!

Today is my 28th birthday and it's been one year since I've quit smoking. I just want to thank everyone for all of the support that this sub reddit provides. To all those who recently quit I want you to know that it gets easier. Just focus on taking it day by day; everyday is an accomplishment and the longer you hold on the less you'll want to turn back. Quitting smoking was the best gift I ever gave myself. It helped me take control of my life and to realize that I have the ability to do anything I set my mind to. Thanks to you guys and the guidance of Mr. Allen Carr I was able to quit and never look back. Here's to another year of life and hopefully, many more!

Do you reward yourself? If so.. how?

Though I understand the health benefits should be reward enough, I think I need something more tangible to work towards. A carrot in front of my nose, if you will.  

I've heard of some people taking the money they've saved from quitting and going on a holiday as a reward, but I need something a little more short term.. maybe a monthly reward? Any ideas? I'm interested to hear what *you* all do and *why*. Thanks!

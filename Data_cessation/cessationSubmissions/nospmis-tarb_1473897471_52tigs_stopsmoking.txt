Incredible lack of support from smokers..

I just want to vent.I'm quitting AGAIN, my best was three months and I really want it to be forever now, I sick of this shit. But anyway, it's been pissing me off that people somehow want to feel validated in their addiction and when I say I quit they do not incourage me, on the contrary. Different people already told me the following: "Oh do you wanna get fat?", "Why are you quitting?" "What, are you crazy stop joking", even my mom who smokes a lot, when I say "I quitted" she says nothing. I think It's because it makes people confront THEIR addiction and they rather keep thinking it's OKAY to smoke, it's not so bad, so many people do it right. Has anyone dealt with this? (sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language)

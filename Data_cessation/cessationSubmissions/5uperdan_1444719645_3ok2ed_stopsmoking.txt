3 weeks today. My journey being a non-smoker, advice for people wanting to stop smoking.

So it's three weeks today since I had my last cigarette after a packet a day for ten years. I read EASYWAY and that was that. Here's a few of the things I've noticed that hopefully will help convince any smokers still caught in the trap:

• I sleep better, period. 
• My skin looks and feels so much better
• Tasting food is like a new world of pleasure, everything tastes sooooo good
• I've learned how to truly relax. When I watch TV, read a book, chill out etc I fee completely relaxed. This one surprised me. 
• I can breathe! I've never had serious problems with breathing or wheezing etc but I can feel how much more air I can take in. When exercising, I recover at double the speed I did as a smoker and get out of breath much less
• I feel AWESOME. By this I mean I feel like I can do anything now I've finally done (what I thought was) the hardest thing ever. I can't explain how empowering this is, I've even applied for my Master's degree and signed up to a 5K run since stopping. 

If you're a smoker, I beg you to read Allen Carr's book. I feel unbelievably liberated and happy that I've taken control of my own life again.  It makes me so sad to see smokers still smoking when I know there's absolutely no point to it and that its ridiculously easy to stop.

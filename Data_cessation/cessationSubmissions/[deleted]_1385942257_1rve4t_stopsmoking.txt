Hi trying to quit or severely cut back my cannabis smoking, hope this isn't the wrong place to post

Now I'll start off by saying that I'm sure it's a lot easier to quit smoking weed than tobacco, but still my habit has gotten out of control in my life. I've been smoking every day on and off for the part 3 years, and I always think I'm gonna quit and then start again. I quit for 3 days last week and then I went and saw an old friend who I used to smoke with so we smoked, and it was just unpleasant and made me feel shitty. so then i quit for another 3 days but last night I was pissed that I missed my flight and am delayed for a day, so I lit up a bowl. The first 20 minutes was great and i was happy I smoked, but then I started to get a headache and feel shitty which is how it's mostly been lately. Even when I get rid of everything I have, all my friends still invite me to smoke with them and it's hard to refuse. I don't necessarily think i need to quit all at once, maybe cut down to once a week but if it makes me feel like shit then there's no good reason for me to be doing it.

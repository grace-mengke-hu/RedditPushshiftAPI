Day 2, Round 2

I've been smoking for about 10 yrs. I've tried to quit at least three times in the last 2 years. I quit this time with the help of NRT patches, I've never been successful cold turkey. I started on the 10th but after not even 4 days, I bought a pack and smoked 6 in a row last night. Yesterday I was so horribly depressed, nothing I did was fun. I suffer from depression normally but this was some of the worst. Every time I quit, its the depression plus the cravings that always cause me to cave. I immediately reset my quit date last night, threw the pack away, and kept using the patches. I made it through my first day (again). I'm just so scared of the depression and how I don't feel whole, can't feel like myself without cigs. I like drinking socially and my boyfriend and I go out a lot. I avoid over doing it for the most part but I'm worried that I'm going to not be able to have the same life now and that I'll never enjoy it (i.e. going out, living in the city) again. Does anyone else suffer from depression and find it almost impossible to quit? I really do want to get on the other side.

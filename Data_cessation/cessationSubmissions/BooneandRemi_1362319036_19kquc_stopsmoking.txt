Anyone else have a sobbing fit?

Yesterday was a regular day, nothing crazy happening but I ended up smashing my finger in a drawer accidentally and I lost it. All of a sudden I was sobbing my eyes out wanting a cigarette. I was standing in my kitchen for 5 minutes crying my eyes out while my SO held me (and I'm sure he was freaked out). I calmed down and didn't cave but has anyone else been dealing with these crazy fits? I feel ridiculous for sobbing like that and it just highlights how addicted I am. I guess I just wanted to know if anyone else dealt with these and pushed through...

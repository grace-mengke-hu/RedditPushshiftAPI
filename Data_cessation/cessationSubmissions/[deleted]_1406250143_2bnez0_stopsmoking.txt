I'm really tired. And what's up with the e-cig spam?

Tired of the spam and just tired in general. My roommate got me to help him lift a three seater couch a block and a half in the goddamn rain and it didn't even fit through our door. I was so pissed because we're both smart people but neither of us realized it was too big. So naturally my body hurts and I've got bruises everywhere. It was no where near my physical fitness level, thought I was going to puke afterwards. I just want to sleep right now! (It's only 9pm)


And about this e-cig spam trying to advertise their products, why don't you advertise on /r/electronic_cigarette ?

EDIT: I'm talking about the literal advertisements that have been popping up every few days leading to a company's website.

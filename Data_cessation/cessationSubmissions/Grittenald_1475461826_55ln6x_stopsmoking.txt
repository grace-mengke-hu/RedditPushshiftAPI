Relapsed last night ugh. Considering this day 1, all over again.

I went on 4 months strong too!!!! I don't have a craving for it at all still, thankfully. Posting here to get my badge going and to keep it ticking as encouragement.

It's getting over the cigarettes and beer that is the worst. It just feels so complimentary. Anyways, posting here to give and gain the support of others in this mission of leaving the dependency of these useless sticks.

I successfully quit smoking, but I keep having cravings. Any advice?

I quit smoking several weeks ago, I want to say it's been two months, but I haven't really been keeping track. I've been good at abstaining, but it seems like almost every day I want to smoke a cigarette. Last weekend I ended up smoking a few while getting drunk with a friend who smokes. It's not a big deal, as I haven't had once since then, but I had hoped that I would eventually stop craving cigarettes and while the cravings have dropped in intensity, I still crave them from time to time. 

To be clear, I have no intention of going back to smoking. It's so expensive and so detrimental to one's health that it would be foolish to go back to smoking after breaking the habit. 

What I'm looking for is for someone to tell me that after three months or six months or even a year that I will stop feeling the cravings. I feel it physically, mostly in my chin and jaw. It feels uncomfortable, and I know that a cigarette will alleviate the discomfort. I can deal with it as long as is necessary to stay smoke free, but it would certainly be nice to know that it will go away eventually.

Dilemma

I've been quitting for 16 days now. This is the fifth time I quit smoking and I want this to be the last time. So far, it has been great. I am really motivated and feel like I can make it this time. However, I've been using weed as substitute. During my first week, I had my cravings and it was a really strong cravings. I open this subreddit, and saw a post where someone said that smoking weed is different from smoking ciggarettes. Before I quit, I smoke weed mixed with tobacco but now I'm taking it pure. Sometimes I feel like I'm cheating, like I'm using weed as a substitute for tobacco. Is this bad?
**TL;DR:** Use weed as substitute for tobacco when cravings, doesnt feel right. HELP

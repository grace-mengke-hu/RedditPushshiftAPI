I've decided to give up smoking...TODAY

Hello everyone,

I'm 22, I had never smoked in my life till about 5-6 months ago, and had resisted joining in with friends. But it happened around February this year. That set a dangerous precedent among friends about me being in by default whenever they shared a smoke and honestly, I enjoyed the chat sessions. It started with Menthols and around June I made the switch to Advances. 

Honestly I feel a bit lucky that I've realised this when I have but I've admit to myself that I have an addiction. I'm up to almost 4-5 a day as of today, I have a sore throat and I've finally decided to give it up after 2 months of regular smoking. I haven't thrown out the rest of my pack because friends do come in for a smoke, but I'm hoping that I get past those cravings and make it upto a week without one (setting a realistic target to begin with)

Please do tell me about any withdrawals that might be coming and what I can do to power through them.

I smoked again.

I promised myself yesterday I would stop. I was going good. Today I fucked up, forgot i had work, arrived 1.5 hrs late and had a panic attack. It lasted for most of my shift/felt shit for the whole time. I was shaking. I was so fucking stressed out. I went and asked a guy for a smoke. 
He gave me two. 

I went in the back n smoked in the washroom. My boss showed up n I hid the cig, the bathroom reeked of smoke and I'm so fucking lucky that he didn't go in there and left quickly. But that just gave me more anxiety. 

I finished my cig and worked. Now I'm at my old elementary (I'm 17) and smoked the other one. I havent smoked 2 cigs in a day in 1.5 yrs and I'm so ashamed of myself. 

I fucked up so much. Im just sitting here so the smell can leave so when I go home my dad doesn't notice. 

Fuck. I thought I could do it.  But I had just a shitty fucking day that I was like "it's okay, just one to calm the nerves so u can work". I hate this. I fucking hate it. 

Tomorrow I'm going to try again, BC I'm just hoping that I'm not a total failure. 

Thank you for listening to my little rant/confession. I needed to tell someone bc rn all my friends are out of the country and busy so I'm alone. 

And loneliness doesn't help with anything either. So fuck.

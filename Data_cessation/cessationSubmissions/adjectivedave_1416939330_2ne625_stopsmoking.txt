48 hours in and gassy

So gassy, what is that about.
Also headaches, tiredness, trouble sleeping, lack on concentration, lack of appetite, over eating, gassy, all the fun stuff.

Avoiding the pub so i don't go to the newsagents opposite after i sniff the barmaids apron.

What's everyone else up to?

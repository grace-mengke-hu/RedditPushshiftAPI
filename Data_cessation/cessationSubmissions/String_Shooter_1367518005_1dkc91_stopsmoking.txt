Ran a 5K!

Ran a practice 5K for my first race in June, and I didn't feel like dying! Yay! Definitely worked some junk out of my lungs, I could NOT stop hacking like someone sprayed me with mace! Any who's, just wanted to share with some people that will understand how big of an accomplishment it is to actually be able to run again! Thanks for all your support and kind words during my cessation!

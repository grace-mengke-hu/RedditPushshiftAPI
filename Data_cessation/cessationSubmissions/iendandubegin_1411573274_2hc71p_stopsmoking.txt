Questions about the healing/recovery process in my lungs.

Hi!  I know this sounds like a stupid question but I feel like I'm missing out; or that my body isn't healing properly.  I haven't been coughing up any junk!  Isn't there a long phase of coughing out the bad stuff?  I feel worried that it's still hanging around in there.  I've exercised a bit, coughed but nothing really came up.  Will have more time to exercise now that I'm back from vacation preparation and vacation and things are back to normal.  I want this stuff out of my lungs.  Surely I'm not back at full lung capacity, right?  I smoked pretty heavily for 11 years, FYI.  And I do smoke an e-cigarette but honestly not even that much.  For example: I didn't use it at all during vacation, I go up to 2-4 days at a time without it.  Then other days I use it somewhat religiously (work days).  Any feedback would be appreciated.

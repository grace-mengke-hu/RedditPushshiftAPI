Day 5, need advice

After quitting cigarettes about 2 years ago, I took up vaping as a "healthier" alternative. I wound up vaping all day every day, and was ingesting the equivalent of nearly 2 packs/day. Now for several reasons, I want to cut out all nicotine permanently.

Since Saturday morning (5/2) I've been nicotine free, but even here on day 5 I feel like I simply cannot perform at work or in my life in general. I am a software engineer and require intense concentration for long periods of time, and right now I have gotten maybe 10% of the work done that I should have since this week began.

I've heard varying things about when the focus comes back, some say over 2 weeks. Is there anything that I can do in the meantime that will help me continue performing at work?

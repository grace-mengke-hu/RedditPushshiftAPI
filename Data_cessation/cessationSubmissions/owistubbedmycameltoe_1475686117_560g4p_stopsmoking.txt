Gonna Friggin Do It This Time

I started smoking when I was 15 & I've quit smoking at least 5 times in the last 15 years. The longest run was 6 months. Every time, I've let an emotional trigger "allow" me to light up again. And, to be completely honest, half  of the time I was kinda looking for an emotional trigger so I would have an excuse. Now that I'm rounding the base on my 31st birthday, I've decided that it's time I grow up about it & really quit. I don't want to have been a smoker for more than half my life. Not to mention it's killing me & I can feel it now. My lungs hurt. I'm tired all the time. I literally feel dried out. Since I smoke around a pack & a half every day, (two-plus when I'm drinking) I spend WAY too much of my meager paycheck every week on these cancer sticks. So, with all these incentives, I decided that the cigarette I smoked a little under an hour ago will be my last. I know I'm in a better position (mind-set) to quit this time because I have 3 unopened packs in my freezer. I've never tried to quit without finishing the carton first. I will be using this sub & other sources for support, and I appreciate your input. I really want to make this change.

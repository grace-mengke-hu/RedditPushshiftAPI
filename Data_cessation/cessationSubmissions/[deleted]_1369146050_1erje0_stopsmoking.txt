one week! also a quick question!

good golly miss molly, a week, not even a puff!

but I have developed a pretty annoying and kinda painful cough, no blood or anything, anybody else experience this?

say after i've quit for 30 days, and I have a cig, how far will that put me back? is it the equivalent of making those 30 days moot? will i become addicted boom just like i was before? will i ever be able to enjoy cigs just 1 a week or 2?

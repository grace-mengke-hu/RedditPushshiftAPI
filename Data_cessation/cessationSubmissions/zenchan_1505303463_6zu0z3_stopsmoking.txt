Day 4 and I'm really weakening. Please give me tips so I don't relapse

I've been posting supportive messages for everyone, but right now, if there was one within reach, I would smoke. I got back from lunch and now have a boring 3 hour train ride ahead. I hope I can get through this day without collapsing

**Edit**: Thank you everyone. I managed to get over yesterday by reading and re-reading your messages. And finding ways to distract myself. My trains were delayed which meant extra time near smokers and within reach of the tobacco shop, but I kind of made myself think of staying strong for the next hour.

I thought I was breezing through the quitting process, that's why the intense and prolonged craving hit me so hard. But today is another day, and you all are right, I'm stronger for having withstood yesterday.

Thanks again!

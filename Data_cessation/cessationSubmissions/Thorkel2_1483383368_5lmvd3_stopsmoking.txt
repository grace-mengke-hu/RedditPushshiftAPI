Day 8. Just checking in.

I'm writing this post on a stationary bike at the gym, enjoying my 8th day without cigarettes. I've tried to quit several times over the past couple months, and so far 8 days has been my record. I'm feeling a lot better about it this time, though. The initial withdrawal symptoms have mostly passed, and I'm not even thinking about smoking most of the time. I know i still have a long way to go, but this is the best start I've had in a long time.

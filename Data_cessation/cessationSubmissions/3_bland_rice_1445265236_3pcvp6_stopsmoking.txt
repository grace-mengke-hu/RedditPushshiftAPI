Started Chantix yesterday!

Already, cigs are tasting bad and I hardly want one, although I still smoke them. Not sure the pills are the cause as it's probably too soon for them to be effective, but even if it's just in my head I'm excited to quit! My official quit day is this coming Sunday.

Wish me luck and good luck to all of you!

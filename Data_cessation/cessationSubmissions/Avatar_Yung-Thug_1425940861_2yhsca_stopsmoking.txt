5 day mark.

Lurked for a month, smoked for six/seven. I've bummed smokes off of people at parties and when I was drunk for two years now, but I finally bought my first pack on Halloween last year. I've been smoking ever since until 5 days ago. I was at about a pack every other day by early February.

I've tried quitting a few other times but they didn't pan out. This time it just feels...easier. Sure I still get urges (especially at times like this where I'm actually thinking about cigarettes) but I'm able to stay focused and not give in. I'm determined to see this through and put this (relatively brief, yes, but also very intense) addiction behind me.

Still, I can't help but think to myself that if cigs weren't so bad for me, and if they didn't make my breath smell like someone shit into a campfire, I'd still be smoking. **But** that's not the case, so the only smoking I'll be doing anymore is the occasional joint or tobacco pipe, and maybe a stogie for special occasions. Fuck cigarettes, gang. Stay strong. Willpower. Hal motherfucking Jordan.

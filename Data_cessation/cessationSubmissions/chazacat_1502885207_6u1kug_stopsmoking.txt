Day 11! Feel amazing. Supplements were my magic bullet.

First week was terrible, of course, but for the last few days I've felt incredible, and I feel confident about the future. Here's what has been working for me:

**Taking supplements - my new ritual.** Not into them generally, but it's really helped to have a (healthy) new ritual to replace smoking. A big blow when you quit is just the absence of a habit: empty space. I've been taking stuff like flax supplements, a multivitamin, and a probiotic a couple times a day. Doesn't really matter what so much as the *act* of taking them. I think all this has made me feel better sooner, physiologically and psychologically.

**My old quit diary.** Not so much from this time -- but from my last quit attempt. Rereading what I went through last time helped me remember that it's all ebbs and flows. And I remembered how good I felt at the end of every day when I didn't give in to cravings -- because I had documented that over and over. If you don't have an old quit diary, forums/reddit is where it's at. 

**Internet people.** Reading all the encouragement and determination here and elsewhere. THANK YOU INTERNET PEOPLE! You are good people.

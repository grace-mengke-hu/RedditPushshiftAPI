First day trying to not smoke was:

Today was the first day of my free smoke challenge, as someone who is pretty addicted like i mentioned in my previous post it was hard. 

But, i had only 2 cigarettes today compare to almost a pack that i’m having daily! 

In the morning i didn’t smoke at all. When i came home from class had one when i thought about my ex some toxic though and then i had another one in the evening when i had another toxic thought about my ex. 

Than i had another toxic thought about my ex but i refused to smoke. I just didnt. So ended up having only two cigarettes today,  I know that I supposed to start without smoking at all. It was super hard for me today especially refusing to take the third cigarette.

Hopefully tomorrow will be better ...

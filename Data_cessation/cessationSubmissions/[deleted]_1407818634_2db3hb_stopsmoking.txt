Made it passed 72 hours

As of 3:30 P.M. EDT I am 72 hours smoke free and I feel good about it. I feel like I'm back to where I was before I relapsed after 57 days of not smkoing a little over a week ago. I have reaped the concequences of my poor descision making. My lungs are full of shit that I'm still caughing up and I realized taking the dive for the reasons I did were pathetic at best. But all well, I'm continuing forward.

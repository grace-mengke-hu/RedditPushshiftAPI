Quitting 22/03/18

Right first post on here and i am just after some support.

Ive decided to quit this Monday coming, i will be going cold turkey from the start, been smoking 11 years, i am 29. Ive had enough of wanting cigarettes first thing in the morning but even more when i am just bored and have nothing to do. so ideally i would like to replace the habit with something, not sure what and suggestions would be helpful

i have quit once before for 3 months and then i got nervous as i was a best man (about a year ago) and had to do the dreaded speech, smoked one or two before it and its been downhill since.

i smoke from 10-20 a day and i just want out. i live with my wife who also smokes but she doesn't want to quit (not yet anyway), that will be downfall as there will always be an "easy smoke" around.

i dont know what im expecting to hear with this post as i am sure i have it heard it all but any help/advice is welcome.


well anyway i just wanted to write about it to see if it helps with the quitting process 
Thanks :)

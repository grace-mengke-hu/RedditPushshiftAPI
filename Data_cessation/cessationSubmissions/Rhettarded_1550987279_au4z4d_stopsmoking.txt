I'm quitting nicotine!

So... I haven't smoked for about 2 years now after a pack a day for 10 years.

But I vape nicotine still so it was relatively easy for me to quit. Today I haven't vaped at all. Feeling a bit edgy but handling it well.

Bit of a different quit story I know but this community is awesome so figured I'd post!

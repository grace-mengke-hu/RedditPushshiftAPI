100 days!

I honestly never thought I would get here. Just want to make a post to celebrate 100 days because this community (and quitnet) has really helped me stay quit and I owe a lot to you guys, and I'm thrilled!

For about two years I'd be in the cycle of attempting to quit then smoking then attempting to quit - I think my record was 6 days. I'd given up hope in myself and my self esteem about quitting was really low and it made me pretty disgusted in myself, knowing I wanted to quit but keeping up smoking.

I don't know what made this quit attempt different to the others - it was just another quit attempt, but it stuck (although I'm determined not to get complacent, I know I'm not out of the woods yet). 

I love the feeling of being able to breathe properly and not being tied to cigarettes, and I'm really proud of myself because I thought I couldn't do this. Also, I don't want to go all woe is me, but I'm also proud 'cause I'm schizophrenic and apparently 90% of people with schizophrenia smoke -- I thought it was some necessity that I had to smoke. It's not and here's to 100 days!

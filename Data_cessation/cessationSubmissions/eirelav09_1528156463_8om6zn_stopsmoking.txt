Day 1.

A couple months ago I decided to take advantage of the smoking cessation program I was eligible for through the insurance I finally got as a result of a promotion at my shitty retail job. I spoke with a counselor which is required for the free NRT. We agreed on a plan: I'd use nicorette lozenges to gradually replace cigarettes. It started out great! In two weeks I was down from 10-12 cigarettes a day to 5 cigarettes and 2 or 3 lozenges.  

Then a couple weeks ago I ran into a really rough patch in my relationship and got another promotion with zero training or preparation so my stress levels exploded. I gave up on the lozenges completely and lost all motivation to even try cutting back. I told myself I had enough reasons to ease up and I "deserved" to smoke.  

Flash forward to last night: I realized that I'd gone straight back to smoking a pack in two days and was furious with myself. I looked at my boyfriend and said, "I'm just not gonna buy another pack." I smoked my last one eight hours ago.  

I'm on my way to work, where I usually smoke anywhere up to 6 times a shift. When I was at 5/day I was only smoking once per shift but in the past week it's gone back up to 4-5 times per shift. So this is gonna be REALLY REALLY TOUGH. I'll probably still go outside just for the mental break and have a lozenge when I would smoke but I might lose it. The only consolation I have is I can't buy cigarettes because I literally don't have any money lol.  

Anyway. Wish me luck?  

Also, really not looking forward to how much worse my quit zits are about to get. They're already so gross. Ugh. And I hear/read a lot about crazy dreams so I'm kinda just preparing myself for utter misery lol.

What are your smoking triggers?

Identifying smoking triggers can be super helpful for quit attempts. It helps us to make a plan for when we get triggered or helps us avoid some of them altogether till we're stronger. Some of my triggers included stress, caffeine, alcohol, and anxiety. What are yours? 

Developing a plan for when these triggers arise is important. For me, I'd exercise, drink chamomile lavender tea, do deep breathing, call a friend, or take myself out for a nice meal. What do you do when triggered instead of reverting back to smoking?

I'm happy to be 2.5 years smoke free after being a half a pack smoker for 10 years. If you're looking for help/guidance, check out this blog: [www.quicklyquitsmoking.com](https://www.quicklyquitsmoking.com).

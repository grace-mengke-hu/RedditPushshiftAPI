Smoking Dreams

I know this topic gets posted a lot, but this has been bugging me almost every night for the past week.

The dream normally starts out with an every day situation and then I'll find myself at the gas station buying a pack, or in my car, finding a half smoked black and mild. There is no thought process, I just immediately light up and go on with my business. My dream self doesn't seem to reflect how I feel about all this. The guilt I feel is crushing. It's like knowing I had just one shot and I blew it, condemning myself to forever be a smoker. Then I wake up. I feel absolutely horrible for maybe, 20 minutes until I realize that I have not smoked. I'm still good. I still have a shot.

I know some people see the guilt associated with smoking a dreams as a good reminder of why they quit, but god are they annoying to me.

I have to do this

Almost a full month. Spouse and I are fighting and I'm leaning to old habits. I bought a pack a couple of days ago and have had 3 smokes. I haven't had any today as I don't have a lighter but the cravings are incredible.

4 weeks. Didn't smoke at all this week and no anger issues. It is actually getting easier. I never thought I would say that.

Update: Up to day 11, had a small relapse 3 days ago but I was back at it the next day. 

5 days smoke free, on day 2 I found out I have a blood clot on my lung.

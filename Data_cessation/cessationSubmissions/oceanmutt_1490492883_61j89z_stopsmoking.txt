A warning about painting over smoke stained walls

Do a google search something like "nicotine + painting" or "smoke + painting" before you start. Because I'm sorry to tell you, it is not going to be as easy as you may think. Smoke stains will simply bleed through regular indoor latex paint. Or the new paint may actually peel off if the dirty paint underneath it is a gloss or semi-gloss, and the wallboard has a smooth texture.

Bottom Line - You might be able to get away with only putting on a coat of a shellac based primer first. Like the one I've linked to. But it is possible you will need to wash the walls first, and then paint with the primer to avoid problems.

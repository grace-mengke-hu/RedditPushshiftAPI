Why I hate smoking. Day 2 attitude adjustment.

Head is hurting. Had cranberry juice. Worked out. Better but still there.

Why I hate smoking:

- It's killing me. As a non-smoker I live a very healthy lifestyle. 
- My kids really want me to quit.
If I quit, my wife will too. I know it.
- Gawd it stinks, especially in the colder weather now. I am embarrassed going in the elevator at work.
- I know from experience that life without smoking is way better.
- Smoking is gross, not enjoyable. 

Just get on with your day! OK I will. Thanks, I feel better.

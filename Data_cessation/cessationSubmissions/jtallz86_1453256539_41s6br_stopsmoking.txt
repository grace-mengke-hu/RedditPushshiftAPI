3 "miles" on an elliptical...

Didn't even realize it. I was reading the entire time and only stopped because I was risking being late to a meeting. 
   Two months ago I would have been suffering 5 minutes in and even now only plan to go fifteen minutes at a time. Today was nearly 30 minutes. Guess now I can start trying to challenge myself on pace and stamina.

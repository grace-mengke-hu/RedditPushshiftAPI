When does it get better?

This is my 3rd attempt to quit smoking. I've been at it for a week. I am starting to remember why I failed quitting before; I am starting to drop into a deep depression and it doesn't look like there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The problem is I can't remember how long I actually lasted without cigarettes during the previous quitting attempts so I'm not sure how long this depression will last. I am starting to convince myself that maybe the depression is not a symptom of quitting but smoking just treated an underlying condition. I'm probably just lying to myself because I really want to smoke but goddammit my addiction is making a pretty persuasive argument right now!

You can help me by answering the following:
1) Did you also get depressed when you quit smoking?
2) When does it stop?

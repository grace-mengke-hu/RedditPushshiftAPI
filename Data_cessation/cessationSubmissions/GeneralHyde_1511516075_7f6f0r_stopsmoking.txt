It took courage, but I did something great for myself tonight.

As I finished yet another cigarette, I started to really get into thinking about why exactly I was smoking. It doesn't help my anxiety, in fact it exacerbates it. Each one makes me think about the time I'm losing from my life to it, which just serves to make me feel worse. I feel like I was using the act of smoking to try to fix a deeper problem, but really it was just putting a band-aid on it and ripping it right back off, leaving me feeling worse than I did before. After realizing this, I decided that the negative things that came from every cigarette far outweighed the subjectively good things that I got out of it. And so, after internally fighting with myself about it, I opened my pack of cigarettes, took out the 10 or so left in the pack, and snapped them all. I'm leaving it behind and facing a better life smoke-free. 

tl;dr: I realized smoking was doing me more harm than good and decided to quit tonight, snapping what I hope to be my final cigarettes and leaving them behind.

Nonsmoking Rage?

Ok y'all, it's been a week and a day since I had my last cigarette, and I am absolutely flipping my shit. Over the littlest things. Mostly managing it internally but I feel like if something doesn't give I am going to go postal. I have def made some \*comments\* I shouldn't have at and have had to kinda run outside at work to prevent myself from verbally slaughtering my coworker. This is not usual for me at all. 

Point being when the fuck does this stop? I feel over the past 2 days like I have just been constant, low-grade angry. I almost want to just quarantine myself from the human race until it passes. Did anyone else have this problem&gt; Should I just smoke for society's sake??

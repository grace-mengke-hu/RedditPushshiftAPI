Im trying again

I have tried to quit smoking numerous times, going cold turkey, patches, gum and inhalators. I even tried the electronic cigarettes to stop my filling my lungs with tar. And each time I tried I cracked. Last week I started a course of tablets called Champix. It affects the dopamine receptors in the brain. You are allowed to smoke for the first 7 days of the course and choose between the 8th and 14th day to stop smoking all together. I have chosen day 9 (today) but there are some effects I have noticed over the past week. Even though I could smoke, I got no pleasure or or relief in doing so. No nicotine hit. Just stinking breath and edging that wee bit closer to serious health problems. So from day 1 to day 8, I went from 20 a day to 2. Morning and after dinner. And they were more of a ritual I have developed. Now I have not done either of them, and looking forward to seeing this through.

Did anyone else quit by using cannabis?

I used cannabis to help me quit and it worked wonderfully. I have already smoked medicinally for a long time and just added an extra joint whenever I felt a craving for a cigarette. I would step outside every two hours and just hang out for the time it would have taken me to smoke a cigarette. When I would drive or watch TV, I would usually have a straw that was cut down to size in between my fingers. I would take phantom drags or even rest the "cig" in my mouth for a while. I was able to quit cold turkey this way. Also, losing my job helped. Without those two things, I would still be smoking cigarettes.

Keep up the good fight, fellas. Substitute a cig for a joint if the going gets tough.

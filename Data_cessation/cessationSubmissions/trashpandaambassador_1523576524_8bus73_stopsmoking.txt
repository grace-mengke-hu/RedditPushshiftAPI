What do you do after compromising your quit?

I was on day 25, and honestly things were pretty easy. My partner is still a smoker, and a recovering alcoholic and addict. I’m in the process of getting out of the relationship (it’s going to require some legal shit and take some time) but for now I’m still living with him. 

Last night, he relapsed. I didn’t have anyone to talk to about it, and eventually broke down and had a few drags. It didn’t help, of course. But now I find myself swirling thinking about saying fuck it. The brains playing tricks like “well you already botched it, might as well wait til this is over to quit again” etc. etc. 

Any advice on snapping out of that while living in a high stress environment with someone that literally leaves packs everywhere? Thanks in advance.

Success!

I haven't had a cigarette in over 24 hours! I'm 24 years old female, been smoking on and off since I was 17â€¦ Recently got up to a pack a day and I was coughing up a lot of black flem my tongue started hurting, so I decided to lay off for a little bit. I've been using the VUSE to keep my nicotine cravings down and it actually helps a lot. Just wanted to share with you guys!

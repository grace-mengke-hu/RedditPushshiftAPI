Small support group chat for young (18-30) smokers who wanna quit.

Hey guys,

I really wanna quit and was thinking of making a self-support group chat (maybe whatsapp) for people like me (22m) who wanna quit and to support each other on our way. Like we "quit together" and support each other on your way to a smoke-free, addiction-free future. Where we can share our thoughts, feelings, etc and get through the hardest part.

I feel like a small (maybe 3-10 ppl) and personal support group would be kinda way more encouraging than a huge forum like this. Like i love this sub and all the support, but with soo many people on here you dont really have to "prove" to anyone that your actually quitting. Like you never really speak to the same people and it feels like i could also just read those "you can do it!", "keep it up" kinda texts anywhere on the internet and i would still end up betraying/lying myself when i smoke again without anyone knowing.

Anyways, if anyone wanna join, shoot me a DM and ill add you :) We can do it together, a bit like alcoholics-anonymous.

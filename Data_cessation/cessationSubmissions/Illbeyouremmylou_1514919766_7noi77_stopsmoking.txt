Might as well try again!

This isn't my first, second, third or fifteen attempt.. but here I go! For supports I'm going to use this sub as well as the stop smoking app. The plan is to take deeps breaths, drink tea or do yoga, or all three whenever I have a craving. I didnt plan this in advance, I just woke up this morning and decided it was time to take my power back with this addiction. 
Cheers!

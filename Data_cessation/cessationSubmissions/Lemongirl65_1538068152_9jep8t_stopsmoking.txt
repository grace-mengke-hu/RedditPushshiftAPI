Anyone else watching the Senate hearings and craving a cig like CRAZY?

Day 5.  long time smoker (35ish years).

I have been at a  (8) every 10-15 mins since 10am'/beginning of hearing.

I know I should turn off the TV and take my dog for walk.  But I don't want to miss anything.

Those butts are looking so good!

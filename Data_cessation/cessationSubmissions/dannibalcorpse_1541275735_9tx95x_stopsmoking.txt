four days and six minutes in!

so i've been using the SmokeFree app (like i'm sure a lot of folx here have at least checked out) and it recommended i check this place out.  looking forward to mostly just lurking but reading about people going through the same dang struggle i'm going through.

last night i had my first car ride of more than a few minutes AND my first trip to a bar since quitting on tuesday and i didn't get tempted away.  here's to keeping this up, and again thanks to all of you for creating a community i can turn to and draw inspiration and support from!

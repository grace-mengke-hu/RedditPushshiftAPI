What's up with these dreams?

I'm 4 days in now and my dreams just keep getting more and more strange/vivid. And I'm not dreaming about smoking, I'm dreaming about shit like Jurassic Park with priests.. and trees that grow wigs and just crazy shit. I don't remember dreams before my smoking days so I guess I'm just wondering if this is forever or do these bad boys stop at some point? I don't like being weirded out in my sleep.

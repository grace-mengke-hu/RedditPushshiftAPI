Quitting smoking for 4 years! Scared of depression.

I stopped drinking and using drugs 5 years ago. A year into my sobriety I knew it was time to stop smoking as well. It wasn’t fitting in with the person that I wanted to be. I was so tired of having anxiety over smelling like it, not knowing if I was going to be able to smoke soon, if the wheezing I was experiencing was serious or not and etc. 

The first time I stopped smoking I used lozenges. It was honestly a huge rush for the first month not smoking because I didn’t ever think it was possible for me to not smoke. I was over the moon, I felt invincible. The lozenge use diminished gradually and I went on with my life... until about 3 months into no nicotine at all I fell into the deepest and darkest depression I have ever experienced in my life. Looking back I am able to see it was just my brain chemistry readjusting and if I just held on tight I would have made it through it smoke free. However that wasn’t the case. I smoked. I felt pissed. I quit smoking to feel like this? Plus my mind just didn’t have an optimistic type of outlook. Anyways, I have quit again and again and again since then. I can’t help but think that, subconsciously, I’m scared to completely quit again because I don’t want to go through that depression again. That’s why I struggle. I haven’t ever gone passed 2 months since the first time I quit. 

In January of this year I started using the JUUL. Which I began to hate more than cigarettes. My hair started to thin and I was always tired and had brain fog. I stopped using JUUL a week ago and bought some lozenges. I definitely feel better but I know that I’m just going to have to go through that dark patch in order to get through this once and for all. Does anybody have any advice on how to get through it? Do most people go through the depression? If you’ve read all of this jibber jabber thank you! Man, I wish I never smoked that first cigarette.

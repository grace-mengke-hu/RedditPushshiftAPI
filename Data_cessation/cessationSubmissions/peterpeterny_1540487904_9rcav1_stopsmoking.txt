Advice - How I Quit Smoking

I am writing this because I quit smoking cold turkey. I smoked for 15 years and was over a pack a day before I quit. I don’t have this amazing willpower, all I did was change my thought process. I want to share with you the steps and infomation that worked for me and can work for you. I would also recommend buying Alan Carr’s Easyway to Quit Smoking. That has been my inspiration for quitting. .

If you haven’t stopped smoking yet - Prepare you mindset

-I am no longer using the word quit in this post and neither should you. You are not quitting -anything. Quitting implies giving up. The only thing you are giving up is handing money and health over to tobacco corporations.
-THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO SMOKE
-Smoking is NOT a normal human function.
-You are going to be freeing yourself from this highly addictive drug called Nicotine.
-You are CHAINED by this drug. Your life is dictated by this drug. You are a slave to this drug.
-When you are low on cigarettes, you have to get more, if you can’t get more you become agitated and worried...chains of the addiction. Chains that a normal human does not have or need.
--IT IS EASY TO FREE YOURSELF FROM THESE CHAINS!
-If you are still smoking, taste the poison closely with every inhale. Your body is still trying to send you signals to stop poisoning it. Your mind tries to tell you it taste good but how often do you really try and taste it? Your body is sending you signals that you are POISONING YOURSELF.
-Set a date, a moment, a last cigarette. Be ready to free yourself.
-Don't Allow Past Thoughts to Dictate Your Future Actions.

***Two Steps to Freeing Yourself

When you free yourself from smoking there are two urges that you must break. One of them is very easy to destroy, even though corporations and media would like to make you think it isn’t. That is the drug Nicotine.

-Nicotine is a highly addictive drug. You body has 0 use for nicotine.
-One of its highly addictive properties is its FAST acting nature. The moment you inhale it, it fulfills that urge for more...for now.
-THIS ALSO WORKS AGAINST IT. It comes into your body fast and LEAVES your body fast. Which is why you need another one in like an hour.
-In three to four days nicotine is out of your system completely. A weekend.
-You don’t need a patch, vape, gum or anything to get over this. When you wake up after sleeping at night, most of the nicotine is already out of your system. If it really was such a hard drug to release yourself from, you would be waking up every hour or two at night needing to smoke a cigarette.
-Nicotine is not hard to stop but its associations with emotions is what has chained you.

The second urge you must break is more persistent than the first. I don’t know if it ever goes away completely but the longer you fight it the less and less it exists. This urge is a little more abstract. 

-Nicotine has latched its chains on to your emotions.
-A normal human experiences emotions at 100% - they are bored, nervous, relaxed, focused, and happy at 100% and deal with those emotions as a normal human would.
-Smokers emotions are at 75% because we have added the addiction of nicotine to complete that emotion to 100% We have chained nicotine to these feelings.
-WE HAVE ASSOCIATED GETTING HIGH OFF NICOTINE TO IMPROVING OUR EMOTIONS
-Are you bored and have a cigarette? Or do you need to light this cigarette to focus on the task at hand? But aren’t those things the opposite? How does this magic poison do both those things? IT DOESN’T.
-The fact is - your emotions of needing energy, being bored, focused, nervous, relaxed, all will happen regardless of if you have a cigarette or not.

-Whenever you have an urge to smoke...
-----Identify the emotion you're experiencing at the moment - bored, relaxed, focused, nervous, or/and happy
-----Visualize the emotion. I pictured my emotion as some type of circular red blood cell
-----Now visualize the nicotine poison attached to this emotion in some way. I pictured a green poison glass cloud cell attached to my red blood cell.
-----Peel the nicotine poison off of the emotion. Realize that this emotion does not need a cigarette and move on with your life. 
-----Then focus on a new way of changing (bored, nervous) or enjoying (relaxed, happy) the emotion that your having.

-Find other things to replace all the time that poisoning yourself took up. 
-Driving and smoking was probably the toughest to overcome so I started to listen to Critical Role and started getting into DnD. Letting my mind drift in a creative direction. IDENTIFY which emotions are so badly chained by this poison drug and provide them with support to overcome.
-Alan Carr promotes having a saying to combat urges - “Yippie Im a Non Smoker”. You would be surprised how effective that is. Yell that at yourself when you doubt. Say it out loud. Make it your existence, YOUR A NON SMOKER.
-After just a few days you will notice improvements in your entire body (Nicotine is a fast expelling drug), use these improvements to peel the nicotine away from your emotion. I still smell my fingers every now and then to see if they smell like smoke and am very happy when they don’t.

Break those two chains and you can free yourself whenever you want. Nicotine leaves your system immediately and you can overcome that. You must cleanse your emotions of this poison called Nicotine. Once you do that, you return back to a normal human being. All the benefits that people usually speak of like money and health are a BONUS if you break these two chains.

You do not need to live your life as a smoker any more. Good Luck.

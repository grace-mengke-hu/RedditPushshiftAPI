Repetitive question, but I'm having trouble quiting (obviously). What empowered you to quit?

Trying to quit, I just bought a pack of djarum black cigars. Like everyone else I've got the mentality of "just one more pack then I'll stop". 

What empowered you to quit? Patches or lozenges, gum? I can't figure it out. Just got some lozenges that I'm gonna start taking. I might try a vaporizer with little or no nicotine.

Im open to any and all suggestions.

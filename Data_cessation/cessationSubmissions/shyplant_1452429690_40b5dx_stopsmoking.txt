I still enjoy hanging out with smokers, even without smoking!

Ooh, this is a good feeling. I used to smoke at school during breaks because staying inside is a bore and most of my friends smoke anyhow. 

The first few days of joining them outside was sort of tough, and I was fighting the urge to bum a cigarette, but these days I feel fine and quite happy just being around them. I still (for some dumb reason or another) enjoy the act of smoking and being around smokers, but I realise I can enjoy it just as much as a non-smoker, and this... is such a goddamn relief. I don't feel like I'm missing out. Yes, smoking is a fantastic social lubricant, but aye, I'm fine without them! 

Sorry, perhaps this is a bit of a lame post - but I smoked mostly out of its social aspect, and this comes as some sort of breaking point which I'm excited about.

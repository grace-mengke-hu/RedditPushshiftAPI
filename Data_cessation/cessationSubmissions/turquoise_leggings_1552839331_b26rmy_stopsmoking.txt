Quit 2 weeks ago, smoked today - how do you deal with fails?

I quit 2 weeks ago, was on and off smoker for 2 years with the last six months smoking everyday. This is my first attempt at quitting and i was feeling so good! and today i couldn't overpower the urge and bought a pack.. and smoked. I know this it is not a reason to give up and i will keep going but feel really bad right now. Was wondering how do you deal with fails like this?

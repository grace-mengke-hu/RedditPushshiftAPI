Day 2: a happy non-smoker!

I smoked since I was 13. Yea, I know, i'm 20 now. Cigs per day: 25-30
And actually stopped for 6 months when I was 18. I got sick for a week and didn't smoked for that time, then I managed to hit the 5 months mark without cigs.
But then I smoked several joints, so I guess that the nicotine was back in my body, and restarted smoking real cigs.

Two days ago I read again Allen Carr and quitted from day to night.
But I do still have some cravings like the post-launch cig or the classic *Coffee & Cig*

Beside that, i do really enjoy not being a slave.
*Smoking does NOT help me in any way*
*My life was just something between a cig and the other*
*Smoke's taste is awful, weird, but definitely not good*

Those are the best thing I learned from EASYWAY.
How do you guys deal with the occasional cravings?

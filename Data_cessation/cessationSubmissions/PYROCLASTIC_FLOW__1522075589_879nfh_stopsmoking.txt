Advice for a specific issue

Maybe someone has had something similar and can offer some advice. The way I smoke is different than most. I basically got hooked on smoking via weed and tobacco in a bong. I'm trying to quit both so I've cut the weed heavily and put like 90% tobacco in. I can stop for like two days but I get absolutely fucked up feeling around that time, head is spinning, using the bathroom all the time, blood pressure feels all messed up, etc. I think it's at least partially because the way I've smoked creates a huge amount of nicotine in my bloodstream and high blood pressure (?) and the drop off is extreme. Does anyone have advice for how to deal with these symptoms? It's not even the nicotine craving that gets me it's that I feel so damn awful. Thanks

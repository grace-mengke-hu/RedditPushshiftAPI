Quit by accident last week, don't know if I want to keep it up.

So last week I got a pretty bad case of amigdalitis, which got me in bed from tuesday to saturday. My throat ached so much I didn't want to smoke, so I haven't smoked since tuesday afternoon.

Tomorrow I get back to work, and not only I am not sure that I'll keep my streak, I'm not even sure I want too. See, I'm not even that heavy of a smoker in the first place (10-12 cigs a day), but more of a 'social smoker'. Also, smoking is pretty extended in people of my age here (25 yo, Spain). 

I'm considering dropping the smokes during the week, and only smoking if I go out during the weekend, but I'm not sure thats doable.

Part of me wants to stop, as I probably wouldn't be writing this otherwise. But muy brain is trying to trick me into a "not yet".

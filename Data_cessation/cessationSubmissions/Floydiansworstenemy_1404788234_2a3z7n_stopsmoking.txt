Another few days down, you guys have no idea how much small things can be big things!

So, its been a few more days. Thanks for the support. Had a couple moments of absolute knee-wobbly-ness wanting a cig but I have made it through tobacco free. I almost cheated myself and smoked a pipe... its not a cig... but I didn't. I hope I can make it to some safe platform where I can confidently look back at my smoking days,not be scared of them coming back.

Unplanned Kick

Hey all, so I  have beena light, but consistent smoker, off and on ( mostly on) for almost 15 years, until about two weeks ago I got extremely sick, and was essentially comatose for a week. I could barely breathe so smoking was out and I had no interest and still can barely manage a puff or two before my chest locks up. So I kinda accidentally quit smoking. But now my lungs are getting better  so that excuse is about to vanish. I actually really want to run with this as I'm getting older and the health risks are becoming more tangible. The biggest problem I have is the longer I go the more it's getting to me psychologically. I dont really have cravings but if i have an errant thought about a cigarette, or like this morning when i found one under my car seat... I have absolutely zero tools or strategies and am worried I'll lose my nerve and am unprepared. So i'm hoping for any tips or tricks for the more psychological aspects?   


Cheers

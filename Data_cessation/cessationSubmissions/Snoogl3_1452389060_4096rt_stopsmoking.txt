Quitting cold turkey

So I have recently stopped smoking, I am up to day 3 and my biggest concern is that when i go back to work i will get into my old habits. Being in an office environment I like to be able to go outside on my breaks but this would always include a cigarette. Any suggestions on how i can still enjoy my breaks outside without getting back into this habit of smoking again?

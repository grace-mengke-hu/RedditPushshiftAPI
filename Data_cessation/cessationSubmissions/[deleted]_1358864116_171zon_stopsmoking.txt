Today while I was getting dressed, I decided I'm done.

I didn't smoke my last cigarette, I didn't buy a pack to slowly quit, I just said I'm done.

I really want to quit. More because I want to save money than anything, but I can't deny the physical benefits either. I'm getting back in the gym starting today with two of my friends, so it's a perfect time to quit.

The hardest thing for me to over come is being in a bar atmosphere. I shoot a lot of pool throughout a week on leagues and just practice in general, and I know if I have a beer I'll be craving for that menthol to go with it. Do I think I can go without slip ups here and there; hell no. But I think that's normal, isn't it? I'm doing this without any pills or special gum or e-cigs, I just want nicotine and all that shit out of my body. 

And I decided I"m coming here to do this. So thank you guys in advance. I've seen what a positive role you play for each other, and I'm happy to have people that don't even know me with me every step of the way.

Day 1...

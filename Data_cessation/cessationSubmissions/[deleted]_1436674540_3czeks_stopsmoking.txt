Study concentration is terrible

Hi all! I am on 17 days and very proud of myself. However, I am so much less productive than I was when I smoked. Someone told me that nicotine stimulates brain activity: is this true? Is there anything I can have instead that would mimic that effect? 

I would ordinarily think it was a myth but it kinda makes sense given the dreams that I had on nicotine patches. Coffee doesn't seem to do the trick. 

Just read [this](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-a-nicotine-patch-make-you-smarter-excerpt/) - to be absolutely clear, I do not see this as an excuse to relapse. I am looking for a replacement.

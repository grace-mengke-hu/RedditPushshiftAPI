Look what I have...

Day 2. 

*does a happy dance*

Cannot stop coughing this morning, but lots of stuff is coming out, so... progress?

Yesterday was rough because my husband worked a 12, and same thing today.. BUT!

Shoutout to /u/my_self_vape for another day of letting me check in constantly and sending me funny links to pass cravings. You're awesome!

Advice on OCD and quit dates

My birthday is Thursday, but I have the strong desire to make my quit date tomorrow. I'm afraid it being barely off from my actual birthday will mess with me tomorrow. I'm almost out of current pack and don't want to commit to buying a new one. Any offered perspective on this idiosyncrasy?

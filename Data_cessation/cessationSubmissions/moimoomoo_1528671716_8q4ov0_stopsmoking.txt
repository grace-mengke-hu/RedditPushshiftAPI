Tomorrow is my Day 1

I’ve been smoking since I was a teenager and am now in my early 30’s. I have tried to quit multiple times but always fail. I smoke 1-4 cigarettes and I have asthma and am prone to respiratory infections. It’s just time to stop. I quit drinking a month ago and that’s been easy compared to this, so now I’m going to put the same effort into quitting smoking. Just wanted to introduce myself.

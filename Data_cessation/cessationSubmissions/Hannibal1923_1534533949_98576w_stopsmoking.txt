I cant stop romanticizing smoking

So i quit 40 days ago after smoking a pack a day for 10 years. 

Quiting felt pretty easy, much easier then i thought probably because when i quit, i really hated cigarettes.

However around two weeks ago i started to romanticize smoking. First only with the morning coffee and once i was done with it it ceased. Now, since a few days i have it almost everytime, when i go for a walk, drive in the car, when it rains, when i watch TV or work on the Computer....Im just thinking how good these moments would be with a cigarette even though i know once i take a puff i will hate it and myself.

I thought its just a period of quitting and it will go away put i feel like its getting worse and worse. I want to hate smoking again but even watching documentaries about lung cancer dont help like they did when i decided to quit.

So any advice what helps to get over the nostalgia?

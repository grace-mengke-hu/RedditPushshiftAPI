Accidentally smoked and I feel like garbage

Basically I got handed the blunt, but it was actually a Black & Mild. I only took one hit but I burst into tears as soon as I realized and had to talk to my bf on the phone for an hour before I calmed down (although I was also drunk so that didn't help, like I was full on bawling lol.) I really wanted to make it a year without smoking any tobacco at all (it'd been about 4 months at this point). I feel a little better now but I'm just so disappointed in myself even though it was an accident. I was so close to just giving in after that. And I was so proud of myself for making it this far. It feels kind of stupid now that I'm actually typing it out since it was a little mistake, but it meant a lot to me to abstain completely.

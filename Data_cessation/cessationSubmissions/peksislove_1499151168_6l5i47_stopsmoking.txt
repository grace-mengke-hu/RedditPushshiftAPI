When I go home, I will be a non-smoker

Hey everyone. I said I was going to quit about a month ago, but I didn't last long at all. Today I broke down for the hundredth time and though it may seem like nothing, I lasted 19 1/2 hours. That's the longest I have ever gone without a cigarette. I was doing good too! The reason I relapsed was because my dumb ass held on to some smokes as a safety net so I went straight to them. My nicotine-addled brain said go ahead. You can do 19 hrs again. My brain tricked me, but it was right. I'm hitting reset for the last time! I learned that I can do it. I was going so strong, but the easy access got to me. They're gone so no more "safety net" for me. I'm ready to go to war with this addiction! Let's do this!

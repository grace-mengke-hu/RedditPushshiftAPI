Dealing w/ Depression and Quitting Smoking

I've been smoking 1/2 a pack a day for the past six months, before that I smoked a pack a day for the past ten years. I just turned thirty a month ago and have started to seriously think about quitting smoking. 

I've got the gums of a 80 year old through over brushing, genetics and quitting smoking and my mouth is in constant pain but I can't bring myself to see a dentist just yet about it.

I'm wondering how people who smoke here deal with quitting and depression. For me, the biggest road block to my staying quit is that I get in a really low, foul mood and reach for my cigarettes because it's hard to think about your long term health when you can barely cope with the day that lays in front of you.

I know that a big part of it will be trying to adjust my perception and tell myself that I will in fact be around for years after and that I'll regret smoking even though I have a hard time seeing that far ahead.

Anyways, having said that, I'm still going to give this a go and try to quit. I made a dentist appointment for next week to get a good cleaning and a checkup. I've read a lot of the posts here and find it inspirational. I'll keep you all posted on my progress.

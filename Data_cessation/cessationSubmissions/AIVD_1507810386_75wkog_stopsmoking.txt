In 10 hours my first week without sigarettes in ~10 years will be completed.

Alt account, because my main account is too tied to my personal identity. I never told my family I smoked in the first place and I became very good at hiding it. It was very tiresome though, to the point I actively avoided IRL contact.

The hardest part about the above is not being able to tell them that I am quitting, and having nobody to share this small victory with (except my girlfriend, but we quit together so that is more of a circlejerk than anything).

The decision to quit was mainly made out of financial difficulties, recently lost my income and have no reserves to rely on.

What helps me motivate to keep going is running. I've been long-distance running (mainly 10K's) for about three years now while smoking a pack a day. This sunday I will run my first half-marathon.

I went for a small test run yesterday, having not smoked for 5 days by then. I broke every single record (okay, I was 1 second up on my 5K PR) I had on Strava.

It feels as if a limiter has been raised from my body, and my lungs can now keep up with my legs. I can't wait to explore my physical limits all over again! I never expected the effects of quitting to be so big and early!

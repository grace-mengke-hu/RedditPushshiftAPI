After multiple attempts over several years, finally One Full Month FREE! This is my experience so far.

I had been a regular smoker since I was 18, and I'm turning 37 this year. I was starting to think I'd never break free from the trap, but here I am one month without a single cigarette. So what worked this time that I did differently before? 

+ *Ignore the quick opportunities:* If I'd see a co-worker or someone I know smoking, I used to bum one without hesitation. This would always eventually lead to me buying a pack. This time around I just let the opportunities pass and the desire to smoke passes with it.

* *That taste in my mouth:* I guess that's how I get my cravings. I'd get this "nicotine" taste in my mouth that I need to satisfy, kind of like getting a song stuck in your head and you have to actually put it on so you can let it go. For this I'd use good old fashioned spearmint gum. It "changes the conversation" going on in my mouth, and by the time the gum has lost its flavor I can't even remember why I was chewing it in the first place!

* *Have someone supportive to talk to about your cravings:* My wife was a smoker as well when we met, but she quit completely about two years ago. Instead of pushing down my cravings and feeling ashamed of them, I would tell her about them. Whether it's through a text message, or re-capping our day at the end of the night, getting that off my chest felt great.

* *Apps like 'Quit Now' or 'Smoke Free':* I'd say they helped moderately. I used to look at them as a novelty, but resetting them whenever I'd start a new attempt was painful. I'd look at all that info about health and money saved and see how I just undid all of that. 

* */r/Stopsmoking:* Honestly, looking at other people's success stories wouldn't help me at all. If the post was just patting themselves on the back for a year smoke free and not trying to offer advice it would just trigger me. What *would* help is posts from people trying to quit that were having similar triggering events as me, and being able to supply my own advice as support. It would leave me with a satisfying feeling of "why would I want to go back to that?" Spoiler alert: I don't.

* *Alcohol:* This is a big smoking trigger for a lot of people, and it's the one I see break people's streak more than anything. Basically if you're going to abstain from alcohol because you associate it with smoking, and alcohol's one universal trait is that it lowers your inhibitions, what do you think is going to happen next time you're drinking and around cigarettes? Well abstaining completely just wasn't in the cards for me since wine along with craft beer & cocktails are a big hobby of mine. Plus my in-laws tend to drink heavily on family occasions, and they're those "smoke when I drink" types so I'd be right outside with them. This time around I didn't stop drinking at all. If I had a nice bottle of wine that I thought would compliment a meal, it's getting opened. New release beer tasting at the liquor store down the street? I'm there. Someone wants me to meet up at the bar? You get the picture… Point is **I broke the association** - I made it more about me than about a reason to smoke and it works.

 

Other than that, I still get cravings when I think about it. Heck I'm having cravings just writing this, but it'll pass. Last night I even dreamed I was having a cigarette, and even in my dream it was awful - fitting at the one month mark.

So if you're trying to get through those first few weeks, don't sweat it. Don't change your life too much around to quit, and don't feel bad talking to close friends and family about it. And keep a pack of spearmint gum on you whenever possible!

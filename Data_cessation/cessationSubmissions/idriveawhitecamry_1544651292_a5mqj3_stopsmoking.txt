Nicotine withdrawl timeline

Well I haven't smoked for years, I picked up vaping about 2 years ago. I've been using high levels of nicotine daily during this period of my life.  I just passed the two-week mark without nicotine. I thought it was supposed to get better after a week but I feel worse now than I did a few days after I stopped. Yesterday I got some suicidal thoughts and strong anxiety. I woke up feeling very depressed and I ended up relapsing with some nicotine gum and it made me feel much better. Was that the peak of the withdrawals at 2 weeks? Or is it something else that made me feel depressed and anxious?

My first serious attempt.

Hey guys, 

I just discovered this sub and I started another attempt earlier today. I smoked my last cigarette about 5 or 6 hours ago (this is a long time for me since I tend to smoke near 20 cigarettes daily). Previous attempts didn't go all too well, lasting 2 to 3 days before I gave in again. This time I went and bought nicotine replacement pills named Nicorette Freshmint to help me. they give me a terrible sore throat and make me feel a bit light in the head but they seem to get the job done. I mainly made this attempt because I've been struggling with bronchitis for the last month and the coughing is really getting so out of hand that I'm getting scared of it. I've also switched to a vaporizer for my weed habits to completely stop with any form of smoke inhalation. Weed isn't as addicting to me as tobacco is so I don't plan on giving that up anytime soon.

There are a few things I'm afraid of and are coming up. One is school, my school friends aren't really supportive and almost all of them smoke. I do have another group of friends outside of school who are supportive and none of them smoke, the problem is that I see these guys about once a month because we don't live near each other. Another thing I'm afraid of are the festivals I work at during summer break. I work as info/security, hours of standing in a crowd with nothing interesting to do from about noon to long after midnight.

Well that's my story. This sub is really inspiring with all the other stories and people. I hope this attempt will be my last one and I also wish all of you the best of luck in quitting yourselves. Take care.

Desperate

Hey reddit. I did it almost two weeks. Now i failed.  Ive been smoking again. Several times. Tomorrow i've got class reunion so i don't think i'm able to not smoke then because i've got  a weak ass personality. What do I do after that day? How do you pick up not trying to smoke after you've failed?

I want to stop so bad (No days)

Hi ~ 43 year old male smoking for 30 years. Now I am smoking about 1/2 pack a day. 

 I want to stop so bad. I will probably say a lot of things many already know. But ..

It's killing me.. I cough a lot .. especially in the morning.. I have asthma and use an inhaler about 5+ times a day. I hate it. But there is some part of me that doesn't care or overides my body and I smoke. I smoke when I don't "need one" and I will need one , then go to the store and not asmoke for 30mins ..? I'm addicted. and I need help.

I know I can do it, I want to do it .. I have about 8 cigs and about 14 dollars to my name. I was planning on quitting when this pack is done but my addiction decided I should get one more pack and ease on down.. 

Interresting fact ~ I just left my girl friend (15yr relationship), but I still am physically in the house because I have no money and no job. .. I know .. anyway. I will be able to find housing and work .. (We are pretty civil really) ** under lots of stress and my brain is jumping around like crazy ..

I get motivated by this subreddit and think about it throughout the day when I reach for a cig and tell myself to wait 10 mins .. then 30 mins go by and I have one or .. whatever .. 

I just need to be pushed over the edge .. Whatever that is that decides. 

Writting that was great .. I will stop now .. any help or advice or ANYTHING will be so appreciated. 

Thank you

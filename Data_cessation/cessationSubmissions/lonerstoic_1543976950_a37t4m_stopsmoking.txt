Can I Quit Cold Turkey?

Okay so the patch/gum don't work.  It's like drinking whine when are used to chugging vodka, you know?  If anything, it just makes it worse.

I just need the confidence to quit cold turkey.  I was also wondering if I should do a three day water fast, seeing as food/coffee triggers cravings.  It just leads to the same vicious cycle, day in and day out.

How do you feel about my chances?

3 months sober, getting tempted

I haven't smoked in 3 months. amazing accomplishment for me, i have been so proud of being sober for this long. But now the temptation is back and it's strong. I'm having those dreams again where im buying a pack or smoking. i even asked people for a smoke today. Nobody said yes. Legal age to buy is 19 here. My birthday is in two days.. I really see myself falling into the addiction again. My loneliness and depression isnt helping either. I know i have to deal with these deeper issues but theres quite a bit on my plate. I want to give in. Focus on getting better mentally. Cigarettes can do that for me- keep my emotions controlled. But i know that i will be disappointed if i give in. I feel like i have lost the battle. It seems too difficult right now to be sober, productive, and content all at the same time. Maybe if i start smoking i will be able to get my emotions under control well enough to start making friends and focus on the positive stuff...

Addiction forever?

I keep hearing that, once you've quit for long enough to be very stable, smoking 1 cigarette will undo literally all of that time you spent healing. 

I get why this might be true if you buy a pack and go right back to what you were at when you quit, e.g. 8-a-day. But surely 1 cigarette by itself won't cause another 5 days of pure psychological and physical agony like when I originally quit from 8-a-day? 

Would I just be at higher risk of buying that mega-mistake-pack? 

My boss, for an anecdote, was a fairly heavy smoker a few years ago and for the past 2 years he's smoked tons, as much as me, but strictly when he's drinking. So we each smoked 10 drunk cigarettes per week, but I used to be 8-a-day. He only buys packs for other people, or when he's having a party and drinking early. Never carries around a pack, doesn't smoke during the workday. Is it likely that he really feels no cravings other than when he drinks, or that he's constantly fighting a battle to not smoke when he's sober? 

TL;DR: I feel great about being an ex-smoker, but if my boss was truly able to smoke 10 cigarettes a week after having been addicted and is truly isn't fighting a battle during the day to not smoke, I would also like to have my cake and eat it too!

is it all mental? what precisely are the consequences of smoking a cigarette when you're drunk after being an ex-8-a-day-smoker for months? will i wake up in the morning and want to buy a pack as bad as did on Day 3?

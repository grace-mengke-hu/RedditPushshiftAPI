Trying again with patches

Trying to quit seriously for the 3rd or 4th time this year. I think previous attempts failed due to my having unclear/too many goals and too much anxiety. I feel a lot more prepared this time around, plus the nicotine patches are helping A LOT. First few days went by smoothly bc of patches and having clear goals for the day/week/year. Wish me luck and let me know if i can help!

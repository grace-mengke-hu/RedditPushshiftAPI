I made it a full year Reddit! If I can do it, you can too!

I'm officially one year off of cigarettes. I still have cravings, maybe once a week, but the thoughts of how bad it would feel and taste are way stronger now, so its easy to let them fade away. My parents were both heavy smokers until I was 5. I started at 19 and went until I was 36, struggling to quit over and over again until I finally did it. I never thought I would really quit. The patch helped me. My wife helped me. Here's to 10 years. YOU can do it too!

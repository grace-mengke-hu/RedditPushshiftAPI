1 Month Quit

I've quit for a month and now entering my second. I find I am not attracted to the smell of smokers as much as I was. My apartment finally no longer has the 'background' cigarette smell to it. However, I am still finding a ton of dust everywhere as I clean. Is that normal?

This week I broke out all over (my body) in (quit) zits. How long before these little bastards go away? Is there anything other surprises I need to be aware of?

I still momentarily panic when I put my hand in my pocket and don't feel the reassurance of a pack of cigarettes there. I still feel a little anxiety and depression. How long until that goes away? I don't however feel the need for a smoke anymore. I found a lone cigarette sitting in my car. I am proud of myself because it didn't cross my mind to smoke it.

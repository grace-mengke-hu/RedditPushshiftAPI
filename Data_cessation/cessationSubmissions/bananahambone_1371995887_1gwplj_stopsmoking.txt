I reached the Summit of a Mountain: Found butts

I hiked up a 4000 meter mountain in Borneo a couple days ago.  There were cigarette butts near the summit.  I picked up some along the way and disposed of them.  I figure picking up the butts of careless others is the karma I deserve for every cig tossed out my car window.   At least when I was smoking and hiking I would field stip the smoke and put the filter in my pocket... most of the time...        Cigarette butts on any trail are a bummer.

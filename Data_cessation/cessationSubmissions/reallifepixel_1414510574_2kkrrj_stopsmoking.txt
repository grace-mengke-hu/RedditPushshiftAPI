Day 2: Keep Keeping On

Ok, I went 24 hrs w/o a smoke. Yay me! And man, it wasn't easy because my better-half smokes. In the evening, I asked her for one and she said, "I thought you stopped." So, I let it go. But later that night, she asked if I wanted to smoke, but I said, "No." 

I haven't at work today so far, so yeah... keep keeping on.

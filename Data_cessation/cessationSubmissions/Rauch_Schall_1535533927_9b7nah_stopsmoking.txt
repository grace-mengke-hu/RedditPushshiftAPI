Cravings logs - let's compare and map out whats ahead of us

Hi all! 
Since I noticed many of you use the smokefree app or similar ways of tracking your progress, i would be interested in how your cravings developed over time, in both frequency and severity.

I thought it would be interesting to find common patterns and see whats ahead of us ;) 

...my log is still short and quite noisy (three weeks coming up, yay!) but I guess Ill make a start:

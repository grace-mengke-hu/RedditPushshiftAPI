autumn is coming

and skyline it's so grey here, starting to rain and no way for me to go for a ride outside today. i've been fighting the craving and the addiction with exercise myself so much. bike, swim, walking, yoga... now shitty weather is coming. this is probably the first day i stay at homein 17 days. and the first idea that come to my mind was: ooooh, now i can really relax and smoke a cigarette. what da fuck! i've been keep focus and focus, try to decouple good/bad moments from the smoking. i've been talking to others on this subs to stay strong and focus... and now it's coming again? i'm facing more and more moments that trigger me, always challenging and feeling better and better. but stay here at home with shitty weather outside... i'm not ready for that. and you know what? i'm just thinking to go outside for a walking even if it raining.

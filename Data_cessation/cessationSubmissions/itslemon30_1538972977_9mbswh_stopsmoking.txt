Headache and fatigue taking Chantix

I just started taking Chantix a week and a half ago. The first day I took it, I had a headache (I legitimately never get headaches). As I’ve continued taking it, the headaches have been increasingly accompanied by fatigue and intense dreams (I’ve heard these are pretty common).

Basically, I feel sick - like I have mono or something and it lines up pretty well with how much Chantix I’m taking. I’m still smoking, but have gradually lost interest so I’m stopping tomorrow and I think I just had my last one (yay!).

Anyone else experience this or is it more likely I have a virus or something?

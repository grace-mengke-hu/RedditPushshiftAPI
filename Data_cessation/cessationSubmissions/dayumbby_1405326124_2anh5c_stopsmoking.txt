Today's the day (story inside)

I just had my last cigarette. I am at rock bottom in my life, and I NEED to get out of it. 
I just had a horrible breakup, and I am absolutely convinced that if I'm going to fix my shit I need to first of all quit smoking. So, here I am. 

I have decided. I do not want to keep slowly killing myself anymore, I want to live. Smoking is disgraceful to my whole family and all that they've given me. 
For every 7 days I go without cigarettes, I am going to reward myself with something, equal (or slightly less) to the amount of cash the cigarettes would've cost me. 
Coming up is a cookbook with healthy meals designed for building muscle (yes, I love working out) :)

I wish myself good luck. Thanks for reading.

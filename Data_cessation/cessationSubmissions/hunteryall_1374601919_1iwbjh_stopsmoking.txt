keep at it. don't give up. don't worry about those OPs

I've been a pack a day smoker for about 6 years. On and off. I've tried to quit, last a month or more and then have an OP (other people's) or two. Then, like a rolling snowball, get to where I was bumming too many then I'd just buy a pack and smoke a pack again. I've done that same thing many times over the years. Twice this year in fact. 

I simply wanted to share my story for anyone out there dealing with this same situation. Don't beat yourself up when you have an OP, or buy a pack. Just keep your convictions strong and get back to them as soon as you can. I thought of it as black or white, failure (smoking) or success (not smoking). I was setting myself up for failure because I'd give up when I failed. It's so much more important to view it as a setback. That means you just get right back to not smoking again.

Anyways, I've been going strong for about 2 months. I use patches. I'm using the 2nd step or 14mg ones. I alternate days wearing one or not wearing one. It's definitely a struggle, but it gets easier.

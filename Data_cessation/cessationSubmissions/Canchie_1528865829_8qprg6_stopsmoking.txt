I’m in the perfect position to quit, should I????

So this past week I underwent jaw surgery;I’m 19 btw; and haven’t really felt the need to smoke a cigarette. My face isn’t going to be unswollen enough for at least another week where I will even be able to suck the air thru the filter. I went cold turkey without even realizing it and am in this weird position now. So I guess this is it. This is my opportunity to quit and part of me wants to take it. Physically I don’t feel the need to smoke a cigarette, but psychologically I do. I’ve only been smoking for about a year now and noticed that I’m smoking close to 10 cigarettes a day and am seeing how this is affecting my body. So I guess I do have every reason to quit. But like I said mentally when I think of quitting i think of missing those moments when you:
-Just had a big meal and smoke a cigarette 
-Driving on the highway, blasting music, drinking a Dr Pepper and smoking a cigarette
-your bored so you go outside to just smoke a cigarette 
-the cigarette you smoke before or after a stressful moment
These moments keep flashing thru my head. These moments where a cigarette is the little mint to top off the perfect day or the little relaxation to a bad one. I really don’t know what I expect to get from this. Part of me is hoping someone will say “hey your still young keep going, you can quit when your 30” but I guess I’m hoping someone can give me a wake up call.

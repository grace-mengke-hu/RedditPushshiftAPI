Strange triggers

So today a co-worker came back to work after being away for a year maternity leave.

Let it be known that this girl is a huge hypocrite, a confirmed liar, and a lazy ass who doesn't carry her own weight yet she is on my team and I have little to no choice but to grin and bear it. 

Her return has provoked a HUGE craving. Ok, it's not that HUGE, but I do recognize it as the way I dealt with people who exasperate me. It took me a little by surprise (the craving) but does go to show that there are still a few triggers to be confronted...and defeated. At this point, it's very much a mind game.

Have you had any unexpected triggers surprise you lately?

Reducing physical withdrawal symptoms

Sorry if this is a repeated thread. I searched a few different things and couldn't really find anything too helpful. 

My question I have for you is: are there any ways to significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms or the length of them? I'm currently in my first semester of college and have been doing well thus far. This past week (8 days without nicotine in total) I had been trying to quit smoking. Problem was I had the worst brain fog/headache imaginable and really couldn't do anything school related. 

Is there anything that has worked for you guys to lessen the symptoms when they come? Nrt, tapering off, ecig, etc?

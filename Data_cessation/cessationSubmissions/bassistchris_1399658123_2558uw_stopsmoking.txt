Day 4... I broke...

Hey everyone, I just wanted to vent a little. First, I'd like to say I'm new to this sub but congrats to everyone making the push! And thank you to everyone with their encouraging posts! Stay strong!!!

And on that note, I had my last cigarette Monday May, 5... Today has been my first day off from school and work and I broke down. I left the house just to buy a pack... 

I know I made it almost 4 whole days without smoking or vaping or anything but for some reason I just couldn't go without it today. I had two in the parking lot before I even got back in my car. 

I feel like a junky... I swear the high from a smoke after a week without was the best feeling I've had in a loooooong time. And now I regret it so much. I know I can't afford (health or financially) to keep smoking, and I've kicked "harder" habits before but smoking feels like the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.

Any words of encouragement are welcome. Sorry for the rant reddit, I just needed to get it out. Thanks everyone, and keep on keepin' on!

HEEEELLLLP!!! Read carefully...

I'm an easyway relapser, I've been smoking again for 5 months. I started again because I was freaking out about a tremendous amount of new responsibility at my job and I was feeling very overwhelmed. Stupid I know. 

In any case, I didn't really want to start again, felt like crap when I did, didn't enjoy it and now re-read the book and finished last night.

The first time I did it I was so happy to be a nonsmoker! I was ecstatic and overjoyed! I didn't crave them at all, I was happy to be free. Except right about that time I started battling MAJOR panic attacks. Like the kind that are very disruptive to a persons life. It took me about a week to connect them to nicotine withdrawal because as I already said I was so happy and no real desire to smoke.

Now here I am day one and I'm sitting in the same boat. Not wanting to smoke, nauseated by the idea but dealing with very disruptive panic attacks the likes of which I haven't dealt with in years.

To make matters worse: I am a mild agoraphobic and have a very hard time traveling on the best of days. One week from today I am supposed to get on a plane and be the best man at a wedding in ME. I was feeling pretty good about it but now all of a sudden I don't know how I'm going to survive.

I don't want to smoke, legitimately. But... I do want this to stop and I do want to be able to do this wedding thing without losing my mind (not trying to be hyperbolic, the idea of having to be on a plane alone right now is about as appealing as being waterboarded.)

SOS! Any and all advice! Help! Help!

Dealing with depression after quitting..

I feel like this will be a moderately regular subject heading into the holidays - a stressful &amp; emotional time for people. I significantly reduced my tobacco intake in October until November 1st when I stopped altogether. I do not have issues with craving cigarettes or tobacco normally in my everyday life. I am having huge issues dealing with a depression that already existed and was being coped with through nicotine. 

I now feel very conflicted on the use of nicotine and have been doing my own research to personally decide what is best for me but I still feel very confused. I am working through trauma and situational depression which has made taking medication for it not the right route for me as I am capable of functioning through whatever lingering depression I have most of the time. I have, for fifteen years, coped with high stress situations by smoking. It helped calm my mind and refocus on what was important instead of spiraling into a deeper and darker depression. 

So now I wonder, what is the difference between me going and being prescribed narcotics for anxiety or anti-depressants with unknown side effects vs taking nicotine in a different form? Could nicotine be as harmful as these medications can also be? I want to learn how to cope with my issues but I also don't want to be continually held back or pushed back from progress I've made because I can't cope and no longer have any coping mechanism.

Just wondering if anyone else has ever pondered these thoughts and what route they took..

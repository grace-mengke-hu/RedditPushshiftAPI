Today is the day I take control.

I have been smoking off and on since I was 19, I am currently 24 and tired of the way I feel after I smoke a cigarette. I have tried to quit in the past and have made it months without a cigarette.  I always fall back into it though, with the mindset that "oh one cigarette wont hurt me". So today is the day that I give up this awful disease for good.  I look forward to posting my milestones along this journey here, and look forward to the feedback that I will receive and the feedback I will provide.

Thank you everyone!

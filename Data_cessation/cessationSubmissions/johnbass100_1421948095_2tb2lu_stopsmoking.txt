Almost one year

I rarely visit the 'quit smoking' forum anymore but thanks to everyones help in the past.   
I am a few days away from the one year mark and while it has not always been easy, it does get easier as time goes on.   just never take another puff!

Money saved in a year:  $2,800 !!
health:  I feel SO MUCH better.
smell:  I no longer stink

Overview:  Why did I smoke for so long..........

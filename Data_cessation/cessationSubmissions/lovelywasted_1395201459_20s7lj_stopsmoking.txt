Withdrawal symptoms setting in.

So, I'm coming to the close of my second day without cigarettes, and so far here are my stats:

100% of the Monoxide is out of my system.
80% rid of the nicotine.
25 cigarettes not smoked.
14,760 seconds added to life expectancy.

So, these stats are already blowing my mind, especially since I already haven't smoked 1.25 packs of cigarettes in 2 days. However, withdrawal symptoms are starting to set in. I'm currently feeling extremely hyperactive, restless, and I'm breaking into a cold, clammy sweat right now. How have y'all dealt with symptoms like these, or any other withdrawal symptoms, and what is some advice you might have? Anything helps!

Also, it might help to note that I smoked for about eight years, about ten a day, give or take depending on my school and work schedule.

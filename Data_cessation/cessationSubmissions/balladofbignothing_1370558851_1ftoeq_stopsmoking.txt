EASY WAY to escape smoking.

Hello!
This is for anyone who is in the process of quitting smoking, is thinking about possibly trying to quit smoking, has already quit smoking, or are just curious as to why people smoke when it kills them. It is a short book - about 100 pages. In the introduction, the author, Allen Carr, explains how to read it for the full effect. 
I will tell you though that it is very proven to work with even heaviest of smokers, and the way it works is that it **dispels the brainwashed mindset that nicotine taunts you with through education on how it works.** 

It is an excellent read even if you have already quit smoking. It will keep you away from the nicotine trap.

I had read it last holiday after quitting but only up to about page 40, insisting that I was cured, only to find that recently, after moving to Florida, became stressed enough to think that smoking would help again. I was wrong of course, and gave this another read. Now I remember the horror of **the truth about nicotine**, and am making a set of flashcards so I don't forget again!

Good luck to you!

My Fiance is 4 days in

Hi all,

My Fiance is on day 4 of attempt two - yay for him!

I'm being as supportive as I can through this and thankfully the mood swings and general moodiness are subsiding. I know this will be a rough ride for us both.

He is aware i Reddit and of this subreddit but he isnt interested in Reddit. This seems to be waning a little day by day.

The reason I am posting is because im trying to put together some sort of pack/items together for if/when he needs them.

So far I have gathered: salt/tea tree oil for his ulcers, the allen carr book and vitamin B tablets (i read this helps?). i know its not alot but im trying.

Ive been keeping him as busy as possible outside gaming but hes struggling with concentration ATM so its all hit and miss.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

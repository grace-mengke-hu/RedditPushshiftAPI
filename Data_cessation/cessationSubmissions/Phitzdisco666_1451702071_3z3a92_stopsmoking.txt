Starting tomorrow!

It's my new years resolution but I decided to quit tomorrow and not today. I know that's kind of cheating, but tomorrow I'm going out all day with my family and Sunday I have a kids birthday party and a few other things going so I figured that it would be easier to start the journey with a lot of distractions instead of a typical day of stress. Here goes...wish me luck. Only had three today so hopefully that will make tomorrow a bit easier.

App with health benefits as you quit?

Hi,

I'm trying to quit and the thing that really motivates me is seeing how my body is recovering as I go longer without smoking.

I know quite a few of the apps list the things that is happening to your body as you quit but is there any that are better than others for this?

I'm on Android.

My life is a mess, but it's one without cigarettes.

The first days were absolute shit and I really really really wanted to smoke but I didn't and I am so fucking proud of myself. To all of you in the first week: HANG IN THERE! You can do it!

In the last 17 days I..  
... decided it will be time to tell the world I also like girls (and it scares the living shit out of me)  
... got drunk twice  
... had my ex telling me he always loved his best lady friend, even when we were together.  
... had 2 crazy deadlines  
... studied for finals  
... got in a fight with my fwb.  


AND I DIDN'T CAVE IN. Oh my god, I just needed to tell someone the whole story of the last 17 days. Keeping all this stuff for myself is horrible.

I also saved 50 euro! I'm gonna buy a new lipstick tomorrow, after I nailed my finals.

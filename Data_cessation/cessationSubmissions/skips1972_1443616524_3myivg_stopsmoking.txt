Stoptober starts tomorrow

* I hate wasting money on cigarettes.
* I hate constantly brushing teeth/eating mints and washing my hands after every one
* I hate planning my day around each cigarette
* I hate hiding it from my family
* I hate the smell of stale smoke, and picking up the cig butts from my garden
* I hate that I'm the only smoker in my circle of friends

* Mostly... I hate that I'll be the wheezing and gasping old dad playing with my son. He's 20 months now, and the absolute centre of my universe. I hate that I've probably already knocked years off my life through smoking, and that is time that I could have spent with my amazing little boy. I want to stop for his sake, more than mine.

I've smoked around 15 a day for around 13 years. I've thought about quitting before, but never lasted more than a day or two. This time is different. I WILL STOP.

I've got three cigs left in my current pack. I'll enjoy those tonight, and then from tomorrow morning the journey and struggle begins. I WILL STOP.

Most importantly,
Jack, my amazing son, I promise you - I WILL STOP!

* Edit - as suggested by someone, those last three cigs were ripped up and binned. No time like the present to start!

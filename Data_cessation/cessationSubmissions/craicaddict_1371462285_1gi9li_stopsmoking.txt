This is too easy.

I'm on my 90th day smoke free and my major concern is that this has just been too easy for me. I never have strong cravings, even while drinking or socialising with smokers.

I'm genuinely concerned that I'll just snap one day and smoke a full pack.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

Cold turkey or taper?

Made it 3 days off smokes and fell of the wagon yesterday. Have smoked a pack a day for 18 years with a 2 year break 10 years ago. I don't want to die early is the main reason I want to quit. But, vanity is in there, too, along with a relationship with a nonsmoker. Doing this FOR ME, but struggling to do it. Who has experience tapering and how did you do it? Any guidance is appreciated!

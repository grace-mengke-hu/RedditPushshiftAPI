The Pack: Did you throw it away or keep it around?

Successful quitters - did you keep the pack around or did you throw it out? For me, I "quit" numerous times by throwing away my packs, only to return to smoking after several days. 

This last time (and I consider this having quit for good), I left a pack on my countertop. It's still there in fact...

My reasoning was this: There will always be a pack of smokes staring back at me when I check out at the supermarket or when I pay for gas. Throwing away the pack wasn't going to make me want it less - I felt like I had to stare it in the face on a daily basis and say, "No... not today" until I finally stopped thinking about it.

Just thought I'd share my own story. I'm also curious what others have done and how your strategy worked out for you!

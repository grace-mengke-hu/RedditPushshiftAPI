Recently stopped smoking... depression..?

I stopped smoking for the most part about two weeks ago. For a while now I've been in a funk that I can't get out of. Nothing truly seems to make me happy, I have to fake a smile around my friends quite often, I've lost motivation in a big way. Could it have to do with quitting smoking?

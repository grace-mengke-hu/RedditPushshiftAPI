About 6 months in cold turkey and having random cravings to start again, advice?

Hey guys,

First off, thank you all for being such an awesome community.  I quit smoking about 6 months ago cold turkey.  A big part of it was because of Allen Carr's book completely echoed the sentiments I was having about cigarettes in general.   I hated being a smoker, and the only thing I thought about while I smoked was how much I hated it and needed to quit.  With that being said you would think it would be easy for me to stay committed-- however, in the past week or so I have had cravings to take it up again.  It is weird because in the past couple of months I've been through music festivals, house parties, and bars where I was either drinking or doing drugs and that entire time I was able to stay a non-smoker even while friends were chain smoking around me, even while I was drunk or fucked up.  But now, seemingly out of nowhere, I keep having this urge to start again.  I am aware that one cigarette = the resurrection of a retarded, **RETARDED** addiction, but for some reason my mind keeps toying with the idea.  I am still strong enough to keep resisting, but I fear my brain's ability to justify starting again.  It's a weird feeling.  I feel like I am in a game of tug-o-war.  I know I shouldn't and I know a lot of the responses are going to be of the "DUDE, DON'T DO IT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT!" nature.  But I just want to hear some insight/advice/experience on this feeling.  Even typing this out helps a bit, but I am still curious to hear your thoughts.  

Thanks again.

New quitter!

I don't know when it started why did i even start. I have been smoking like 4-5 cigarette per day from past 5-6 months. I never felt like i'm getting addicted. Now, that i realise this and want to stop completely. Today was my honest try to stop it completely. I just gave up and smoked 1 cigarette at last. I regret, i will not let this continue. I will restart from now. #FeelingHopeless.

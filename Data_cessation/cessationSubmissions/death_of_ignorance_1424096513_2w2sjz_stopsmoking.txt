Wanting to quit v.s. Needing to quit

I quit because I want to spend as much time as I can with my soon to be wife. I took Chantix and it helped and pretty much made me quit by the second week. Two horrid nightmares and I decided dealing with cravings was better than horrible sub-realities at night. My only advice would be to quit when you are ready, and to find a reason to live your life longer than it would be with cigarettes.

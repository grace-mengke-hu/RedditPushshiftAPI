Third day without NRT

 I can't believe I've gotten this far! I gave the remaining NRT stuff to my mother who has been smoking way less than she used to! I'm trying to encourage her to quit. She's proclaiming that this current pack is her last, so we'll see how that goes.

On the upside my body is pretty soon free of nicotine! I've also started coughing up crap now that I've quit nicotine. I thought it'd start with NRT too, but apparently I was wrong. I have also been way more energetic for the past few days which is pretty cool! I haven't really had too many cravings after I quit NRT, some situational cravings, but they've been easily dismissed. I do have to stay vigilant though, I can't allow myself to dwell on the thoughts of smoking, I'm still afraid that I might end up smoking if I let myself think about it too much.

On the downside. I have slept maybe four or five hours total since I quit nicotine. I'm used to insomnia, but this has just been weird, I'm not awake during the night, but I'm not sleeping either. I'm seriously hoping this will end soon.

No real point for this post really, I just wanted to share. Maybe you people who quit with NRT could tell me if your cough started during NRT or after like with me?

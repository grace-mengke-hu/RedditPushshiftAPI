Why not a hat trick?

So I'm currently enrolled in out-patient treatment for cocaine and alcohol addiction and have been sober now for 13 days. My mindset had been that I should continue to smoke to lessen the edge but when I woke up today feeling elated and grateful for the short progress I have made so far, I thought to myself, I would probably feel even more great if I stopped smoking as well. As luck or fate would have it, I only had two smokes left in my pack. I finished the last one not too long ago and I'm really pumped to continuing on this healthy living path. Best of luck to all of you!

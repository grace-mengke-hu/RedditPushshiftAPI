Blackout drunk and bought a pack of smokes after 64 days

Yep. Quit for over 2 months. Got drunk for the first time in months. Ended up blacking out and smoking a good amount of cigarettes. Having my last smoke as i type this out. Hopefully it'll go better this time. Still keeping my days just as a way to see how much money ive saved. Went from a pack a day to quitting cold turkey and have saved over 600 dollars.

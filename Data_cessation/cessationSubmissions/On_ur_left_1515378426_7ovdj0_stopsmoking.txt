Day 3

I haven't smoked in 48 + hours but I had a really low key weekend watching movies and putting together puzzles with my kids. I can tell my energy levels are low. But I can also tell it is getting easier to breath. I can smell more too. Let's get through tomorrow by not stressing out too much. I sure hope there aren't too many production issues.

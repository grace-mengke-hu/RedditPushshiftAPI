Best tips to last the distance

Hey!

I'm going to quit on Saturday. I'm moving to a vape first and as soon as I can afford it I'm going on a health retreat where I'm going to go cold turkey.I've smoked for 23 years (since I was 11) and have smoked 20 a day since I was 18. I've quit a million times before and maybe 3 times got to 4 months and started again.  I was always doing great and then out of nowhere I'd suddenly buy and smoke a pack. I think smoking serves a few distinct purposes for me:

First, I feel like I need a bit of delinquency /rebellion in my life otherwise I get bored - smoking provides that. Other outlets for this need are group creative projects and really good, mind-opening conversations but these can't be found predictably like fags. 

Second, I use smoking to deal with anxiety. 

Third, I use smoking as a way to literally suck up my emotions as I'm not great at expressing them or sitting with them. 

I really want to quit permanently and I'm nervous about failing. 

People who have successfully quit - what are your best tips? 

In particular, if anyone feels like smoking performed the same function for you as it does for me I'd love to know how you changed your attitude / what you replaced fags with. 

Also, I'd like to know how to prevent cravings before they arise and how to get rid of them when you start to feel them. 

Thanks in advance for your advice!

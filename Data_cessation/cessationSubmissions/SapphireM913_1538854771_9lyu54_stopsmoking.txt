Today is kicking my ass.

I'm 2 months and 6 days quit (8/1/18). I work 2 different part time jobs, and for those two months, I was working my other job, today's my first day back at this job (pizza delivery). This is my first delivery shift without a cigarette in 11 years. Even during other "quits", delivery days didn't "count" (yeah, I know, skip the lecture).

Started this morning on my way in, even driving to this job I felt odd not having a cigarette in my hand. I had two long deliveries for my first two runs, and on the way to both I went "oh good, I'll get to have a... Hold up...you don't do that anymore". Just got back from another long run and the person in front of me in the other lane was smoking, I could see it in her hand and again "that would've been a good run to have a cigarette".

This is the most I've thought about smoking since I passed 2 weeks. It doesn't help that errybody and their mothers smoke here, they schedule an extra person just so there's pretty much someone out on a smoke break practically all day.

I'm torn, because I used patches and lozenges to get through my quit. I've been patch free for 10 days, lozenge free for 8 days, and I know the physical dependence is gone... I don't want to reignite it. But I'm not sure how well I'm going to do white knuckling it for the next 7 hours.

36 hours in. Looking for motivating content.

I'm 29 and I've been smoking since I was 17.  I've quit a few times (one time I lasted 3 months before using a breakup as an excuse to start again), and I'm giving it another go.  My two sons, money, and my health are obviously great motivators, but does anyone have any videos or pictures that they use as quick reminders/motivators when they're feeling an urge?  I've tried the gum, cold turkey, and e-cigs to no avail.  This time I'm on the patch.  So far so good.  Thanks, and good luck

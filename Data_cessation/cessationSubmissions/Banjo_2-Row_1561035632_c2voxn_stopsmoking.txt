I “ran” my first 5k yesterday

I was one of the last to finish, but there’s no way I would have been able to do this 6 months ago. I’ve been going to the gym since I quit smoking and my wife is noticing a positive difference. I’ve lost about 10 lbs. and just feel better. Y’all stay positive and focus on results. If I can do it, so can you.

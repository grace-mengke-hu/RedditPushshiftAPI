Occasional vaping with friends made me develop a craving for normal cigarettes.

We've never vaped anything strong. Usually 6 or 3 mg. I thought that there's no way I will become addicted to nicotine. Oh boy was I wrong. I subconciously wanted more and more of that poison, I haven't even realised that I have fallen into a hole until today. What I want to say is remember that vaping is also extremely addictive and while it's healthier, in a long run it's still no good. Don't make the same mistake I did. Vaping is as harmful and people need to realise this.

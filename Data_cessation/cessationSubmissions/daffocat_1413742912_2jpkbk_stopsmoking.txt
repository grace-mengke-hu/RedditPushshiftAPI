Day 30. Reassurance is needed please that it gets better.

Day 30. I have put on a stone in weight. At times I am lost and miserable. At times I am happy. Please can fellow quitters reassure me that I am doing the right thing, that soon I will not crave a smoke and that it does get better.
Also tips for not eating my own body weight in food on a daily basis and how to motivate myself to exercise would be appreciated.

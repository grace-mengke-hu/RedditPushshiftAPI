Need some words of encouragement.

So I finally did it!!! 1/17/15 was the fateful day of my last cig. After 12 years and almost 2 packs a day.... 
But it's fu..ing tough. I read Allen Carr's book and while I admit the guy has amazing powers of persuasion and logic. I just felt so scared after reading, it took me a while to really take the plunge.
I haven't had a cigarette in 5 days. Cold turkey, no nicotine replacement whatsoever. I never thought I could pull that off.... lol. 
But yeah, I want to rip my head off sometimes.... At least once every hour lol. 
Did I do this right? Maybe I should have used patches, gum or something. I tried e-cigs before and they didn't work. Besides they seem counter intuitive if your goal is to kick the habit anyhow. 
Well, I'm sorry if I'm rambling. But thanks for reading anyways. I just want to keep my mind busy and focus on other things. I'll do my best to stay strong and determined. 
Great forum, just what I need ;-)

It's Day One. Excited and optimistic!

I finally listened to many of you, and read Allen Carr's EasyWay. 
I picked it up a year or two ago. I remember the revelation, undoing the brainwashing, and how absolutely wonderful it was to be free of cravings. 
But, I only read it halfway. And 13 days in, I thought "That was so easy. I'll have a few while drinking with my friends". And we all know too well how that goes. 

This time, I read the whole thing. I tagged important pages that will help me when my mindset needs redirecting. 
I can't thank this sub enough, I had never heard of this book. For years, we watch so many friends and family fight the addiction, and more often then not, fail. My Grandpa quit for 8 years before caving, and this book will be the next thing I hand him. I hope to pick up several copies this week to give to those smokers I love dearly. No one should suffer through this addiction, and ending it should be the happiest part of our lives.

Quitting as a social smoker.

I smoke maybe b/w 5-10 cigarettes a week. Mostly on the weekend when drinking and once or twice in the morning with coffee. I'm not properly "addicted", at least that's how I justified smoking to myself (the "I can quit whenever I want" mindset.) That being said, I've been trying to stop altogether for about two months, and it's been quite hard. How do you all stop the urge to smoke when drinking? It's hard because all of my friends still smoke and the temptation is crazy when I'm a bit buzzed.

I'm done

Been lurking in this sub for a while, but I've finally had enough. I smoked way too many cigarettes last night and today my lungs hurt, I have a headache, and I just feel gross. I can still smell the smoke in my hair. 

So, I'm done! I don't want to be a smoker anymore. It's SO GROSS! It's literally killing me! I'm going to go crush up my two packs I have and throw them away, then get in the shower, get clean, and emerge a new person. 

Here's to day one.

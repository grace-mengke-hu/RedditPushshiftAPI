Hour 52

Hey Cigarettes! Do you see that? 52 hours have now gone by and I haven't cracked yet. You were so sure I couldn't last a day, but now I am moving towards my 3rd. You held onto every moment of my life for the last ten years, but that is all over.

Yes, my head hurts, I am constantly covered in sweat and shivering at the same time. My heart thumps heavily in my chest as I think about the sweet relief you would bring. How a simple puff could alleviate all of my anxieties and make my dreams come true. But, I know that it's a lie. You're a two faced demon whose only goal is to drag down any who cross your path. Those who can't bear the burdens and need to escape. You promise relief, but bring a suffering even greater than what we want to escape from. Even if we don't notice it right away.

Hey Cigarettes, do you remember the good times? Because when I think back you aren't in them. You act like you were, but I remember laughter, singing, games, and activities. What I rememer about you is you taking me away from those things, so I could spend five minutes with you.

They say cigarettes shorten our lifespan by X number of minutes per smoke. Maybe they physically don't have a number, but they certainly rob us of time. Every single one robs us of another joke with our friends, or another song at the bar. They rob us of our productivity and our focus. They rob us of our taste, smell and sight. They promise us the world, while stealing it all away, until all we have left is them.

Hey cigarettes, do me a favor.. don't call again. I know that won't happen and even now as I cast my hatred towards you I still feel that burning desire for you. I know it will be a lifetime before I forget you, just like my first love, but that doesn't mean you are welcome to my future. 52 hours ago we broke apart and I hope if I can make 52 more years that that will have never changed again. Goodbye Cigarettes I won't/will miss you.

Is there an e-cig without nicotine or chemicals on the market? As simple as water vapor + mint leaf? Natural, organic and safe ingredients?

The reason I ask is because I'm thinking of quitting smoking again, I've done this a couple of times. 

I've been smoking for roughly 7 years 1-1.5pack/day.

2 years ago I stopped smoking, but started back up again in November of 2013 while on vacation. I kept telling myself, "just on vacation", but I was in full swing as soon as I got home.

When I quite last time, I quit cold turkey. Well, maybe not entirely CT, I do have a secret, I smoked a joint (well just a part of one) at the end of the day for the first 2 weeks after quitting. This really helped alleviate the desire to fill my lungs with smoke, sans-nicotine. I don't smoke weed at all anymore and would like an alternative this time around, just for the short term weeks. I've proven to myself it works well for me.

So, back to my question....

E-Cigs seem like a great solution, but I just don't trust them. I don't want the nicotine and I don't care for the chemicals. On the other hand though, I don't know much about them. 

What I'd really like is just simple water vapor...
Does anyone have any recommendations for an e-cig that is just water vapor, no nicotine/chemicals. Even better if they have flavors, but all natural?

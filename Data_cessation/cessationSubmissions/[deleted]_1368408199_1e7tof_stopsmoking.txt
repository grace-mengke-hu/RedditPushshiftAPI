It's like being reborn

I haven't smoked in 9 days and I can fucking **smell** things again. I never realized how insensitive my nose became after 5 years of smoking . It's almost overwhelming. I woke up and realized I could smell the freon from my air conditioner. I could smell that I put way too much pepper on my hash browns. This is awesome. I wanna go smell everything now. I haven't decided if things taste better. Maybe I'm imagining that part.
This is what I've been waiting for. Results. This'll probably easier than I thought.

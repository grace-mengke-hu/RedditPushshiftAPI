3 months

3 months, 90 days.

I don't know what to say, I used to be horribly addicted and never thought I could give up.

This subreddit has been a great help to me, I check in and lurk regularly.  Recently I have seen a lot of people asking if the desire to smoke ever goes away so I thought I would give my 2 cents.

My favourite cigarette was the first one in the morning, I looked forward to it when I went to sleep, as soon as I awoke I wanted it and couldn't think straight until I had it.

Today, 90 days since I stopped, cigarettes don't enter my mind when I wake up.  But this doesn't mean I never think about smoking.  You have to relearn how to live without smokes, every time you do something where you used to smoke and you don't it gets easier.  As an example, when I was a smoker and went to the cinema, as soon as I came out I would light up.  The first time I came out of the cinema after stopping smoking I thought about cigarettes and had a mild craving.

But each time you get through these situations without smoking it get's easier.  That's why I don't think about that morning cigarette any more, I have woken up 90 times without smoking and each time it got easier and easier.

I don't want to discourage anyone from giving up, but I would be lying if I said "yes of course it completely goes away within a few weeks".  When you encounter a moment where you would have smoked previously for the first time as a non smoker, you will likely at the very least be reminded of smoking, or have a craving.

Ultimately though it's all worth it, I have saved nearly 600 quid and feel much healthier, whilst I don't want to get complacent, I know as long as I don't smoke it will get easier and easier.

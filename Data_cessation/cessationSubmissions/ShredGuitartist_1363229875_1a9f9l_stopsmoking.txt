Quit Saturday Evening After A Long 10 Weeks Of Overtime.

I've quit before, but this is the straw that broke the Camel's pack. :D
For the 2.5 Months of 50-60 hour weeks I was smoking constantly and doing nothing but working and sleeping. 
    
Then last Saturday hit and I was out with friends. I felt terrible, emotionally, and physically drained. I then proceeded to hand over the rest of my pack to my friend, say goodnight to everyone, and cut out of the party at 8pm.
    
The next morning, I woke up, got on my bike, and rode 5 miles to the nearest grocery store. I have been working out and riding every day since. Taking it easy, but slowly pushing myself. It's working, I can tell, and the cravings aren't so bad.
    
I love the way you all encourage each other on and I think I really need to just write this all out, get it out there, and have a frame of reference, forever laid out on the intertubes to keep me going. I have a party to go to on Saturday and I know that will be the hardest part for me. But with your help I think I can do it. Just check this post whenever I feel an urge! If.

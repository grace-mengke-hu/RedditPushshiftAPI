College student who needs advice on quitting.

So last year, because of the stress that comes with being a student, I started smoking. About a month later I decided that I don't want to go down the same rabbit hole that both my parents are unable to come out of. So I bought a vape (won't say which because I don't want to be called a shill, but I'm a college student so its pretty easy to guess). 

I haven't touched a cigarette in 3 months now, the thought of it makes me sick, but my nicotine intake through my vape has definitely increased. I decided to quit vaping because 19 y/o is too early to ruin my life with an addiction. 

The problem is that if I don't hit my vape for an hour I start feeling really restless. After a day I become an unpleasant person to say the least, and it annoys both me and my friends. The longest I've gone is a week, but I couldn't concentrate on school, got really irritable, I would start twitching randomly, and was overall just in a really bad state. 

I've tried cold turkey, and it doesn't work. When trying to quit gradually I just fail because I sub-consciously pick up my vape and hit it before I even realize I've done it. 

Do you guys have any advice for me on quitting gradually and making sure I don't sub-consciously vape?

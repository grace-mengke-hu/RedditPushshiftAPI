Alright, tomorrow's the day

Tomorrow morning, I'll officially wake up a non-smoker. My last cigarette was at 7pm this evening. A quick history of me: I'm 24 and I've smoked 10-20 a day for the last 6 years. I started as just some angsty teen trying to prove his independence, but after trying to quit several times before, I'm starting to realize just how much I've given up to be a smoker. The money I've wasted, my good health that I've endangered, the people I've alienated. I'm done. I've used depression as an excuse to keep smoking for years now and I'm done with that too. I want to be better and make some positive changes in my life. I'm a little self-conscious posting my little rant here, but I want something to keep me accountable. I think I can really do it this time. After reading the posts on here for the last few days to get me motivated, I'm amazed at what a supportive group you guys have here and I hope you can help me take this step.

Edit: 24 hours in and I'm celebrating by going on a walk/jog and damn, my lungs are killing me!

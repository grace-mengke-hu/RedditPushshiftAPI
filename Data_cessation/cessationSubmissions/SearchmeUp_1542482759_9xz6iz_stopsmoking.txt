20 year old that is hoping to slow down on smoking my Juul and weed

Not sure if this is the subreddit that can help me but I’ve been constantly thinking of quitting. 
I have started my 3rd year of uni and ive come to realize that my mental and psychical health have depleted a lot as I continue smoking. I used to work out and really get school work done but I’ve realized that it’s been slowing down my motivation.  
I love smoking weed, it helps me once and a while but I know when I do my mind tells me that it was a a mistake and how I use the time after I smoke to do nothing. 
With the Juul, I smoke at least a pod a day. It’s making me lose money and the nic habit I’ve created is really hard to let go. 

Honestly I guess I’m here to see if you guys have any words or advice for me to start slowing down. I feel completely lost and my roommates aren’t the best help. Thanks.

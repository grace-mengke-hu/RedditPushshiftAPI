Had a dream that I smoked two cigarettes last night.

I remember feeling absolutely guilt ridden in the dream.  Shortly after I woke up, while I was still in that half dream/half awake phase, I was silently cursing myself.

Once I realised it was just a dream, and I still haven't had a cigarette for almost 300 days now, you can only imagine the kind of relief I felt.

Has this happened to anyone else?

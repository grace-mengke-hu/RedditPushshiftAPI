I hate weed

I say this to anyone out there who enjoys weed and it doesn’t affect your life, I congratulate you. I wish I could’ve been like you guys. Weed has made my life a living hell. I can’t focus on important things like school, family, friends. At times when I smoked weed I felt like there was evil in my heart and that there was evil in this world. Ever since I stopped smoking weed, my life became better. I am able to focus on myself now and I can focus on school, I exercise, play video games from time to time (occasionally), I can sleep peacefully without having to worry about anything. Life seems much better without it. I’ve become more confident now being sober. I wish I had never smoked weed before in my entire life. Weed can be harmless, so long as you don’t smoke weed every day. Instead you should only smoke weed if it doesn’t affect your life. From now on I quit smoking weed on July 14th, 2018. I hate weed. 

Leave any good comments (I don’t hate people who smoke weed, I hate the drug because it negatively affected my life)

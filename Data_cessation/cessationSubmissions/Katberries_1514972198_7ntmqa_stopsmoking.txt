I’m grieving the loss of smoking, and my sleep is awful

I’m on approximately day 9 of super reduced smoking. Some days I don’t have any, others I have one smoke. (It’s dumb but it just took me a while to be okay with quitting). Already my asthma has improved and my bronchitis is gone. Unfortunately, I’m miserable. I want to cry all day and actually slept most of the day all last week. Now I’m unable to get to sleep at night (I work 8am-5pm, and it’s 1:30am now). I’m unable to concentrate or recall information easily. Despite all the physical benefits of quitting, I’m so depressed. I have dealt with depression my whole life and it’s taken a toll on me lately. Smoking was something I did to cope. I’m alone with only one close friend (who’s usually too busy for me, and I feel like a burden). I’m so worried I’ll push through the grossness of a smoke and buy a pack.  Don’t mean to whine, I’m just feeling so weak. No amount of vaping (without nicotine) or nicotine gum has helped. It does feel like a grieving process. 
Any advice or similar experiences?

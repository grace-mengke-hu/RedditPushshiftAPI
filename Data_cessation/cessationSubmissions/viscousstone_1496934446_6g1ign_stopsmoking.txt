To Be Free

I choose to be free. 

Free from this "friend" who has done nothing but break the promise to support me

Free from this "friend" who has done nothing but poison me

Free from this excuse that prevents me from accomplishing all the things that I want to do

Free from this waste of my most precious resource - time

Free from the stench that follows me where ever I go

Free from a cough that makes my eyes water every morning

Free from the stains I anxiously try to scrub off my teeth every morning

Free from the anti-social behavior that comes from eeking out those moments to have a drag

Free from the financial burden this poison induces


Free from the feeling that the only way I can cope with my life is with a cigarette in hand

Free from the lies that this will be more difficult than it is


Free from the fear of running out of cigarettes

Free from the fear of being looked down upon for a filthy habit

Free from the fear that I cannot be myself without a smoke screen in front of my face

Free from the fear that I need some kind of prop to be able to express myself. 


Free from the mental weight of assessing when my next smoke will be, whether I should go for one now, since my
 next chance won't be for a couple of hours 

Free from the insanity of bundling up to smoke a wet cigarette in the middle of a blizzard

Free from the exceptional stench of smoking on a damp day

Free from trying to stop my dog from chasing my butts as I flick them away

Free from the embarrassment of identifying myself as a smoker

Free from the delusion that tomorrow will be easier



Free from the pressure from my family and doctors to "quit"

The freedom to read and write in the mornings with my cup of coffee

The freedom to explore how much more I can do in a day 

The freedom to define myself outside of a filthy addiction

The freedom to regain my sense of smell

The freedom to regain my sense of taste

The freedom to be immersed in the moment

The freedom to experience everything with friends

The freedom to take back my health


The freedom to honestly live my mantra of "feel the fear and do it anyway"

The freedom to recognize the only reason I hadn't quit before - was fear. 


Today is the day. This is the time.  Not one more puff. Not one time. 


I have overcome worse things in my life. 


It is easier to stop than to continue.

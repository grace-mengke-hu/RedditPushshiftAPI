Slipped up after good progress.

I had been doing really well, then last week, and again today without a thought I smoked with some friends who let me bum some cigarettes. I'm not really torn up about it, but is a bit demoralizing. Do any of you know of any good ways to keep yourself mindful, and not slip back into it without really thinking?

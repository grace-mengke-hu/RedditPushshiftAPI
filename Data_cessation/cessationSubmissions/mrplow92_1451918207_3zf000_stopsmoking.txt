New Year's Resolution

I am a 24 y/o M and I started smoking when I was 16. Eight years of smoking takes a huge toll on anyone but I realized it was absolutely time to quit. I had 5 cigarettes left at 11:45PM on NYE and I vowed (no matter how drunk I was) at Midnight that I would throw away the rest of my pack. I kept true to my word and I went to bed at 2-something with my last cigarette being at 11:57PM. It is now the 4th of the new year and I am proud to say I haven't had a cigarette. I got a vape to help ween my cravings and satiate my oral fixation (no homo) and I am even happier to say that I have not craved a cigarette since I quit. I tried quitting in the past but I was never in the right mindset and I constantly craved cigarettes even with a vape. If anyone is doubting that they can quit or they don't think they can do it, LEAVE THAT NEGATIVE ATTITUDE AT THE DOOR! Sorry for yelling but don't even get that sh!t in your head. You CAN do it. Anyone CAN do it. If I CAN, you CAN. Don't give up. Don't let a negative mindset bring you down. Stay strong.

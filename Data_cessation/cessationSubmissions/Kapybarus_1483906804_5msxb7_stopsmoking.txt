Quitting but this bothers me. Air is already toxic

I want to quite smoking for sake of my health but in big cities with all smog, pollution and exhalates from cars, mostly diesels, the air is already toxic for breathing. 

People are already dying because of this and they dont have much options what to do. 

Sorry for pessimism, this is just my quitting anxiety I use to have.

Trying to quit smoking, would substituting cigarettes with other tobacco products help?

I am trying to quit smoking (pack a day currently) and was thinking about using other tobacco products instead of smoking cigarettes for the first few days. Cigarettws are so much about habit for me, so I would like to redirect my attention from them without getting the really hard withdrawal. Is this a good idea?

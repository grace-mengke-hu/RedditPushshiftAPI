I am proud as ALL FKING HELLL!

Yesterday, we went out to see my sister's camper, her and her kid and hubs. I liked the camper and we went out to a campsite. I barely thought of smoking. Also, before we ever got that far, we were at the Walmart where triggers used to exist. Hardly any trigger yesterday. Starting to really dis-associate cigarettes with Walmart now. NOW I see progress.

Never had an urge to smoke yesterday. Now I feel closer to normal.

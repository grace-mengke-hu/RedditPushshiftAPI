I'm gonna be honest: I love rolling cigarettes, taking a break outside with friends who also smoke, lighting it, that first puff, and seeing the smoke rise...

...but fuck me do I feel full of regret and guilt right after it.

I started social smoking at 18, hated the taste but when I was drunk (first started drinking at 17) and on a night out with mates, I'd love taking a breather outsife the sweaty club, and lighting up with a friend.
Had some of the best conversations with people out there, especially over all the nights out in uni (where I first met a previous girlfriend too)...

Anyway...(apologies for the rambling) 

Progressed into a full smoker at 19 after a shitty breakup, and have since, been on and off.

At 24 I managed to not smoke a single cigarette for 9 months straight, but then this all changed at New Years, when I was drunk and chain-smoked like 10 / 20 rollies that night.
Now I'm 25, and I've just got back from a week's holiday in Greece (where I got through at least 40g of baccy in a week) and I feel like utter shit. I'm coughing, my chest has a faint ache from time to time, the back of my throat feels wheezy, and my fingers stink.

How do I stop, guys? My weaknesses are drinking, and being around my friends (band-mates, work, college) who also smoke. I just love rolling smokes, when I see others rolling a smoke it makes me want one, and you bet when I'm drunk I love to chain roll smokes.

I really want to stop, I get paranoid about every health condition going sometimes and know continuing down this road will only lead to an earlier grave than I already expect.

What tips / apps / strategies do you guys have?

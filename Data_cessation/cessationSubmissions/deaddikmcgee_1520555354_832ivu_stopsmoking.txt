Day 1 (Failure)

I wasn't able to quit cold turkey :) However, I only smoked a total of 1.5-ish cigs today. (I rolled a little tobacco in a couple joints) That's a marked improvement! I'd be at 6 or 7 by now. I have no urge to smoke another one so I think I'm good for the rest of the day.

I'll make a deal with myself-- if I make it the full day tomorrow without any tobacco, then I won't reset my badge :)

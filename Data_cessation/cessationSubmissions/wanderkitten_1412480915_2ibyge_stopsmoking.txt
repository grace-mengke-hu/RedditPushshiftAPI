please help me I am feeling so sick?

i've been smoking cigarettes for a long time..about 4 years. I'm 20 now, I went on a date with this boy yesterday and we smoked so much till we got sick. A pack and a half together, and one pack was one of those packs were those popping menthol packs. anyways i can't even sit up straight now, i have a fever, and i just took my patch off.
 
i work as a line cook, full time, as a 5 foot 2 girl.. it's really physically tiring and i don't even know how to feel better for work tomorrow. i feel so nauseated and i want to vomit

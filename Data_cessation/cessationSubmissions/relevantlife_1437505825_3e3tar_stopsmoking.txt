Not sure what my flair says because I'm on mobile, but I'm 64 hours smoke free. Cravings are for real.

Haven't had a cigg since Saturday evening, but the cravings are intense. 

I was with a friend earlier, asked if I could bum a cigg, she said yes, had it in my fingers, then I put it right back in her pack. It was very hard. 

My mouth waters when I think about a cigarette. It's like fucking food and that drives me nuts because it's terrible. 

How long until some relief?

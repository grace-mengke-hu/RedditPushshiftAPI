Failed again!!! Relapse on day 10

I don't know what to do anymore. I keep failing over and over and over again. It's been one month and three weeks since I first quit, and I've had three relapses, It's been stress, anger and sadness, the three emotions that have made me relapse. I don't know how to handle negative emotions without lightning up. I don't want to have to go through the withdrawal over and over again. 
I just re-read Allen Carr for the fifth time two weeks ago. I know cigarettes don't calm me down and fon't fix my problems, but for some reason I can't stop myself during those difficult times. 
Any advice?

NO MORE SMOKING

OK  I used to not smoke started smoking when I got married to my husband. He was a smoker and I was curious! What did he get out of those long white sticks with brown tops...lol so one day I picked up a cigarette and tried it I coughed, and screamed bloody murder it burned my chest! that was the first time I tried again and my friend warned me. Don't start smoking its the worst thing I could have ever done! Me not paying attention started smoking for real and that has been almost seven years and now I am Tired of it the way it smells the way they taste and being ashamed of holding a cigarette. I have seen 3 people die in my family. I want to stay around long enough to raise my kids and see my grandchildren one day. so on this journey I go its day 1 no cigarettes.

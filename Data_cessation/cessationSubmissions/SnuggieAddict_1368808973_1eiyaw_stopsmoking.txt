When will the anxiety subside?

So, being a nonsmoker is awesome. I think about smoking less each day.
Problem is: I have a treated general anxiety disorder. Usually taking 75mg of zoloft and 0.25 klonopin. 
Ever since I quit my anxiety levels are higher. Not crippling or scary, but uncomfortable. I have mini-panic attacks and a general feeling of being hyper-aware. I sent an email to my pdoc telling her I quit smoking and she's super proud, but told me to let her know if I feel bad.

So, I wonder - is it normal? When will it go away? Given my disposition to anxiety, should I talk to my pdoc about increasing dosages or just treat it as a normal period of stress and ride it out?

100 Days. I have saved $1000 on not smoking Cigarettes over that time and not smoked over 4000 Cigarettes.

Was 2 pack a day smoker.  26 years old. Always thought I would quit.  Never really tried.  Got sick and now those are some big numbers.  It's the little things that add up. Good luck everyone.  Trust me when I say you can do it.  You really can.

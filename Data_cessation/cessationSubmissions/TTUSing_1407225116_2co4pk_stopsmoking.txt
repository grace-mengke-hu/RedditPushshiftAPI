Day 2

I have now not had a cigarette for 1 day 17 hrs and 23 mns... So I am on day 2 :)

Funny thing, I expected today to really really suck but for some reason, I have felt fine.  I was around co-workers as they smoked outside and felt no desire to smoke.  I haven't really had any cravings.. I don't know what it is.  It is just... weird and not what I was expecting.  Especially given that I have tried many many times in the past and have been smoking 1-2 packs a day for 14+ years.  

Anyone else ever had this experience?  I am fully expecting many hard and shitty days ahead where it will take everything I have not to smoke... but today hasn't been one of them for some reason.  I feel great!

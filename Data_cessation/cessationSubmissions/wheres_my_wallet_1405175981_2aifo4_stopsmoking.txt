My first day starts today

I have finally decided the try and quit (again), and this time I think the reddit community might be just what I need to see it through.

I have been smoking for 7 years since I was 18, and have quit on and off for a couple months at a time so I know it is possible. My reasons to see it through this time are because:  

1. I love going to the gym and exercising, but I have found that I have trouble breathing which is really holding me back  
  
2. I am finishing my degree in Genetics and want to continue a master's in the field of cancer. I have learned a lot working in labs about cancer and it is really something I don't want to have to experience.  
  
3. My long-term GF and I are going to be getting married in the near future, and I really want to start a family (and actually be alive/not sick when we have kids/raise them).  
  
What has worked for everyone in quitting? I am just going cold turkey, which is pretty difficult but I have done it before. I figure I have some pretty solid motivation to see it through, so I have a good feeling about doing this.

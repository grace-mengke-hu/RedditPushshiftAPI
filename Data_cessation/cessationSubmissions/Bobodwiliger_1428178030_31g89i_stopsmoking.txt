Hiding smoking from spouse

I smoked for a long time. I quit and then started again. My spouse thinks I am still quit. He will probably freak out as he is very against. I am thinking of telling him the truth but scared. Partially for his response but also it will make it harder to continue sneak smoking. Does anyone have experience hiding the habit from an SO? PS I do want to stop. But we just had a baby and I'm even more stressed now. Don't really know what I want from posting this, I'm just all over the place.

I made it!! Year #1 Down yeehaw!!

So...
This time last year I decided to quit smoking after 40+ years,
Believe me, there were many times I thought I was going to cave. But with the help of all the great people in this sub-Reddit, the smoke free app and Allen Cars Easy way to quit smoking, I can say that I am a non smoker and seldom think about smoking..
The odd time out of the blue, an urge will hit me, but any thoughts of the gratification of smoking are greatly outweighed by the benefits of being a non smoker. I must admit that it took about 3 months before I had my emotions under control, so for anyone struggling what seems to be a never ending battle..hang in there... One craving, one day, one week, one month and before long you will have won the battle. It really is worth all the unpleasantness you are dealing with now. I don't cough anymore, I don't smell like smoke and I don't have to expose myself to all kinds of ugly weather, etc., etc., etc., for that nasty nicotine fix.
So...with the money I have saved I am going to treat myself to a nice dinner out with hubby and some friends. I've already enjoyed a vacation and a few new clothing items and best of all..I am setting a better example for my grand children.... Good luck all you new quitters...hang in there, because it's not what you are giving up when quitting, it's what you are gainingðŸ˜Š

best options for quitting

Hi All!

First of all awesome job to all of you for quitting! I have tried a few times and a few methods to quit. The patch: allergic to the adhesive. Chantix: bad side effects. Lozenges/gum: couldn't find the right dosage, too weak didnt help, too strong made me sick. Ecig: still have it but it was no help, like a novelty.

What are some ways you are all are most successful? I am pretty sure I am ready to quit but it is also kinda scary to quit. I know continuing to smoke should be what scares me as it will kill me but I am more scared to quit.

Thanks for your help guys!

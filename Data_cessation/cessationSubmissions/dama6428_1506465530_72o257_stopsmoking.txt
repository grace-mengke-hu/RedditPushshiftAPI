How to Quit While Surrounded By Smokers?

Hi. I’m a pack a day smoker and really need to quit. I’m not having any negative health effects yet, but I know I will in the future. I live in MA and the cigarettes here have become way too expensive, so that is my main reason for quitting. I’ve tried and failed many times because I’m surrounded by smokers. I work at a group home and I have to take the residents out to smoke... it’s torture while I’m trying to quit!!! All of my coworkers smoke and all of my friends smoke. I can’t escape it. Any advice on how to quit while being surrounded by smokers? Thanks in advance.

I quit smoking 10 years and one month ago...

Just thought I'd share my success story. I smoked for about 12 years. Put down my last cigarette in November 2006. Honestly, it was one of the hardest things I ever did. It took me about 5 years from the time I started wanting to quit to the time I actually stopped. (But I did manage to drastically cut down on smoking before I fully quit.) 

But, I eventually got there and I'm so glad I kept at it. It sounds silly, but I'm really proud of it. Weirdly, I regard it as one of my biggest achievements. 

The health benefits were immediate and amazing. They got progressively better the longer I didn't smoke. Today, 10 years on I'm in great shape fitness-wise. My lungs have returned to normal. I cycle, walk for miles and play sports. (As a smoker I did nothing but drink and play video games.) It's so nice not to feel like an ashtray every day. 

If anyone is thinking of going back to cigarettes - don't! It's the biggest scam on earth and it's literally killing you. There are better things to do with your time and your money. 

If anyone has any questions or wants to know more about how I stopped smoking, shoot.

can’t believe im even saying this but

honestly, i never thought i might be addicted. i’m 18, i smoke about 3-4 cigs a day. im also a huge hypochondriac and my newest worry is my throat and tongue fucking up, possibly because of cigarettes. or at least cigs don’t make the current slightly infected state better. anyways, i stopped smoking for a week. or at least i told myself i would stop. and i realized, i can’t. i just don’t want to. i never thought it would be like this, but smoking just makes me feel happier? and idk, i guess i’m writing here to ask if i should really not smoke a single cig this WHOLE week or if a week pause wont help my health anyways. i really dk, just let me know ur thoughts.

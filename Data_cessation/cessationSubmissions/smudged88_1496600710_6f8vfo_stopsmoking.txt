UGHHH!....again

So in the last two weeks I've "tried" to stop smoking like 6 times at least....BUT I'm done! I cannot feel like this anymore. I'm hoping stopping smoking will give me some more energy I'm not even 30 years old and I am tired, out of breath and seeing lines on my face, not to mention the crazy anxiety. This has to be it. I'm wondering how long until some of this improves after stopping?

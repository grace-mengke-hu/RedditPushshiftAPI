Advice for tapering/quitting

Hi all - I am a high school senior who has been smoking throughout this whole school year rationalizing to myself that it helped me brush off stress. For the most part I limited myself to two or three cigarettes a day and promised myself I would quit as soon as I graduate.

Well, graduation is in two weeks and I am starting to get myself ready to kick this habit. I was wondering if anyone has advice to pass along about quitting effectively and lastingly. Thanks a bunch!

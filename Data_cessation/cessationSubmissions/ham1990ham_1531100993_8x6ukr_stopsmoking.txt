Day eight, not so great.

I quit 8 days ago, cold turkey. I read Allen Carr’s easy way and was feeling very good about it. However,  when I did quit, I was really worried about enjoying drinks and not smoking. So I hadn’t been drinking. Last night I decided to have some beers with friends (who all smoke) one of them said he would refuse to give me a cig if I asked. Well he went to bed, and I cracked. But I haven’t smoked at all today / I haven’t felt the need or want to. I just feel so guilty about having one. I’m nervous that this will happen anytime I want to have a drink or a few. Any tips or advice???

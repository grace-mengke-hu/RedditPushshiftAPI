Day 46 is halfway over, and I haven't smoked again

Bf really laid into me verbally last night, I didn't get much sleep and felt pretty shit all day.  But, I didn't smoke.  I went to work, pulled a 12 hour shift, worked out, and didn't smoke.

I read articles.  Cried.  Ate junk food.  Vented to a friend.  Took care of my dog.  But I didn't smoke.  

I had nicotine lozenges, made sure I didn't overdo them.  I'm going to bed alone after finding out my bf spent his night last night with a girl he's hoping to hook up with, flirting, drinking, and who knows what. 

But I did not smoke.

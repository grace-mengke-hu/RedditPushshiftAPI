Day 47 and started C25K!

Quitting smoking was so much easier this time around. I've quit a bunch of times before, one lasting 6 months and others lasting two weeks or a few days.

This time has felt good from the start. 

I've been going through a few problems on the side; company I work for going bankrupt, breaking my collar bone, having my first panic attack in 6 years (completely unrelated to quitting smoking). None of these things made me even think about lighting up.

All the physical withdrawals were gone by day 4 or 5 and since then I've been free.

I started running to prepare myself for  C25K and I just finished W1D1 this morning. I'm super excited about my health for the first time in years.

Keep up the great work everyone! Not one puff ever, and drink lots of water!

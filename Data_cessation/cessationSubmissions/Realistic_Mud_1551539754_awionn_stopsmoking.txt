Day 85

I've started to get disgusted by the smell of cigars. This old man that lives with me smokes these cheap cigars called double diamond. They are so disgusting. They are not even a proper cigar, it comes with a filter, and looks like it was taped on. I used to smoke them because they are 30 dollars a carton.

Anyway, I'm on day 85 still on 14 mg patch and still chewing the nicotine gum. I find that I am irritable and anxious without my nicotine gum. I know the next step in becoming nicotine free is stop chewing the gum but Im struggling to stop chewing it. Anyway thats about it

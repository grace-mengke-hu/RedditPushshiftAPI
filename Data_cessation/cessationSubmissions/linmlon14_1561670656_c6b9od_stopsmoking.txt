Stop smoking while your partner keeps smoking?

I want to quit but my partner isn't ready, we live together. Whenever we smoke we talk about the day and other things, it's very social for us, I just don't know how to stop while he continues and still feel like we are close. Has anyone quit and had a live in partner who hasn't? Tips, ideas, wisdom?

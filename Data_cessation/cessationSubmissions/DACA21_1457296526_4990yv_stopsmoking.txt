Quitting Smoking with Mental Health Issues

Got out of very emotionally abusive relationship and met someone new which prompted me to quit... However I'm still in a bad place in life due to other factors and Mental Health issues. Back when I started smoking it started as using the cigarettes to burn/self harm myself which I switched to smoking them as my coping mechanism, now I'm worried if things take a dip I'll lose my progress or worse self harm again. 
Any tips to avoid this happening when I feel triggered?

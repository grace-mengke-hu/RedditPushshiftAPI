No coughing, no phlegm.

I was a heavy smoker for 14 years. I smoked a pack a day for more than a decade.

I quit 26 days ago and read a lot here. People talked about the coughing and the phlegm. I did not experience any of this! Is this a good or a bad sign? Will my lungs clean themselves any other way?

Super Happy Doctors

You know what's liberating?  Being able to tell your doctors that you quit smoking.  It doesn't matter if you've been lucky enough to avoid a major smoking related disease or if you're sick already.  Tell your doctor that you quit and see how happy they get.  On the social history box on medical forms, I love checking the 'smoked, but quit' box.  As of right now, I haven't smoked 1,085 cigarettes. People, that is well into five cartons of cigarettes.  All in less than 45 days.

I'm back after months of screwing up. Made it 4 months last time hoping to knock it out this time.

Blablabla. All the excuses you've all heard and said before. I'm among people that know there's no story I can come up with to excuse my falling off the wagon anyone could take as legitimate. Now I'm back. A little less gung ho and lots more humility. Wish me luck in this attempt.

HERE WE GO AGAIN...Day 0

Hola!

I have quit smoking many times before, always cold turkey. I need to quit because I can't afford it (I'm on Medicaid, that's how poor I am), and I also hate being attached to cigarettes, especially when I work.

I am on bupropion for depression, so hopefully that helps my withdrawl and/or cravings. It has before. Also, I'm planning on getting really into brushing/flossing my teeth and chewing minty gum, that has helped in previous quit attempts. Moreover, I'm just gonna try to stay busy, do a lot of chores (that always helped me feel simultaneously productive and takes my mind off smoking), be hygenic. Also, this subreddit has always helped me immensely.

I just smoked the last cigarette in my pack 15 minutes ago. GOING COLD TURKEY! The next 3-5 days may be a wild ride. The next hour is gonna be a wild ride, hell. 

ANY COMMENTS/SUPPORT VERY MUCH APPRECIATED! THANK YOU!

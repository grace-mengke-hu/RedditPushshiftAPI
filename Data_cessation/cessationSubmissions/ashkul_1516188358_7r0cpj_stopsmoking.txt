Got terribly upset...

Had a major argument at home, got a rage... Went to market to buy cigarettes but came back from the shop. Had another round of rage and went to the market again and bought 2 cigarettes. 

Came back home and was about to go to my smoking place on the stairs, but instead broke the cigarette with all my might (not sure what to do with the new lighter now).

 Feeling good for not giving up but I hope my mood gets better soon.

Late night reddit browsing, just came by to check my days quit.

cant believe its been 392 days. I owe a big part of my success to this sub and the people in it. Haven't been around that much because I feel like Ive really just kicked it. The temptation to smoke comes around every so often but I just look at how long Ive came and a couple drags of satisfaction isn't worth the time and effort and pain Ive gone through to kick. Good luck to all still struggling, and thanks again to this sub and all the people in it.

This may be lame

I have not smoked for a week now.  I'm not sure,  but have probably been smoking for 10+ years. I'm a "regular" smoker but have been wanting to quit for years. Lately i usually only smoke when I drink ( 1 every day) . It has been up to a pack a week at some times. I went on vacation recently with no digs and don't feel a craving.

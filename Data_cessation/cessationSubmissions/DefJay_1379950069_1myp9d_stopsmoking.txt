Quitting smoking would be so easy, if it wasn't for the cigarette after the meal what is irresistible! HELP!

Do you have any tips on how I can stop smoking? My biggest problem has been not smoking after eating! Is there a way to get the same feeling after the meal or simply forget about smoking?

Thanks!

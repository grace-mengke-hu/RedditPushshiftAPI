Quit smoking about 3 months ago and switched to ECig and quit that too however...

I have quit cigarettes and do not miss them at all. However, I switched to a Juul E Cigarette to help me off the nicotine addiction and quit that too but can't really say I quit per se. My friends have Juuls and every so often when I'm with them they will let me hit them. My question to you guys is will this fuck me up and make me crave nicotine again just as bad? Like if I don't smoke an E Cigarette for a month and then take a few hits from my friends will that nicotine addiction/withdrawals come back the same as one I originally quit?

I need help. 

I "quit" 2 months ago. Only thing is I haven't quit at all. I've started sneaking. I hide it from my partner and everything. What's worse is I smoke more now because I only have short privacy windows!!! 

Jesus Christ guys!! :-( I'm such an addict. 

Is that Allan Carr book all it's cracked up to be? 

I'm so ashamed.

Struggling at the moment.

I really want a smoke. Been fighting with the woman all day which is one of the times where I would go for a walk and smoke. I'm a non smoker now so what the fuck do I do? I've been contemplating on and off for about an hour now about how I'm going to get a cigarette. 

Ok, after writing that I feel better. Only want a little smoke now ;)
I'm not going to break. The pain from the first 3 days is not worth any imaginary pleasure I could get from one cig.
Thanks for listening guys.

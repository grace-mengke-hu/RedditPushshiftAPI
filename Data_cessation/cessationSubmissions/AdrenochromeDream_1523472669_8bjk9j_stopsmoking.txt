Brown Mucus on Waking Up

Hey folks! I quit smoking about two months ago, after ten years of a pack a day. The last few weeks I've been waking up with an awful taste in my mouth and when I go to the bathroom and spit, I'm seeing immense amounts of mid-to-dark brown mucus. No cough throughout the day, no pain, just gross shit in the morning. Thoughts? Is this normal? Should I see a doctor?

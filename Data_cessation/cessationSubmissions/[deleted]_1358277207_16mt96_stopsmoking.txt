I want to thank you guys honestly from the bottom of my heart!

It has only been 6 days, but my life has literally made a 180 (360 you end up where you start right? aha)  I was doing my weekly budget and paying bills when I realized my husband and I will be saving over $800 a month and ~$600 is because of smoking, the other $200 is because of my POS car breaking down, which caused me to cancel insurance and obviously eliminates gas.


My husband and I have not been on vacation together before, that includes leaving our province. So we both decided to book a vacation for the summer, and he said it is up to me where we go. Without all of your stories and encouragement I would have broke down and begun the dirty habit again. I honestly feel refreshed now that I have stopped, even if it's only been for 6 days. To me it feels like years!


I want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart, you honestly do not know how much I appreciate it! You guys opened my eyes and shown me how much better my health and body is without it, and you guys also opened my eyes to show me that I can now save a shit ton of money. Which comes to my next point, since you guys helped me along this way, I need help picking out where to go on vacation. Any suggestions?


Thank you all you wonderful people!


**TL;DR:** I love you all, where should I go on vacation.

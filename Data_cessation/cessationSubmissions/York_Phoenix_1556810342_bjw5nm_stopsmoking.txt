Not smoking but dip, why am I having cravings 60 days after quiting?

I know dip isn't the same as cigarettes but given the nicotine, I imagine the withdrawal symptoms are the same. When I first quit, it was a straight up cold turkey situation. I just lost interest and dropped it like a penny after I finished my last tin. I had zero effects after that.

Now two months later? I'm having legit cravings. I think about the feeling, the flavor, the good times, and I resist the urge to buy a tin against every screaming urge in my brain.

Why is this? Why am I seemingly experiencing worse symptoms 2 months later rather than the first week?

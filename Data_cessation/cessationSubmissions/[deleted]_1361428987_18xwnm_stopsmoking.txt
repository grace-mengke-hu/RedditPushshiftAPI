Well here I go.

I've tried many times to stop and a month ago stopped for five days before girlfriend stress got me back on. It makes me feel like crap physically and mentally. I just started the insanity workout (at the age of 40) three days ago and it's kicking my ass. I'm hoping it helps motivate me to stop. I can go all day at work without but when I get home I majorly crave. It's important for me that this time I stay with it. I MUST. So I just puffed one last one to remember how it hurts, tastes like crap, and does nothing for me. The imaginary treat if you will. Wish me luck brothers and sisters as I go into battle now against myself.  Good night.

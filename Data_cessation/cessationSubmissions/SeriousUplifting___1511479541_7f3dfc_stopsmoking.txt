I think I finally made some progress but..

Hi everyone, 

Just wanted to share my success and challenges with quitting smoking. Its been exactly three months. I also quit drinking and I workout everyday now. Quitting smoking helped me gained some of my breath back! I lost 50 lbs this year and I got on a meal-prep meal and I’m working with a personal trainer but lately I’ve been getting a very strong urge to smoke again. 

How do you keep your mind off it? Does anyone have a similar experience of staying away? I took a few hit of a vape yesterday when I really felt like smoking cigarettes. 

Shoot me with your advice.

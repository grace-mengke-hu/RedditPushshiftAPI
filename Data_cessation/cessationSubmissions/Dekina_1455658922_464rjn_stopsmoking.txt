Maybe saved my life sooner than I thought.

So I am close to my second week. Already after the first two days, I had some problems with my skin acting up, and an old piercing getting infected.  

Or so I thought, at least. It turns out, after a trip to the ER, insane amounts of antibiotics and pain killers, that it might be something completely different. It appears to be inflammatory breast cancer.  The reason it flared up so quickly, is actually because I stopped smoking. Already on day two, my circulation was improving. This means that the cancer cells that hide around the milk duds, and blocks them, becomes more obvious. It is not just because I have poor circulation, but my body figures out that something is actually wrong. Lymphs swelling up, fluid building up, all kinds of awful things happening in rapid tempo.  

But it got caught early. This means that I'll be fine. If I hadn't stopped smoking, it would have taken a lot longer before I would have figured out something was wrong, and then I don't know where I would be. All final results will be in by the end of next week. I am hoping, but not expecting anything but the worst.  

And still, in all this mess, I thought of smoking once or twice. Nasty little bugger, that addiction. Kicking really does save your life. Maybe in more ways than you expect. So please keep going.

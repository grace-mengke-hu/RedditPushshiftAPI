Drank Friday and Saturday nights still nicotine free! 5 days 20 hours 42 minutes.

I never imagined that I would be able to go out, drink, be around smokers and not smoke. It feels really good to achieve. I have never drank without smoking until this weekend. I was so happy Friday night when I got home and hadn't had one puff. I did chew on straws but no cigs!

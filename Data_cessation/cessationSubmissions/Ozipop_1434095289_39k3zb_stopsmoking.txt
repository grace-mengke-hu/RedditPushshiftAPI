One Day At A Time

Feeling great this time around for the most part. I just did nine days without smoking, smoked for four and here I am going strong again with another four smoke free days.

I quit drinking 3.5 years ago and I am still fine and dandy with the one day at a time idea, I can't possibly worry about drinking tomorrow, sobriety today is good enough for me. 

But for some reason the idea of never smoking again is very daunting. I know I am supposed to feel liberated that I don't have to poison myself anymore, but jeez it feels like all of eternity is barring down on my every moment. 

I guess the hardest part is that I just want some time to pass quickly so that at least I will have some 24 hours under my belt, but I hate the idea of wanting time to just pass by. Life is so short and precious I feel like a fool wanting to just wake up 5 years from now a definite non smoker.

Anyways, thank you all for your support and your posts, I really do reach out for them when I'm getting stressed out.

Newly Quit - Any advice?

Smoked my last cigarette late Sunday night. Been smoking on and off for 15 years.

Withdrawal not too bad at the moment, but chest and back feeling a little uncomfotable.

Does anyone have any tips to alleviate the inevitable withdrawal / side effects from not smoking. I'm determined not to start again, but reckon I've got a good couple of months of discomfort to deal with before I'm comfortable with the change.

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

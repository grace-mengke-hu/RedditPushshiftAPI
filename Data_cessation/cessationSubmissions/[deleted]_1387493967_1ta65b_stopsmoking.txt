For the love of...ARRRGH having to reset my dag-gum badge AGAIN

Please excuse this rant but I am beyond frustrated right now. I have been stuck (medically) in my home for more than 7 months now, (apparently what I have is very rare), my household went completely unexpected from a two person income to a one person income, I am having to helplessly watch the most wonderful man shoulder all burdens and almost every where I turn, it seems the world is hell bent on stealing my "happy". I am doing everything in my power to remain positive as my "happy" is very important to me, but it is wearing me down.  On my last attempt at quitting smoking, I broke out in hives head to toe. (It is part of my medical thing) Doctor said that I need to keep stress down and trying to quit smoking is stressful. So I don't know what the heck to do. But I keep working on it and keep on trying. I have been spending a lot of time on Secret santa as it is helping me stay positive, but I am beginning to wonder if I should hold off on trying to quit for just a little while. Has anyone else run into medical complications that are made worse by quitting? If so, what did you do?

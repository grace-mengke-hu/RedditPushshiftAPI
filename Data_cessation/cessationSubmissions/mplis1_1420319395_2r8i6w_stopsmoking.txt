Happy with my decision

Today I spent 40 minutes cleaning up 6 months of cigarettes and a few years of ash off of my balcony.. I used to use wine bottles, beer bottles, anything really as an ash tray. The recent windstorm managed to break these leaving a mess everywhere.. After having ash blown in m face, my eyes stinging and my nose stuffed up I am thankful that I never have to do this again!

I'm done with it. Day one. So far so good.

The withdrawal I can live with. In fact it's hardly noticable most of the time. My main concern is this: as a musician there are a lot of situations that I have strongly associated with smoking over the years. Rehearsal, (driving to) gigs, playing in bars, festivals, etc, etc. This conditioning will be the hardest to break. At least our drummer also quit some time ago and our bass player doesn't smoke... So the non-smokers are the majority now!! 

Anyway... I think this is a great subreddit. Nice to know you're there.

So today was rough..

Today was a stressful day, really stressful. At the end of it I found my self sitting with an UNLIT cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other. I was so deeply in thought I subconsciously lifted the lighter to light the cig then my friend saw me on his way home and came up to me and took the cigarette and crumpled it and threw it all over the ground. (He did this while he had a cigarette in his mouth which was wierd)

Tl;dr: I'm proud of my friends.

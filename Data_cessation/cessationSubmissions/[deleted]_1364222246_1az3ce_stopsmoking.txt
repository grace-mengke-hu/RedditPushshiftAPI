In control.

I smoked for the last 10 years of my life. When I stopped smoking my biggest fear was alcohol. After the first sip of beer the urge to light a cigarette would sky-rocket through my brain and force me to leave birthdays/friends/bars/partys or suffer horribly until I couldn't stand it anymore. Now after 50 days for the first time I feel safe and in control of things. I had quite a rough weekend in terms of partying and drinking and I still want to smoke at times but its not painful anymore. The absoluteness of the urge has gone and it feels like the nicotine monster has lost its bite. I can't even imagine me smoking again. Made me smile the whole day. The tools I deem the most important on my way to erase the cigarette completely from my mind, are patience, my smoke-free-app, chewing gums and this subreddit. Thank you guys for sharing and having shared your experiences with me. You're helping a lot.

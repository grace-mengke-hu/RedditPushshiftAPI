OK so this is how it starts.

Long story short, I have smoked for 15 years. In the last year my Asthma has returned, and I have to stop with this sillyness.

Hope to be around amongst you people for the next couple of years, giving and receiving encouragement. Smoked what I hope to be my last one last night. No. What *will* be my last one last night. Here's to the inevitable amounts of gunk I will be coughing up in the close to near future!

Quit cold turkey, over 24 hours ago. A redditor pointed me to this subreddit. I'm excited to finally kick the habit.

I'm 27. Have higher blood pressure than normal due to genetics and of course smoking. I can control one of these factors, so I have to quit. I'm going to be getting back into fighting shape too as my reward. I'm only 5'11", 165 lbs., but I stopped going to the gym about 8 months ago. Just lost energy. I'm ready to fix all that shit and will be relying on you guys! Thank you for existing /r/stopsmoking!

120 hours with a few things to note.

So I'd first like to start by saying how awesome it is to have made it this far!!! 

Second, I had my first nightmares. The first one was two nights ago where I was smoking a cigarette. I woke up sweating scared out of my mind, instantly relieved that it was only a dream. 

Last night I had a dream that I was all of a sudden alone in the middle of a bad part of Boston without money or a phone. These dreams are pretty weird.

I also wanted to say that I woke up really, really sore today and really tired. But I don't feel sick, just like a ran miles yesterday when in fact I was sitting.. (it could have been how I slept but I'm still curious anyways..)

And lastly, I was wondering if there are anything awesome things to expect as I'm really close to hitting the 1 week mark. 

Either way, thanks for all the support so far guys, you've been super helpful! I will not fail!

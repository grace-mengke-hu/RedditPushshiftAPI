Whats your reason for quitting?

Maybe this has been asked before...but i cannot find a reason to quit. I did quit for 200 days but a couple months ago I started smoking again and Unsubscribed from this sub.

I quit mainly because of a girl, she was much younger than me, and i quit because I was afraid of getting wrinkles and I wanted to stay young (talk about vanity). But...it never worked out with that girl...now she is gone...so there is really no reason for me to quit. My health is good, I only average about 5-10 cigarettes a day, depends on the day.

I did enjoy my quitting days, I did look healthier...but now there is now reason for me to quit now.

Anyway, what was your main reason to quit...what keeps you going strong?

6 months. Wow that went quick.

I can't believe I made it to 6 months.  I absolutely loved smoking and thought quitting was going to be just brutal.  Wasn't too bad, there are still moments of cravings but they are coming much further apart.  Coming by here has definitely helped.  I don't have a fancy phone so I come here to track my days without nicotine. Knowing what it took to get to 180 days keeps me from going back to zero.  Thanks everyone, good luck.

Newbie 5 days

Yeah i got 5 day smoke free. Yeaaa me. â˜ºI am on Chantix. I must admit i like the crazy increased dreaming. I had a hell of a craving that was brought on by the sound of my garage door opening. ðŸ˜¨ That is where my partner and i smoked. She has no desire to quit. I never thought a sound would be so dangerous. I have 10+ yrs  in a 12 step fellowship. So i take it one day at a time.  I need to stay motivated. So i am looking for some mature, funny people to reach out.  This isn't my first time. I stopped smoking for 3 yrs an picked it bck up. This time Im reaching out for support. So share advice or just share anything. I want to know what was the craziest thing that set off a craving for you and how did you handle it? Talk to you guys soon. Blessings.

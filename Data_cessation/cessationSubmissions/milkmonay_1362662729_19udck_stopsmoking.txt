Cancelling Manufacturers' Coupons

Hey guys- I quit 3 months ago and my physical health has never been better.  
Whenever I get cigarette coupons in the mail, I call the number on the envelope and cancel them.  I've called Camel, Marlboro, and L&M.  Now, it seems like I get Marlboro coupons every week!  I never even used them when I smoked, why am I getting them now?  
To be fair, they do tell you it may be 4-10 weeks before they are actually cancelled because they may already be ordered for printing, but it's been over 10 weeks!
Anyone else have experiences with this?  It almost seems mean to get them in the mail after asking for them to stop.

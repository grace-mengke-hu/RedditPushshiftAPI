100 days today and I feel great. Thanks, guys!

The last couple of months have been horrible. After I quit smoking, I was sick a lot, I couldn't sleep, I had the worse dreams, I was depressed. So many things made me want to smoke again - finals, a typhoon hitting my home country, a breakup.... But I got through it and I feel so much better physically. I'm even going to try working out again right after I come back from an out of town trip. 

Far from done, but I'm feeling great today and I wanted to thank you guys for all the help. Your posts are inspiring and you've been a great support system!

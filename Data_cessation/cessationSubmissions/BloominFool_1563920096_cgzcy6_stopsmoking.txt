Hello, I wanna quit.

Well there you are. Hello, I want to quit. I really do and I thought maybe this would be a good way to help myself as the r/HydroHomies has got me drinking water now. However, two questions arise quickly for me. One, is what is the app everyone share's screenshots from? Two, is I have been looking at reviews for *Easy Way to Stop Smoking*, and while there are an overwhelming amount of positive reviews across many sites, I always look at the negative or 1 star reviews to see if they are all on the same point and it seemed a fair amount were. I guess the second question is I have heard that all 30 chapters can be fairly repetitive and that Alan makes a case for everybody who smokes does and thinks certain things. My problem is I genuinely enjoy the taste and flavor, and I no longer smoke when stressed, I know it's still bad for me so I want to quit.  IS this the case; should I get the book? Thank you in advance, I want to quit for my health and longevity and my wife worries a lot about it and I really want to make a positive change for my family.

Quitting for first time

So I smoked about a pack a day. I started to notice effects from smoking very soon and not even after a year of smoking I sound and feel like shit. My boyfriend and I both decided to quit on Friday. He completely stopped with help of a vape I slowly cut back because I hate vapes. This is my first full day without a cigarette. I need some tips

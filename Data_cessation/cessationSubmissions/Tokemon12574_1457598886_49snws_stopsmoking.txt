Smoke-free for six months! Can hardly believe it!

Well it's time for my six month post! It took waaaay less time than I thought.

Major benefits..? I'm healthier. I now rock-climb and have reconnected with an old friend thanks to the sport. I've got more money. 

But most of all I'm not chained to a fucking wall dealing with the misery of withdrawals all the time. The cycle is broken and I'm over the moon that I was able to stick with it. 

To everyone who's just starting out... keep with it! It gets easier and it's 100% worth the initial pain! 

...and a massive thankyou to Katelynne for being the cool-ass person that she is and for motivating me to make a move on a decision I'd made months beforehand. I owe her a lot. Thankyou.

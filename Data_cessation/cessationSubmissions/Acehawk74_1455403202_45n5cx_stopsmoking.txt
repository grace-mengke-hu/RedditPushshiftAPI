233 days.

It's easy to sit back and celebrate the months, or half years, or half weeks, or anything. Let's be real. Every time we don't pick up a smoke, or light one up... or even tell ourselves we don't NEED it... it's a cause for celebration. 

It's easy to get lost in the days. Sometimes life, while hard, takes away the chance to celebrate the big moments, and the little victories, tend to slip away.

I'm smoke free for 233 days. The last time, I picked up a cigarette was Thursday, June 25th, 2015. I am proud of every single little victory, and big victory through all this.

Take a minute to think about something. What little and big victories have you earned? I'm damn proud of you, and i'm damn proud of myself. Thanks for reading. I hope this can help provide a bit of happiness to your day.

Cheers.

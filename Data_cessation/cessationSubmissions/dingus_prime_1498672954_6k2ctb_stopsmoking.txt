Quick question regarding the science / timing of cravings when quitting (specifically first 48 hrs)

Hey all, I decided to quit smoking on Monday for a larger plethora of reason, but regardless of reason, I decided to go cold-turkey after smoking a pack and a half a day for nearly 8 years (not including large amounts of hookah and dokha). 

Essentially, I am curious about how the "first 48 hours" are defined. I'm aware that the cravings and withdrawal symptoms tend to peak around 48 hrs, but I'm not sure what the reference points are, especially since so many attempt quitting by slowly decreasing the amount that they use. 

I guess my question is, if I end up caving and have a cig, will my first 48 hrs start over and be just as bad as before or will it sort of taper down. I know I shouldn't, and really don't want to, I'm just having a lot of trouble functioning properly right now because of withdrawal and want to know if I'm screwing myself by essentially starting the quitting process all over again. Thanks

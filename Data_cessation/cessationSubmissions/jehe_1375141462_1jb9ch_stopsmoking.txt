Last cig was today.

I smoked a lot in high school. Then went cold turkey and didnt smoke again for 6-7 years. 

Then i started a job that would put me on 16-18 hour shifts. At first it was fine. Then i started smoking and drinking just to keep my head together.

Needless to say, I quit the job, and picked up something 6-8 hours a day. The smoking continued.

I smoke when i feel anxious, bored, or after food. I now feel like I'm going to have a void in my life, and im not sure what im going to do then.

I feel like since i quit once, I can do this again. But i'm totally unsure of whats going to happen.

Any advice from fellow quitters?

Also, this time around i only smoked for about 2-3 months, probably bought a total of 4-5 packs, which i'm glad now, so the habit wasn't as concrete as 3-4+ years of constant smoking, but its still going to be hard. 

 I also find myself having a hard time looking forward to things, whether its a tv show, something good etc...

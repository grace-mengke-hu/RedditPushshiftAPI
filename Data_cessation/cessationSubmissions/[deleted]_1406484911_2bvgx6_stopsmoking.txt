What to do while in the car

Today will be my first smoke-free day. I've tried to quit many times before, but I am very determined this time. I plan on secluding myself in my home for the first few days and to avoid any triggers. But I am scared about my #1 trigger for me, which is driving. Any tips on what to do that first time I get in the car? Maybe some kind of replacement?

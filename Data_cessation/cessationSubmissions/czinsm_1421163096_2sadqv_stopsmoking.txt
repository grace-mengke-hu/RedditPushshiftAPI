Insomia / overall thread

So far its been going pretty smoothly, but the only thing that has really been getting under my skin is the insomia aspect. Aggh. It feels every craving hits me the moment I go to bed and keeps me up for anywhere between an hour to two. Is there anything I can do about this?

Quit smoking on New Year's, didn't realize how addicted I was, and that I was experiencing withdrawal.

I quit New Year's Day, and smoked my last cig. Usually smoked a pack every 2-3 days. Never thought of myself as being addicted, simply quit because of the financial burden and hated being a mooch. I've been feeling terrible for the past couple days, thought I had a stomach bug. I have stomach issues as is, and anxiety issues, but these past few days have been absolute hell. Can't sleep at night, but wake up early afternoon. Intense stomach cramping that takes my breath away, and for the first two night, I vomited everything I ate. I was so anxious, mostly because I didn't know what was going on, and that the withdrawal itself caused increased anxiety. I'm just glad the realization of what caused these symptoms pushed me farther away from craving a cigarette ever again. Any advice from people who've quit? How long does this last?

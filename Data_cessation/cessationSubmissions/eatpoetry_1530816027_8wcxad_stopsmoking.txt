Smoking and ADHD - and other thoughts on why I can't go back

I had a sneaking suspicion that smoking was making my ADHD worse. I have inattentive type, and when I took dietary supplements that helped with blood circulation to the brain, my ADHD improved, so I figured smoking probably did the opposite. 4 days in, I haven't noticed a drastic improvement but I have noticed some. I feel less lethargic and it's a little easier for me to remember where I put things. Since I can't take stimulant ADHD meds, I'm grateful for anything that helps!  
The other reason I really can't go back is my SO. He's never admitted it, but his substance use is very influenced by mine. When we got together, he went from being a borderline alcoholic to drinking very rarely if ever, because I don't drink very much. At the time I was not smoking, and not long after that he quit too. When I started up again, so did he, and although he never smoked as much as I did, he basically quit again a few days ago when I quit. I don't think he even 100&amp;#37; realizes he does this. Still, it makes me feel like I have an additional responsibility to stay away from cigarettes because I know he's going to just low-key also pick up a pack when we're at the liquor store together.

I am a nonsmoker (new here)

Hey guys,

Just thought I'd introduce myself to the community and stuff.

Until yesterday evening I had been smoking for more than 16 years. Today woke up as a nonsmoker with an addiction habit which I'm determined to kick. There is no next time - it's now!

Love what you guys do here and hope to be a very long-time member of /r/stopsmoking :)

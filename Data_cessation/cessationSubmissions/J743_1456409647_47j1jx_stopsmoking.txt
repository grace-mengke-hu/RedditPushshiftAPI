Day 1, Again

I woke up and I just couldn't do it. I could feel how shrunken my lungs were. As I'm typing this my hands are number and my fingers are gittery. I've smoked a lot in the past 10 years, but today is the day! 

Just checking in. I have a feeling it will be easier to check in everyday on this forum to make it through. 

Today though, I feel weak, I have a serious brain fog, and I'm nevus. Law School makes me want to smoke 8 packs in one night. But we'll see what we can do. I think I can make it.

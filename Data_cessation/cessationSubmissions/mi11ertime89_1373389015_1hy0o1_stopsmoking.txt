Thought I'd share my quitting tool

[Tea Tree Chewing Sticks](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001U1YB8)

These things are amazing. They are stronger than toothpicks so they won't splinter in your mouth, they taste great, make your breath fresh, and most importantly give you an oral fixation to take your mind off the smokes. I actually got the idea from former Cubs manager Dusty Baker who still chews them regularly.

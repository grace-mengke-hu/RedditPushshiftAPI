Take an apple break instead of a smoke break

So I quit more than a year ago but since I changed jobs, I've been jealous of my co-workers smoke breaks. I'm not missing the cigarette, I know those will just make me feel like shit and probably lead me down a slippery slope that I don't want to be on. Really I'm just missing being outside for a few minutes and chilling out. I stepped outside a couple days ago with one of my co-workers just to hang out in the sun while he smoke and he told me about someone he knows that takes regular apple breaks during the day and I really liked the idea so now I'm going to be taking Apple breaks while my co-workers smoke. 

TLDR
I'm taking Apple breaks instead of smoke breaks at work. 

Hope this helps someone!

Weird changes through the day

As i mentioned in my last post ive had bad mood swings. The thing is the last two days have gone like this:
Morning im happy and cheerful
Mid day im happy still
Then when it gets to around 5pm im grumpy until around 7 then happy again, now i dint get this because i never smoked after 4pm. If anyone can explain this please let me know. Or maybe im just over thinking haha

Just Want To See My Badge

I'm "quitting" smoking. The body is programmed to need cigarettes so much that if I admit I'm quitting it will rebel (OMG! Never again? Smoke right now!). That alone is enough to make me want to stop supporting the companies that have co-opted my willpower. 

I've thought about rewarding myself for not smoking, but in honesty, no reward trumps the amount that I do *want* to smoke. A reward in future is delayed gratification. Smoking will make me feel good *right now*.

Instead, I need to replace the habit with a different habit. I've gotten some mileage out of observing the way my body feels when I don't smoke. I've also gotten some mileage out of listening to *Quitters, Inc.* (King) while in the throes of withdrawal (really amplifies the story).

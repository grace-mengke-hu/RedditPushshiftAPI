Life changing

Giving up smoking was the hardest thing I've ever, ever done.  Nothing helped me, in the end, it was all on me.  I didn't want to use nicotine replacement therapy because, why substitute one shitty addiction for another one?  That rules out a lot of things, vaping, patches, gum etc.  I'd already tried hypnotherapy and acupuncture.  In the end just ploughing through, cold turkey, that's really the best way in my opinion.  It's hard, it's really hard.  Those first three weeks felt like there was nothing to look forward to in life, and there was an overbearing nagging feeling that something was missing.  It's difficult to explain to a non-smoker, how you could actually "look forward" to inhaling poisonous smoke.  Yeah, those first three weeks were unbelievably difficult, but they're in the rear-view now, and a distant memory.  I don't even think about it anymore, certainly not the way I used to.  My wife still smokes, so I find that fact pretty amazing, to be honest.

So now that I've beaten that, I'm going to beat drinking.  Positives, onwards and upwards people, improve your lives.  This site was incredibly helpful in those early days as well, so stick with it and keep giving up.  It's worth it.

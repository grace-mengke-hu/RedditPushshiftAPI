Ending Day 5, when does it get easier?

To give a background I started smoking when I was 16, I just recently turned 23. Before I quit I was smoking about 3 packs a weeks. I just finished my MBA and I start my new job at a Big 4 Accounting Firm in January. 

It's currently the night of day 5 and I think i'm about to lose my mind. The stress of school is now over since all my grades are in with high marks, but for the past 5 days all i've done is sit in my room and play League of Legends with my friends. I haven't left my house in 5 days, I even had to have my parents drop off my textbook rentals to UPS because I don't trust myself to leave my house knowing my lack of impulse control will lead me to the gas station to buy a pack on the way. It is literally taking me all of my will power to not go buy a pack right now and I am strong enough to fight it now, but what i'm worried about is the future. When I start my new job as an Accountant I will be right smack at the start of busy season working 10-12 hour days. 

When does this get easier? How do you guys who work high stress jobs deal with it? I feel like i'm at a total loss and i'm going to break in the near future, I know this is probably the addiction talking but if I have even one cigarette, is that going to fuck everything up?

I cracked

After 105 hours or 4 days and 9 hours, i cracked. I went to a shop bought cigarettes and smoked. I just immediatly wanted to puke, I still want to puke. It wasn't worth it, I don't feel better and frankly, I'm dusgusted with myself. I'm not ressetting my quit date, I still am a non-smoker as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to ever again. The cig I had didn't taste good, didn't feel good and I now know more then ever that I can continue to do the right thing and quit.

I'm deeply sorry to the community here who had my back the past couple of days, I failed you. But from this point forward I will continue to do the right things. I will be better and I will do better.

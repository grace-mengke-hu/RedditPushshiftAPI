When do physical and psych cravings stop?

I did smoking for about 15 years, vaping and dip, lozenges, finally pulled the plug. This time is a bit easier than previous attempts to quit but it's about day 6 and I have a really bad urge, I thought nicotine was out after 3 or so days and processed out through pee. Is it still physical withdrawal from nicotine (headache, grogginess) or is it all psychological?

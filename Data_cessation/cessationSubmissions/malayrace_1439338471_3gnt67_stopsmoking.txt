My 7th day. Feel fresh. Cleaner teeth and breathe.

I m 35 and i was diagnosed as a weak heart. Now i feel so motivated. After 3 days quit, my heart back to normal again. II dont take any nicotine replacement. What i did was drink plain wateras much as i can . It is more than 4 liters a day. I still think about ciggarete sometimes. But i try to keep my self busy. I hope i can forget the habbit for the rest of mylife

Hmm...here I am.

I bought my last pack of cigarettes today. I guess the reason I ever started was because I wanted to die, my cat had also passed when i decided I wanted to start. This is obviously a slow death waiting to happen. But I'm so happy with my life 1yr 1/2 later. 
I'm quitting cause I want to be alive to live  as long as I can with my boyfriend. Im quitting because my mom picked it up after quitting in 2000 cause I started. I want her to live a long life so as soon as I finish this pack (which, lets be serious, will only last a day or two) I am DONE. And so is my mom. Wish me luck, although I think this'll be a easy ride. I've tried before and it's more of a terrible habit then addiction.

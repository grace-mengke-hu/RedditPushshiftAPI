What is that book that everyone here swear by?

I've read a lot of discussions and comments here but I really can't stop smoking. But in every thread there is everytime a comment in which a person recommend a book, I've read the name so many times but honestly I don't remember it, and I don't know if it's always the same.
I read that you can read it while still smoking.
Is it really useful, if yes, why?

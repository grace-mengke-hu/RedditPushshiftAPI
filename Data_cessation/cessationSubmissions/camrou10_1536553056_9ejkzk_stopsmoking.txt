Had a smoke today, and my body rejected it by making me feel sick.

I still feel kind of sick. I finished it, and then that was it. I don't feel too bad about it, and I'm thinking I should probably slow down on smoking now more than anything instead of going cold turkey. I can't go cold turkey. Don't have the strength or will to, which just sounds pathetic to me.

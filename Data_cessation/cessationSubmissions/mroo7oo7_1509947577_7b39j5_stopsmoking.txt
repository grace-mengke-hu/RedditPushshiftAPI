This is the second day in 12 years that I've not had some kind of nicotine. Sucks so good.

Applied for a job that tests for nicotine. I've changed from cigarettes, to gum, to patches, to cigars, to snus, and back to cigarettes (wash rinse repeat), several times over the years. This is the first time I've gone cold turkey. I've come to realize that since I often used several different forms of nicotine over the day, there isn't a spot that doesn't give me a craving.

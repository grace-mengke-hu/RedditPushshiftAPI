I really can't believe I used to smoke... Day 70.

I know it seems a bit mad, some of you are probably thinking, "dude, it's been 70 days, you have a long way to go", but no, the reality is, is that this has been 2 years for me, 2 years ago I started this journey, it all started with "i'm done" I lasted probably 1 day. This went on for months and months, quitting a day at a time, then, last April came and I gave up for 84 days, then stupidly I started again, complacency, that is what i blame that relapse on, I genuinely thought I could have "just one". I then smoked for 6 more months, until, 70 days ago, I finally quit for good. I now know that I will never smoke again, this, for me, has been easy, it really has, i'm so done with smoking, so done with the bullshit, the money, the health scares. So, so done! All I can stress to you new quitters is to simply, not smoke. Yep, it's really that easy, you just don't smoke. Good luck and thank you to this sub. Forever in your debt. And yes, i'm really drunk right now and no, I don't want to smoke lol.

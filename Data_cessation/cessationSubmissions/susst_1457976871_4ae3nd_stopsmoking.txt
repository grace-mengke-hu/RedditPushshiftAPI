Let's do this.

My friends are sick of it, my family is sick of it, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of the smell, the taste in my mouth, the film on my hands, the way people look at me on the street. I've been at it for months now, months longer than I should've been. It started small. Offers from my buddies, accepted for the sense of camaraderie. A pack bought drunk on Saturday, flushed down the toilet Sunday morning. A pack bought on Monday, finished at the end of the week. Three cigs a day. Then six. Then half a pack. Then a full one. It become a part of my routine, and I didn't even notice. That's what gets me about it now, the fact that it became automatic. All the motions are still hard-coded in my muscle memory.

Starting to smoke was an empirically bad decision, but I'm not going to let that mistake wreck my self esteem, and now I've decided I'm not going to let it wreck my health. That's why I'm here. 

I found this subreddit yesterday. I'll be checking in every week at the latest. Let's quit together. Good luck, folks. We can do this.

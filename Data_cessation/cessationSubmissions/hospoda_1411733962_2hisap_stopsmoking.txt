And here I am, trying to fix me.

Hello guys. I've been lurking around here for quite some time now. Today, I got up, made myself a coffee and - of course - lit up a cig. 
Frankly, I felt pretty miserable for a few months now. I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years, whom I love very much (but it had to be done) and started to hate myself. Getting drunk every night and trying to smoke myself out of this planet was my daily routine. 
It was yesterday, I was walking on a street when I heard a young man talking about religion and about living a good life. Then few meters away there were three young musicians playing a very beautiful music on violins, with dozens of people admiring them. And after then there was this drunk guy "playing" harmonica, who seemed pretty miserable. I started to think oh how much of a human trash I am in my early 20s. Day after day I was drunk, letting my potencial away with urine in dirty pub toilets. 
I now realized, this is probably my last chance to turn my life around. 

Let's start with kicking this wrecking habit. 

Thanks for reading and for those, who are lurking the same as I were - stay strong and do it. Every day that you smoke is gonna make this stopping thing harder. And I've now realized, that I stop either by myself, now.. or I die.

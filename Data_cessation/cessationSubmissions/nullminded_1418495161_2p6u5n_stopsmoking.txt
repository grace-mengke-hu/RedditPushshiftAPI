Almost there!

I decided a couple days ago that I seriously want to quit smoking. They say you're not going to quit until you really want to, and for once I really do. After I actually come to that decision it has been very easy. I had just shy of a full pack of cigarettes left, after those are gone I'm done with cigarettes for good. Day 1 I smoked 7.5, day 2 only 3, and today is day 3 and so far I've had 2. I have 2 cigarettes left in my pack which will likely be before bed and when I wake up tomorrow. I've been using an e-cigarette with higher nicotine to break myself of actual cigarettes. It was a hard adjustment the first day but since then it completely takes the edge off. Once I'm free from cigarettes I'm going to start buying less and less nicotine with my e-juices until they're all gone. I'm very proud of myself for this and gives a real feel of accomplishment.

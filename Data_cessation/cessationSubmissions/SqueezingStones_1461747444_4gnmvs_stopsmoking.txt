She is 44 and amazing. She is going to die.

Today I called an old work colleague. I say colleague, but I really do consider her a friend. There is a bit of an age difference between us. I am 27, she is 44. But we always got along so well, she is a very grounded and loyal person. From the day I met her she treated me so kindly, she would offer me rides because I don't have a car. She would bring little treats to work for me. She would stick up for me when our managers where being assholes. She let me cry on her shoulder when I went through a terrible break up.  She would give me cigarettes when I overspent on the weekend and couldn't afford to buy my own... She really treated me like a son and expected nothing in return. Truly one of the best people I have ever met. 

We were talking on the phone, about her son and her daughter - how things were with them. Then she dropped the bombshell, she has stage-4 brain cancer. As far as I am aware there is no stage-5. This is pretty much a death sentence for her. She has had surgery to remove part of the tumor, but they couldn't get it all. The doctors have told her it's twelve months to three years until it kills her. She was so upbeat and positive, though I know she must be hurting. All she could talk about was staying strong for her kids so they don't have to spend years worrying. What a fucking saint. I wished her well and told her we would meet soon. I hung up the phone and I cried my eyes out. I'm sorry Relly, I'm not as strong as you... 

I don't want to die like that. I will not let this stupid little monster take me to the grave. I will stop.

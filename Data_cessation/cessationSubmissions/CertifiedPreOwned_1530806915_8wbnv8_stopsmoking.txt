Here I am. I need the help.

Hi all. I've been smoking for the last few years about a pack a day. My wife is 15 weeks pregnant and I've waited too long to quit. I know why I need to quit and I know I should quit but finding the *want* to quit is hard. Any tips or kind words would be appreciated. I'm just posting this to give myself some accountability.

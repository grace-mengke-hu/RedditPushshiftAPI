Cigarettes and depression

Hey guys I'm very new to this subreddit. 

So I read Allen carry book and I feel very upset with myself because I'm still smoking and I've heard literally everyone who reads it quits at the end...well not me unfortunately. I'm in my early 20s been smoking since age 17 and I've noticed that when I try and quit I get severely depressed...like I can't go outside or enjoy anything depressed and I start thinking about how much of a failure I am and how I haven't been pursuing a good career or anything after college etc etc. 

My question is if I ended up quitting cigarettes would this depression go away or would it not matter as I'm most likely just proned to being depressed? I think I read something a while ago about how most smokers are depressed people in general.

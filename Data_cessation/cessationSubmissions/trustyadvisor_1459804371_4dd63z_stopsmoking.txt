~~3 Days Clean~~ O_O

I started smoking at 16 and was a pack a day smoker until 3 days ago (I'm 28...). Over the last two months, I decided to start taking wellbutrin as a smoking cessation aid, but it didn't help much. I decided to cut down, and successfully cut down to about 5-8 cigs a day. Recently, I had 'the future' talk with my gf, and I want to see my grandkids, so I quit on Saturday, 4/2/16.

One thing that is exceedingly hard is jaw pain. I have been snacking constantly and chewing nicotine gum which causes my jaw to seize. Another thing is my brain SCREAMING at me, but I guess we all have experience with that. I can hear my inner voice trying to coax me to have a quick cig.

The HARDEST thing of all is how my routine has changed. I don't know what to do with my time. It took me 4-5 minutes to smoke a cigarette, lets say 4.5, and I smoked 15-20 cigarettes a day, lets say 18, so that's 81 minutes a day that I just smoked and looked at my phone. 1 hour, 21 minutes of my day I got back, and it's totally weirding me out. I used to smoke inbetween classes, when I walked my dog, inbetween games of League of Legends, whenever someone called me on the phone, after sex, etc. and now i'm just sitting here rambling to you guys. Anyways, that's all, thanks for listening. I'm committed, no going back at this point.

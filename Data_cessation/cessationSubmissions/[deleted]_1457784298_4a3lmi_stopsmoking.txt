2 weeks in!

Got my 2-week-flair!! Just wanted to say a big thank you for all the support this sub has given me over the last couple of weeks. I didn't think I could do this (after so many unsuccessful quits before) or feel this way about being a non-smoker. I can breathe better, I can walk further, I don't cough up crap in the mornings any more and my kids love the fact I'm not a stinky mummy anymore. My moods are evening out, my anxiety has nearly all gone... The list goes on!
To those of you who've only just quit - I was a smoker of 15 a day for 16 years - it really can get better this quick! Keep on keeping on folks ðŸ˜€

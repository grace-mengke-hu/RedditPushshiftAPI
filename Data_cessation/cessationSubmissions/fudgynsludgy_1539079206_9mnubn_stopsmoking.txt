19 days in, feeling great

 Just wanted to share to you I've smoked for about 10 years and just recently quit (must be like the 160th time) this time for real though.

Mainly quit because of my health, was very short-breathed, the coughs were terrible (yellow brownish slime anyone?) But still would roll my heavy tobacco and "enjoy" those smokes. And while I still do enjoy the smell of it, let me tell you the following I like myself a lot more, not smoking!

The smells I smell now can be so overwhelming, I totally forgot things like grass have a certain smell. I dont cough all the time and I can breathe freely. I gained a lot of time which before I used for rolling and smoking. I dont have to worry if Ive packed my smokers stuff or if Im going on a trip if I've enough of it..

Again its just 19 days in and I know I have a long way to go still but I do believe this time is different (you got to believe ;) )

What seems to help during the cravings is speaking out loud: "Man I could really go for a smoke right now". Things like that, it will get it off my mind literally. Especially the first few days were baaad. My GF had to go through some shit from my side this time xD but it does get better, i barely feel the cravings these days .

Before quitting I thought that I was a smoker, but later I realised thats not a right mindset. Dont identify yourself as a smoker because than it will get hard to quit. Its the tobacco industry who wants us to think we're either smokers or non smokers but its just not like that, you're so much more :) allright wish me luck and GL everyone on the same journey or getting there!

Question about nicotine gum

For those of you who use nicotine gum. 
When you put the gum in your mouth, how many times do you chew it before 'parking '?
And I'm always afraid to swallow my saliva. Afraid that nicotine hasn't fully absorbed in my mouth yet.  
Am I  choose to hold my saliva in my mouth for a while before swallowing or no?
Thanks

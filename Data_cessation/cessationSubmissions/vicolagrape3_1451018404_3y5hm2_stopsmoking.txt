Is it rude to ask family members to stop smoking in front of me?

I am 22 yrs old, I have been smoking since I was ~14. Both my mother and father smoke, now divorced. My mom's boyfriend and my younger sister (19 yo) both smoke currently. It's enough of a trigger to constantly smell it in the house and garage, they smoke in the basement but are too stupid to realize it permeates into the rest of the house. I am visiting for the holidays, and dread getting in the car with them because they chain smoke getting ashes all over the place. I feel very un-included as they spend a lot of together time in smoking areas. 
I have been trying to quit for a couple years now, this is the best I have done. I was totally fine until I came here, I can't get away from it!!
The worst part is my mother has pre-emphazema along with a few other preventable health problems related to smoking- her teeth are all fake now, etc. Her boyfriend has COPD that is rapidly progressing. My grandparents kindly asked her to consider quitting. She laughed and blew them off. They have prayer reminders in their house, as if 'God' can help someone help themselves. 
I don't want to see her die of this, and I don't want to relapse. I feel like an asshole asking someone to do that, as I already get eye rolls if I make a complaint about it. 

Thoughts?

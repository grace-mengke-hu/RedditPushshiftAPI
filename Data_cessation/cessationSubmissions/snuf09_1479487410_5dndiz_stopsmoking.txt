Day 4 Today has not been easy so far, tomorrow will be even worse

Around day 2 my throat started to hurt like crazy and I have got a cold, which sucks because you would think stopping smoking would make breathing easier but jesus I feel like shit. Craving has been high but I'm still managing to not take one drag at all.

But tomorrow will be the real test, big party with my friends which mostly are smokers. So this will be hard, have thought about getting nicotine gum or something for when I can't take it anymore but something in me says just do it on pure willpower. What tips do you guys have? At least I have you guys for venting and I am very thankful for that :)

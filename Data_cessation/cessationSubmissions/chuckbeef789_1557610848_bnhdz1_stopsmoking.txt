I said "I used to smoke" today and it felt wonderful.

  Checked into a motel today, was given the option of a "smoking" or "non-smoking" room. I chose "non" and commented to the front desk agent that I was surprised that "smoking" rooms were still an option. He told me there were still a few though they were being phased out and I mentioned that I used to smoke. It felt great to say that. 
  A nice little experience I wanted to share. Keep up the good work everyone.

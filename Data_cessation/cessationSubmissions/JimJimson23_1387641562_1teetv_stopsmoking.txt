How do I quit when a decent pack of smokes is 37 cents per pack and every male around me smokes?

Living in Laos and I keep telling myself, day after day, that I will quit. Then I'm out and about and find myself craving a cigarette and eventually cave in. How can I maintain discipline and stop feeding this stupid addiction? When I'm in the US, simple economics forces me to cutback to maybe 2 or 3 cigarettes a day and when I'm around my family, I am able to quit for weeks on end without any serious struggle. But now I am on my own and a pack of cigarettes is half the price of a bottle of tea. How do ya'll maintain discipline? When I'm around my family, it's to avoid disappointing them. I know tomorrow or possibly even tonight, I will crave a cigarette and eventually I will cave in and smoke one. 
Edit: Thought about it and my motivation is to regain my appetite and put on some pounds.

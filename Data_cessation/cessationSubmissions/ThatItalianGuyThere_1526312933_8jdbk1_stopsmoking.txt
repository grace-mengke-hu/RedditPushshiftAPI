Day 3... Old routines and inner conflicts

It's day 3 of smoke free for me, and holy sh*t it's rough.  First day at the office, where literally everyone smokes.  Thankfully, one guy wasn't in today, so dodged the morning bullet.  I'm dreading the afternoon when the CEO shows up.  He always wants to smoke while we talk about the day's work, etc.  
At the same time, my brain is just foggy, like I'm obsessed with telling myself not to go buy a pack, not to give in to the bullshit.
I can't focus very well today, and I just feel "off". Any of y'all have experience with that, or tips to help?

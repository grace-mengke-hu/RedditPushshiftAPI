Smoking in my sandbox

Thinking back on my interactions with redditors in this sub I often recall conversations about smoking in dreams. It's been a theme for me, since it's one of the last vestiges of being a smoker.

I heard somewhere recently that dreams are a way of hashing out issues in life, a way of getting out that stress or perhaps dealing with embarrassing situations in a sandbox of sorts. It could be pure poetic bullshit but it's a useful analogy at the very least, that helps me compartmentalize some emotion.

Well, even ~800 days since my last cigarette I still occasionally smoke in my dreams. And I still experience some guilt when it happens. I probably experience it much more often than I recall, as is the way with dreams, but it's always a surprise.

I'm quite content with that sandbox notion. Even if I always have these dreams, this small bit of guilt, I'm quite content in knowing it was played out in a consequence free zone, and I only have to consciously visit those feelings once in a while when a dream persists into the daylight.

This is another notion that speaks to the only real mantra I've had since quitting over two years ago: I'll always be an ex-smoker but at least I'm not a smoker.

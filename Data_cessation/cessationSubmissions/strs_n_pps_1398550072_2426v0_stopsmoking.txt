Another attempt, day 13

So this is going to be the last time i stop smoking. i dont think i can quit again after this so this one is going to have to stick. Im on day 14 and ive hit that 2 week lul.

This is not the first time i have quit smoking (its not the 21st time either) i was a smoker for 10 years floating between 15 and 40 a day.

So far its been ok, going out has been fine (as most of my friends have already quit) its the times when im alone which are the hardest, when im bored and sad.

But its day 14! and i know i don't have to smoke anymore, ive even stopped being a dick to my family. which is a positive

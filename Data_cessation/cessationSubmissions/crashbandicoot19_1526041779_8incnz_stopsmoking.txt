From weed to tobacco to nothing

Stopped smoking weed\(so many blunts over the years\) for probation...started smoking tobacco.I just had my last backwoods,and im so irritated that I have to smoke and blow it out my mouth to be relaxed and that im PIST! I wanna be normal like everyone else but for some reason I know subconsciously It just makes me calm down and zone out  for whatever reason. Im irritated all the time that I cant just chill out and stay calm without the help of some outside chemical. My favorite thing is to go outside and look at it all while I jam and blow some smoke. I threw my ecig but Il probably be digging it up later as I find its the lesser of the evils.IDK i wanna vent and maybe yall understand that feeling of everything is gonna be alright you get form smoking.

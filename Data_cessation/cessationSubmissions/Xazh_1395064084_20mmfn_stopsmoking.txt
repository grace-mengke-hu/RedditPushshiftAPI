And here we go...

Today is the day, March 17, 2014, that I finally move on from my addiction after 5ish Years. 

I have been putting it off with excuses such as, "I can't right now, if I do than I will be irritable and take it out on the kids I coach.. and that's not right."  "Too much stress, no way I'll make it" well no more!

The season is over and I have a month long break, so the kids are no longer an excuse.

I Have no stress at the moment, so that's not an excuse.

I need a place to vent, to complain, to bitch and moan. I will be using this post. I don't expect or need responses, just a place to gather my thoughts...

So here.. we.. go..

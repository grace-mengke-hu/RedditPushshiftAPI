Reset badge :'(

After two years as a non smoker I reset my bedge. Stressful event - a visit from a boy I liked after 2.5 years... Failure is multi layered. Anyway I am determined to stop again.. My withdrawal is awful after two days now not smoking (restlessness, anxiety)... I really need your support now. Thank you kind people of Reddit ‚ù§

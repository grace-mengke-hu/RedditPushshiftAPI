Fuck you nicotine

Today was to be the worst day I have ever experienced under nicotine withdrawal.Everything started out fine but as nightime came closer i suddently started crying for no reason,so much frustration anger and envy began going through me that I thought I would explode.I went out and ran for a mile thinking that would put my mind at ease but it made me even more frustrated(why do i have to go through this,just one cigarette could end all of your suffering).I ended up punching a brick wall until my knuckles started bleeding.Scary shit,but now im fine and happy not to have caved.Please stay strong and remember never to take another puff ever again no matter what the circumstances.

Cracked my first 100 days smoke free. Yay!

I don't think I have gone 100 days smoke free since I started high school. That was 1979. That's right. Think Donna Summer on the radio, Star Trek The Motion Picture at the movies and pong the game on the telly. Almost forty years of wasting my money my time and my health on a stupid addiction.

I wish I had found Allen Carr sooner. His book has helped me to start my fifties in a super empowered and positive outlook.

I won't be a sucker another minute.

Hi all. I wanted to say to those who may not think you can quit, you can!!

You are capable of making this decision to take care of yourself and kick this addiction! It may feel hard at times, but each time you get through a rough time, you will feel awesome for owning this mind fuck. Smoking lies to you and you will see and feel so much clearer as you let go of the need for it. I know you can do this!

really hope I succeed this time

I quit for the best part of a year and then had a big disagreement with my partner and was smoking like a chimney again. Now on day 22 but still craving to smoke now and again although my cravings have gone down to 4 a day. I'm doing this for my 2 girls so everytime I have a urge that's who I look at to remind myself not to give in. I've always suffered awful health anxiety and was better when I didn't smoke so I'm hoping in a few more weeks my health anxiety will feel better and I won't need to go back on my pills. Well done all you non smokers. Be proud!

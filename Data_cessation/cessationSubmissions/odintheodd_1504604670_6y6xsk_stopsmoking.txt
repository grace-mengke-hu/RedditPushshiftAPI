Round 3... FIGHT!

I've made it 2 whole days without puffing! Onward to 3! Woke up wanting a puff really badly, but I popped a lozenge instead. They're really working for me this time! I'm just using up whatever I have from past failed attempts. I have 4mg lozenges and gums, and a little bit of 2mg lozenges and gums. I CAN DO THIS!

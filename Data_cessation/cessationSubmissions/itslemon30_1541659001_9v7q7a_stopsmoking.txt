How long before I can drink!?

I quit smoking a month ago. I used Chantix for 3 weeks, which made it a lot easier and I’ve been all on my own for the last week or so. Everything was fine until tonight when I had a couple drinks and got home. If I had any cigarettes I would of smoked one without a doubt. 

Rewind till this last September. I quit smoking for a week or two. I have 1 drink. I go to the store and buy a pack.

Rewind to this last spring. I’ve been quit for 5 months, I’m on a date (drinking) and my date breaks out a pack. I’m off to the races.

Literally every time it’s what does me in. When can I have a drink without really feeling like I need to smoke?

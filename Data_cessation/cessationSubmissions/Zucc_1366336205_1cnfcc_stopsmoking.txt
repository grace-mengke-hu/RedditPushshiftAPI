Day 2, bringing out every trick in the book.

I'm using the vapor cigarette (Blu), with nicotine gum as a supplement, and just put on a patch.  I've also got one last cigarette in a pack with my lighter, telling myself that it's my last one, and can have it whenever I want it.  Almost did it a couple of times, but I'm still managing to hold on to it.  I'm pretty sure I'm intaking more nicotine than I ever did smoking, but it still doesn't seem like enough.

I don't really have a question.  Just needed to talk.

Herbal cigarettes recipes?

Hello all! I'm quitting smoking and I'm looking for alternatives, something to smoke while I'm fighting the nicotine cravings.

Ideally it would be a combo that tastes as close to tobacco as possible but doesn't have physical addiction pottential.

I've tried nirdosh (tastes...badly) and have ordered some herbs that comprise a certain hipster brand's herbal smokes but I would love to find some recipes if someone here has used herbs to quit cigarettes.

Managed to make it a month until...

I had my good eCig stolen from my vehicle last week. I bought a pack of cigarettes to hold me over until my new supplies arrive in the mail. I've only smoked one, maybe two, per day (compared to a pack and a half), but smoking is smoking. Then I also smoked about half a pack while drinking with friends.

However, I don't think I'll have a problem staying off cigarettes once I'm back to the eCig, as I didn't have any urges while I was using it. I'm also cutting the nicotine content down to 8mg, and in a month or two, 0mg. I think I'm almost there!

P.S. How do I reset my badge? I'm on my phone, and can't see the sidebar or anything. Do I just message the bot the new date?

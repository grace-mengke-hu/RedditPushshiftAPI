It's gotten better. But does it still get better?

Just turned the page on day 89. Everyone's an asshole. I really wanted to bum a cigarette after work. Wanted to stop at the store on the way home. Laying in bed now and honestly, the only thing keeping me from that corner store is sheer laziness. I've reached a point where I'm solidly "not smoking", I'm resigned to it, I've stopped reaching for a pack that isn't there. But I haven't stopped wanting the ritual. Does that wear off? I've come a long way in 89 days, but sometimes I need to know there's even sunnier skies that I haven't reached yet. Will I always have this faint desire for a cigarette?

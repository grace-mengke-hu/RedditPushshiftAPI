Random question about Allen Carr's Easyway and the final Cigarette

Did anyone else have their last cigarette with their spouse and not focus on what he told you to during that final smoke? I am only a few days into quitting using Easyway, and I feel that it's not working!!! I haven't had a smoke yet...but I thought about it today, and I really think I should have smoked my last one by myself.  Is that weird?  Or am I just making excuses right now?

200 days and I feel fine!

I didn't even realize that it has been 200 days since my last smoke. Ive had some hard times and many of you have been nice enough and encouraging enough to help me through my breakdowns (ive had quit a bit as I am a drama princess) So thank you everyone for all the support.

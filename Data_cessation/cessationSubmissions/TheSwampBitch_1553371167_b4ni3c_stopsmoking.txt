Relapsed after almost 2 years of being smoke free

Damn, people.
Just... damn.

On March 30th it would've been two years. A couple of weeks ago, I started smoking again.
At the beginning I thought I've got it under control, but tonight I gotta admit to myself that it has become a problem again.

It's already taking a toll on my health again, and I fucking hate it. 

When I first quit two years ago, I did cold Turkey. It was my first try quitting, and it worked. Until it didn't I guess.

I don't even know why I write this here, maybe I feel like I need a little help this time. Starting tonight, I'm quitting for good.

Thanks for letting me ramble, I hope it's not bothering anyone.

The tables have turned!

I was at a bar with two other friends the other day, we grabbed a beer and something to eat. While I was eating one friend excuses herself for a smoke, and then the other friend who is a casual smoker asks to bum a smoke. They both asked if it was ok to go for a smoke and leave me. I honestly didn't care about the smoking thing, but I thought it was a little rude that they left me there to eat alone! 

Is this what we had done to our non smoking friends in the past? My how the tables have turned!

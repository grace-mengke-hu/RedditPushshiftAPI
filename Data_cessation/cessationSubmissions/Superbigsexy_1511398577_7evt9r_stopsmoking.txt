I want to stop smoking but I can't.

Hey y'all I am 19 and have been smoking on and off for a couple of years. I started when I was 14 but stopped when my brother was born. I picked up again around 17 and have been vaping and smoking since then. I smoke about a pack a week. Everytime I try to quit I always find an excuse or a reason to smoke. I am highly stresses currently working 2 jobs 7 days a week.(where everyone smokes and offers me cigs) As well as a full time student.I use that as an excuse to smoke. I want to quit. I do not want to give in to my cravings. I've been smoking more and more each day. I don't want this to consume me. How do I battle these cravings? How do I turn down people offering? How do I prevent myself from smoking when everyone else is smoking around me? I'd love to hear from you all and share your experiences with me. Please help me help myself.

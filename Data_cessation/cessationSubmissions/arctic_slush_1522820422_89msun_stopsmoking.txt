Anxiety/Insomnia/Breaking Out

Hi guys, today marks my 12th day. Longest I’ve been in a long time. I am happy that I haven’t touched—although I almost gave in today due to anxiety. I’m stressing through the roof for no reason and my heart is constantly racing. My chest actually hurts right now. Because of anxiety I’m also not able to sleep much—if at all. My face is breaking out and I look like crap to say the least. Any advice? Has this happened all at once to any of you? How did you deal with it. Please help, thank you.

500 days smoke free - my journey

TLDR: Read a book, went Cold turkey and it worked.

I owe my life to a man and I can't even buy him a beer, because he died before I got the chance to.

His name was Allen Carr.

His writing may have been repetitive, dry, and boring, but he saved me. I saved me.

I was a heavy smoker and smoked for 8 years of my life.
I alternated between Rothmans Blue, Marlboro Black and Next Red. 1-2 packets on good days and 4 on stressful ones. I was never able to go below 1 packet a day.

I tried to quit so many times before - nico patches, nico gum, e-cigarettes, acupuncture, hypnotism. Nothing worked for more than 3 months.  Nicotine always kept its grip on my mind. Like a brace around my neck. I was a slave to nicotine.

I started reading Allen Carrs book with heavy sceptism, but in hope that it wouldn't be just another bs self-help book. 3/4 through the book I couldn't take it any more and made a life changing decision. That I would stop consuming nicotine.  
When I stopped cold-turkey it felt as if I was naked. Like a part of me was missing. I remember thinking that I would never manage and that it was already too late for me. 

3 weeks had passed and I never looked back. There were times when I got drunk and declined offers for cigarettes. 3 months on colleague had a baby and bought expensive cigars, the type I'd die for (I loved cigars) and politely declined despite peer pressure and the overwhelming desire I had for them.  I shared a joint 6 months onwards and it was great, except afterwards I got my first nicotine cravings in a very long time. So I had to give up joints as well.

500 days on, my old friends who never saw me without a cigarette still can't believe that I quit. 

It was a tough journey overall, but it was totally worth it.

I am richer, healthier and no longer stink of that crap.

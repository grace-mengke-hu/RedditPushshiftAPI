This was a rough night.

So.. i got a letter Saturday and took my time reading it.. when i‘ve read it yesterday evening.. man. I fell down. A governmental bureau wants to sue me (stealing/keeping money from them).

So.. since it was Sunday I couldn’t get any information.. so I haven’t slept (was super nervous and stressed) and had a looooot Of cravings.. caused by stress. So crazy...:(.. so i had two heavy cravings this morning until I could clear that letter out.

Happy I made it through and the letter.. they made a mistake. No one wants to sue me 🙄🤷‍♂️😄

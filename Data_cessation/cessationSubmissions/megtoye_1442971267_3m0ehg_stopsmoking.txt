Day 4: broke and a bought a pack

I am on the patch, too. Started smoking when I was 15 and it was never really a social thing. I smoked after everything I did everyday. Wake up, smoke. Gym, smoke. Walk to store, smoke. Eat, smoke. 
I would smoke when I was really happy, and really sad. I am now 28 years old and after 13 years of smoking I am so sick of it controlling my life and making me feel terrible.

On Day 3, I was feeling fantastic. Like I had made the best decision of my life. Today, I tried to get some work done and my lack of energy, ability to fully focus or get motivated, on top of my fear of gaining weight... all got to my head. The following narrative consistently ran through my head: "now is not the time..." "you'll never be able to get through such and such such big events in the next couple of months with your energy levels so low..." 
 "the patch is just prolonging the real withdrawal... you think this sucks, wait til 3 months from now when you don't have the patch on, then how you will get anything done..." "you already don't feel good about yourself, do you really want to gain weight on top of it? why not lose more weight and wait to quit when you're feeling really good..."

I smoked two cigarettes and feel awful. I crushed the pack and threw it in the trash. Done the garbage chute in my apartment building. The last few days I was really proud and it was a struggle. Now I have to start all over again. I can't wait til this addiction is over and I can lead a healthy life.
I wonder, should I just do cold turkey? is my energy/motivation/focus going to ever return to normal? I feel so out of it all the time, even with the patch...

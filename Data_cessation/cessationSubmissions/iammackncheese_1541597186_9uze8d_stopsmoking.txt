Need advise from the experts

I am planning on quitting smoking on a regular basis. I started in 2013, went up to a pack a day (10 cigs) by 2014 and started my attempt to reduce from 2016. Have successfully come down to 2-3 per day but unable to go lower.
What is the most effective way for you guys? Is cold turkey a good option?

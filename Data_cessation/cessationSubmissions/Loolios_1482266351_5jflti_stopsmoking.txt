Quit for 6 months, relapsed. Feeling like shit.

Hi I'm new to the subreddit. I was a daily smoker for 2 years and I was smoke free for the last 6 months. I don't know what it is about winter time but the cold always makes me want to smoke a cig. I signed up for a badge and I'm hoping this subreddit can help me quit for good now. I hate being enslaved to nicotine/tobacco. I'm hoping 2017 is the beginning of a nicotine/tobacco free life. Let's kick this shit for good everyone.

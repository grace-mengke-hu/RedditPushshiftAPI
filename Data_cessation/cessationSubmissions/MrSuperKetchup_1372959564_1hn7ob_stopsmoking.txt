Two Weeks, Happy Fourth!

So it's been a rough two weeks, but I made it to the 14 day mark!  I can already feel a change going on in my body. I'm eating better, feeling better. Now all I have to do is get to the gym. I wanted to tell about a night I had the other night though, something happened that really made me upset, and looking back on it, I'm surprised I didn't react more than I did at the time.

So I went to my first party last Saturday since I've quit. It was a midnight pool party theme, so everyone was outside, chilling in and around the pool, drinking having a good time. My friend offers me a cigarette and I decline and pull out a pack of gum. My other friend loudly cuts in and says "HE doesn't want a cigarette HE quit." Okay, thanks man... I guess...Note, that this guy is one of my closest friends. So that same friend later offers me a cigarette, and when I said "No, dude, I quit." He just said "...really...?" I assure him, yes. I'm done. 
So later on in the evening, we're by the pool and he offers me a puff of his cigarette. I again decline. He then inhales slowly, looks at me, and blows a straight cloud of smoke directly into my face....
All I could say was "Are you kidding me? What the fuck?" And that was that. He apologized, so I just sort of brushed it off. Thinking back on it though, Jesus, why would you do that to someone who was trying to quit?

I'm really just venting here because I wanted to get it off my chest and how upset it actually made me. Despite that incident, I've been able to go to bars/group hang outs and have been able to successfully resist the urge. I want to prove something to myself, as well as to the other assholes who apparently think quitting is for smhucks. I'm just not entirely sure how to deal with this "friend."

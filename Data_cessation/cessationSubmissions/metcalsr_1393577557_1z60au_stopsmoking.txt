An interesting game to play to help quitting smoking.

I was recently visiting a Dungeons & Dragons player's forum, and came across an interesting game for quitting smoking. It's kind of an RPG, that relies less on stats and more on dice rolling to decide whether or not you can smoke. It's pretty simple and easy by itself, and with a dice rolling app on your phone, you can play without lugging a 20 sided die everywhere. If you're not into DnD itself, then just consider it a type of dice game.

I have currently been doing this game for seven days, one week. Which is much longer than I last on most quitting attempts. 

Essentially the game works like this, you roll the die and if you make a 15 or higher, you do not get to smoke, anything below that and you can smoke. Each day the number gets one lower, until by day 7 when you need an eight or lower in order to smoke. This keeps going until you literally have to roll a 1, in order to be able to smoke. Not only that, but when you fail a roll, you have to wait one hour before you can roll again. This part is ingenious, because when I crave a cigarette and fail, my mind goes "Well, it's only an hour till can try again!" 

I also added in some extra rules just for fun, for instance when I roll a 20, I treat as a Mulligan. I can choose to press my luck and roll once more, and if it's still fails then I can't smoke for two hours.

I highly recommend it, not only for the gradual progression, but also the surprising amount of fun you can have with it. Also, be sure to add in a little bit of you. I highly recommend extra rules that make the game your own. For instance, I actually rolled up a full D&D character, and I been playing with that character. He gets bonus experience for every day that I stick with it.

Also, I make no claim to own this idea. If you would like to check out the original article, the link is below.

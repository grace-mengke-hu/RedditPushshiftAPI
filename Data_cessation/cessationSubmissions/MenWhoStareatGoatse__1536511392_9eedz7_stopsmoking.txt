Constant lethargy/sleepiness?

Hi, 

I just want to ask about some of your experiences. I went from cigarettes to vaping, and by the end I was vaping *really* low nicotine content. I don't even have strong cravings, but I'm just so damn tired. I'm on day 3 of no nicotine and for the last couple days I just feel like I can fall asleep at any time. I only really feel awake after a workout and it only lasts a few hours at best, them I'm right back to feeling like I need 16 hours of sleep per day.

I'm not even certain if this is a result of quitting nicotine or just something else. That's why I'm asking: is this a part of nicotine withdrawal? Is it something that's happened to you guys who have quit cigs/nicotine? I'm not particularly irritable or anything, just extremely tired and lethargic. Perpetually sleepy. I guess the absence of a stimulant could do this but what I've read about nic withdrawal seems more like insomnia/depression/irritability/headaches, etc.

Thanks for your time.

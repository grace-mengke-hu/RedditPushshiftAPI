Day 2, using the patch and horribly depressed

My life is going great. But since this afternoon (I put the patch on at midnight at the start of 6 July 2015; it's now 10PM on 7 July where I am), I feel horrifically sad. Lethargic, disinterested in everything, doomed. I haven't smoked in just under 48 hours. 

But there should still be nicotene in my system from the patch so..is this a mental withdrawal? anyone have any similar experiences?

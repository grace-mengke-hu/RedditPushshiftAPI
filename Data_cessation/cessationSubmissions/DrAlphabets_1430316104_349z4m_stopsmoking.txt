How do you guys deal with the pressures of social smoking?

I think the biggest obstacle I am having in my quitting process is other people smoking. And they are everywhere. When I'm  at home, smoking doesn't even cross my mind. But when I'm out, especially at work I am really struggling to make it even two hours at a time because I'm surrounded by other smokers.

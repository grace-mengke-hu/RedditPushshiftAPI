Had a dream about smoking

I've had heard a lot of people having dreams where they smoke, and it's usually at the beginning of smoking cessation. I didn't have any to this point.

At this point 56 days free of smoking, it's been a quite a while without experiencing any discomfort, more likely the opposite - I'm really enjoying not smoking.

Dream I had last night was quite disturbing. Without really thinking I lit a cigarette, and smoked it, and after a while I smoked some more, only later to realize that I don't like doing this. And I was devastated and immediately regretted smoking, and knew that I'm gonna quit right away, and even thought about resetting my badge on this subreddit.

Then I woke up and felt kind of hazy, and then I realized that I didn't really smoke, and was joyful and happy that I'm still holding strong. :)

I've had some failures in the past with quitting smoking, but I think this time is a keeper, have been to some parties where I have been super wasted and didn't even fancy a smoke.

Just wanted to share a bit of my experiences, and wish you luck with living a smoke free life!

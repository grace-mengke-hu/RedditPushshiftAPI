Ecig question

On mobile so my search capabilities are limited. SO and I are cutting back/on our way to quitting and an ecig is coming in very handy. I've noticed in the past when relying more heavily on an ecig that it seems like I get a more frequent and wetter cough. My initial reaction is that maybe an ecig is a bad idea, possibly worse for me than a white knuckle slide out of smoking. Then it occurred to me that I've heard quitting/cutting back will/can cause an increase in cough and production in the beginning while your lungs clear up. Any thoughts or insights appreciated. I'd rather not do any new damage in the process of quitting. Thanks!

Almost 4 weeks without a smoke....now to get my ass into shape. Any advice?

As the title says, now that I've quit smoking, I want to get in shape. I barely exercised or did anything active for the 10 years I smoked. 

Some questions for all you beautiful people out there, anyone else do something similar when trying to quit? Did it help? I know there are some good subreddits out there on exercising and fitness, but any other resources that cater specifically for (nicotine) quitters? One stop shop for someone who is a complete noob about this kind of stuff and is basically starting at square one?

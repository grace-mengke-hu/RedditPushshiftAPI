I want to quit smoking but my constant stress levels worry me.

Been a smoker for about 22 years and to save money and my life and be better for my son I want to quit smoking.  However I have a lot of stress in my life (work, financial, crazy ex that I support) and I'm worried I won't be able to do it.  

I know my motivation for quitting is my 7 year old son I just don't know if I have the willpower to do this.

relapsed on day 5 -_-

So i quit for 5 days, and then i was getting really stressed with myself because everything was pissing me off. Literally the smallest thing. I brought 20 cigs last night and i have smoked 11 of them already, i'm about too smoke my last one in the minute and then i'm gonna flush the rest and continue from there, hopefully cut them out for good. I know i can do it, i've quit before for a year and i started again when i went too college years ago. I think it's because i am bored 99% of the time with whatever i do.. But a good thing is i am not getting cravings like i use too i am just smoking for the sake of it really. Also how do i get a badge? would you say quit smoking today or tomorrow when i've not had any. it would seem more logicial i guess.. i've already 3 cigs this morning already. 

Cheers, hopefully i will kick this habit. I quit weed no problem at all, and i smoked that for 8 years.

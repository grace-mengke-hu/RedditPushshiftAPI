I woke up smelling like cigarettes

Last week I was staying at a cabin in the mountains with some friends from out of state who I hadn't seen since before I quit smoking. I had been looking forward to this trip for months, while also dreading it because every single one of these friends smokes like a chimney. Sure enough, we spent pretty much every evening out on the porch so that my friends could feed their habit. I won't lie--it was HARD to resist. And it put me in a terrible, petulant mood. Why couldn't everyone just put their addiction on hold to make it easier on ME? I knew that was unreasonable, and I knew that in order to spend time with these old friends I had to push through the hard feelings and just sit on that porch with them. So I woke up every morning smelling like smoke, and with a tightness in my chest from secondhand smoke. But I also woke up every morning with pride and determination. And this specific morning I woke up to a 4 month smoke free badge.

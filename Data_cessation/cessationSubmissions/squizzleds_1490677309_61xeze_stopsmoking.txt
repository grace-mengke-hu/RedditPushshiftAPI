Stopped

I tried my first cigarette at 11! 34 now. Yesterday I stopped, on a bad day I was smoking 10.
Mornings are worse as I have bad IBS and anxiety and used cigarettes (I thought) to chill me out before work. 
I feel ok. I carry Allen Carrs book around like some kind of talisman but I'm ok. 
Looking forward to improving my running and not constantly wondering if it's ok to go out and smoke ðŸ˜Š thank you for this sub

Third try, three weeks in

Doing pretty great overall! I've noticed my cravings have really subsided, and are becoming less frequent. I know that it's never really "over" and I need to keep vigilant, but I'm feeling confident that this can stick. 

The thing that surprised me the most was how much smokers reek when I'm out in public! Gah - I guess I really smelled that bad too. S gross. 


I'm really proud of myself for making it this far, and I'm determined to keep it going. I've saved nearly $100, and I just feel healthier overall.

Keep it up, y'all! Im proud of you guys too :)

Had nicotine fits, bought 35g for $18 I'm f*cking done.

Only 25 haven't been a smoker for very long(few years). I'd have to say vaping got me addicted. I never smoked very many cigs but after running out I went to get some rolling tobacco and ended up paying $18 for just over an ounce.

I don't even feel ready for this. I feel like I can't do it. I've smoked pipes, cigs, vaped, dip, chew, everything pretty much all for the nicotine. However I've vaped most often. I'm tired of paying for it most of all. Damn I enjoy it a lot but I know the consequences and my lungs need a break.

The short lived buzz which is pretty non-existent isn't worth it anymore. 

I feel overwhelmed because I also have a marijuana habit though I don't feel it's as bad as tobacco. I'm scared to quit both at the same time. So I'm gonna start with tobacco. 

This will be my first real attempt at quitting. I REALLY don't want to and I really don't know what to expect. But I have to. I'm officially a slave to it. Can I get some tips? I'm gonna go cold turkey I hear it starts to get better after 72 hours.

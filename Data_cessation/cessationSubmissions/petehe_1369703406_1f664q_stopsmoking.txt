Pretty much mainly posting this to pass 3 minutes

The last time I had a cigarette was Sunday night at 10pm. So as of now it has been roughly 49 hours and 4 minutes. With any luck at 49:07 I won't feel like a cigarette anymore.

I got through yesterday without a hitch, but I was on gum all day. I haven't had any gum today, but I haven't really been craving cigarettes (or, for that matter, gum) until now. I am currently craving a cigarette. It's that time of the morning. Usually right now I'd be getting up from my desk, walking downstairs, probably filling my mug up with tea, and blazing up a durry. 

Part the reason I'm not at the moment, is because I'm busy posting this. That, and if I *was* to smoke a cigarette I would have to walk up to the shop and drop >$20, which is money I don't want to spend on slow suicide. Also, I'm planning to start my day one of [C25K](http://www.reddit.com/r/c25k) this arvo . A cigarette now will drastically work against that.

Aaand thats exactly 3 minutes. Thanks for reading.

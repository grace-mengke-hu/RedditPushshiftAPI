Hello everyone. I’m new, and It’s the morning of day one for me... and there’s quite a strong voice in my head, as expected at the early stages... (do not read if triggered by “evil” voices/messages)

Day One. It’s morning. And they’re all I can think about. Just got to remember that I like breathing, without pain or discomfort, I like running short distances without sweating, I like money: not the disappearance of £50 a week from my wallet for no reason and I like other things besides smoking; they’re not the only thing I get a “kick” out of. 
Just gotta remember that. Cause At the moment, every breath seems to be aching for me to put one in my mouth, just like usual, just like always, and “don’t stop. Don’t you ever think you can stop. You know you can’t. You know you can’t do it. You know you’ll be back on them in a matter of hours. What else are you gonna do? Sit there, thinking about them that’s what! You can’t do anything else. You don’t want to, cause it’s not the same without nicotine running through your veins. Coffee! Ha! You think you can enjoy that without a cigarette?? Maybe the first one, but you know you’re craving something else. You know that even a cup of coffee can’t do it for you by itself. And what about after you eat breakfast? Think you’re not gonna sit there feeling completely agitated until you’ve had that after meal one?”
...(and on and on)

Sorry, that’s the voice of addiction. I’m trying not to listen to it. But I thought I’d get it out here. Because this is what we go Through. If anybody would like to respond to it for me that would be great. 

Cigarettes really are the devil. Now, how do I get this badge?

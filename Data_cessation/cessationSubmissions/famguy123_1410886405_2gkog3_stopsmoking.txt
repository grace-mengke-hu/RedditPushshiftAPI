I'd like to know what moment or event made you decide to quit?

Was it a revelation? Was it a death? Maybe a stop-smoking ad? 
For me, personally, I went to the doctor to do an asthma test and they told me that I have the lung capacity of a 64 year old. I'm almost 26.  That kind of did it for me. 
EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing your stories. Hearing why others have quit seems to help justify me quitting. Plus, i know that i'm not alone. :)

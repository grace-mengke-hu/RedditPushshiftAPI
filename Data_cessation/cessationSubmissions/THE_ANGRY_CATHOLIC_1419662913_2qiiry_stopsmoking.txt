A small victory

I posted about a week ago that I intended to quit using my ecig. Since then things haven't been too dandy and ive continued to use it every day (granted less than before). Well yesterday I was working all day and was busy most of the other time. I looked at the time tonight and saw that it was 1am. Meaning that I went my first day without using my ecig at all. Something I can't remember doing previously.

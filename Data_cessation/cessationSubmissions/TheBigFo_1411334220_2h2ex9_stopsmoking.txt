Hello everyone! I am in need!

Hello everyone. I am currently smoking a cigarette and have 4 left in my pack. I desperately want to quit. I've been smoking 30-40 cigarettes a day since I was 15 years old, I am now 24. This shit is ridiculous. I'm constantly broke and for some reason I've let a chemical tell me it's okay to throw away $300+ a month. I don't have a support system. No friends, I don't really talk to my family, and I work a stressful job(EMS) with a bunch of chain smokers. I'm insanely scared. I feel like I pretty much have a heroin level addiction and don't think I'm strong enough to stop.  How do I do this? I've read countless articles on how to stop and my brain always says "that won't work, we'll find a better method another day". Give me your wisdom and guidance. Be the people that I don't want to let down. 

Thanks in advance to any replies and sorry for the wall of text.

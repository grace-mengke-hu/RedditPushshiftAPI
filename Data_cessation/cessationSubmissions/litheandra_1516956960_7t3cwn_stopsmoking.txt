Need advice on Nicotine Patches

Hey, guys. 
I decided to quit smoking using nicotine patches, nicorette, first step. I used to smoke for 10 years, last two-three years 20-25 cigarettes/day. 

The problem is that math simply doesn't add up, and Internet is of no help. Basically, 20-25 cigarettes (light) is 15-20 mg of nicotine (20 mg/day is max), but patch is 25 mg. Should I jump into step 2 (15 mg) or let it be?

I feel quite good, except crazy amounts of drowsiness that prevent me from working and thinking clearly. I didn't have so much of cravings, only habitual thoughts ("oh, I just ate, I need to go to smoke!" kind of thing). I guess it's to come, but I'm utterly confused of whether to stay on step 1 or move to lower dosages. 

Thanks a lot in advance!

I'm going to quit. Smoked my last cigarette this morning.

After posting yesterday to introduce myself, and getting a couple really good comments, I'm going to do it. I downloaded an app to help me quit, and looked at a book that someone suggested to get. I smoked my last cigarette this morning, and so far so good. I'm sure the next few days will be really hard, but I'm glad to have a community like this that will help and support me. So, thanks!

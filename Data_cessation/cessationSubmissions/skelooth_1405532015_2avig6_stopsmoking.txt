After 10 days, the physical withdrawal symptoms and cravings have stopped.

I went from smoking 2 packs a day to quitting cold turkey. It was difficult. It physically did not feel nice. I couldn't focus, I was constantly anxious and sad and hungry. After day 8 the effects started lessening, and now on day 10, knock on wood, I feel pretty good. Just gotta stay strong and it's not so bad on the other side!

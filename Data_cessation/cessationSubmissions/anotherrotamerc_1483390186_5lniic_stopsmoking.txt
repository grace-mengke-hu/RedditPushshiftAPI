Just passed 25 hours!

I have smoked for 38 years. I'm using Chantix just to feel like I have a chance of making it. 2 packs a day for quite a long time have made the addiction seem insurmountable but I finished a pack yesterday early afternoon and just let it go. 

I hope to have a good reason to report in here every day or two and will support everyone who wants to get free, no matter how long you've been in chains.

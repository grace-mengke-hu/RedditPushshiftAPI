When you quit, keep on "buying cigarettes"!

I know what you're thinking - "What the fuck?"

Just hear me out.

Most of the time, people who quit (and relapse) never really notice the extra money, and can't use it as a motivator. They just spend more on other things and don't really notice it.

Do this instead - go to your bank and open a savings account. Transfer $5.00 or whatever your cigarettes cost per pack every time you would have smoked a pack. (pack a day = $5/day, pack every two days = $5/two days...)

You can see actual money add up very quickly, and its a HUGE motivator.

So keep on "buying those cigarettes" when you quit, and you won't just see an estimated number on an app, you will see actual, tangible money in your savings account.

Any long time smokers turn it around physically?

I'm 29 and have smoked a pack a day since I was 17. For the longest I was fine. Could still run a 5-6 minute mile, play hours of pickup basketball every night without missing a beat, workout, do anything. I was capable. About 4 years ago I stopped all physical activity. I didn't get fat but I got completely out of shape. All the things I shielded myself from by always being physically active have now come crashing down. My hair's falling out, my face is becoming worn, and I get winded and sweat from cleaning my car out for 5 minutes. 

I'm done smoking but I'm fearful I won't be able to get back to where I was even 3 years ago.

So are there any long term smokers that were able to get it back, at least the physical capability? Thanks.

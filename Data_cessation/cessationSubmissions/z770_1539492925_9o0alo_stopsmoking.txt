Rehab for people quitting to smoke and get healthy?

Is there an inpatient rehab support center for people trying to quit smoking and develop other healthy habits in america? I'm asking for my mother who is in her 60s but has been a smoker most of her life, has diabetes, high blood pressure, and has had 2 strokes - for all of that she's pretty active and ok but she needs an all day medical/rehab support place that you can't smoke, encourages healthy eating and physical activity. Does this exist?

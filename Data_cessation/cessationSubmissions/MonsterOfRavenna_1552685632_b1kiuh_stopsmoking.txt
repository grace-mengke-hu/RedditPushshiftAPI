One Week In: Feeling Uncertain

I quit smoking a week ago and while the really bad withdrawal symptoms have gone away, I am in a constant battle with myself as to whether or not I actually want to do this.  A part of me really isn't ready to give it up and is thinking of this as a "break" rather than quitting, while another part knows that if I go back to smoking I'll just be making things harder for myself later on when I want to quit again.  Anyone experience something similiar?

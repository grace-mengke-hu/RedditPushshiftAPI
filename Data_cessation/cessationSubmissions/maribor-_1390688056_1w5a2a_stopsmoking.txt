I can't understand...

My short story. Sorry for bad english, but I must tell someone so...

I smoked for 13 years, in the end 30 cigarettes a day. On nights out even 60... I try to quit before and I think the longest I managed was less then a day heh. One day my co-workers decide they will quit. I knew they wouldn't last more than few hours, so I join them in this. I really never want to quit. Just for fun, to see how long will I last. So it begins..

Day 1 - Nothing

Day 2 - Nothing

...

Day 100 - Nothing

Day 200 - Nothing

...



Till today. Since first day I was exposed to smoke every day. All of my friends, co-workers and also parents smoke. Never stay out of the way of people who smoke, just doing stuff I was doing before, but without cigarette. I never needed or think about one, I'm not nervous or agitated. I didn't even cough once since I quit. Like I never smoked. Before I can not even start a day without a smoke, I was a wreck without it, my hands were shaking and so on...


I can not understand why. This is the easiest thing I did in my entire life. Changing my phone case with new one is harder then this. I know many don't have this luck, but I wish you would.


I quit somewhere around the end of march last year, so soon it will be 1 year.

96 hours. Chantix.

I quit smoking at 8:30pm on new years eve. I've been trying for years to quit and would get a few days here and there with the nicotine patch. It never held because I was just as addicted to the patch as I was with smokes so I'd take it off after day 2/3 and smoke. 
Chantix helps. I'm only gonna take it for 3 weeks and only 0.5mg twice a day. The side effects are a bit shitty but hard to tell if it's the not smoking of chantix. 
Hope everyone is succeeding in their goals today. It's a fucking massive change and it's really hard but it will save my life.

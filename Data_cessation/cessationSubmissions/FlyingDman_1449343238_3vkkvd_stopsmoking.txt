"Or just quit ..."

Yesterday in the bar, after some gintonics, I lost my pack of cigs. I checked  the floor, on the table near me but couldn't find 'em. So I told my sister: "Ey, I lost my cigs again (second time already)."
"Oh again?! You moron, take one from me."
And then 8a voice, from a girl i like: 

"Or you just quit."

So the night went on, I didnt't quit instead I just bought a new pack. More drinking, more smoking.

Today around midday I woke up, a very slight headache but nothing serious. I get up, grab a cup  of coffe and walk of to the balcony. I sit down, light one up. 

As I am almost finished smoking, thinkong about nothing special, a strong thoght get i my mind. And I can even hear it coming out of own mouth without wanting to say anything.

"Or you  just quit."

I extiguish the small rest of my cig, thinking: Yes, i stop now. Finish. 

And i really want to stop. I used to smoke a lot. Today is the first smokefree day. 

Sorry for the story, just wanted to share it with somebody who doesn't know me.

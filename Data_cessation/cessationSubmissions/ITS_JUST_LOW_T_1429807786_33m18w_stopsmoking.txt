50 days.

So today Is my 50th day not smoking. According to my app, I have not smoked 796 cigarettes that I otherwise would have. I've saved $278.25, and 3 days 7 hours and 34 minutes of time that I would have spent smoking (assuming 6 minutes per cigarette).

I've tried to quit in the past, but always put it off. Tried the e-cig route but it actually made things worse (developed a pretty bad cough and lost lung capacity). 50 days ago my girlfriend gave me a cold. I woke up to a sore throat and wen't about my day. After my second class, I realized I didn't have my cigarettes, and it was 3:00. 

I literally hadn't thought about them the entire day, and at this point the thought of smoking was just making my throat even more sore. I decided to try and go the rest of the day. My throat was sore for about a week, at which point I thought I would probably start smoking again. Nope. The cold may be gone, but for some reason the desire for smoking never really came back. It's a very strange feeling but as of the last few weeks I honestly hardly think about smoking. The only reason I'm even posting this is because my app sent me a notification congratulating me on my progress.

Tl;Dr: Best of luck to all of you trying to quit, and I hope you all get bad colds.

It's been 5 days and I'm having severe withdrawal symptoms, PLEASE help me.

First of all, thank you for clicking on this post. I didn't smoke but I used Snus which is a form of chewing tobacco. The kind I had used has 48mg nicotine per portion in it, whereas a cigarette has 12mg-18mg nicotine in it. I've used snus for about two years and since about one month i started doing it more and more. I took one every 40 minutes, about 16-20 per day. On friday I've had enough and finally had the courage to stop.

On friday/saturday it was just the cravings but since sunday it has gone DOWNHILL. First headache, then sweating, diarrhea, massive farting, shakiness, fatigue, loss of concentration and anxiety. Today I have a sore throat on top of all these symptoms. When will it get better? How can I reduce the symptoms? Should I go to the gym and exercis, if yes, cardio or lifting?

I'm really really trying and I really want to stop, I've spent more than 4k $ on this shit called snus.

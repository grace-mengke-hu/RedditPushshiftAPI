any advice for a first time quitter?

So, I decided to stop smoking around 3 days ago, and its going okay. I've had quite bad headaches but I'm not sure if it's related! I'm 22 and ive been smoking for 5 years, around 15-20 roll ups a day (yuk I know). It's my first ever attempt and I am a little bit nervous.
so far my plan has been;


- drinking tea instead of coffee (coffee and a cigarette together all the time) and drinking more of it seems to help me when I get a craving

- started cooking more; I've always known how to cook but I am very lazy. I've just had chicken in red wine sauce :) it seems to help me take my mind off smoking.

- chucked away every single smoking item or accessory in my house and cleaned it top to bottom, getting rid of the smell especially in my room. 

- set myself a reward system, using the money I save from smoking!


I was just wondering if I'm right in doing these and if you have any other tips or suggestions for me to make sure I don't ever go back! 

thanks :)

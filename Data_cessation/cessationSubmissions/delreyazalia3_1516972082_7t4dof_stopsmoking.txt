This is it I need to stop please help

Female, turning 21 in April. Helllllp. Started when I turned 14. I have associated smoking with everything. My close friend died 4 years ago in May, we always smoked together and I used smoking as a means to get over her death, and every time her anniversary rolls around I smoke so so much more. I don’t wanna do that this year. I don’t want to smoke anymore at all. I have an amazing boyfriend who doesn’t smoke and has always tried to help me quit, it’s so horrible for him and i want to smell good for him and myself, be healthy, all the other benefits. Besides him though every one of my friends smoke. It’s incredibly difficult to be around them and not smoke. I’ve tried to quit several times but always end up cracking on a night out and go straight back to it. I got the smoke free app (and I mean I set the date to quit on this thing several times a week and crack every single time) I’ve set the date now to my last smoke, today at 12pm gmt, it’s now 1pm. I’m gonna throw away the last of my pack (always been a difficult thing to do) and I want to be a real non smoker now, I always tell myself ‘I can have one on a night out’ or ‘one in a few months’ and just no. I need to never smoke a cigarette again. My boyfriend is a great influence for this and my family too but I just want to hear that I’m not alone and feel like others are with me.
Give me strength to have my own strength! 
My motivation and will power in life in general is shit.
Thanks guys

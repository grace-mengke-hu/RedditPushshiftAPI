How do you know when you're ready to quit?

Just a little background: I'm still young, only 20 years old. I hope that doesn't take away from this post, or make it less "serious." I've been smoking since I was 13 and by the time I was 14 or 15 I was smoking a pack a day. Lately I've noticed that whenever I go out with friends on the weekend, I'll smoke a pack a night. 

Everyone says you're unable to quit until you know you're ready, and I guess I have absolutely no idea what that means. Smoking is not cool, I hate the way I smell, I hate the disgusting phlegmy coughing, it's all around an embarrassing habit for a 20 year old (especially). I hack worse than my mom, who's been smoking for 40 some years. Sometimes I truly hate smoking with such a passion.

But smoking becomes such a ritual, almost a friend. Have a bad day? Chain smoke. Going on a lengthy drive? Chain smoke. Work kicking your ass? It's time to go outside for a smoke break. Then, anyone dealing with bouts of depression understands that relationship with tobacco addiction. I keep telling myself that once I start seeing a counsellor, I'll stop smoking.

I'm torn and kind of rambling, so I apologize. I just don't want to waste a patches kit if I'm not mentally ready to give these bastards up. I know you guys can't get in my head and figure this out for me, but how did you all know that you were ready to quit? Was it some sort of epiphany?

Thanks guys.

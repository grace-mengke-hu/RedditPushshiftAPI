Is it wrong that I miss it? Should I be worried?

I was in a strange headspace when I quit - I generally knew that I needed to quit, I was coughing brutally hard in the mornings... and yet part of me would love to just have some sort of weak-ass reason to bail on the whole thing and go back to old habits.

I'm holding out under the assumption that it's the addiction itself playing games with my head, but... can anyone else weigh in?

You can do it! 2 years smoke free

Thank you fellow Redditors for maintaining such an amazing community! You guys helped me quit smoking and I've been smoke free for over two years now.

Three years ago I decided to quit. It wasn't easy. I found this sub and subscribed to it for fun. I never posted here, instead this was just a sub I would occasionally read. Everytime I scrolled through Reddit aimlessly, I usually saw a post from this sub about how someone was quitting or motivating others to stop. Everytime I saw these posts, they kind of got stuck in the back of my head and pushed me away from that next cigarette. I would Reddit often enough, to see these posts often enough, to push that next ciagette far enough, until I eventually kind of just stopped. Don't get me wrong IT TOOK A LOT OF WILL POWER. But in the end it's all in your head, do yourself a favor and just don't have that next smoke. It sucks.

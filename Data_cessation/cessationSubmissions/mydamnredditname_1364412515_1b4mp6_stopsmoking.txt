Day 3...

Hi all! I had my final cigarette this past Sunday night. I've been a smoker for 31-years...starting when I was 16. Hell, back then we could still buy our smokes from a vending machine.

I've quit twice before and each time it lasted about 8-months. The first time I used Zyban. The 2nd time I tried nicotine replacement using the lozenges. Each time it was hanging around smokers that got me smoking again. Of course, it wasn't their fault I started back...but being around that temptation was too much.

For my 3rd attempt I am using Chantix. I was hesitant to get the prescription because of the possible side-effects. So far so good on the side effects. I am grumpy...but, really, I'm usually a cranky guy anyway.

I think the big difference this time is that I want to quit more than ever. The last two times I *knew* I should quit, but didn't really *want* to quit. This time I got to the point where everything about smoking just disgusted me - the taste, the smell, the cost - just everything.

I know it's a going to be a battle to give these things up for good...but I really think I can do it this time.

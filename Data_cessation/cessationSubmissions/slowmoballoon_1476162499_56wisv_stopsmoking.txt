It takes 21 days to make a habit...

Or so I've heard. 21 Days without a smoke. 21 days.      

I won't lie it's been a ride. I'm staying strong though, even in the wake of friends and co-workers lighting up in front of me. I guess can deal with that. It's harder to deal with the random faint smell of smoke on the street. Sometimes it smells like shit; other times it makes me crave one. I get that faint urge, that urge that creeps up out of nowhere.      

That nagging, relentless urge that makes you wants to forget all that hard work you put in. It makes you want to forget all of those 21 days. It makes you want to forget all of those proud moments. It makes you want to forget about all that money saved.       

But, you will **not** give in. You're closer to one month than you thought you'd ever be. You're closer to forming that new habit than breaking that habit. You're closer to being a non-smoker!       

Don't give in to that evil, sneaky urge. Unwrap some bubble gum and blow some huge bubbles, doodle on a napkin, go walk around, do some breathing exercises, find some flowers to sniff, write a haiku, stand on your head, high-five the person next to you (If you're alone, clap for yourself((You deserve it))), go look in the mirror and say, "HEY! You can do this! You're awesome!"      

21 days and still counting.

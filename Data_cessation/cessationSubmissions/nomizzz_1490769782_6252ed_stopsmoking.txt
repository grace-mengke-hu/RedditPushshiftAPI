Fighting Grief Relapse!

I quit almost a year ago now, but my mother who suffers from ALS and is fully locked-in plans to withdraw her ventilator life support and pass away next Wednesday.

The grief from my mother's impending death is driving me towards a smoking relapse. I'm trying to remind myself a smoking relapse is the last thing my mother would want, but the grief and stress of caregiving while helping her plan is overwhelming and feels like it needs an outlet.

Has anyone had a relapse or come close due to unprocessable grief? If so how'd you snap out of it or recover?

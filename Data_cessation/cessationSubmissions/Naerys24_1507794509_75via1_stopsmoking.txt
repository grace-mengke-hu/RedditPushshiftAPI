I feel hopeless

Hey everyone! 
I have posted here before twice I think? Last one was over a year ago and I still haven't managed to quit.
I am at a loss right now. My situation is the following (sorry I am not a good storyteller and I'm probably all over the place):
Where I live cigarettes are very very expensive. I am rolling and a patch is around 30$. So when I am trying to quit I always try to make sure it's near the end of that package. Though it often ends when I'm not "prepared" enough or something like that. That one problem. 
In the last year I actually quit probably like 10 times or more. Always fail after 1-4 days. Why am I failing? Something goes wrong like the dishwasher falls apart and I can't handle it. Or I am going out with friends and because I have Anxiety and can't deal with this without my crutch.
Or I end up in a really bad depressive mood and even suicidal thoughts.
I actually quit yesterday. But today I was sitting around doing nothing, pretty bored and couldn't deal with that. I thought: when I could at least smoke...

FYI I have clinical depression, so it makes the depressive moods while quitting almost unbearable. 
So do you guys have any suggestions? I would like to quit right now, but I always make a huge investment when I buy another pack. How do I decide the right time to quit, and how the hell do I make myself stick to it? I just feel like I tried everything and I'm just a lost cause.
Btw I tried Alan Carr (which I actually still believe in but it doesn't really work anymore), medication such as zyban, vaping, gums and all that shit...

Hope I'll hear sth from you! You all are so helpful and nice I'm glad that I found a community like this.

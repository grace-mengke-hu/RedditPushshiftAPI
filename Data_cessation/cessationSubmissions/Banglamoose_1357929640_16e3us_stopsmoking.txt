I want to quit smoking, but I am too afraid to let go of the crutch I use to deal with stress.

Can anyone tell me their success stories in quitting smoking when they smoked mainly to relieve extreme stress and anxiety? What is the first thing I need to do to let go of this unhealthy crutch and learn to deal with my anxiety and stress without cigarettes? Note: I have general anxiety disorder and experience panic attacks on a regular basis. I am also overwhelmed with work, grad school, and taking care of my 17 month old son.

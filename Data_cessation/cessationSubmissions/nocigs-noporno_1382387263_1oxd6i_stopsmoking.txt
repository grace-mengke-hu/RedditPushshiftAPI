Sometimes i forget that i even smoked.

Today i was read reddit and drinking some coffee.  When it hit me i felt like i wanted a cigarette.  I was a little confused lmao.  I was a pack day a smoker for 7 years.  Quite using the allen carr book.  Funny how that feeling hit me.  I have really forgot about smoking.  That alil scary and good in the same way.  Happy bc i quite yay im health and what not but then my scum bag brain goes.  Why not just light one up.  Come on it was so easy to quite.  JUST ONE.  But i know all to well that it will never be just one.  Just one is never just one.  First it will be just one.  then it will be just a pack.  ooo after this pack.  Then ooo shit i gotta Quite.  I'm fully hooked again.  How the fuck did that happen.  So thats not going to happen.  Going back to putting it behide me and moving on.  Good luck everybody.  If you really want it.  You'll find a way.  Peace.

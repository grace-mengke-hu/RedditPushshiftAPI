Premeditated relapse? Day 5

I understand this may sound ridiculous to some, even to me. But a friend suggested to me that after quitting long enough to get the nicotine out of your system, intentionally start up again. But attach smoking to less things when you start again. No driving, not after food, you get the picture. Psychologically this makes sense but I'm doing pretty good with minimal cravings no anxiety, really no negative effects at all. Its just almost reflex to reach for a cig when driving or after a meal/drinking. Which is where I found my pitfalls in previous attempts.

Thoughts on cravings? Help needed!

Hey guys. So I've read hundreds of times that cravings last a relatively short time but I find that mine last a very long time  and would appreciate some outside perspective on this. 

So previously when I've quit I can go the whole day at work feeling great. No problem. Then I leave work and that little voice gets louder and louder on the 45 minute trip home. That's 45 minutes were the idea of a cigarette feels like a good idea. 

How do you nip it in the bud so quickly. Initially I tell my self that is not what I really want and half think that the craving is gone but I eventually wind up doing it anyway for some stupid justification. And obviously it does not feel good and I end up throwing the pack away and repeating the process all over again.

I really do want to quit. I can almost feel my health, mentality and life slipping away. 

So I suppose my question is :

How can I stop dwelling on the craving and allowing it to last so long?

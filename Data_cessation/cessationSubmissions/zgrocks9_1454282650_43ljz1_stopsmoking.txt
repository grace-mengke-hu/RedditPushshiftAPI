What have you used to begin your journey?

Hi all, 

Im a smoker of 8 years, I've had periods of nonsmoking ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months but I haven't been able to maintain it. I feel like I am stuck in a rut. I want to quit, but I just can't push myself to follow through. 

What are some ways you all have used to help get you out of this rut? 

Thanks!

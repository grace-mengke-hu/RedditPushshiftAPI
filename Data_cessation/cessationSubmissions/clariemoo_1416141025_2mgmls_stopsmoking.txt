Approaching 3 months of quit :) Benefits after putting up withdrawal period!

I'm so excited about this! These are the benefits I have noticed now:

* The real nasty quitters flu(s) seemed to have stopped after month 2

* Breathing so much better ("deeper") and notice a huge improvement in endurance when jogging

* I picked up a bunch of new hobbies :) to help change routine without smoke breaks and get into new habits

* Not stressed out like before and feelings of depression seemed to have been gone for good after month 1 and I feel full of energy! Mind feels positive and not "clouded" anymore

* Cravings are inexistant, and don't think about smoking or missing one now

* Healthier looking hair and skin 

* Weight loss so far: since smoking I must have lost 4 kg through regular cardio and calorie-counting. however month 1 was full of doubt with lots of digestive issues and bloating and was afraid i had effed up my metabolism.



I'm still going through some constipation (steadily getting back on track) issues and insomnia but it is so much better than 2 months back!

Backstory: smoked on and off a few months this past year. Thought my body and mind wasn't addicted to nicotine... boy was i wrong... Withdrawal effects were horrible (month 1 and 2 were nasty) but glad I stuck it out and see only improvements!

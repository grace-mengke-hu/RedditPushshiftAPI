Something similar to the smokefree app but on computer ?

Hello everyone!

I set my quitting date and it's approaching big time. My last cigarette will be the day of the ending of my art jury (i'm in art school, its a really stressfull sort of exam).

However, I recently lost my phone of 2 years and as I'm a broke college student, I can't spend the money on a new smartphone anytime soon.

My question was, is there a sort of "online"/browser website that I can use on my computer in the same way one would use the smokefree app ? It seems to help people from here a lot. I think it would be a good motivator. I almost always have my laptop with me anyway so I could log in and see my progress quite often. 

Thanks everyone!

I've smoked off and on, and then solidly, for the last 25 years. I started when was 15, am 41 now. 

I quit Jan 2011 and that lasted until my mother passed away that December. I went back home to help my father clean out her stuff. She had a pack of camels. Came home and husband and I basically picked right back up. 

From there until a couple of weeks ago we tried cold turkey, vaping, gums, etc. There was always a stressor or excuse to make. Plus, I am diagnosed BP II, depressive, and diabetic. A lot of my smoking was a reward and energy provider and quitting felt impossible. 

My husband and I have been smoke-free for 18 days so far. It was a combination of issues with our teeth, our health, getting old, period--and yet another person in my family who also smoked, being diagnosed with cancer and another ex-smoker friend also going through chemo that really drove the point home to this idiot. 

I don't find the cravings any less hard when they hit. But they do hit less. I still can't watch someone smoke on TV, and I still have to be careful to keep discussion of it short with my husband. I can't walk through a cloud of it without wanting one, despite how it smells. And of course, this week, we may or may not? be hit with a maybe? maybe not? really bad hurricane and I am struggling through some urges there. 

Anyway--I've made it so far, and I want to keep it up! I wanted to tell anyone who has been smoking for decades and thinking you can't--you CAN. There is no easy fix. There's really no perfect way. It is tough and it is hard and it is an addiction and habit that are very, very hard to break. 

But we can! We can do this!   
Here's to 18 more days, and hopefully, years of being free to come!

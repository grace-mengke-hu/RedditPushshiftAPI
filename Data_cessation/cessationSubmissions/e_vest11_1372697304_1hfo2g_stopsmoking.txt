I wrote this about Nicotine, but it also applies to a bad relationship I went through.

It's been awhile now without you. Everybody said it would be easier as time went on but at this point I am not sure. I still think about you way too much, and while the times we shared together were nice, I have come to realize you are an addictive poison. All those times I thought you were bringing me up, you were bringing me down. I know it was not your intent. I mean, you were just there, I was the one that gave in. But it was foolish for me to do so.  So now I can't be anywhere around you or I start to feel anxious. It's strange, I used to turn to you in times like these, and now you are the main problem.  I wish things were different. Had I been strong enough not to let the problem slip out of control, I could've been able to still enjoy your company from time to time. But I fucked up, I grew a dependency and now I have to make things right. I want to say I will look back on your companionship with warm thoughts, but I don't think that will be easy. I will certainly miss it, I still miss it everyday, but I am doing the right thing.   It's weird what at one time caused me so much joy can cause me so much grief. But life has a tendency to do that. Sometimes you have to be severely tested to see what your made of, how tough you truly are. And the test continues...
 
I'll miss you Nicotine. Think fondly of me.

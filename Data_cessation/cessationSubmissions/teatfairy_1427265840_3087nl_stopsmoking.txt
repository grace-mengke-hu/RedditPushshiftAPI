Just realized I didn't even introduce myself

Hello! I'm joining the ranks of non-smokers slowly! Today is day 1! I'm 24 and I smoked 1/2 - 1 pack a day for 11 years. I have a wonderful son, a long term relationship, a job, and I'm in school to be a sign language interpreter. 

I have struggled with ocd since childhood and recently (ish) overcame agoraphobia. Life outside the house is nice!

I decided to quit last night to pursue a little fantasy of mine... I'm going to train myself to be a contortionist! I've always been fascinated with contortionists and now I will hopefully be on my way to becoming one. 

I have my first nicotine patch on and I haven't had a smoke since 1:00pm. I have a quit app to track my progress and now I have r/stopsmoking! 

I look forward to this journey! (But I'm also kind of scared...)

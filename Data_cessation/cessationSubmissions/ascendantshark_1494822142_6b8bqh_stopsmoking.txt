Riding in a car with a smoker

Got a free ride, but there was a smoker in the car. I smell like menthol cigs now and it's disgusting. Started off the trip breathing easy, by the end I had a dry throat and was coughing occasionally. I even opened my window whenever they would light up, but man hopefully all this coin I'm saving from quitting will help me get my own ride. Just a reminder that an open window doesn't really do much while smoking in the car.

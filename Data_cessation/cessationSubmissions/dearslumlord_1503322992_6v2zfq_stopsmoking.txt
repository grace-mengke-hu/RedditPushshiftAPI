67 days!!

Wow, this feels weird. Don't even know what to say, really. I've used Swedish snus to quit smoking cigarettes (in particular, General snus), and it has helped tremendously.

Here's to hoping I don't pick this habit back up once I'm back in college...that was where I picked it up a few years ago :/ (I first attended when I was 18...took some time off and now I'm going back at 21)

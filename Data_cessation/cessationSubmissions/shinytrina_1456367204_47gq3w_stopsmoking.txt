Something I have noticed regarding my sugar levels

I am a type 1 diabetic and am working on day 5 of my quit, I put out my last cigarette at 11:25am EST Saturday.  I have noticed as of the past like 3 days that my sugars seem to constantly be on the low side.  I am wondering if any fellow diabetics have noticed the same thing?

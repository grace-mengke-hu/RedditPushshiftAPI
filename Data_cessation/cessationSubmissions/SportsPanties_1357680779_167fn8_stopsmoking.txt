To the person that suggested Allen Carr's "Easyway to Quit"

I wish I had made a note of who linked it, but I ran across this subreddit Thursday.  Someone recommended Allen Carr's "Easyway to Quit Smoking", and I began reading it over the weekend.  When Carr began writing about companion cigarettes, and later trigger events, I began to think, and I noticed that he also wrote "Easyway to Quit Drinking."  As Scotch and Camel lights are like peanut butter and jelly to me, I finished both books last night, poured my last glass and had my last smoke.  

A week ago the idea of never having a whiskey and cigarette again was enough to make me want to drive to the store and then not leave my apartment for a couple days.  

Sincerely, to whoever posted the link, as well as anyone who posted before I was aware of this sub (and to Mr. Carr of course), Thank You on account of all those that you helped!  

I have all the confidence that those were the last drink and smoke I will *ever* have, and I feel genuinely foolish for this information having to be pointed out for me.  The weight I didn't feel this morning (even with a slightly unrestful night) was a small thing, but beautiful.

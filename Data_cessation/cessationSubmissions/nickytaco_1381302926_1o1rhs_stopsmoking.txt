Day 3- grandad going into pallative care. Help!

So today is my third day without cigarettes. I found out last night that my grandad is going into pallative care and they are going to stop treating him and just make him comfortable. I always hear great things about this sub and I'm struggling. I really don't want to start smoking again.

Struggling, on and off again smoker

Tried the patch, no longer works.  Tried cutting down, nada.  Tried reading the book, still struggling.  I am at an end and don't want to be a smoker in 2017!  I am thinking of trying an ecig or one of those 300-800 puffers.  Do they work and if so, which one should I get today?  Also, I'll admit it since I know you all understand, as a cancer survivor, THIS IS KILLING ME!!! (cancer was not smoking related, but it freaks me out).  Help.

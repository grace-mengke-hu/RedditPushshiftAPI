having the most difficult day ever

had a bunch of shit things happen to me today and discovered my housemate smoking inside the house. when i smell cigarette smoke that close to me it honestly makes me see red. all i have thought about all day is how easy and nice it would be, amidst this mental breakdown i appear to be having, to light up a cig and kiss goodbye to my woes for a blissful five minutes

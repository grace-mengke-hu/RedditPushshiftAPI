Guhhh all I want to do is smoke

Alright so I’m 31, had been a smoker more than half my life (which sounds weird when I say that) 

Went to a hypnotist 5 days ago and counting to help kick it.

Today has been THE WORST, I am working with a bunch of guys who I haven’t seen for a while as I travel for work and most of them smoke, first couple of days it wasn’t so bad, I thought great! That’s the response I wanted to seeing them smoking. Today however has been foot tappingly, hands running through hair-ly, frustratingly bad for me...all I want to do is take one off one of the guys....

It’s the weirdest thing because the last 5 days feel both incredibly long and short at the same time, I gave up for a year a few years back and god damn it I don’t remember it being this hard...

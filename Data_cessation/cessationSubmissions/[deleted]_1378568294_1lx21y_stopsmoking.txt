How do I deal with the unreasonable rage?

I switched to ecigarettes, made it six days, relapsed, and am back to ecigs which is great except I am pissed off all the time.

My boyfriend dips and he was supposed to quit with me and he's already given up which pissed me off to the point where he slept on the couch last night and I haven't said more than five words to him in two days.  I nanny for a living and **everything** the kid does pisses me off.  I'm short with my six year old and just irritated with everyone who exists.

I know logically that I am overreacting but I just feel so mad.  I'm even still getting a small amount of nicotine from the ecigs so it isn't even because of withdrawal.  What the fuck is wrong with me?

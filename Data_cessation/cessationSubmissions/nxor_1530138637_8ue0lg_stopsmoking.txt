Keeping it up, forever

Feel like I have to post after having cravings. I am over a year in, and recently spent some time back in my old city where I used to live (and smoke like a chimney!). Met lots of old friends and some life stresses steered me towards lighting up. I didn't though, but the thought agitated me. I love you all for your support, you guys &amp; gals are my pillars. Lots of love &lt;3 :)

Helping a friend quit, need advice

Hello,

I'm trying to help a friend of mine to quit smoking. He is on a two week streak, but yesterday when another friend lit up, he really really wanted to smoke. I told him no, and he smokeed some dank instead to keep him from smoking a cig. I wanna keep him on his two week streak that he is on so far, but when he asked if he could have a couple puffs, and I told him not to, he looked so broken. I just wanna know if I was correct in doing that, or if it is beneficial to allow him to have just a few puffs.


If this kind of thing happens again where he really craving a cig, would it be beneficial if I let him take a few puffs, or should I make him go cold turkey?

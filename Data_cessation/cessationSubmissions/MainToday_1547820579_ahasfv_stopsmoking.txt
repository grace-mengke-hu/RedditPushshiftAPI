Cough and cold from quitting?

I'm on day 10 and feeling really good about it :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've smoked for about 5 years, 10-15 a day. I quit once before for about a month, but I feel much more serious about it this time. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, both times I've quit I seem to get the smokers cough (non-smokers cough?) It just feels like a regular cold and cough. But I'm getting really sick of feeling like this :( I quit in the first place cause I'd got the flu and figured when I hadn't smoked for a couple of days that I should keep going with it. So I got better for a day or so, now my lungs seem to be doing their thing and making me feel shitty again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to use it as motivation to stay serious and remember that I never wanna do this again, and I'm trying to be grateful and remember that it's most likely my body healing itself. But it's such a pain in the ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else got experience of this? When did it happen for you? / When did it clear up? Any advice for soothing my grumpy self?

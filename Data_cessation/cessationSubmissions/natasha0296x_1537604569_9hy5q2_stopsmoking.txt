Day 23 no smoking, first time drinking today... itâ€™s my friends birthday so we will be out drinking and I am so anxious when I drunk before I smoked a lot, Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll give in and I really do not want to. Any tips to keep strong I havenâ€™t had any temptation so far and want to stay strong!ðŸ’œ

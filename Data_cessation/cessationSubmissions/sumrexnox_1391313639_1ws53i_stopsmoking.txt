It's possible to win.

It's been 582 days when i'm posting this.  I want everyone to know just how far i've come in dealing with my addiction.  About 7 months ago I quit my job and moved to another state, and started an ecig company*.  I said that so i can relate to you all how easy it would be for me to walk into my stock room, right now, grab a bottle of some juice and start using nicotine again. It's been that way since i started the company, and i havent. broken. once.  The thought crosses my mind every now and then, but i dismiss it immediately in most cases.  You can do it too.  One step at a time.





*I wholesale, and dont want your money.  i will not mention the name or area in which i operate.

Why am I getting mad cravings all of a sudden?

Hello everyone, I'm just curious if anyone else has gone through this. The first few months were absolutely no problem, but all of a sudden I find myself craving a cigarette really badly several times a day. I don't want to give in but I am very tempted. Thoughts?

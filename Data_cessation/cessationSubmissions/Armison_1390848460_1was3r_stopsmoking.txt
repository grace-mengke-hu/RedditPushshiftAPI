Thank you r/stopsmoking for helping me be one year nicotine free

During my lurking phase, seeing your posts on my front page every day made me face my addiction rather than retreat into denial.

You told about Allen Carr and I'm glad I read it despite my skepticism. I disagree with Carr on a number of things, but the book sure got me hating smoking and looking forward to breaking free. I quit before I even finished the book, with three packs left in my carton.

I didn't set a quit date so the anxiety could build to peak levels. I didn't say I would stop 'when I finish this pack' so each cigarette would appear more precious. I just decided one morning that I didn't want to keep hurting myself and I quit.

In addition to you guys and Carr, the materials by Joel Spitzer and John Polito over at WhyQuit.com were immensely helpful. Understanding what was happening in my mind and body and having strategies for dealing made the experience much easier. I am convinced that quitting is primarily a mental challenge. Physical withdrawal is very real, but the way you think about it makes all the difference. 

I really love being a non-smoker. Kicking nicotine to the curb is a lot easier than your addicted brain (and the NRT industry) tells you.

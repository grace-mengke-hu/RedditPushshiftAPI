30 days! And passed some key tests.

I've been wondering what would happen if I was in a social situation and another smoker offered me one. 

I've been worried about craving a cigarette when I drink, and if I were to smoke weed.

Over Christmas I faced all of these tests. There was a gathering, my uncle offered to go out for a cigarette and I said I don't smoke anymore. I drank, which I had been putting off because I was scared I would smoke. Same with smoking a bit of weed socially. It was fine.

I wasn't even tempted. It feels good.

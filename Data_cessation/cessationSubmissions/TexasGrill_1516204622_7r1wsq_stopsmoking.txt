Day 10 for me. Seems almost too easy. I'm cautious of the future.

First post here.  I read Carr's book, I'm using nicotine lozenges (not many lately), and I don't get too many cravings.  Maybe 3 or 4 a day, yesterday and the day before, 2 so far today.  I've had one lozenge today.

Seems too easy.  Is the light at the end of the tunnel an oncoming train?

I read this subreddit daily, and between your support and Carr's book, I knew I was ready.

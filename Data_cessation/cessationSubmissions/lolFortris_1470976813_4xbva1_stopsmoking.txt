10 days.

Its been a while since my last try.  Well, now I'm 10 days.  
I finally just got up the nerve, and had a long talk with my doctor.  She was more than helpful, actually, and only wanted to start with a patch.  Nothing else.  And, well, its working.  
I know its not getting over the nicotine, but I'm hoping that I'll be... as dedicated then, as I am now.
I guess, if anything, I just wanna let people know to talk to your doctor.
Good luck folks.

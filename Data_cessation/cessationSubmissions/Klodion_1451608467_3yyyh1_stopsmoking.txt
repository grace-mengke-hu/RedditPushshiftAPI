That year went fast!

Hi guys, I'm just writing to wish the New Year's resolution quitters the best of luck. It's been a year since I've smoked a cigarette and I don't regret it one bit. The really funny part is that it's super easy, so much so that it's quite ridiculous.


Some of you might be in doubt as to whether or not you're going to succeed in quitting. My advice is to focus on taking it one day at a time, and by the end of the third week it's all uphill. To be honest with you after three months smoking doesn't even cross your mind anymore. 

Anyway, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of posts on here over the next few days with similar points, so I'll keep it short and sweet. Nonetheless though good luck to you all, and thank you r/StopSmoking for giving me the kickstart to quitting for good.


Happy smoke-free New Year.

I just got my 7 Month Badge! Woohoo!

I'm so happy and proud of myself.  Also, very thankful to this group for pointing me in the right direction.  I'd still be a smoker if it weren't for y'all.  

Just wondering, I noticed that the badges are updated every 30 days, instead of month-to-month.  So while I do have my 7 month badge right now, it won't technically be 7 months until the 20th.  

How do you guys feel about this?  Do you prefer going by your actual quit date or just follow the badge?

The last words I heard from my best friend's father were "Thank you."

His name was Brian. He was very poor, and basically lived on my parents' campground in his trailer. Brian was a really nice guy, and was always hospitable to me when I visited. He was also regularly visited for week long trips by his son. He was 9 when I met him, and I was 10. We were good friends. I'd visit Brian's son and play video games with him very often. The trailer Brian lived in wasn't very well kept, and always smelled of tobacco smoke. Having grown up living on my parents' campground, I was used to that smell. A year and a half after having met Brian, I went to visit him at his trailer one day. He seemed very tired, and was talking about how he didn't feel very good. After a while, he asked me to tell my parents he was calling an ambulance. Since my parents owned the campground, they needed to be told this sort of thing. I told him I'd go let them know, and he said thank you. I rode my bike down to the house and told my parents that Brian was going to call an ambulance. I was worried and ended up spending the rest of the day at home, watching TV. 5 hours later, my parents told my sister Brian had died on the way to the hospital. He had lung and throat cancer. They didn't want me to hear, but I did. I couldn't think for the rest of the night. I just cried. Soon after, my best friend came under the care of his older brother, who started to stay at Brian's trailer after he was gone. My friend became bitter and angry at everything and I couldn't be around him. The day I heard Brian say "Thank you" was the day I lost two good friends.

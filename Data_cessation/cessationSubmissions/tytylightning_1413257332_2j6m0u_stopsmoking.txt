Milestone for me this weekend.

I have been a smoker for 11 years. I'm 24 years old. I have tried to quit countless times, but I have a lot of friends who smoke and every time I drank with them I just couldn't fight the urge to ask for smokes or I would cave and buy  myself a pack. I tried to be the person who would say "it's okay, I only smoke when I drink" but we all know that's a crock... 

I moved provinces about 7 weeks ago. I have been looking for work ever since, and have been nervous living off savings, so I haven't drank more than maybe 1 or 2 beers a week in that time frame (which in itself is a big deal.) so I haven't smoked in 7 weeks. (Accomplishment number one) Since I just got a job,  I went home for thanksgiving weekend of course knowing I would get loaded with my friends. I was absolutely terrified of caving because I knew it was going to be around and I thought I might revert back to my smoker logic "it's okay cause I only smoke when I'm drunk"

I'm proud to say that I drank excessively, hung out with my old smoker friends, and didn't take a single puff. I'm confident now that if I can get through this weekend, I can make it through every other weekend. And I'm confident that every single person reading this can too. 

Side note: just to be clear I'm not proud of the excessive drinking, I'm proud of the fact I didn't smoke. I just can't think of a better way to word that right now haha

Choose your Fight - Weed &amp; Tobacco

Hey Fellow Fighters! 

We fight to be free, and according to Allen Carr and your shared experiences here, we all will feel this sense of Freedom sooner or later. I have to admit that i am making my victory more predictable by allowing myself to use cannabis in the evening with my newly bought vaporizer (such a nice and clear High by the way!!). And i would also say that i am addicted to Cannabis for two years by now maybe..so i am not substituting nicotine with cannabis but i just have chosen my fight! My therapist would say, one step by the other, don't try to accomplish to much at once or you will fail! I rather hope that once i am over Tobacco, i will be able to regard Cannabis more as an isolated substance (living in Europe - i used to smoke spliffs) and hence easier regulate its use to maybe once or twice a month or so. What is your Experience with Weed versus Tobacco? Am I on the right path?

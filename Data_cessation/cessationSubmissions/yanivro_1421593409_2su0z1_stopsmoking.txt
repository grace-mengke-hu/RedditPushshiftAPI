Got the best feedback from Girlfriend today.

*So after 52 days (that I'm celebrating at this moment right now) my girlfriend came to me in a total random way and gave me a kiss and said I smell good , Finally , I was torturing  her with that awful stench.*

*Now Finally It's gone.*

*Be strong guys , you can do it!*

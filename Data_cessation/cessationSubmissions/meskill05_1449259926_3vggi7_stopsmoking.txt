Can't shake it

Can't shake the feeling of wanting a cigarette, usually it would pass by now, and it seems to only be getting worse, getting really worried. Don't know if I should go buy another vape (seeing as last one got flushed down the toilet), still have juice with 0mg of nicotine, before something stupid happens!  Ughhhhhhhhh ,don't like this feeling

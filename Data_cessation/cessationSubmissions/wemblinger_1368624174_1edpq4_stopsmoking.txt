I thought I was lactose intolerant. Then I gave up smoking...??

Used to be, I drink a glass of milk, and my stomach would gurgle, things would happen, and I'd be in the bathroom within the hour. Lactaid typically converted the liquids/solids into WW1 levels of gas. To be honest, I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.

Well, as you can see by my nifty flair I've been a free man for almost two weeks. Last night I had *TWO* big frosty cold glasses of milk with a slice of after dinner cake, and barely a poot in 13 hours! I don't know what happened, but I like it. I can only imagine the constant nicotine gave me "issues" (19 years x ~30 cigs a day).

So hey, another benefit of kicking that abusive bitch Nicotina out of my life.

Done.

I started out with the casual cigarettes here and then. Ya know, you're hanging out with friends and you have one or two here and there and you tell yourself you'll never be addicted? But then you become stressed when shit starts to go wrong in your life and you try to cope through cigarettes. That dopamine kick gets shit going. 

Before you know it, you're smoking a pack a day. 

I haven't been a smoker for a long time compared to most of you here, but I am as addicted as any addict. I've quit a hundred times now. I've told myself this is the one last puff a hundred times. I've told myself it's today and now a hundred times. I'm tired now.

This time I'd like to be brave and this time I hope this is for the one last time, the last time.

Another try with e cig

I quit smoking and relapsed and I didn’t want to go through the hell of nicotine withdrawal, so I got an e-cig (myjet) and I’m now 36hrs smoking free but not nicotine free, the e liquid I’m using is 30mg nicotine. My question is that will it be hard to quit the e-cig after awhile? And do have ay suggestions of how to go about stopping vaping after I’m through with smoking?

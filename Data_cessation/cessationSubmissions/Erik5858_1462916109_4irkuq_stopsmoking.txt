My Last Post Thanks Guys!

I'm no longer going to sub to this subreddit because I feel I don't need too. I just wanted to tell everyone here that this sub Reddit is really the reason I quit. It doesn't matter if you have 1 day or 10000 days smoke free, everyone is useful here and I'm sorry I gotta go. I'm still smoke free and going strong. Cheers guys!

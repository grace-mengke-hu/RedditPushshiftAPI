Day 3. ಠ_ಠ

Using the patch, i've had a couple half smokes here and there ... Only
A couple of my friends know so far


I'm usually a pack a day smoker, so the baby steps/weaning seems to be working! 

I've found eating fruit is helping! When i crave i munch a couple pieces of pineapple and it distracts me. 

Just wanted to share!! Been smoking since i turned 18, third attempt! I believe i can fly!!

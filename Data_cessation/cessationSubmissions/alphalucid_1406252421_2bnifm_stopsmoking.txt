Here goes nothing

I haven't had a cigarette today, and this is the second day with wellbutrin xl 150mg.

We'll see how this trip goes. Today my head has felt like it's been in the clouds. Mostly lack of focus and anxiety are my biggest withdrawal effects. With the wellbutrin it may just be placebo so far, but I think I have had less cravings and anxiety.

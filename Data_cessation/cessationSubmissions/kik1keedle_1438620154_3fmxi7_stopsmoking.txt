Finally ready.

The timeline I gave myself, and the excuse I gave myself to prolong my slavery to nicotine has passed. I moved two states this weekend, and I'm so ready to accomplish what I want in my life. Goal number 1: quit smoking. Here is my real day one. No excuses, no bullshitting myself into believing I can have "just one" when I feel "stressed."

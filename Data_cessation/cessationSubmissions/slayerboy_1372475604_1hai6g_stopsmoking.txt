EASYWAY and nicotine withdrawal

Alright, I'm on day 3 of using EASYWAY to quit. So far, it's been smooth sailing up until today. The nicotine fits are absolute hell right now. I'm not a violent person, but holy crap I've destroyed a few inanimate objects as a result of these withdrawals and had I been living with someone I no doubt would have strangled them for breathing the wrong way on a couple of occasions -- especially the one I had last night.

This is just the nicotine beast leaving my system is all I keep telling myself. Random stuff seems to trigger the withdrawals, but when they come, holy crap stay out of my way for about a half hour. Then I'll be completely fine util the next one. Never had this on day one or two.

I'm done smoking for good and have no desire to even touch a cigarette...but.....these violent nicotine withdrawals, they'll go away, right? Or are these things I'm experiencing not even nicotine withdrawals?

I just want to make sure I'm not alone in this violent withdrawal thing.

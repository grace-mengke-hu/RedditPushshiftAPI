How I learned to stop loving big tobacco and finally quit. (Clean 2.5 years, here's my story)

Hello StopSmoking!

I'm doing NoFap currently and I've found myself once and again coming back to using my quitting of nicotine as a reference. So I thought I might as well come here and tell my story. I warn you, I talk a lot of nicotine and smoking in this post, but I think that is necessary to get my points through.

You might say I'm brainwashed, hell I am proud to be brainwashed in that case! I read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking in December 2010, and as the stubborn bastard I am I told myself to smoke more than before and just continue ever harder after I finished the book.

This is something he is actually encouraging in the book. The thing is, I tried to quit several times before, I managed to go a couple of days before falling back into habbit. Some times I even changed the habit, using "snus" (Swedish tobacco you put under your lip) for several months, being damn proud to quit smoking. The thing is, all that was fake, I knew it deep inside, and I did not have the power or courage to face that fact yet.

The thing about tobacco, for me at least, was the hype, and especially the anti-hype. Perhaps this is a good time to tell you that at the time I picked up the book, I was smoking two packs of unfiltered john silver *per day*. All this time I was smoking, I had this constant stream of people telling me how god-damn stupid it was. This is something a smoker is **well** accustomed to and even well aware of. I mean, I poured my money to big tobacco, ending up having to skip out on food to afford the ciggs. I bet a lot of you can relate to this and it was perhaps the only reason I wanted to quit before I actually did it.

The anti-hype I was talking about, is just that, it is the constant nagging from people, advertisement, tv, government, friends, family, strangers. Yeah you know it's really bad for your health! What is your reaction on this nagging? Let me guess, lighting up?

This was the first thing I had to realize, that **every** time someone was at it with me, I went straight out and started smoking. Realizing this made me laugh out loud, sitting in my bed, smoking and reading that goddamn book.

So, the next thing that I started processing was how actually big tobacco wants you to use tobacco. Here in Sweden we have this great tradition of making tobacco which you can put under your lip, hence bypassing all restrictions about smoking in the workplace, airport, airplane, bar, restaurant... yeah you get the point. Swedish Match (our big tobacco) has different kinds of "snus", and every type comes with a "social marking". If you take it "l√∂s", baking it yourself with your fingers, you are either hardcore or from the northern parts. If you take it in a non-bleached bag, you are a typical user of snus. If you take it in a bleached bag, your are wussier than the others. Then on the other hand, if you take it scented (mint, lime, lingonberry etc.) you are using it as a woman or you try to quit it.

This labeling is what is so dangerous and wrong. The last one of those, it is the most dangerous one, it is the same with menthol cigarettes. Why do big tobacco produce these kinds of products? "It's fresh". No it's a big fucking way away from fresh, it is still the drug you are used to take, just in smaller dosage and with some perfume scented onto it. So what happens when you decide to step down your addiction and you start smoking these? You never, ever, ever, ever, will even get close to that kick/rush which is the only reason you smoke at all! This will leave you hungry (which is the same signal to the brain as nicotine-abstinence btw) and you will have this constant dissatisfaction, because 1. You cannot fulfill that missing hole in your stomach with food (this is also why people quitting, without knowing that the sensations are the same, gain some weight) and 2. You will be constantly moaning after that next break to go out and have a menthol cigarette. So, big tobacco are producing products which is supposed to be fresh and easier to use while stepping down, "OK"!

While on the subject of stepping down, let's talk about nicotine patches, gums, sprays etc.

Do you know who are the biggest supporters of anti-smoking research and who are contributing proudly to the anti-smoking schemed ads? Big fucking tobacco. They are so damn clever that they know you will react as I described earlier, you hear about someone dying because of lung cancer? Take a smoke. You see pictures of destroyed lungs? You take a smoke. But hey! We have this great product for you, when the abstinence comes, take one of these gums, and it will be al'rite!

Ok... So what are these products made of? Of course they have nicotine in them, otherwise you would never be able to cope with the abstinence, right? This is false, the only thing that small dose of nicotine does for you is to just drag you further into the addiction, this is the same reason I described earlier about stepping down or smoking lighter ciggs.

Anyways, after this realization that big tobacco is actually behind every movement behind this stop-smoking shit I began to really question my reasons for smoking. I was just feeding the machine with more money, and more angst and my fears became greater and greater... So I smoked some more...

While this was some fucked up shit I've read, my nicotine-stained brain didn't really want to believe this, I mean, why should I trust this guy, talking about big tobacco and how evil it is. Actually there were no reason at all at this point that I would continue reading, but just out of curiosity I continued.

After I took the decision to continue reading, I began wondering about why I wasn't quitting, I mean, I knew how fucking the disgusting the business and the smell and health-issues were. So I began contemplating actually trying to stop. But I remembered that I promised the stubborn bastard as I am that I would continue smoke more than ever while reading, so I did.

The next thing that got to me was the dynamic of the nicotine abstinence and how it affected the body. I knew that it was hell while quitting since I had tried it a couple of times. But the book told me that the **physical** abstinence would only be there for a couple of days, and after that it would begin dissipating. This led me to think about why the hell I still felt like shit after several days, up to the week mark (when I usually relapsed). Psychological.... I woke up, I smoked, I put my clothes on, went out of my appartment, smoked, got on the subway, went up, walked to the uni, smoked, went to first class, pause, smoked. Yeah you get the point. It was quite the habit I had there, and I knew it would be tough to break, really tough, especially while drinking.. I mean, I had my smoking friends, it would be weird not to go out with them and smoke during a party.

So I continued to contemplate these thoughts while reading the rest of the book. When I got to the end I had thought so much about every detail of my addiction, I felt so fucking sick, I was almost puking while smoking that last cigarette. Of course I didn't think this would actually stick, and I would relapse within the day or perhaps the week. But as time went on, and all these urges came, this aching hunger-feeling, the longing for taking another smoke, this was the time I recognized something. I was prepared for it, I had my viking axe, high above my head, ready to strike at every attack from the nicotine, it was amazing. I continued thinking about this and I kept on fighting, never doubting that it was the right decision to kick that nicotine-motherfucker in the face. It was really hard during times, especially during music festivals and stuff like that.

But I came through, it took a while, but I had finally made it. And it was never actually hard. I was so damn prepared for the fight, it was no match. The urges still come, but now it's so rare I'm surprised every time, actually, thinking about it, I cannot remember clearly when the last time I even had the urges. But then again, it has been 2.5 years, and it has been wonderful, I can breathe properly again, I can run, I can fuck! (used to be tired and just fall down beside the woman after a couple of minutes) and I have not lost my smoking friends! (I actually began joining them again after a while, just to fuck with my addiction, it didn't bite)

So, this is not a post to brag about how I managed it, this is just my story, and the thoughts and theme on my mind during the period I prepared for quitting. People say cold turkey is hard, it is not, you just have to be prepared for the fight, properly prepared. I knew in my heart (now I say it if someone asks, but back then I couldn't) that if I have just one smoke, just one snus, I will be back, and I will **NEVER** quit. This motivates me, this is what is keeping me strong, and I know you can get this feeling and feel this strong too, because I could do it!

So, take up your axe, and kick that nicotine sucker in the face!

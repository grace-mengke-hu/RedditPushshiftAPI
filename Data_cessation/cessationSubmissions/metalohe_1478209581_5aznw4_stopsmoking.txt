My reasons.

I had been smoking for 7 years solid (14 y. - 21 y.)until i was able to get myself to stop just a few weeks ago. It was part of who i was, i didn't know social life without being a smoker. I am also the type that loves smoking as an activity and i also feel like i've lost a friend. But i still want this. I want to be able to identify myself as a non-smoker without a second thought.

I also took the quitting process very seriously this time, as my previous attempts have not succeeded. I have always started again in a day or less. Now, i wrote down all of my reasons, a checklist what i could read, before i lighted up a cigarette. I also bought myself nicotine gum just in case. (haven't needed it :))

This time it has worked. It has not been difficult. I have also gone out drinking with friends, which i feared to be an obstacle, but had no struggle with being the not-smoker.
I also thought i will write down my reasons here in case they help someone else through a craving or help make a decision for better.

* Do ANYTHING else.

* Just. F*cking. Because. (i decided)

* I will relate with a non-smoker in my group 

* I know it seems hard and pointless, but i. decided. so. And this is most important. I have power over myself.

* I want this.

* Even if i have lost all motivation, i still want this.

* My family will be so happy..

* It was my safeplace. Now i am my safeplace.

* It's not funny. I am toying with my life.

* "Why should i not let myself?" Look at all of the above!

* If i actually will go and do something else, then it won't be that bad.

* A lot of people can do this. I can too.

* Look in the mirror for 1 minute.

* Just don't do it. (anti-nike haha :D)

* This too shall pass.

* Do some crosswords.

* Do breathing-exercises.

* Drink water.

As you can see i was desperate. :D But anyways, you all can do it too!

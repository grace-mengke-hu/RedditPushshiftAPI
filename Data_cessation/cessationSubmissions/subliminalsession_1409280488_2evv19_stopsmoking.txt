first time being ill as a non-smoker...

woke up today with the flu, felt like i did EVERY DAY waking up as a smoker... mouth dry, coughing loads, sniffling, etc... just to put it in perspective, the other 80 days i've felt as healthy as i possibly could have done. proof that smoking must be one of the worst things you can do to your body... shocked.

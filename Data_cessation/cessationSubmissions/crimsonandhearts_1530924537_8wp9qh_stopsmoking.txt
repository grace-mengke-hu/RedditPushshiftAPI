Day 5 on chantix

Got another update for y’all, since I started the full dose of chantix yesterday. I had 6 cigarettes yesterday. I lasted a whole 7 hours without one and wasn’t even craving one that badly. Instead of a whole pack, I had only 6. Which is pretty great. I did have trouble falling asleep last night and had trouble sleeping through the night which is one of the side effects - but no agitation, no weird or bad dreams, nothing too bad. The one thing I do notice is the brain fog I’ve heard some people talk about, I feel like I turned into an idiot over night. Lol. I’m so out of it and spaced out. 
But I have a good feeling about this. Haven’t lost my mind yet! We’ll see lol.

Day four (again) and not inspirational.

The question burns in my head. I don't want to acknowledge it. I tell myself, it's just the nicotine withdrawal it's not how you really feel.  It will all go away. But I still feel like there is one thing that will make all the thoughts about all the things that irritate me go away. The one thing I look forward to when I drive to work. The thing I look forward to after work. The thing you seemed to enjoy but you let it take up too much of your life, do too much damage and enjoyed so much that it became un-enjoyable. So you quit. It's only day four (again) and the question remains...would you rather? Would you rather live like this or die early...Maybe if the weather were better? Maybe if I liked my job more? Maybe if I still had friends like I used to? Maybe then it would be worth it? I'm not going to smoke but I know I'd rather.

Does anyone else just feel happier?

I've been dealing with major anxiety issues for a while now. I've definitely had my good moments, but I haven't felt consistently happy in quite some time. Before I started smoking, I'd been doing fine, but my anxiety really ramped up around the time I started smoking. I realized this about 6 months into my addiction, but figured there was *no way* that *cigarettes* could have had such an impact on my mental state and made me so miserable. Does anyone else have similar experiences, or thoughts on this?

It's been about three weeks since I've had a cigarette, and these past couple weeks have been *great*. I just feel so much better emotionally. Nothing else has really changed (although I have started exercising regularly for the first time in my life, which is awesome), but I feel so much more able to brush off any troubles I have, and I'm happier than I've been in a long time. Right now, I'm just hoping this feeling will last.

I do still get cravings, but they're not *too* frequent and they seem to pass quickly. When I think about it, yes, I admit, I *love* cigarettes, and smoking still seems very appealing to me. But I was mostly just wondering: What emotional changes, if any, have you noticed that could be associated with smoking? I'd like to figure out if this is why I feel so great or if it's just a coincidence.

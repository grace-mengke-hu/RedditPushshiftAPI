Website for current smokers wanting to quit and families of smokers who want to help

As part of an inter-professional health professions team, a group of physical therapy, nurse practitioners, and medical students have come together to produce a free website in the hopes of putting out quality information and resources for those looking for help quitting or family members of smokers who need support and resources.

Five Days Smoke Free - Emotional - please help ðŸ˜ž

I'm 25 weeks pregnant - found out in November. I've been trying to cut back as much as I could but every attempt to quit entirely has been a failure. I'm on day five now smoke free and proud but I'm more emotional than I thought I would be...my situation sucks - I live with my boyfriend who I don't get along with anymore due to his drug abuse. I can't leave him even though I want to cause I have nowhere else to go. I was laid off from my job after finding out I was pregnant and have been struggling to find work since. My boyfriend isn't even looking. (Can you see why it's been so difficult to quit?) He's also a chain smoker and inconsiderate as well. Tonight I felt like I was hopeless and pathetic for believing that I can quit when all I want is to smoke. It seems like everyone around me is purposely making it more difficult than it should be. All I asked for was ONE week stress free - just one....and I got the exact opposite of that. I've never been so irritated and emotional at the same time. Cigarettes were always there when I felt my worst. They helped me feel better. But now I feel at my worst again (ten times worse due to the pregnancy) I can't smoke. I cannot partake in doing the one thing that makes me feel better and I'm beginning to hate myself for every cigarette I've ever had. I'm beginning to hate myself for getting addicted. None of my friends are around. My family has their own issues. I would usually turn to smoking but I can't now. I feel so stupid and could really use some support. Does this get any better? I feel like I lost a dear friend. When does this become bearable? I just cried like a baby because I hate myself more than anything right now. Any tips are appreciated

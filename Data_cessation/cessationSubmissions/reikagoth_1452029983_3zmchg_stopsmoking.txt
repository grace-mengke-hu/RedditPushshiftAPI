Been wanting to for a while

But today is the day.
My teeth have been getting bad and I'm terrified of the dentist. Its been 16 years since I last saw one... And 16 years since I started smoking. 
After a quick look through the web, I realized a LOT of my dental woes are directly related to my smoking. I've quit before. Not permanently obviously, but long term.

I'm permanently done this time. 
I scheduled my dental appointment and smoked my final cigarette today. 

I can't afford any kind of cessation gear, so I'm going cold turkey. Wish. Me. Luck.

I'm gonna need it.

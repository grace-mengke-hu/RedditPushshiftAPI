Fasting to quit smoking

Hey everyone. I did this a couple years back and quit for 18 months. Then fell back from a really terrible job situation - bad excuse I know. 

Basically, fasting will dramatically speed up your body's ability to get rid of nicotine so you stop craving it. However, if you smoke while fasting... You'll start to notice how absolutely dreadful the habit is. Smoking a cigarette will get progressively more painful and sick inducing. 

I'm on day 5 of water fasting, and tried to smoke a cigarette. I made it halfway through before I stumbled to the bathroom to take a hot shower for 30 minutes to avoid dying. That's what it felt like. 

Curious of anyone's experience with this type of approach.

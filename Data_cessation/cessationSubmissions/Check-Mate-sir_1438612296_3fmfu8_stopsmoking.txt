One year!

Can't believe this day has finally come but it has! One year away from cigarettes isn't much after having smoked for twelve, but sticking with it will put that much time between me and cigarettes as well!

This sub is immensely helpful and am very thankful for its existence, everyone here has the right attitude and incredibly supportive to each other, keep it up, we're all in this together!

Quitting daily smoking wasn't so bad, but how do I stop smoking when I go out?

This is the hard part. If I'm drunk, having a good night, eating a bunch of garbage, it throws me off. A cigarette doesn't sound so bad then. 

I don't want to stop going out of course, I just hate smoking when I go out. It's a mental not physical thing.

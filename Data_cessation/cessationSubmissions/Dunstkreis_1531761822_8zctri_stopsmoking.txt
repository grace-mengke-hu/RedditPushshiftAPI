Fights with husband on day 6

Hey ya, I‘m on day 6 of my quit. It’s been 20 years of a pack a day and this is my 5th attempt and I really feel this one. Unfortunately right now I keep fighting with my husband - at times for reasons understandable to me, at others not. In the nicest way I knew how on day 2 I asked him to please just bear with me no matter what because I was going to stop smoking. That I did not know what was coming up but I was sure I needed his unconditional reassurance since this it was sure gonna suck big time. What kept happening however is that old issues kept resurfacing and had us arguing. Today I managed to put myself into a good mood and invited him for a walk after work... it ended in mad fighting. That kind you do not want in a marriage. What I’m not sure about is whether I’m the unbearable asshole here because I am admittedly irritable or if something is really awry here... can one ever tell during withdrawal? I’m super confused and cigarettes seem like a good idea again - please help

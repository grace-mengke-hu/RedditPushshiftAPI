I'm losing my conviction to quit.

I really want a cigarette right now.  I'm losing my shit.  Really need some help.

Edit:  Thanks everyone!  I made it through the worst craving I have had yet!  Mainly due to the encouragement by all of you!  I'm still cigarette free and don't plan on smoking any time soon.  Thank you all again!  This subreddit is truly a godsend!

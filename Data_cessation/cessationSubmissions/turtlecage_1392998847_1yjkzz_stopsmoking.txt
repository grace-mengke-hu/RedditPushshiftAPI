6 months!

I'm so grateful for this subreddit. It had helped me immensely. 

During those first few weeks checking this subreddit daily was so helpful for me. Now I go on here maybe once a week to check in. 

Ultimately my desire to quit became stronger than my desire to smoke. So proud of myself. You should all be proud of yourselves too. :)

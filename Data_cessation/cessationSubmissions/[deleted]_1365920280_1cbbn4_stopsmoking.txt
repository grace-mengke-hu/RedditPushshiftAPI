I don't know if this is terrible motivation or not, but it's working.

A little while back I lost the woman I loved, dated almost 4 years, all that fun stuff.

Stopped smoking because when I smoke, all I can think of is that she's probably doing way better than me, getting in shape, living her life and here I am smoking and killing myself.

By living longer and bettering myself, I'm "winning" in a sense. I don't know if that's insane motivation or not but it's working so far, so fuck it.

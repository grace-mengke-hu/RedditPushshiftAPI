odd way to stop smoking.

Alright, so this certainly isn't a traditional way to quit. But, yesterday I smoked 3 cigarettes. They all tasted like gasoline.... literally!  3 days ago I got a very bad sinus infection ( doing a little better today, think I'm over the worst part.) I don't think I'll be smoking anymore...or vaping. I started vaping about a month ago, doing both throughout the day, now even the thought of vaping makes me wanna puke, literally. It is a shame I just bought $40 Worth of vaping stuff though. Sorry if this doesn't make sense kinda out of it right now.

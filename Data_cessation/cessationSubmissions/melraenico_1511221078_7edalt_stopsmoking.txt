My mother is 66 years old. She has end stage COPD. She weighed 71 pounds back in February when she was put on hospice! Itâ€™s now November she weighs 101 pounds and is no longer on hospice. I want to share how I am helping my mother so others may benefit from it too. My web site might give you hope!

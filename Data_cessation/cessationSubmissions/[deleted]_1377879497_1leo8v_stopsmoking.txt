Quit smoking at tuesday, advice needed

What can I do when the craving comes? Is it still smoking if I only smoke while drunk? The everyday smoking I've not really missed that much(so far), but I know that as soon as I open that fourth beer at a party I'm going to need a cig... How do you guys feel about the drunk smoking?

Edit: I've been smoking since I turned 18 (damn "Now I'm adult I can do what I want") and I am now almost 22.

Breaking the Habit

They say it takes three weeks to form or break a habit. Just 9 hours to go! Still using the lozenges, but I'm definitely way down on those. I feel like I should keep using them for the 12 weeks that the bottle recommends. Happy to be doing something good for myself! Thanks everyone for the support!

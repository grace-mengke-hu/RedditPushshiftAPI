I Had a really intense craving this morning....

so i stopped myself in dead in my own tracks, realized it was just the chemicals and my troll brain playing tricks on me. then in my head i was like "WAIT. You got this. Let's go!" And i spent the next 5 hours cleaning virtually every room in my house like maniac. it is now essentially spotless and i still feel like i should be cleaning things.I normally live in a pig sty, and like it that way but my god i have so much energy... 

Quitting does some strange things to you, just thought i should share :)

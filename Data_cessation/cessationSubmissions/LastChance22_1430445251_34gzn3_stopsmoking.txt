Cold turkey v cutting down then quitting.

Hey guys, I only just found out about this sub/community and think it's an excellent idea. 

I'm just wondering, from all your experiences, whether you think cold turkey is the most effective method, or if cutting back and/or replacing some habitual cigarettes with a vape is a good first step. 

I know everyone is different and different methods work for different people, personalities and situations, but I still want to hear about your experiences and thoughts on the two methods.

I hit a nicotine pen today and had no feeling whats so ever.

I am really confused. I keep on doing research and can't find anything on this topic. A normal Juul pen is like 50% and this one my friend had was like 30%. When they hit it they tell me they "can't think" or "find it hard to stand" for a few seconds. My friends aren't light weight they are heavy marajana smokers. I know this might not be the right subreddit but it was my 2nd time vaping and I felt nothing. I took good hits with my lungs until I would cough but I felt nothing. Same thing happened the first time. From the first time I had it and the 2nd time it was maybe 2 weeks so I don't believe it is a tolerance. Is it possible to be immune to nicotine? Only thing I got was a light headache right now. If someone who is experienced can help me I'd appreciate it.

Anyone want to start Couch to 5k with me?

Whether you still havenâ€™t quit completely and need some encouragement or you recently quit or quit a long time ago and you want to start running....

I just started using the Couch 2 5k app to remind me why I quit and put my lungs to better use. Just wondering if there was anyone out there who needed a push from a friend to get out there and do something healthy for yourself!

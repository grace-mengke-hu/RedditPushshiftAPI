I don't want to quit. Am I ever going to stop craving?

My best friends said I could move in with them if I quit, and they're extremely supportive of me, but other than wanting to live with them, there is literally no part of me that actually wants to quit smoking.  This is day four of no smoking, and I was wondering if anyone had any insight on how long it's going to be until I stop craving, since I really never wanted to quit for my own reasons in the first place.

Starting over.

I quit last January 1st and I made it to July 4th. It was pretty easy until I went to stay with my mom during her hip surgery and recovery period. Staying in my childhood home allowed me to start lying to myself again and I started smoking again.

I have just now quit again. This time I am going to stay free. Those 6 months were my best in a long time and really want the feeling back. Last time I used Chantix and it worked great. I tried that way again in November but it didn't work this time.

I'm just going to stop this time and return to this sub every day for support and to help where I can.

Thanks for being here!

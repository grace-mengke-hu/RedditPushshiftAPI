Almost a week...

I'm almost at a week of no smoking. This is the first time that I've ever truly tried to quit. I've always talked about it, but never actually did anything about it. I'm 23 and have smoked since I was 13. I'm going the cold turkey route. How do you deal with getting angry or irritated? I've tried deep breathing, but that only works sometimes. It's especially worse right now whenever I feel 'stuck' or trapped somewhere (like riding passenger in a car) Any suggestions? I'm tired of snapping at the people I love. ):

Still want to smoke as much as I did on day 4

Ive read the book ive stopped using any thing with nicotine and I still want to smoke for ffs i figured by day 25 it might not be in my mind as much but the minute I wake i think about it and all day it pops in my head still at least 15 to 20 times about as much as I used to smoke

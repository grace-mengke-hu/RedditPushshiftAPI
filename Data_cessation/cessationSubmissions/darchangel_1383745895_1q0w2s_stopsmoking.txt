Here's a trigger I wasn't expecting

2 nights ago I was stressed out and I stayed up most of the night thinking about stuff. Last night I was still stressed but was dead tired so I picked up Tylenol PM. The pills got me down early but destroyed my sleep all night. I woke at 2am thinking it was time to get up. Then 3:00, 4:00, 5:00, 5:30...

In college I pulled a lot of really late nights (and more than a few all-nighters) and the next day I smoked like a chimney. Apparently that association is still there because I REALLY want a cigarette. Quitting has actually been relatively smooth up until now. Even reintroducing alcohol wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. But the tiredness is brutal.

So exhausted. Want cigarettes...

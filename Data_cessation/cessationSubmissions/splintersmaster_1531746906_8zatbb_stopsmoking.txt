Why do I only crave at work

1/2 pack a day for 15 years. I gradually cut down to a pack a week only smoking at work or when drinking for the last year or so. A month ago a smoked my last few. I hit a vape pen a few dozen times and wore a 7mg patch three times since. I'm mostly over it. I can go the full weekend without even thinking about, even being next to a smoker outside does nothing. But once I get into work the cravings seemingly last the entire shift. Once I punch out they leave. If I go home early, they're gone. It's literally only while I'm at work.

Anyone experience something similar? Is there a scientific explanation for this?

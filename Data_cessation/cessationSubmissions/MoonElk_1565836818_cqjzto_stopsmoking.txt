I need to hear stories about how your health improved after quitting smoking. I keep falling off the wagon and my health isn't doing well.

I have been "quitting" smoking for 2 years now and keep falling off the wagon. Mainly when I'm drinking I'll either smoke a cigarette or vape which leads to smoking. I have pretty consistent GERD/acid reflux which is significant. I feel like I have shortness of breath a lot of the time. And every time I smoke I have more trouble sleeping. Has anyone noticed any improvements in these symptoms after quitting for a while or is this just my life now?

Day 4

I am glad that I made it this far already. In terms of time it's not much, but (for me) the worst cravings happen in the first days.

Now I just need to continue. Challenges in the near future:

Today I will go back to my student home and people smoke together. I will let them know that I quit and that under no circumstances should they allow me to borrow a cigarette from them.

I will be occupied during the weekend, I probably won't think about smoking. Next week I will be in my hostel again, and I should not smoke with people I meet there.

The longer I manage to not smoke, the cleaner my lungs will become and the easier it is to breathe. I plan to never smoke again!

Thanks for your interest and good luck on your own journey!

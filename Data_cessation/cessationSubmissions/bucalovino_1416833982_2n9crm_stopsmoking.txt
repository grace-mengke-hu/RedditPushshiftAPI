When you want a loved one to stop smoking

My boyfriend knows how I hate that he smokes. He'll casually mention how someday he'd like to quit. It's been a year and I'm starting to fear it's something he'll just never get around to. Any advice on how I can be proactive without nagging him or overstepping boundaries?

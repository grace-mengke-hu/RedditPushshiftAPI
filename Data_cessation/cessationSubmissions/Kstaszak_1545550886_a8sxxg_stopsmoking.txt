Day 2

So I hadn't thought about cigarettes at all today, made it through work. Made it all the way home, and made it to my bed without so much as a thought..... thought about it only cuz i picked up my phone and actually looked at my notifications saying I had q new message from this subreddit.... that feels pretty good

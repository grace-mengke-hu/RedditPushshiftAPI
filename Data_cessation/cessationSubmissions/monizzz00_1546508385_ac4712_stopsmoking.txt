6 days in my quit. Is the damage I’ve done reversible?

19(M) who smoked on and off since 15. About ~4 cigarettes per days. I quit 6 days ago and am doing alright. The cravings are still present but I’ve managed to handle most of them. I keep wondering to myself if my body will recover from all the cigarettes I’ve smoked. I wonder if I’ve smoked enough to cause cancer? I’ve never heard of a teen getting cancer from smoking so I don’t know. All I know is that I feel much better being smoke-free. No more smelly hands, no more smelly hair or face. I can wear perfume again. Getting through each day is an accomplishment for me

Don't know what to do with your hands? Try this trick.

First time poster, long time lurker here. 

I'm on day 20, the longest I've gone. Every other attempt would end by day 2 or 3, I couldn't find a temporary replacement for the cigarette to keep my hands busy. Then I stumbled across a safer, *cheaper* alternative.

**playing cards**

Need a cigarette? 

*take out your cards and shuffle them* 

*learn a slight of hand/magic trick*

*get your friends involved rather than going out for a smoke*

**the average craving lasts only 3 minutes, the same amount of time it would take for you to roll/take out a cigarette and smoke it**

all you need to do is *keep yourself occupied for those 3 minutes*

if not cards, try a **penny**, improve your dexterity by rolling it over your fingers...*hustler style.*

There are some cool positives that come from this.

- **you don't smoke!**
- **you learn a skill**
- **you look *badass* (if you practice hard)**

You'll be paying very little for a pack of cards, much less than a pack of cigarettes. They'll fit in your cigarette tin, or the spot in your pocket where they *used to be*.

It's not a big investment, and definitely worth a try, get really good at card tricks, show them off at parties, improve your co-ordination and most importantly, it'll keep your hands busy for that *all important 3 minutes*. 

Good luck with your quits guys, I'm sure there are thousands of different methods you can and have used, give it a try and let me know how it goes, different strokes for different folks I guess :-)

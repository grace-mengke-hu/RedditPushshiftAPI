Thinking about the actual time I’ve spent smoking - 5,893 hours of my life!!!

I’m at 21 days. It is still so hard. Does it get easier? When? It is crazy to see from my quit smoking app that I have saved 17 hours!! 17 HOURS OF MY LIFE THAT I WOULD HAVE SPENT SMOKING instead of playing with my kid, or working out, or reading war and peace.  In just three weeks. So I did the math and I’ve spent almost six thousand hours of my life smoking. That is insane.

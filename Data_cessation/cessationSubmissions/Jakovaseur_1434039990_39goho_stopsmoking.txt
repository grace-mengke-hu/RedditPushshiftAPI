Yesterday I started feeling very sick at my job (Day 2)

So yesterday, I almost fainted at my job. I had quit smoking cold turkey the day prior. I had been smoking a pack and a half a day for the last 10 years. Yesterday I felt light-headed, then I had to sit down. I was having difficulty breathing, saw black dots, felt very dizzy and I couldn't feel my legs and arms, they were very numb. I was very cold, but also sweating and my skin was hot. I have no idea what happened, and I can only attribute it to not having a single cigarette in the past ~36 hours. Is it possible ? Can nicotine withdrawal be this heavy ?

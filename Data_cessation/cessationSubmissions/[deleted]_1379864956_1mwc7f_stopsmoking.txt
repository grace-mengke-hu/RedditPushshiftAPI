ONE MONTH!

Holy poop, I've just hit 30 days without even realizing it! Funny thing, when I started my quit, my scumbag brain kept telling me that after 1 month, I will be able to allow myself a cigarette as a reward. Screw that, I will never smoke again, my reward will rather be a life without nicotine and smoking, and a lot of money! ;)

Thank you all guys/girls, I appreciate all your help! :)

41 days... Feeling better physically, but it's like I'm on a moody rollercoaster, I can't seem to pull myself out of an emotional breakdown when it happens, and it's beginning to damage my relationship. Any stories, advice, tips, or comforting words would be wonderful right now.

41 days since I quit, and while the harsh withdrawal symptoms are gone, and physically I feel great, I'm having serious issues with my mood. 

I'm not as snappy or as volatile as I was when I was giving up, but rather I just seem to get emotional and upset over everything that is even slightly bothering me. I seriously wonder if this is what pregnant women talk about. I never was much of a crier - but holy hell I get upset and cry at everything now, and I can't seem to turn it off. 

Even when I have a moment of rationality and realise just how stupid I'm behaving, I can't seem to stop the waterworks and the downward spiral of sadness and self-hatred. It feels like I'm PMS-ing x 10 constantly. 

Does this happen to anyone else? I'm trying to reign in the emotions as it's doing a number on my relationship with my SO (who has been SUPER supportive of me quitting but is getting to the end of his rope with my emotions and visibly fed up with me), and I hate feeling sad/emotional/upset all the time. 

Also, I got over some anxiety I had a while back before I quit, but now it's come back with a vengeance, also putting a tremendous strain on my relationship. 

For both my anxiety and emotional rollercoasters, I have good days and bad days. 

Today was especially bad. I have some serious apologising to do to my SO, but I think it won't matter anymore. The poor guy. 

So like I said, any stories, advice, tips, or comforting words would be wonderful right now.

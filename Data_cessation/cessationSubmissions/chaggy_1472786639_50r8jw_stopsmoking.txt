First try, just started reading Alan Carr's book

I've been smoking for about 10 years. Have tired to quit every week for the last year after weekend drunken events with friends but found excuses to try again. I'm sick of the habit and how it makes me feel but the excuse of dealing with stress and it being a social tool has shut down every attempt. I'll keep you guys posted but any advice is greatly appreciated.

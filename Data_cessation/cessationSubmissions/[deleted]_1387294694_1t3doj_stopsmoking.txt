Quit for a whole week. Bought a pack today......

So I quit. For a whole year about two years ago then I got a new job with smokers. I've tried quitting multiple times since and I can't get it to stick. 

Biggest problem is I have ADHD and my meds make me crave cigarettes even more. I take 30-60mg of Vyvance and the stimulants make me crave like crazy. I only break when I have been on meds for 3 or more days consecutively and I need them to function. I barely function with them without them I'm even worse. 

Problem number 2 is I have an hour drive to and from work. I started smoking back in 06 and heavily associate smoking with driving, I get bored and need something to do. 

I really want to quit. I really do. For myself. For my wife. For my son. 
I want to stop smelling like an ashtray and I want to get healthy. 

I know these are all bad excuses and I don't want to keep smoking. But it really is hard. 

Any advice?

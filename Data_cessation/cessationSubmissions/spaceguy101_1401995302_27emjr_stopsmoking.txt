I just learned my dad is a smoker, what should I do?

A few days ago I found a pack of cigarettes in his car while I was looking for something I had left there. At first I didn't think anything of it, but I have since seen him take a cigarette and walk out to the street to smoke it twice. He doesn't know that I know, and I do not think anyone else in the family knows, perhaps not even my mom.

Both times I saw him take one, it was after he was extremely angry, presumably to calm him down.

I want to know what I can do to influence him to quit. I have no idea how long this has been going on, but I am worried about the health side affects (he does not live a healthy life style).

I know it doesn't change who he is, but at the same time, I feel that I view him in a different way. It is almost like I feel betrayed that I never knew this side of him.

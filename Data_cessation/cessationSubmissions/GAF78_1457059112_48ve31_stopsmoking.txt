Why am I struggling so much???

It's been nearly 90 days and I've had an intense urge to smoke every day for the last 7 days or so.  I have almost stopped to buy smokes a few times. I'm white knuckling it here. Help!  
Edit 3/15/16 for anyone who stumbles across this: This lasted about 10-12 days and was rough. But it did pass and since then I have truly been over the hump. No cravings. Hang in there, you're almost to cruising altitude!

Spiritual reasons to quit cigarettes! Here's my story

Dear Non-Smokers, this is really the first time I post anything about my story on internet. As this section helped me a lot to realise I wasn't the only one going tru all of that, I decided I had to give back to others too! I am studying, learning and applying knowledge in my everyday life and I've always been blocked by smoke. I used to tell myself "Why you wanna eat healthy? You're a smoker dude.. It doesn't change anything" and this applies to exercices, meditation, breathing etc... Then one day I woke up and I decided that I was the creator of my universe and if I really wanted to stop, I could. 

Today, it's been 7 days and OH MEN it feels good. I still skip a lot of people I know because they smoke a lot, but I am able to not crave for cigarettes anymore just by realizing how much it is a spiritual demon trying to control your willpower to his advantage.

So to all the people reading this, the more it's harder, the better the feel will be after you say "NO" just remember this: It's not because you could smoke that you should... ⚔️ Keep winning.

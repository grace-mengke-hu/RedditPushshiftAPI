Third week seems harder.

Not a big deal, but I've noticed days 17 and 18 are harder than say 10~14.

I've had alot of thoughts about "just one", which I know is bullshit and I keep changing my thought focus when I find myself doing it. But it seems like it is happening alot more these past few days than it had in the previous weeks.

200 some days....wow...I can't believe it

Wow, didn't even notice it. I made it to 206 days! I would never think of it 200 some days ago. 

The cravings are totally gone, the thought of smoking makes me sick to my stomach, the smell of smoke makes me want to puke...I just don't know why I was smoking in the first place! It's crazy now that I think about it! There was absolutely nothing good about it! I just kick myself in the ass for smoking that long, over 22 years. 

I feel freaking great. It feels so good not to smoke, I can't tell you enough. I don't even think about it. The only time I think about how stupid it was to smoke, when I see people driving and smoking. I can't imagine smoking in my car right now and getting all my back seat ashed up, car smelling like shit.. my fingers smelling. You know what I hated? When it was really hot and I had to smoke. Ughh...that stench from smoking. It's hot as hell and here I was puffing on freaking smoke! lol! It's crazy to think I was doing it!

Hope you New Years quitters are doing great! By now, you know you are done with that crap. 

To those who are new..keep at it! It gets better! Last couple weeks and just keep trucking with it! It's really not that hard. You will laugh at this whole thing once you quit and time goes by!

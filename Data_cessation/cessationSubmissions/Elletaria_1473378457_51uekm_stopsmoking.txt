Sneaking and a weakness in the area of self accountability

So here's the rub .
I started smoking at age 12, to be cool and metal and badass of course. Like most kids of my generation, I had been around smokers, second hand smoke, in utero smoke, etc and never even coughed with that first one, just hit the ground running.
Now it's 25 years later, and I spent the last 20 or so as a two pack a day smoker. I work outdoors in a field that very rarely restricts smoking on the job.
Add to that the part that smoking has in my very identity, the badass noncomformist badass, and I'm fucked right?
So I finally had it, I've quit 17 times in my career, the longest being 5 months, the shortest one day. Most recently I made it 18 days honestly, 42 dishonestly with a sneak about once a week or ten days or so. I always find a way to justify just one you see...
I've gained 14 pounds on a frame that seriously didn't need that chunk without eating more, actually eating less. I've white knuckled until I want to cry. I've done cold turkey, the patch,  but still I sneak. I buy a pack, smoke one or three, and destroy the rest. And I crave worse for days afterward. I caved on vacation and chain smoked for  five days, it was awful. My breathing was right back to shit where i started. My workout today was embarrassing.
I am a liar, I am a weakling and I always thought I was so tough.
Do they still do lobotomies?
Day one again tomorrow.

Tldr-multiple quit attempts, self loathing, don't want to die this way.

6th Week.

Hey guys!

This is my first time posting. I guess I'm just giving myself a place to ask questions and look for input on my problems! I'm on my 6th week of being smoke free (I started smoking October, 2011) and I feel no better or worse than before. What I have actually noticed is that I get MORE tired throughout the day and my lung capacity seems to have gotten smaller. When I walk up the stairs it's pretty taxing. I'm 21 years old and I do exercise as a smoker and non smoker. I've found it increasingly more difficult to concentrate on school work due to my mind wandering so often and I guess I've picked up video games as my new addiction. Normally at uni I would just study for hours and go for a cigarette when I'm becoming restless. Basically, I still feel crappy when I wake up in the morning, I still have cravings (some days I forget I even quit), and I feel no benefits really whatsoever other than the fact I'm saving money and sometimes I feel shitty and I think that "hey, if I had been smoking all day I might feel even worse". Has anyone else gone through anything similar to this? I haven't smoked anything or drank alcohol since quitting. It's honestly quite the battle each day still but nothing mind numbing. I feel as if I have some type of bad ADD now.

TL;DR - Quit smoking for 6 weeks now, nothing has improved, concentration and attention span has decreased, can't focus  on school and health seems to be getting worse.

feeling sick after cutting back?

over the past month, I've cut back from about half a pack a day(8-12 smokes) to 2-3 cigarettes daily. the other day, out of the blue, I felt like I had contracted the mother of all colds. shaking, coughing, stuffy head, sweating, sore throat. now a day later, and I feel about half as shitty, and I was wondering if this is at least partly due to nicotine withdrawal? I was thinking of nixing smoking completely on sunday, but if this is happening because of my cutting back I think I might stick with my 2-3 cigarettes for a few weeks before quitting altogether.

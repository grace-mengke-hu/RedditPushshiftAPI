Just finished Easyway after starting it over a year ago, and it's time :D

I need to get my flair fixed, since I've been absent from this subreddit for quite a while.  I unsubscribed in weakness. 

Basically, I quit smoking with vaping.  It worked well for months, until I started smoking and vaping.  I finally got motivated to read the book and get rid of nicotine completely.

I've just emptied out all of my vaping clearomizers and put all the batteries/gear into a drawer (I'll be selling it shortly).  I'm not really nervous at all, which is awesome.  I didn't think a book could inspire such confidence, but then I read it, and I'm finally really ready to get rid of nicotine addiction in every form for good.

Just wanted to make a post about it because I'm pretty excited to finally get rid of the terrible burden of smoking.

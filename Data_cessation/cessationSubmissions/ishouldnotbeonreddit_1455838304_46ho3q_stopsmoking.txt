It's only been four days, and I already love you guys.

It is so great feeling like I have finally found a community of quitters! My work brings me into contact with a lot of AA/NA/Al-Anon groups, and although I am not sold on the 12-step model of recovery, I have often really wished I could find a similar group of supportive people who understand how hard quitting smoking really is. The non-smokers in my life just don't get it and are pretty useless as far as support goes. But you guys? You *know.* 

Just reading through old posts here about what you go through in withdrawal has been so, so validating. I get really down on myself, feeling like I'm weak and stupid and have no self-control. None of which helps me quit-- honestly, I've been smoking in secret for years because I just can't deal with the shame and disapproval. It feels amazing to be able to talk to anybody about withdrawals, grieving for smoking, coping techniques, and ways to positively reinforce not-smoking. 

And to you people with 100-plus day badges... you give me hope. So much hope. So thanks to everyone just for being here.

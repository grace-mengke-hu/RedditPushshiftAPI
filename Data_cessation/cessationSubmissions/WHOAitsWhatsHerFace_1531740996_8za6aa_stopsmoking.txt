Day one

Title says it all. Today is day one of me quitting smoking. I have managed to not have one for twenty four hours and the thought is amazing and I'm pretty proud since doing this was a really random decision. I have one question though. How do you guys cope with cravings and situations that trigger the desire to light up? So far I've figured out that eating distracts me, but I don't want to replace one bad habit with another. And I can't avoid most of the situations where I usually smoke (e.g. I work in a car wrecking workshop as a receptionist and can smoke whenever I likeâ€”I'm there for eight hours every day as well).

Thanks guys :)

My story

Well im 27 almost 28 years old in october... So the thing is i used to smoke for the past 11 years. I enjoyed it i loved it. But things changed. I dindt love it or like it anymore feel nasty and embarrasing.. Guilty i felt so bad phiysical with short breathe. Smoked a pack a day. Now is my day 5 smoke free and i ve been loving feeling sober after this time. I realized the rewards are much better than satisfying the insctinct well i know withdrawal comes with headaches ant other things but smoking give it too.. Now with all and the withdrawal i feel better than back when i smoke. But let me tell you way to go is to really want it. Finish a cycle. Finish a lovr hate relationship. I love how i can breathe now. How brighter and clean my mouth feels. How i can deep breathe with out cramps or chest pain.. how energetic my body feels. But you have yo drink water to reduce the withdrawal.. And not get any constipation. I also love yo excercise so im enjoying it with less limitations. Dont give up. Its amazin just embrace it. Its pointless to smoke... You dont worth it. You dont deserve it.

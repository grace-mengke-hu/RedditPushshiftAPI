Got out of a mental hospital and started smoking

I got out of a mental hospital for ten days after trying to kill myself. I failed pretty bad and screwed things up with my therapist and people who help me. I started smoking the day after I got out of the mental hospital. Not cigarrettes but cigars. I got the biggest head rush smoking a cigar, it was unreal. I spend literally two dollars and 50 cents in dimes to get cigars today. I feel so pathetic paying in all dimes to get cigars. It was only two cigars, I smoked in the rain. Its only been about 6 hours since I stopped smoking. I am broke and my dad is my rent-payee so I will likely quit for good this time. Quitting for like the 4th time.

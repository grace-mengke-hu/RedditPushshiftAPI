Caved at around 200 days, but the mental switch CAN be turned off

Hey quitters new and old, just wanted to share my experience in case it helps.  I was able to quit (with great difficulty) for several months, but after some time the cravings came back due to stress.  Even though I'd been battling effectively for hundreds of days, it was still a battle.  Every time I had a single beer or a stressful day at work, I had to overcome stress-related cravings I'd created back when I was younger (trying to cram for a test or dealing with relationship issues).  So here's the thing: I caved a few months ago and bought a pack, but kept my counter going anyhow.  I threw half of the pack out, and am actually glad I caved, because I got to taste how gross and useless the habit is when you don't already have nicotine in your system.

Prior to this experience, I thought I'd always have cravings.  They are gone.  Maybe not forever, but I can now get drunk and not even think of smoking.

**TL;DR - I thought quitting smoking would forever feel like a battle for the first 3 to 4 months after quitting, now I barely think of them, save for still being subscribed to this subreddit.**

Hang in there, and thanks for all the help over the years!

2 weeks; what's the deal with badges?

Cold turkey. I nearly threw in the towel several times. The rationalizations are incredible. They haven't stopped, but I'm doing my best to hold strong. I just keep pushing back that deadline. "Wait until 10 days and see if you still want one. You can have one if you do." "Wait until 2 weeks before you have one. You can have one if you do." It just keeps getting pushed further and further away, but it seems to be working.  My next deadline is my 32nd birthday, this coming Saturday. It's a dangerous balancing act. Thanks for your support, and fingers crossed that I don't take myself up on the offer of giving in down the road. I suspect the urges should decline very soon. Oh god, how I hope the urges decline very soon.

As a side note, what's the deal with the badges? I'm definitely past 2 weeks, (quit March 21st) but my badge has said 12 days for the last 2 or 3 days now. Is the badge system having issues?

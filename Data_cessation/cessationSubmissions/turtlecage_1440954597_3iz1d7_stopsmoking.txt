Day 3!

I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days. I am still using an e cigarette but I am still insanely proud of myself. 

Next week I am going to switch from the 6 milligram liquid to the 3 milligram. Then to the zero!!! 

Cigarettes are out of my life, next comes the nicotine. I feel so much better already, I can smell, I can taste, I can breathe so much better. I can't wait to be free from the addiction altogether.

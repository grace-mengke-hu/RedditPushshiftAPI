I finally got rid of smoking, it was the easiest thing I ever done in junction with what people say about it.

One week ago while chocking myself with ciggarettes I've decided to check this sub reddit to see If there's anything serious or some sort of technique to quit smoking that might be half decent. Honestly I managed to avoid smoking for some short periods of time with the power of will but I always got pulled back thanks to the awful cravings.  I'm writing this now a week after - 0 cigarettes, 0 cravings, 0 side effects ... nothing.. I've been smoking for the past four years smoking 20 - 40 cigs/ day. How did this magically happen? Well as I sad I visited this website one week ago and I thank my procrastination for this, because I didn't actually read anything I only scrolled trough titles to notice this pattern " Allen Carr" "Allen Carr" so I found this as first entry on you tube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TL2Vh7goJc 
 The realization of the facts was so strong that I immediately threw away my packs and lost the willing to smoke. It's all about forgetting the brain wash and realizing on your own how it's actually making you worse in every way and making you unable to smoke again because It'll feel too stupid to poison yourself in that way. And after all if you do it right you'll never again feel the cravings.. Don't aim to quit smoking actually become a NON-SMOKER and never smoke again.. Thanks to that youtube video and for my willing to waste four minutes of my life on that I managed to quit smoking without any side effect.

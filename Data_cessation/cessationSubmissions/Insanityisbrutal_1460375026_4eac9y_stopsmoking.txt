A plan to quit

Hi guys, 
Not been subscribed to this thread long but by god does it help, it actually makes me feel like I am able to quit! I've made a decision to quit on payday which is the 27th, so I can buy this Allan c book you guys have been on about! And also a lot of gum so hopefully that will suppress the urges when they come, apart from that anything else I should get to help? 

I also made a plan which I think in my opinion is a good idea, I usually get my hair cut and dyed every payday and I decided that if I quit on payday I won't allow myself to have my hair done until I have passed a week without smoking, so it's like a treat to me, how does that sound? 

Or do I just sound like an idiot with goals that are too high?

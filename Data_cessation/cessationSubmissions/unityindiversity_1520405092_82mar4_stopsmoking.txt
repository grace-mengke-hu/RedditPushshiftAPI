Anyone find smoking makes it hard to concentrate?

I've been quitting for a few months, I fell back into it the last couple weeks, I'm quitting again now. But one thing I can't help notice is there seems to be some kind of effect on my ability to read/enjoy what I'm reading. Also some anxiety seems to come along with smoking.

I'm not totally sure if this is correlation or causation and was wondering what some others have to say about it.

PS good luck stayin away from the darts, folks!

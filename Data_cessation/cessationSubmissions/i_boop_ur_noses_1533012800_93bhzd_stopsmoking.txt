Guys, I get what Allen Carr meant and I also get why it doesn't 'work' for some

Smoke free since 2 days, arter smoking for 6 years, 20-a day. I tried multiple times. No motivation was strong enough (or that's what I chose to believe). Finally read Allen Carr's book EasyWay. 
Just look at it this way, no matter how psychological you make it, it is afterall a drug addiction. All we need is a way to trick our own mind to believe something, like kids. 
I tried doing it 'my way' multiple times. Sometimes the timing wasn't right, sometimes I was in the YOLO mode, but the truth is I couldn't find a way to wrap my mind around'how' will I survive. Now I understand, I was surviving while I was smoking, now I am living. I lived the same before I started smoking, nothing got better coz of it, so I know it will be a-okay if I quit too. 
Just use any damn method as an anchor to quit, even if it doesn't make sense to you, trust the winners. I'm glad I found this group today

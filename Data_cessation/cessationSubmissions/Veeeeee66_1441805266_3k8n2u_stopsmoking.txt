This is the day!

Joined a new office and i was only smoker in the office. That really helped me in reducing my smoking as no one would come ask me to go for a smoke.

Recently, the office recruited a lot and now my office is full of smokers. the numbers of cigs i smoked per day started going up and I realized that if my number of cigarettes depend on the people around me, it will be a vicious cycle and i will never stop smoking.

Took 3 drags from the cigarette at 9.45am and threw it away. Installed the quitsmoking app on my smart phone. 10 hours without smoke and i won't turn back!

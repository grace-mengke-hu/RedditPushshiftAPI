Taking the plunge today

I have a 4 year old daughter and another on the way and I need to stop.  My daughter is one of those kids who wants to be just like daddy - even as far as being fully toilet trained for 18 months and not wanting to wipe after a pee because "daddy doesn't wipe." 

I've tried my best not to smoke in front of her (I've never smoked in the house and I don't smoke in the car when she's in it) but she still sees me the odd time.  

So the final straw was this morning when we had this conversation:

Her:  "Daddy, when are you going to stop the fire?"

Me: "What fire?"

Her:  "The fire that you do."

Me:  "Sweetie, I don't know what you mean.  What fire are you talking about?"  note: we have a fire pit in our back yard but we haven't used it in a year so she couldn't be talking about that.

Her:  "The poles.  The fire poles that you always do."

Me:  *stomach goes into knots* "Oh...well I'm going to stop buying the 'poles' soon, and I probably won't do them much longer.  They make me feel bad.

Her: "Okay."  And then she goes on to show me how her lalaloopsy doll can double as a pillow and a vicious weapon when thrown at the cat.


So...hopefully today is day 1.  

I've read "the book" twice and although it made perfect sense, it wasn't enough to shake the sense into me to quit so I'm just going to go ahead and not buy another pack today.  


In case it's relevant, I'm 40 and I started smoking at 13.  Since my 20s I've been about a pack a day...

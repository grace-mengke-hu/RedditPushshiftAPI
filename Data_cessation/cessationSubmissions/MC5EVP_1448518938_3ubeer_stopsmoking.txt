3 days!

Just want to thank everyone here for being so supportive of one another. I have basically been living in this sub when I'm on reddit and it has helped tremendously. It's nice knowing at any given time someone else is going through the same thing and can relate. Today has been the hardest for me, but I'm staying focused.

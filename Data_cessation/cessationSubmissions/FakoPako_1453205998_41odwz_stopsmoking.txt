Good Morning People!

How are we going this fine day 19? Hopefully everyone is going strong and not slipping. 

I have a dentist appointment today for my routine cleaning. I am curious to see if they notice that I quit smoking. I go quarterly for cleaning. For sure, next time they should notice bigger difference. 

Well.. time to go pump some iron... lift things up and put them down...

Have a great day you sexy, good smellin', not stinkin', money savin', clean breathin' non smokers you!

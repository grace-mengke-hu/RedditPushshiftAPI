My 100th attempt

Little back story. I have been smoking since I was 15 years old. I'm 26 now and live what I feel is an extremely stressful life. I'm an off and on again gym goer. I have dropped from 265 to 211 and recently back up to 224. I just got a divorce 8 months ago and still live with the x wife. Every day is a battle with my depression anxiety and intermittent explosive disorder ( aka impulsive anger issue.) Recently I just got accepted into nursing school and wanted to get into the best shape of my life. I thought smoking should be the first to go. I have tried over and over to quit smoking but literally never make it through the first day. My anger comes out like a raging baloni sandwich. At this moment I have 3 weeks worth of 14 mg patches sitting on my desk with 3 tubes of lozenges as well. Also as a side note I have read Allen Carr's book and didn't seem to work for me. Sorry for the long post. Any words of encouragement or advice on the patches vs cold turkey method. Thanks to all I hope I join the ranks of the non smokers soon.

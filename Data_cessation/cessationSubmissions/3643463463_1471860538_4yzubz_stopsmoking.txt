smoker and non smoker relationship..

hi /r/stopsmoking, I apologise if this is posted in the wrong sub, I just need some advice! I've been with my boyfriend for two years, he's a smoker and I'm not. I know you'll probably say this is my own fault for dating a smoker, but basically I can't stand smoking! Me and my boyfriend have been arguing over it a lot lately. He's trying to quit for me, while he has cut down loads, it's been months now and he still smokes the same amount since. He'll have one in the morning, one at lunch time, one later on in the afternoon, one after dinner, one at night and one before bed. I just don't know how to handle being around someone who smokes, it just upsets me and makes me angry because I care about him and his health but he thinks I'm trying to take something he enjoys away from him. I also understand quitting smoking is one of the hardest things to quit, it's not easy and I know I'll never fully understand, but I'm trying. He's been quite grumpy lately with zero patience and he says that's what happens when he tries to quit and blames me saying if I want him to quit I better get used to this. So I was wondering is this a common side effect of quitting? As I said he's cut down, but he's been smoking the same amount for months now. Ideally I'd like him down to 3 a day, but I don't see that happening anytime soon and I feel like if he wants to quit, he would of. I admit I have a problem everytime he lights up a fag. It stinks, he smokes in the same room as me, we could be watching a film together and he'll randomly pause it for a fag break. I guess I'm just fed up. Could anyone offer some advice please?

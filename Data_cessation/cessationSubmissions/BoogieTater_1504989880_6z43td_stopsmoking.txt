I'm 2 days in

Feels like three though since I quit on Thursday at 11am. Anyways today has been okay, not a ton of cravings. Last night though, oh boy, it was rough.
I felt my partner nitpicking at things I said or did, and it made me angry, really angry, and then I was having trouble getting DS to sleep. Usually id go out to smoke, reset, and come back in feeling okay. 

I was frustrated, mad, anxious, felt like crying. But I didn't smoke! I'm already getting anxious tonight will be the same though when my partner gets off work. Just need some encouragement.

Serious cravings not going away for sometime now .. Need help.

Am not sure what's happening. Am into 11th day of my 4th quit. All previous quits lasted only 2 weeks. Thought the first few days and week I was confident and craving free but out of the blue for last couple of days my head is making all excuses to get one and light it up. Am telling myself not to do it but feeling miserable because of this feeling this craving is not going away. It's not a 5 min craving thing. I don't know what to do. I know if I smoke I will hate it. But that's how am feeling right now. Want to smoke one badly.

I broke today...

After 2 months smoke free I broke and had a smoke. My anxiety had gotten real bad today and I thought 'fuck it' ... It calmed me down a little but not like it used to. I should have gone for a run or bicycle ride because those relieve my stress way better nowadays.  I'm back on square one but on the bright side I only smoked 7 cigarettes since November of last year which I feel is a big milestone. I'm proud of myself and I plan on continuing strong being smoke free. I will not fail at this!

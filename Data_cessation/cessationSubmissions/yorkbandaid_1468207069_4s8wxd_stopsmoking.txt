About to hit a wall

So ive made it three weeks with no cigarettes at all!!  I've been telling myself to hang on just until my air travel is over (because its a serious health risk for me to fly and smoke and take bc pills at my age).  I have been craving hard and air travel will be complete by the end of this week.  I dont know if im strong enough to keep going...

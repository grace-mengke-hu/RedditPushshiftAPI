Help, my brain is fucking with me.

Hello, this is my first post here.

I quit drinking 6 months ago after a few failed attempts, now I'm trying to quit smoking but aaaarrrr I'm going crazy, my brain keeps telling me "you can do it later, you're depressed, it's not the right time, there are more important things"... etc etc.... how do I get motivated? I can't even quit for a whole 24h :/ Too many excuses. At least with the booze it was so horrible I could see the benefits more clearly...

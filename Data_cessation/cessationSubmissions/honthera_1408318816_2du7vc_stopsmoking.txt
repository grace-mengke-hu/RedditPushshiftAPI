18 months ago my Dad got a massive heart attack and survived. Now hes back smoking. What should I do?

So 18 months ago, my Dad got a heart attack. He's somewhat of a fitness fanatic yet at the time he was smoking about 20 a day (ya I know). He is very lucky to be alive, he in fact raised the alarm himself but the doctor said he was only having a panic attack, thankfully our neighbour pressed for the paramedics and they were present to revive him when he went into cardiac arrest. 
He was doing great after only a couple weeks, it was almost a blessing you know, a wake up call. But recently he was under stress at work and started having a few on the sly.  Ive had a word with him and he assured me he'd quit,  but I think he needs more than that to make him quit. Any advice is welcome!

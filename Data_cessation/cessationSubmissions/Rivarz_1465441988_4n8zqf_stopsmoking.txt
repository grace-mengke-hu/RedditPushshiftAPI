1 Year Anniversary!!

It's been a whole year since my last cigarette. 
**One Whole Year.**

I never thought I could do this. I never made it more than 2 months before this try. I still have dreams (nightmares, really) where I smoke. After 13 years of at least a pack a day, I'm finally free. So here's some highlights for anyone struggling right now. 

**Things that are hard to deal with:** 

1. I still hate being in a gas station staring at the wall of brightly colored cigarette packs while waiting to pay. 
2. I really hate walking past someone smoking a good cigar. Those, at least, still smell good. Those things are all really hard to deal with.
3. Some days, I still instinctively think about smoking a cigarette when I'm stressed.

**What's not hard to deal with:**

1. After I quit smoking, I realized I had the willpower to do other things. I've lost 64 pounds in the last 9 months.
2. I started running after I lost weight. Started C25k a few months ago, moved on to a 10k trainer. I can run 45 minutes straight now. I couldn't run *30 seconds* without being winded last year. I'm also starting Adult Hockey, and going to do a Ninja competition next year.
3. I don't smell bad any more. Conversely, I can smell things again too.
4. I have more money in my pocket, and feel way more healthy than I ever have in my life. 

**Things that Helped me succeed in quitting:**

1. I quit through a combination of a vaporizer and nicotine patches. I had custom juice made at a local place with less nicotine each time I stepped down a rank of the patch. The combo worked well for me, but it might not for others. I had really poor self-control before this, so cold turkey wasn't working. Experiment to see what works for you, or talk to a doctor about what is safe. 
2. I had a plan, and I stuck with it. I made "smart" goals and rewarded myself as I went.
3. I got my family and wife involved. I tried to keep positive too. I drew a cartoon of my dogs telling me how proud they were of me for quitting smoking and put it on my fridge. Corny, but it always made me smile.


There's probably more, but this seems like enough. I just want everyone who's feeling bad about their quit to know that they can do it. You're awesome, and you can do things you never thought you could do. Even if you think you have no self-control, you'll be amazed at what you can really do, if you believe in yourself. 

I'm going out to dinner with my wife tomorrow to celebrate, but I'm happy to answer questions about anything I said (or just in general), if anyone has them! Thanks to this sub for the awesome inspiration for the last year.

I just realized I haven't had a cigarette in a week!

It's been a week and I didn't even notice! I've been an off-and-on smoker for the past 3-5 years, and I'm so excited that I'm finally taking the plunge to stop once and for all. I've started a new relationship, I've decided to quit smoking, and I'm moving on with my life in ways that I never thought possible. I also started taking birth control again, and I'm so terrified of having a blood clot if I continue smoking cigarettes that I think it has effectively scared me into quitting FOR GOOD. I wish you guys all the best. We're stronger than a pack of cigarettes, dammit! Stay determined! We can all do this!

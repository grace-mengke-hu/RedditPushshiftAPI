Wednesday, the last night of my business trip, I went to a casino. Not really a gambler, so this isn't a regular thing. But DAMN, my clothes reeked of smoke afterward. So many people just chainsmoking and throwing money away at casinos. Reality check for sure. Presenting #052 Meowth. See you Monday.

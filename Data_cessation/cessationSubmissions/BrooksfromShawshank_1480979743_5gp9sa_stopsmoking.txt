I want/need to quit smoking, the plan is to quit after finals and I'm already nervous. Need tips

I have been smoking since I was 16 and now finishing up my first semester of sophomore year in college. Next semester I am starting a co-op (January 9th first day) and hopping to be a non smoker by then. My chest has started feeling like horrible recently and I find myself not wanting to go any  where I can't smoke. I tried to ween myself off over the summer but being a pizza delivery driver and bored it was hard to keep my mind off the urge to smoke. E-cigs help but still make my chest feel bad. Do patches or nicotine gum help? What has worked for you guys?

Anyone else feel like a ticking time bomb sometimes?

I've smoked for about 9 years, about half a pack or a full pack per day while also smoking weed mixed with tobacco. Quit for maybe 6 months in total between. This time I'm totally done and after a month of struggling I'm feeling great a couple of months in. Always been skinny and eating a bit unhealthy, but now I'm just munching down food like there's no tomorrow, gaining weight and feeling much better about life. It's such an amazing ride and I'm thankful asf to witness this. It's one of the major reasons that helps me stay a non-smoker. Why would I risk losing this life over some cancer sticks?

Physically I feel great too, but the nagging thought of dying is still fucking with me. I want to grow old, get kids, see my grandchildren and live until I'm at least 75. Dear universe, forgive me for being so ungrateful with the only life I will ever have and please let me experience that. I'm 27 now so I hope I came to this epiphany on time.

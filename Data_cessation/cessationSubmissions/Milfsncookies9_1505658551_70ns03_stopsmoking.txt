Huge milestone

Hey guys, ignore my flair, I need to reset it, because I've definitely given in since I set that. Just wanted to get on here and share the biggest milestone that I've hit yet though.

In the last 6 years since I started smoking, I have never had more than one beer and not had a smoke to go with. However, last night though, I made it through an entire night out with the boys, most of whom are smokers without even taking a drag. It was hard at some points, I got some pretty strong cravings, but other than being hungover as shit, I don't smell bad or have that nasty taste in my mouth from last night. Go me!

I can stop smoking, but it will be hard. any advice ?

So, i am currently 16 years old and have been smoking since i was 14. my current habit is 3 packs a week. I feel like the society is looking at me with disgust every time i light a cigarrete. I am what you can call a social smoker. I dont want to light a cigarette when im at home or anything, the only time i find myself smoking alone is when im waiting on a bus. wich i rareley do. But im afraid that i will end up being one of those a pack a day smoker who smokes alone. So what im saying is i like the nicotine, but i can live without it. the hardest part will be not going outside in the lunch breaks with all my friends. Who is smokers. So is there any advice from holding back, with smoking together with my friends ?

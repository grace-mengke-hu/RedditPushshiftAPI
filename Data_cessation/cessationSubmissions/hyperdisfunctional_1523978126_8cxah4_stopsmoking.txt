Today is the day!!

Today is the day I quit smoking!!  After 10 years and 1 previous failed attempt that lasted 1 year it's become tine to quit!!  This time for all the reasons known to man!!  My health, financial status and most of for my family!!  The money and time wasted on smoking is just ludacris!!
Also on a side note it's also the day I give up drinking energy drinks everyday!!! 

Churrr!

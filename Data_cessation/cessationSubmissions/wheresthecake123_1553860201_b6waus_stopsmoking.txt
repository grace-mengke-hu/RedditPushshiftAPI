Quitting today

Well I decided a few weeks ago that today was going to be the day I quit cigarettes. I have a new niece that I'm flying to visit today and I don't want to be known as the uncle who smokes, so that's my motivation. Not very good at sharing, but I heard this sub helps out a lot, so plan on being a bit more active here in hopes that it will help. Thanks for being here!

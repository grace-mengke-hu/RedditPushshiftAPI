36 Hours In

Hey everyone!  I'm only 36 hours in to quitting, but I'm excited because this is the longest I've gone without smoking since my brother's wedding (five years ago).

I'm telling everyone I know that I'm quitting so they can keep me honest.  I figured I'd also tell a bunch of people I don't know, because why not? Also, I'm hoping my new-found addiction to reddit can replace my decade-long addiction to cigarettes.  Here's hoping!

If you want to help motivate me, tell me some quitting stories, throw me some tips or just let me know how I'm jumping the gun on celebrating because 36 hours means nothing in the overall scheme of things!

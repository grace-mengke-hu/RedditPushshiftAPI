7 days in .. so far so good!

At the time of writing this, it has been exactly 7 days 6 hours and 29 minutes since I last smoked a cigarette.  I am beyond thrilled and have no intentions of going back.  I would, however, like to talk a little bit about my experience.  

I started smoking when I was 16, currently I am 28 years old.  I smoked, on average, a little over a pack a day, everyday.  The day I quit, I had one cigarette left in my pack.  I smoked it in the morning and after I finished I decided that was the last one I would ever smoke and, so far it has been.  The only side affect I have noticed (besides my singing being much, much better [especially in the shower]) is insomnia.  My BF still smokes, even around me and I have not once craved a cigarette (in fact, the smell actually nauseates me now).  I have gone into gas stations and all the stores I used to buy them in and have had no urge to purchase a pack.  I used to smoke constantly in my car and surprisingly, I have managed to not kill anyone in a fit of withdrawal rage.  In fact, I have not been irritable in anyway!  Truthfully, I have not made any other change in my daily routine except for cutting out the cigarettes; absolutely no attempts to avoid triggers or stay away from friends who smoke.

Has anyone else been able to quit with such ease?  I am certainly not trying to brag for those of you who are struggling as I thought I too would go through a similar pattern.  I just cannot get over, for me, how smooth this seems to be going.

I feel almost horrible in a way as my co-worker is trying to quit too and has not had the same amount of luck.

Just wondering if anyone else's transition to a smoke free life has gone as smoothly as mine seems to be?

Thanks for reading!

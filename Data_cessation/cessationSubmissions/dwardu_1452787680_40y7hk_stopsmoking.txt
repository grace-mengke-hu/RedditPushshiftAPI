Stopped again on January 4th

So I had a 3 week holiday and I was smoking too much, and once I arrived back home, I was sick, had fever and just couldnt look at them. I had bought 2 packs before i flew back home, but i threw away the sealed packets in a bin in some garbage bin outside of my house so i wont get tempted to reverse my decision. I hope I will stop forever now.

Need you guys

Just found out one of my friends was found dead after being missing for 2 weeks. Right now i feel like i want to smoke a cigarette. I know it wont make anything better i know it wont bring my friends back i know all of that and its not even because im craving one i just want that serene moment with just me my thoughts and smoke. I dont know why maybe the meditation. anyone been in similar situation? how much would one cigarette set me back in terms of health? I know i wont fall back so thats not an issue. an other thing is im in a country 1000s of miles away form my home country so not much to do or anyone to talk to.


**Edit:** Thanks guys all your responses means a lot and i decided not to smoke anyway. Dont see the point i dont even want one just needed to vent i guess. thanks for your responses! im just going to relax at home play some games then study some kanji.

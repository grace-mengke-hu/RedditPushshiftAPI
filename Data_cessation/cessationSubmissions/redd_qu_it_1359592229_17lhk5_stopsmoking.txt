Attempt #254 of trying to quit

I created a throw-away account to get this off my unhealthy chest. 

I've been secretly smoking for a little over two years now, about 3-6 cigarettes a day and I feel guilty about it every single day. My family and girlfriend have no idea and I feel like shit about it when I see them, but it's sadly not enough to get me to quit. I thought going to the gym would help, but I just got bigger and continued the habit.

Most of the smoking would happen at work, but on weekends, I'd find excuses to leave the house to have a smoke. I've tried quitting so many times and I've avoided posting in this subreddit, because I was afraid of the reality of it. 

I just threw my last pack away 45 minutes ago. I'm tired of hiding my bad habits and covering up any signs that I smoke.

I have my fingers crossed (so a cigarette won't fit in there).

I'm thankful that this subreddit exists and for the contributing redditors here. I'm hoping that this will be one the factors that will help me stop.

Thank you!

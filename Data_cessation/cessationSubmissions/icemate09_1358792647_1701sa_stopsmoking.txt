1 Week Woop Woop Nicotine Free E-Cigs are Great

In order to have something to do with my hands when I'm with my smoker friends, I use nicotine-free E-Cigs. It's helping me with the early days of withdrawal without having to avoid all my friends. I feel great. I worked out yesterday just because my lungs felt better. I'm also reading Allen Carr's book so that I won't have to use the E-Cigs at all. 

Life is awesome.

Phlegm & Coughing

I'm on day 108, cold turkey. For some reason, I keep clearing out phlegm. I feel like I have more of it then when I smoked!! Does anyone else have this issue? My neck also feels a bit sore, probably from all the coughing. Uggh.

Still feels a million times better than smoking though. lol.

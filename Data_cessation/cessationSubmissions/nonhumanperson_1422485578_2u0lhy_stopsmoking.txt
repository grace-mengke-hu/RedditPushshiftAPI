Day 4 - Tell me this gets easier

Day 4 going on 5, really Jones-ing right now for one. I used to love to smoke after meals. Can anybody farther down the line offer advice or insight? Me and my friend are both quitting right now, so we wrote signed checks for $100 dollars to each other that we will cash if one of us breaks the commitment. We text each other every night so far "yes" or "no" in regards to it. I don't want to lose $100 but that price is starting to seem more and more worth it! Fuck nicotine!

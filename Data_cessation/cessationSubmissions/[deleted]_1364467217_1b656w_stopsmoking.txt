Smoking and Depression

Once upon a time, I quit smoking. It was actually pretty easy, at that point I had only ever smoked maybe four or five cigarettes a day, so it wasn't much of a shock to my system. But then I became horribly, horribly depressed. I've struggled with depression since I was 15, but this was worse. I had a lot going on at the time, including my first-ever breakup (yay for going suicidally crazy over a girl you dated for four months), so I didn't correlate it with quitting smoking at first. But one day, after I had broken down crying in the car, I saw a tobacco shop and decided fuck it, I want to die anyway, might as well slowly kill myself.

One puff. That was all it took. One puff, and suddenly everything seemed alright. I wasn't happy, per se, but I didn't want to die, which was a huge step up.

I'm doing much better now, thanks to medication, but I'm worried about what could happen if I quit again. The last time I tried to quit, back in January, I experienced a huge drop in mood, even after withdrawal ended, though that could have been the change in medication that I have since undone. 

My roommate once told me that smoking causes the release of serotonin, in response to which your brain grows more serotonin receptors, which lowers your mood when you don't have nicotine to release serotonin to fill them; in his words, that I'll never be as happy as I was before I started smoking. 

Does anyone here have experience or expertise on these matters?

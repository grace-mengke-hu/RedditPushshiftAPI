I'm on my 3rd day and I want to relapse

I just ran out of zero nic juice and I'm getting really anxious. I've been super irritable and anxious all day and I want to relapse really bad.

What if I just have a single cigarette. Or a half? A few puffs? Does that ruin all previous progress? This is the longest I've gone without nicotine in the last 2 years.

Quitting the Juul

If this isn’t an appropriate sub feel free to take this down but I didn’t want to be a bummer in the actual Juul sub lol. I’ve been using the Juul for maybe 2 years, but quit smoking cigarettes this past November with the help of it. (Best decision I’ve made and still proud of myself for continually following through. It’s still not easy at times hence still following this sub but I’ve come far). My next project now is quitting the juul completely. I’ve been trying to ween off but I think I just need to stop for a number of reasons. I take at least 10 bathroom breaks at work to use it. I use it before bed even after brushing my teeth and oral hygiene is something I’m trying to get seriously on top of after such a long period of neglect (depression, smoking, etc. doesn’t matter why at this point, I just need to change). Juuling doesn’t help this. It also dehydrates me and doesn’t help my singing voice and I take singing seriously and recently started lessons. I have every reason to stop using it but it still feels like an undertaking. Does anyone else have experience quitting the Juul/a vape they could share? I’m dreading it, it’s almost as much as a part of my life maybe even more than cigarettes were at this point, maybe, and I feel overwhelmed but know it’s the right thing to do.

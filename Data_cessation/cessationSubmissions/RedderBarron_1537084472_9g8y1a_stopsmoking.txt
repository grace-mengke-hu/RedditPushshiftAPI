I've been having cravings all day.

Hey folks. So i've been smoke free for over 2 months now, but nicotine free for only a few weeks. I've been using a vape, it's the only thing that's been working for me but today i've been thinking about smokes constantly. My biggesg triggers are stress and boredom. My family has been on my ass about getting a second job cos atm im just working part time in one job, and my mom wants me to get a girlfriend so shes been trying to set me up which is infuriating and frustrating in itself, and today is Sunday, and i live in a small nowhere town where there is nothing to do and the weather has been so cold and miserable that i cant go outside without at least 3 layers. So i've been bored out of my goddamn mind all day! I've been hitting the vape but its not giving me big clouds i can use to aleviate the boredom, i'm out of e-juice except for the maybe 1/5th tank i have left. With no nicotine. 

Help... please? Im thinking about it obsessively.

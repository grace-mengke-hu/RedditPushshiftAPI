Smoking dreams

I quit almost 3 years ago (June 4, 2011). Highly recommend it to everyone ;) Over the last few months, I smoke in my dreams pretty much every time I have a dream I can remember. Last night I had one of the most vivid dreams I have ever had - I had an internal debate of whether or not to buy a pack, I bought a pack and lit up. It felt SO REAL. 

These dreams are starting to affect my waking life as well, as smoking is much more a part of my thoughts than it was 6 months ago. Has anyone else experienced this, so long after quitting? What the hell is wrong with me?

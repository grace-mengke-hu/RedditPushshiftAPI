Today is Day 1 For Me

I'm less than a week away from my 1 year anniversary for when I quit drinking. Back in October of 2018 I picked up smoking as away to cope with anxiety while hanging out with friends at bars. I didn't want to feel like a burden to my friends for not being able hangout at bars late into the night, so I picked up smoking as way to cope with a drinking environment without folks being clued into my internal struggle. This is obviously a pretty unhealthy approach.

So today, I'm taking the plunge to quit. I don't want to just be rotating addictions. I have a few nieces and nephews and I want to be a decent example for them. I have a family history with cancer and I don't need to be helping it along. I know that I'm not the biggest smoker ever (2 packs per week for about 6 months) but I would rather quit while I'm ahead.

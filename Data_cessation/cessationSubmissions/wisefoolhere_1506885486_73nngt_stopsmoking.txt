Didn't even last 24 hours.

I attempted to quit cold turkey yesterday. I lasted  22 hours which for me is good. I can handle the physical aspect of withdrawals, though it's not easy. What makes me fail every time is the anxiety. I'm already irritable and can feel my emotions going back and forth with every reminder of wanting a cigarette. But it feels like when an actual stressful situation comes up, I just can't cope. Cigarettes calm me. I felt like I was only half functioning all morning. I would rather not take medication for the anxiety. I just want to find a way to ground my emotions when the anxiety starts. Any tips?

Smoking since I was 15

I'm 24 now, and I've attempted to quit in the past. It's been 2 weeks now and now my body is producing an ungodly amount of mucus. Honestly, I don't care because I can still breathe better and I've been waking up earlier in the day with more energy, I have more time than I know what to do with. 

My problems are:
1. My roommate smokes
2. I don't know what to do when I'm not smoking
3. STRESS, omg stress gets the urges going (and anger because of customers at work)

This is my first time on reddit and I hope to see you guys more!

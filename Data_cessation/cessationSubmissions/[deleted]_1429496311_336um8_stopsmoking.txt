I just went on a run and the pain in my lungs was Soul Crushing. WTF

In high school and college I was a long distance runner.   After college I stopped running and started smoking cigarettes at 19.  Fast forward to me being 39 now and almost 6 months smoke free.  
Today after browsing some healthy subreddits, I go for a run.    
Oh holy hell the pain in my lungs was excruciating!    I thought I was going to vomit and die.  I ran and walked intermittently for only 16 minutes.       I got home and my daughter said I looked distressed.   I was like yeah, cuz I am!
So what's the deal here reddit friends?  Do I have the cancer or what and will it get better.
Hey I'm going to crosspost this to r/running or something (I think if I tell ppl I'm doing that it's ok).

After quitting smoking, what did you notice first?

For me, the first thing I noticed is that my car had this weird smell.  I mean, I only smoked in my car every so often, but for some reason I noticed a weird 10 year old car smell.  Then I realized, hey - it's just the normal smell that my nose could no longer smell because of smoking.  Today, it was the coffee - it smelled so good...

Off cigarettes for 9 months and then I tried one. End of story.

Quit smoking on 21st February 2018.  All was going well till end of November.  In December I got off my guard and told myself that one cigarette when I am having drinks can be managed.  One went to two and so on.  Come March, I had started buying cigarette packs again.  Kicked myself in the butt, reset my counter and am currently 4 days 13 hours smoke free.
When I initially quit, this group was my go to place whenever the urge hit me.  Gradually I stopped visiting the group.
Two lessons for me, NOT ANOTHER PUFF, NO MATTER WHAT is real.  Do not lose touch with the support group, ever.
Hoping once again, that we can all kick the habit in the balls and take control of our lives.

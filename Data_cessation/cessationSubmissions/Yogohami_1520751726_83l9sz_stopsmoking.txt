Abdominal Pain/Discomfort Quitting Smoking

So I quit smoking for 4 days, and had  abdominal pain/discomfort towards my right side of my abdomen, and sometimes my left.

I relapsed and smoked again, and started to feel better.

Is there any science behind this?  Is it withdraw or a means of my body going back to its natural state since smoking possibly makes your body/organs operate differently ? 

IF it is a form of withdraw and your body going through a healing process, how long would it take for such discomforts to subside?

Almost a Month

2 more days till I reach 1 month without smoking! But other than that I feel better and I do not feel breathless anymore. I've been smoking since I was 15 and now since I'm 18 I finally chose to quit before it might be too late. But for those who quit, do you guys feel like your throat gets irritated when you breathe in second hand smoke from people passing by?

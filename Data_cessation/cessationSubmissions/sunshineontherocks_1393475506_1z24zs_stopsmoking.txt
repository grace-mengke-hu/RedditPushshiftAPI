Does anybody have any advice on withdrawals from natural tobacco?

Hey all, I've been a smoker for about 3 years, 2 of which I would smoke common cigarettes like Marlboro and camel, which have the additives in them. I switched over to American Spirits cause they're a more natural cigarette without all the additives so they were "healthier" (we all know there is no healthier cigarette). There was a transitioning period where my body went through all the withdrawals from the additives of the Marlboro's but what withdrawal symptoms should I be looking out now (for the American spirits) for since I'm quitting the smoking habit. I've experienced mood swings (but since I'm female, I blame it on hormones, which I feel isn't true) and boredom (using a cigarette as a justification to be unbored, which really still leaves you bored). I was good for 3.5 days when I decided to restart because I was left feeling bored with my phone dead, while outside.

Is this normal or should I be aware of more symptoms to be knowledgeable on how to combat them.

Some background... I live with a smoker, I have mild mood swings (in comparison to the Marlboro withdrawal), stress isn't a trigger, a "desert cigarette" (a smoke after eating) is no longer necessary, and driving long distances is no longer a problem.

Thank you!!!

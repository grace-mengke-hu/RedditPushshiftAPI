Crazy, this son of a bitc- nicotine.

I smoked about a pack to a half-a-pack for 15 years. Read Carr's book, thought it was nonsense and closed the book. But it must've contained some subliminal message and found myself to believe his words. And without much thought, it's been 2 days, 18 hours and 7 minutes since my last cigarette. Cold Turkey.  

But now that I'm into day three - my mind (the big monster, I presume) is playing some GAMES on me. Been telling it to fuck off but damn, this son of a bitch nicotine is tough. It's now getting all psychological, telling me that I want to smoke. 

Sorry, thought I had to rant somewhere.

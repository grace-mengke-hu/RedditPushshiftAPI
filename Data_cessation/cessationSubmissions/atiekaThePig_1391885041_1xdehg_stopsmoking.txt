WOW. I'm having problems w/: Reddit (keep getting logged out), we're snowed in, my bursitis hurts like a son of a bitch, wah, wah, wah,........I know what I need:

A good ole' *bitch slapping* into gratitude.  OKay already I feel better just reading my whining.  WOW!  28 days and still not a stinking, cancerous fag has dirtied my lips/lungs.

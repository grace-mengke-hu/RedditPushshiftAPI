My life has changed so much since quitting smoking. I don't have anyone to share this day with, but I'm proud to be one year smoke free.

I can't believe how much smoking was holding me back. I find myself alone these days, but that's only because I have shed the things holding me back. I am working towards the life that I've always wanted. Including my career, personal goals and the people that I surround myself with. 

I have attempted to quit many times in my life and the longest that I have lasted was close to 8 months. This time feels different and I don't miss smoking at all. 

What worked for me was joining a 6 week 'quit smoking' program, that I continued to attend as a support group for over 6 months after quitting.  Many towns provide classes like these at their hospitals. It's worth looking into as an option, and if you can't find one available.. try getting in touch with your hospital administrator to suggest starting one! Quitting is much easier when you have a community of support, a structured environment, and understanding people to hold you accountable. 

This subreddit is so wonderful. I'm glad to be on this ride with all of you. Good luck on your mission. I'm rooting for you all. Yay for happy lungs!

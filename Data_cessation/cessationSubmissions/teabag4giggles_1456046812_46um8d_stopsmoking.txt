Hit two months today. Almost caved just barely

Visiting my father in law, and he smokes in the bathroom. Went to the bathroom before bed, and the pack of cigarettes is laying there. This was one of the strongest cravings I've gotten since quitting.

I sat here and stared at them for twenty minutes imagining smoking just one. It will only happen once. Smoke one and go to bed, and you won't smoke another.

After almost giving in, I realized how disappointed I would be with myself because of how far I have come.

Anyone trying to quit, just remember how far you've come and why you decided to quit. It's a constant battle, but never surrender. We are stronger than our addiction.

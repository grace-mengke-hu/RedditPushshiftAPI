Please, help me

Hi.  
  
I've been following this subreddit for a while now. I **have to** stop smoking for health reasons. If I don't my health won't improve. And I have to do it now.  
  
The thing is that I tried many many times over this past two months going cold turkey and always failed. Now I've tried patches and they helped. I had no cravings. But, cravings aren't my problem. I can deal with them. What breakes me every time is my anxiety of thinking "Oh, my god, I'm not allowed to smoke ever again". So, I failed even with patches today. I plan on stopping again on Monday when I get my head straight.  
  
Can you help me? What to do? Do you have any tips, any way of handling this fear? I feel terrible because if I was healthy I wouldn't stop smoking, I have to stop smoking. I just can't bear the fact that I can't smoke even one when I quit. My health is on the line and I feel like shit after all those attempts that failed. I feel empty and miserable.  
  
p.s. I've read Allen Carr's books (Easyway and The Only Way) and watched his video. I've studied whyquit.com but no results. I'm feeling like I'm in a pit I can't get out of and I can't get "How am I going to survive never smoking again" out of my head even though with patches I have no cravings at all. Please help me, I need to stop :(

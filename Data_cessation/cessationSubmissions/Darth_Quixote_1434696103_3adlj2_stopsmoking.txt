Want to stop before it really starts

I smoked through college to be social, and predictably, it turned into a habit. I've really only been "smoking" for about a year. Anywhere from half a pack to a pack a day. Planning on trying to drop the habit before it gets more difficult. 

Given my fairly short track record with nicotine, will it be as difficult as it is with others who've been smoking longer? After only a year smoking, will it take as long to kick the addiction?

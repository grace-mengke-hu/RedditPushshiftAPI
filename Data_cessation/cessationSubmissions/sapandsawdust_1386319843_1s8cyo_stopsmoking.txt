I was thisclose to caving in last night

I was on my way to an exam, stressed out like crazy. Snapped at my partner (who is also quitting with me), got on a super crowded bus (I have social anxiety), and was practically in tears from how badly I wanted to smoke. It was only running late and one last burst of willpower that stopped me from going into the nearby store and buying a pack.

But I didn't. 

It gets easier, right? I'm proud of myself but oh my god, when the cravings are bad, they're downright awful.

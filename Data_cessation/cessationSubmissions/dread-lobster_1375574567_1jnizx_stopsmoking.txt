Wanting to quit, looking for some pointers

Hey all, how is everyone today?

A bit about myself. I'm 24 and I started smoking when I was around 17. I generally smoke about a pack a every 24 to 36 hours, but I can easily go through a pack when I'm drinking.

My main reason for quitting is the money it costs me ($14/pack here). While this might sound silly, the health benefits are only secondary to the price for me. I'm not much of a self-loathing smoker either, and I really do enjoy having a smoke, but I am kind of worried about this attitude being detrimental to my effort.

So right now I think my biggest obstacles are going to be:

-Wanting to smoke while I'm drinking, especially because many of my friends smoke too.

-Not having one when I'm bored or while I'm break, what do non-smokers even do on breaks?

Would really love to hear any advice or stories!

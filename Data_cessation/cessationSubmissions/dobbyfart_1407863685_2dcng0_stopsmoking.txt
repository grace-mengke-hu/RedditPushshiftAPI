Yesterday was actually pretty hard

So I've always struggled with depression, literally from the time that I can remember, I've struggled with it. It's nothing new and as I've gotten older my coping strategies for it have increased. It doesn't make the depression better but it helps me get out of it sooner, or the strategies let me know I will eventually not be as depressed as I am right now.

Yesterday was really hard. Hearing about anyone losing their struggle with themselves is very triggering. All day yesterday I thought about going to get a pack of cigarettes, because whenever the depression comes back that's what I've done. Forget about quitting and start smoking again. But I didn't do it yesterday and I won't do it today either.

If you're experiencing depression, talk to someone. If you're struggling with your quit, talk to someone. It's amazing how much easier the fight can be with someone at your side.

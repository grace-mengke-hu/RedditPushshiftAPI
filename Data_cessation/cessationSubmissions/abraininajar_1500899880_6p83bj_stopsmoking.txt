Making it a new day

Last Friday I finally signed my divorce papers and left a toxic marriage.  Now its time to stop a toxic habit.  I went from smoking a pack every 3 days to a pack a day over the last year with all the added stress of a divorce and child custody and everything that goes with it.  I was going to start today, but ran out yesterday and quit after my morning smoke that goes with my morning coffee.  Feeling good so far, and ready to keep it going.

I found another benefit to being done with smoking. I no longer feel guilty while inside a hospital.

Used to be when I was a heavy smoker, I'd feel guilty while visiting someone in a hospital. Seeing people wheeled around or recovering from a surgery, I would think "Oh geez, I really am taking my health for granted" and then immediately light up once I was off the hospital grounds.

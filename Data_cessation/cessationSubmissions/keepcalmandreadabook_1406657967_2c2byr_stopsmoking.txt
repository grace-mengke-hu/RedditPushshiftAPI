Slipped up.

150 days down the tube. I was going good but then I picked up smoking trees, and the two really go well together for me, and then bam 4-5 weeks of a pack a day like I had never quit at all.

I have literally spent probably $120+ on this slip up and hours of precious time that I could have used for doing other things. Anyways.

I've been smoking trees and ciggs for a bit now and am ready to quit ciggs. I had my last one last night and am ready to go work and not have any. I can't wait to start working out again (I can smoke trees and work out, but not if I smoke ciggs.) and I can't wait to save money and smell better and look cleaner and all that. Wish me luck, and please give me encouragement I feel like crap and will so for the next few days.

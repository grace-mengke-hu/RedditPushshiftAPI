Just lost 2 months 20 days

I had one cigarette two weeks ago on a Saturday night for "fun", and soon within a week, I was smoking up to 3 a day. It's so easy to go back to full addiction in a matter of a few days. I tried so hard to quit too. I never wanna go through that torture again. I'm just playing with fire. I'm done! I can't even have 1 cigarette if it kills me. Stupid cigarettes.

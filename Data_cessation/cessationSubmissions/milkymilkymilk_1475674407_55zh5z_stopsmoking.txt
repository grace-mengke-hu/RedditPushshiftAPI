Should I quit smoking cold turkey or cut down? (Please Read)

I'm a 16 year old boy and I've been smoking since I was 12 years old. Now I want to quit. I am not terribly addicted so I don't really crave cigs and I think I can quit CT. For the past few years I've been constantly changing cigarette brands and that caused issued such as sore throats etc. What's better for my overall health? Quit cold turkey or cut down until I quit? Will my body be in shock if I quit CT?? Thanks <3

Good day!

Good evening (or whatever) fellow quitters or thinkin about quitting quitters! I just wanted to come on and give huge thanks to all of y’all being so supportive of each other through such a difficult period of time. A few months ago I was lurking this sub and it gave me enough strength push me to quit smoking. Just found myself here again and I just wanted to let you all know how SURPRISINGLY good it feels to be two months and 23 days clean. I legitimately feel clean. I can take a breath passed what I thought was even possible. The day is brighter and things just don’t annoy me like they used to. 

Anyways...to all you friends looking to quit. Do it. It’s the best thing I’ve done for myself in the past few years forsure. I heard some quote today that feels relevant. It goes, “the best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now.” This rings true for all actions. Including smoking. You’ve always got now!

Good luck even though y’all don’t need it!

Got the flu, haven't smoked in 3 days...I'm gonna keep it up.

Has anyone else stopped due to sickness and succeeded? I physically cannot smoke at the moment, but I'm well on my way to getting better. I don't want to keep smoking when I start to feel healthy again. 

I've been a smoker for 7 years, and I've tried to quit at least three times. In the summer of 2012 I quit for 4 months, and I haven't attempted quitting since. 

Should I tell my friends that I'm quitting? (Most of them are smokers). Or should I keep it to myself?

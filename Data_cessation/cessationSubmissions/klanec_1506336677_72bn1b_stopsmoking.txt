Replacing cigarettes with meditation

Hey guys, I'm 22 and I've been smoking on and off since I was 18, habitually since I was 20. Recently I graduated University and I've found a job far away. While I wait for visa stuff to be sorted I've moved temporarily back home to my parents place. Out of respect for them (and suddenly not being surrounded by smoker friends), I've gone a week without smoking. Recently I impulsively bought a pack and that first cigarette tasted god awful, the smell lingered on my clothes and in my mouth for ages, it made me feel ill, I could feel my teeth rotting and the next day I had a deep chesty cough.

 I think this is a chance to kick this disgusting habit early. I've downloaded that mindfulness app and I'm going to try meditating everyday. Gonna go rip up each cigarette and stick them in the trash.

 Are there any long time quitters or people with impulsive / addictive personalities out there who can give some advice?

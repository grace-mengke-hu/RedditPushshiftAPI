Cold Turkey 3 Hours In

I smoked my last cigarette 3 hours ago. I don't have any more. Put on PJ's and got into bed early so I wouldn't go out for a pack. I want to be smoke free so, so bad. I've tried vapors, ecigs, nicotine patches... They all lead me back to cigarettes. So I'm done. Gonna drink a shit ton of water and sweat out the withdrawal. I can do this. Pray for me, y'all

Edit: I started smoking when I was 13. I'll be 32 next week. Doing the math on that startled me. It's time for this to stop!

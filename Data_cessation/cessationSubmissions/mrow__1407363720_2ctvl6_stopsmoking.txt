New at stopsmoking sub, not quite new at quitting

<backstory>:
I've been smoking regularly for the past 6 years, plus two on/off years before that.
Of my two attempts to quit, the first one was about 8 months ago. I have entertained the idea, but didn't actually attempt to quit smoking for so long partially because I didn't see a good enough reason why (?!), and in part because I thought failed attempts might discourage me if ever really wanted to do it.

The first time I tried to quit I failed after 14 hours (including 8 sleeping hours). I hadn't given it much thought before I made the decision, and even though I had a vague idea of things that could happen during the first smokeless days, there were still surprises for me in store. I had a bunchload of work that week, so I found myself awfully unable to focus and stay calm, and on top of that I felt so sad and disappointed that I couldn't stop crying.
It was like I was a completely different person, even being able to recognize that there's no real reason to cry, I cried even more.
Then I lit a cigarette and realized exactly why so many people were comparing cigarettes to drugs. My whole outlook changed in a few short moments and I could feel it - it was exactly like (my experiences with) the comeup on some drugs.

I continued smoking and two months ago I decided to do it again, with a quitting partner - my mom, a smoker for over 30 years.

There was just one entire day that I managed without a cig. Then I bought a pack because I'm awfully afraid of constipation, but I would have one cigarette with the morning coffee and that would be it. And that was it, for two days. Then my partner bought herself a pack and would smoke 3 per day. This went on for about a week, we both got incredibly cranky and shorttempered and were yelling randomly all the time - so we both got back to regular smoking.

I decided I'm gonna quit smoking this time by myself and for good.
It feels a bit scary to write this, but I promised myself I'm gonna quit by the end of this summer.

**From my past (although very few) nonsmoking days I learned that**:  
 - I can handle social situations and drinking without a cigarette;  
 - mood swings when I'm not in control of my body suck real bad;  
 - my skin can still regenerate itself, smile lines and pimples disappeared a bit and my skin lost those yellowish tones;  
 - it's possible to have coffee without cigarettes;  
 - most of my triggers come from the habit of maximizing pleasure;  
 - focusing on healthy eating helps a lot in changing my mindset;  
 - constipation is a huge pain in the ass.  

**I'm looking forward to**:
 - being able to run and climb again;  
 - not having yellow index fingernails or nasty smelling fingers, hair or clothes;  
 - not having wrinkly and deeply carved smile lines;  
 - my mind being clear of brainfog and not needing smoking breaks;  
 - spending my money on things that bring me more substantial pleasure;  
 - hopefully not dying of cancer.  

**I'm very scared of**:  
 - not being able to focus on work (although I work from home and am in control of when and what I do regarding work)  
 	* I decided this would be the time to give nootropics a shot and already ordered;  
 - constipation  
 	* this I will try to avoid by healthy eating, lots of fiber, working out;  
 - mood swings;  
 	* I hope a combination of the things above and some mental effort will help me here;  
 - relapsing  
 	* I'm considering getting a disposable e-cigarette just in case.  


I have three more cigarettes which I intend to keep as a trophy, or dispose of if they're tempting me.
Hopefully I'll manage to finally rid myself of this gross habit and update this post daily.    
  

Kind people of quitsmoking, if you have any advice or additional comments, I'm all ears.
Wish me not luck, but strength!  



edit: I can't handle formatting

edit2: Rereading this after two weeks I clearly see my plan to fail in the tone of my writing. Needless to say, I relapsed immediately. I watched Allan Carr's movie the day after I posted this and lit one as soon as the guy encouraged to sit back and relax with a smoke. I started reading the book. Thank you for all the helpful words and advice.

One day I'll come back here again.

Day 2 - Using e-cig to ween off

Start of day 2. Yesterday went pretty well. Weird getting my nicotine fix at my desk while at work. But it got me through my 3 most important smokes of the day. First of the day, after first cup of coffee, and after meals. I've taken care of the fix for now, but I'm having more issue with being bored. I'm at my desk ALL day now. Good luck to everyone else!

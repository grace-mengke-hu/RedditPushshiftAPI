Long Time!!

It's been ages that I posted here. Hope everyone has been keeping good and new entrants are motivated enough to at least think about giving up smoking seriously.
I am visiting this page after quite some time and am pleasantly surprised to find that I have not smoked for the last 574 days! That's quite something. I share my experiences with all, about my feelings before and after giving up smoking. 
Thank you Redditors for standing by and making smoke-free days possible!!

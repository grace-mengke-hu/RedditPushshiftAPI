Supposed to be NYD, but the holiday kept rolling

So tmr is my first day back from the holiday.  I wanted to quit the first but sitting in my apt, playing games, working on computer are all triggers for my smoking.....well hell, everything is.  I have read the allen carr book and it was fantastic.  Every night I go to bed with the idea of quitting then I wake with an insane drive to smoke.  I rationalize myself to 7/11 and I am once again smoking on the way to work.  
I recently turned 34, and I can't keep fooling myself into thinking I have more time to quit.  Becoming the man I want to be, starts with smoking, then comes working out, then comes losing 20 lbs, all the while building confidence in my decisions and who I have become.  Im excited about the new year!
Sorry if this just seems like rambling, but I wanted to put it down on "paper"  I AM QUITTING TMR!!!!!

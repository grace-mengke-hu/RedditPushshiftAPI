Just had a smoking dream.

I figured it was just one cigarette. Why not? It was normal. Just smoke one, for old time's sake. I was disappointed in myself in the dream after I smoked it. I woke up and I realized it's been over a year since I've quit. Took a little while of gathering coherence to realize it was just a dream.

To anyone who's recently quit: these dreams are normal. 

Anyone who hasn't quit yet: you can do it. It only gets easier with time.

Quitting smoke diary - Hawhoong.

My doctor told me that I had severe pneumonia. So... i should quite smoking.
  The first day i stop smoking and try my best to forget the cigarette, and drink tea a lot. Sorry... i can not do that,,,i can not stop thinking about smoking, considering about to smoke or not, even a half cigarette. My friend called me when i try to smoke. After about 2 hours, i came back and played out, runny nose, yawning, etc. Too uncomfortable.
  I drunk water, sleep on my bed and count Sheep...
  Right now, the whole day passed by, i won!  However, what's going on in the next day?

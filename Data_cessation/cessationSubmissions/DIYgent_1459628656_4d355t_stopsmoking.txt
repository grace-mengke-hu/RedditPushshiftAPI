One year later: an app, this sub and SELL YOUR CAR

I smoked 10 cigarettes a day at work, and two more late at night after puffing a bit of weed. Every night for many years.

I decided to quit quitting quitting after my third kid was born. A daughter. We'd lost one prior, and she was the girl we'd wanted after having two boys. Those guys are animals - they'd drive anyone to smoke.

After three months it got easier. The Smoke Free app was instrumental and I check it every day still, along with this sub.

The wins kept adding up, and now I'm very proud to say that I've quit. I've become that guy who talks about quitting to others while they are standing around smoking. I don't offer it - but when I get asked I tell my story succinctly, but with zeal.

It's a great accomplishment. To all of those who have taken the step, whether it's day one or year 10 - good for you. 

**Being in the car was the strongest habitual trigger I had with smoking.**  One thing I did that I recommend to anyone who has this similar trigger: sell your car. 

To sell your car to anyone other than a hardcore smoker, you need to treat it with an ozone generating machine. 
They work. Rent the machine, de-stink your car. Don't smoke it in it again. Ideally, don't even drive it again. Let it sit until you sell it or give it away. You might love the car. Doesn't matter. The car makes you smoke. You and the car smoke. You do not ever not smoke with the car. Sell the car. 

De-stink the car and sell the car.

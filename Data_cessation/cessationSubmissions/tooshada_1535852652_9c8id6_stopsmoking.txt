Ahhh! Day 19 and killing it!

How did I make it this far? Sheer grit and determination. I ate a bunch of gummies at work, like a pound of them in two weeks. I also smoked a bunch of ganja to help distract me from nic fits. I told EVERYONE so I feel totally accountable and the support is very rewarding. Just fucking commit. Get over yourself, ride the roller coaster and enjoy the feeling once you make it to the end of the ride. 15 years of smoking!!! I’m fucking 28!!! Not another puff, I’ve had enough. 

Download “smoke free.” It’s an app that seriously gave me the tools to succeed. If I can do it, YOU CAN TOO! I love smoking but I love myself and my family more. 

Oh, and fucking CRY! Cry like a baby, make a fool of yourself. Realizing how ridiculous your behavior is reinforces the perception of letting go. We don’t want to see ourselves like this or let others see us like this, but the horrifying reaction keeps me from ever wanting to experience this again so I want NOTHING to do with a cigarette. Fuck that. I went through hell to feel okay without them. Shitty ex.

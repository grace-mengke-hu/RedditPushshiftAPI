I hate you all, I'm giving up smoking too.

I'm tired of seeing you posting shittons of informations about how long you don't smoke. I'm tired of new non-smokers I can see everyday here. I hate you, I hate myself, and I'm giving up smoking. Cold-fucking-turkey. Wish me luck, you already non-smoking faggs.

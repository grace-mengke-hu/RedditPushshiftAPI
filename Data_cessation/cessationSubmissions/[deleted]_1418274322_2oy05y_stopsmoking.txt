Almost at 365

I don't exactly know the date. I could check an old journal entry but I don't want to. It was some point in the middle of January.

The most amazing thing to think about is how there has been ZERO cravings and ZERO missing it and ZERO thoughts of going back.


Gone is a crutch that owned me for most of my adult life. When I first stopped I remember physically feeling AMAZING. I was like "Wow, it feels so good my body is not used to how good It feels, this will probably go away and i'll go back to normal" - but no, I still feel amazing.

If you're thinking of stopping and you are reading this, realize that what i'm feeling now isn't amazing - it's just smoking takes a huge toll on you & you WILL continue to feel like crap.

Start feeling good about yourself, you have the rest of your life to enjoy!

DONT wait for the new year, just stop right now!

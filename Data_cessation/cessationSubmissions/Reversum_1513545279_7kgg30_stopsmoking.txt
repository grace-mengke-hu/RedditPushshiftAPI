I knew stopping smoking would improve my stamina, but not that the difference would be this large

So I (finally) stopped smoking a week ago after smoking for 1.5 years. I know I haven't been smoking as long as most of you here, but it felt kind of necessary to break the habit as I wasn't even able to run to the bus anymore.

To improve my stamina and at the same time measure the difference between smoking and not smoking I also started running again a week ago. 

The night I put out my last cigarette (and destroyed the rest of the pack) I went for a run - it lasted for 3.5 minutes exactly. I'm not exaggerating - I really couldn't run any further. Only 7 days later (and 7 runs as well), I'm already able to run 18 minutes (4 kilometers) with only a short 3-minute break somewhere in the middle. That an improvement of 400% in one week.

I didn't see that coming, but it definitely motivates me to continue running and to never touch a cigarette again.

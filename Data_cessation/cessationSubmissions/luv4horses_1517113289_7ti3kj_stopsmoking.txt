Day 27

I had my last cig on NYE. I wasn't even planning on quitting but I woke up and said that this will be a fresh new year and I haven't smoked since. I've noticed I'm no longer coughing up a lung in the morning. I have so much more time to do things. Though I do feel bored a lot. I feel like I'm getting down though too. I think this is another sign of quitting. I guess with smoking I had something to look forward to and get away for a few minutes, now nothing. I need to find something to fill that void. 

I am quitting using nicotine gum which I chew about 2 pieces of day since I quit. Am I just prolonging the inevitable if I continue with the gum since I am still getting nicotine?

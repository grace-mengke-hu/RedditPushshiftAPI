Day 1 of quitting smoking and I'm curious, where does everyone stand on ecigs?

First off, I would just like to say thank you in advance for any advice you guys have for me. I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while in the hopes that it would build up my courage to actually quit for good this time, and I feel really confident because of all of you.  
I attempted to quit yesterday, and went almost an entire day and relapsed. My neighbour and I had a run in yesterday, and that set me off. I was tense enough from not having a smoke all day, and the issue with my neighbour pushed me over the edge. I know I am just making an excuse for it, but here I am, ready to start again fresh. Today has not been that bad. The cravings come and go, but I am keeping it together.  
So, time to address my original question! Where does everyone stand on ecigs. I had used them coupled with the gum before, but I found it didn't help at all. I knew I had to try another method when, on multiple occasions, I would be chewing the gum, and think to myself "man, I could go for a smoke right now". I didn't find the gum helped at all. The ecigs have some pros and cons for me. I find it helps with the oral fixation somewhat, but the fact that it is so much heavier than a real cigarette is definitely a down side. I have yet to try an ecig that actually tastes like cigarettes.  
Anyway, what do you all suggest? Other than a random puff on the ecig I have, I am going cold turkey this run.   
What helped you quit?

Day 12 is over

I'm 20, had been smoking for a few years, but I didn't smoke too excessively until I could buy my own packs. This year, it slowly increased to a pack and a half a day, and I usually woke up feeling physically miserable (clogged nose, sore throat, mouth would always taste like crap, eyes burning, etc). 

It's officially been 12 days (288 hours) since my last cigarette and it's hard not to focus on how emotionally/mentally drained I feel, but I'm trying my best! 

Just wanted to vent a little and share my progress!

Good luck, everybody.

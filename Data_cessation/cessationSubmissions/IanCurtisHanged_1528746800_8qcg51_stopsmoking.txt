6 months in (yes!) and I'm just miserable all of the time (no!)

I quit 6 months ago after about a decade of smoking  and I *love* being a non-smoker again.  But, my depression and anxiety are the highest they've ever been, especially the last month or so.  my drinking has skyrocketed and my eating is out of control because I can't deal with anything anymore.  I got so frustrated the other day over some tiny dumb thing that I screamed until I lost my voice. I try to use physical activity to channel my anger, but I just end up hurting myself.  I was splitting firewood so furiously that I almost blacked out. 


I don't feel like I want to start smoking again  but I also feel like I don't have that time to decompress anymore throughout the day.  When I try to take time to just relax, all I do is think too much and my anxiety starts peaking.  


I know I should probably talk to a doctor about this, but that's just not an option right now.  Anyone else have similar experiences?  I just need to vent, and hear that I'm not some kind of weirdo that needs to smoke to keep from having a nervous breakdown.   thanks

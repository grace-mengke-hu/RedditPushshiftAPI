Over a month and I haven't smoked a single cigarette.

Even my cravings have gone, I don't see the point in smoking again. At first it was hard and I gained weight, due to usually breaking up the time I ate with cigarettes, but now I am losing weight due to feeling healthier. i can exercise more without getting out of breath, so I'm exercising more. Endorphins are a better high than cigarettes and I'm saving money!

No better time then now

I have been "attempting" to quit for some months now, yet I always came up with a perfectly vaild excuse (at least to my crazy smoke addicted brain they were vaild. But after finishing Allen Carr's easy way it finally clicked in my head what i was doing to myself. I was waiting for a perfect time to put them down when really it doesnt even exist, Anytime is a good time to quit.

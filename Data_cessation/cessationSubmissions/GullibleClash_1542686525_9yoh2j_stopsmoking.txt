Truth about smokers and another good reason to quit

Apart from all the money you will save and the healthier life you will live, just know that you will not be judged any longer for smoking. Even if it may seem as if people don't care you smoke, they do. I greatly dislike people who smoke publicly as it just smells nasty and harms other people who may have other breathing problems. I am way less likely to talk to a person smoking or someone who smells of smoke. You will be far more accepted by everyone and will live a happier life. So make the change and toss those cigs away for good as they bring you none.

I've gone smoke-free for a full day for the first time (voluntarily) since I was 14. I'm soon to be 43 years old. I have never made it 24 hours before. I'm almost there...

I've tried quitting many times before but I never *truly* wanted to, I tried because I knew it was bad for my health. A recent health scare actually scared me this time and I decided that I wanted to quit for good now. I tried cold turkey as I was once able to quit another addiction in my past this way once I'd set my mind to it but this method seemed to have inadvertently summoned a she-demon who occupied my body and scared everyone around me, including me. A close friend suggested I try to quell said demon by throwing some lozenges down my gullet but, unfortunately, that didn't work. I ended up caving to the demon's demands and made a sacrifice of $7-ish and made the burnt offering the demon desired. 

I was kicking myself but I was NOT giving up. I spent the next two days using the lozenges intermittently, dug out my vape stuff I'd bought a couple of years ago (and used about all of a week, while still smoking) and cleaned and refilled them, and smoked the pack, vaped and had the occasional lozenge to acclimate myself to satisfying my cravings through those means instead of through the cigarettes. Last night I smoked the last of the pack and felt that it was truly my last cigarette, I was done, I no longer wanted to smoke and tomorrow (today) is a new beginning. 

I woke up this morning and that craving was there but the desire wasn't. I had a lozenge immediately and made my morning coffee. When the next craving kicked in, I used my vape pen. I used the vape pen throughout the day. I had one more lozenge today. In one more hour from posting this, it will be 24 hours since that last cigarette. I wasn't able to do it cold turkey as I wanted to, but I was able to do it. I amazed myself today.

Edit: Thank you for all of the words of encouragement!

I made it. Day 1 done.

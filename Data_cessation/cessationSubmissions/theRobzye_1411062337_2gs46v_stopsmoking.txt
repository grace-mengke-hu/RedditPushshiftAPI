[Day 3] Others and the struggles of a planned quitter

So today was a rough day during the morning. My co-worker who wanted to quit with me was taking Champix which is supposed to take away any nicotine craving and is apparently very popular.

Anyway, so Dr's orders were to quit in 2 days. So I'm back smoking on my usual routine... except a little better - only smoke every two or three hours at work and a lot less at home.

The problem today was that my co-worker completely fell of the train. Smoking every hour. This really sucks for me because I always thought i was such a great inspirer/supporter/leader and I believed I was truly helping him. Even though I couldn't go a day without a smoke he was clean for four days until today. When i asked him if the champix wasn't working he said it was. He just wanted to be a smoker more than he didn't.

Now this hit me hard because it forced me to realize the brutal truth about quitting - all the medication in the world can't make the choice for you. All the help and support in the world can't change your mind. Basically, you have no power over anyone else.

I know that most of you will already know this but as a 19 year old who has always been there for anyone believing I was making a difference it was quite a blow to take knowing that you can't actually help anyone. You can only be there for them. 

I was coming to the point where I was sure that meds would make quitting easy as pie. But now I realize it won't matter. Yes it will help, but the war is far larger than just a nicotine craving. It's about changing your lifestyle, schedule and identity. 

Smoking is terrible. It traps you into this illusion that you are powerless without it. But I've come to the point where I am truly looking forward to Day 5. 

No excuses from there. 

No more delays. 

It's happening.

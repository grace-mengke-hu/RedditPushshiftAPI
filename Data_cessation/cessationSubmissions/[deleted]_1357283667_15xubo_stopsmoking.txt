I asked my girlfriend to help me quit smoking

Second full day, and still struggling. But I told her I wanted to quit and I needed her help. I was determined enough that while we were driving i handed her my half full pack and told her to toss it out of the window, which i've never done. While we were talking about ways she could help me, she ended up saying, "how about everytime you have one, i'll have one." and she doesn't smoke cigarettes and i wouldn't like it if she did. It actually really helps me, whenever i think that i want a smoke, i just think, "i don't want her to have one, more than i want to have one." 

Anyways, thanks for reading and wish me luck!

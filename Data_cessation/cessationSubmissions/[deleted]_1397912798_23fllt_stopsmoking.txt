Day 2...

Today is day 2 of being smoke and nicotine free. I'm taking Chantix and I've found it really does work as advertised. Though, also as advertised, it's not a magic bullet.

I still have cravings. Though, they are FAR FAR less intense and don't seem to cause anxiety or panic attacks.

Last night I was very angry and lashing out at people online.

This morning I'm starting out sad but happy, too. Weird emotions. But, it's been 24 hours and this is day 2.

Slept better last night, too.

Wish me luck today!

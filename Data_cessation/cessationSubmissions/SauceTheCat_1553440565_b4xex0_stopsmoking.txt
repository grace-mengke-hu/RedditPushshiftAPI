20 year smoker, currently 84 hours clean.

I'm the mid 30s lady who quit this past Thursday out of necessity due to wisdom teeth surgery. Not gonna lie, three days of prescription pain killers certainly took the edge off those first few days of cravings, but as of this morning I'm done with the pain pill induced fog. I didn't like how cloudy my head felt and not being able to drive. So I'll save those for a rainy day of bad cramps and get on with my quest to quit smoking all on my own. Well not totally alone, with support from my wife who is also quitting.

I'm still here and still clean. This is the longest I've ever gone without a cigarette since I started smoking as a teenager! The urges and cravings are slowly fading away, each one getting weaker and spaced further apart.

Holy shit, y'all, my skin feels so much better after only three days. Breathing has improved greatly. My heart feels like its beating at a normal pace again. My wife and I have already saved a combined $45. Saving money by not killing ourselves, what a concept!

My biggest challenge right now is getting over the "I'm bored" cigarettes. I don't feel like my physical cravings are unbearable anymore, I don't have that tightness and shaking in my abdomen and my throat doesn't feel tight anymore. It's just my brain keeps going to that "You just finished a task/have nothing to do/you deserve a reward" place.

Killing myself with cigarettes isn't a reward, you dumb brain. We don't need 200 hits of dopamine a day to live. Billions of people do it every day and they feel better than smokers! Cigarettes are a lie. They only make us think we feel better, but they don't. I am better than dried plants wrapped in paper! I. Can. Do. This.

I JUST QUIT , HELP ME !!!!!!!

It's not my first time quitting that is what scares me , and I gained 20kg the last time I quit so that scares me even more , Just want to be healthy and the I feel like the cigarettes are destroying my life honestly ,  I can't run 100 meters without getting chest pains and I can't live like this anymore , sorry for bothering you guys like this just wanted to see if someone has had the same experience. Love you all!

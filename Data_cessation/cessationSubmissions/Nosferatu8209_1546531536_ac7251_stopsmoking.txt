Wife and I are determined this time!

My wife and I smoked our last cigarettes abt 2 days ago... We tried quitting so many times before... At some point we were smoke free for 6 months before we gave in... Now we are not making grand promises, we just want to set a good example for our children and live a more active, healthy life. Lets see ho we succeed this time.

We are both using the app which is great but I find this thread extremely useful. I often think that my mind is exaggerating the withdrawal symptoms (and they are a \*\*\*tch), but it is comforting to see that there are other ppl who feel/felt the same way! Thank you for being there

Sudden strong cravings.

Does this ever get any easier? I quit ages ago and all of a sudden I'm getting intense cravings, I just want to go buy some fags. Maybe it's because everyone around me has started again but all of a sudden something has snapped within me and I can't stop thinking about just having that one, but it's never that one is it. Arghh.

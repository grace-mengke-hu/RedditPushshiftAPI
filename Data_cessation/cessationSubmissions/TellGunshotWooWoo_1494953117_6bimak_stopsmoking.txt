Day 4 tobacco free, still lethargic and irritable as all get out

I had been using smokeless tobacco for 12 years, quitting now purely to get a job.  Prior to quitting I dipped 1.5-2 cans per day.  I weaned myself for a couple days then gave it up.  

My goal was to just quit until I take the nicotine test but since I've made it through what I hope is the worst part I will try and just keep clean.  

I don't know how the nicotine rate of smokeless compares but today is the first day where I don't feel insane.  I'm still very irritable and feel tired but such an improvement over yesterday.  

I've been using a nicotine/tobacco free replacement but I'm stopping that over the next day or so because it's harder on my mouth than the actual tobacco.  I've been chewing gum nearly constantly and I feel like it helps quite a bit but I think I may be sensitive to the faux sugar as it's about to give me diarrhea. 

Any how I cannot wait to feel "normal" again.  I do feel a little relief over finally working towards quitting as the social stigma associated with smokeless tobacco is much worse than smoking.  

I hope to wake up tomorrow morning feeling free and clear.  Good luck to anyone else going through this fun journey

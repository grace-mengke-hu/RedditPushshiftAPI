How long does the spitting/hacking last?

hey guys I used to smoke alot of tobacco with pot, I'd usually go through a pack once a week or once every two weeks, did this for almost three years.

decided to quit the cigs part and I've been doing ok but I've been hacking up junk (tar?). I read this is normal and a good sign but how long does it last usually?

thanks

Quitting today

A close friend of mine is dying of cancer. He's been struggling with it for over 5 years... But that never stopped me from picking up my first stick 2 years ago.

He's dying now. He's on morphine, oxygen, wearing adult diapers. He's rocking back and forth, drowsy from his medication, eyes rolled back into his head. He used to be lean and fit, chemo stripped most of his muscle mass and now he's struggling to catch every breath. His breathing is too laboured to even eat. His cancer has spread to his lungs, and it's causing him so much pain.

He's leaving this world soon. And I'm actually glad for him. He's in so much pain right now.

I'm quitting today. I told myself that I would quit when he passed, but seeing him today really shocked me. Not just because I've never seen him this bad, but because I don't want to be like that myself. He was unlucky enough to get cancer at such a young age. I'm lucky enough to be pretty much completely healthy apart from this disgusting habit I have.

I'm quitting. And this post is here to remind me... Of my feelings today.

God speed fellas.

First day of the rest of my life ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm new here but have been reading the posts with interest. I had my last cigarette at 00:30 and put my patch on before bed. I can't sleep but don't know if that's due to the patch or just finishing night shift. 
I'm so positive about quitting this time but went to the chemist and signed up for smoking cessation. I have the 24hr patches and Nicorette quick mist as breakthrough. I've downloaded an app to keep track of time stopped, money saved and health stats and am looking forward to seeing the numbers increase. 
My partner is a smoker and doesn't want to stop so that's going to be hard but I know I can do it. I will probably check in here a few times a day for some positive reinforcement tho.
Just wanted to say hello and wish all you quitters the best of luck. We can totally do this!

So I’ve been vaping for 6 years

Wow I can’t believe it’s 6 years, I counted it while on the toilet atm. I gotta stop this, it used to be regular
Vaping, then turned to the big boy mods with the clouds, then it went to the JUULS and refillable pod systems and now I’m using disposable pods in which god knows what’s in them. After going on a alcohol and nicotine bender this past weekend for the reason that my best friend is going to med school (go figure) I think it’s time to grow up and get off the nicotine. It’s been 2 days since my last vape puff and 9 hours since my last cigarette. I don’t smoke cigarettes much, i carry one emergency pack which lasts me about a month. Today I smoked only one cig and threw the pack away along with all my vapes. It’s time to hit the gym bc I’m about 12lbs over weight and give my heart and lungs a break and start living and loving life.

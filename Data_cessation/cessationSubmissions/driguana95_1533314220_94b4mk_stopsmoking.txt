2 days in and can't hold any food down

Hey, I've been going cold turkey for about 2~3 days now but I'm struggling to not vomit anything that I consume. I've tried ginger tea, water, plain rice... it's just come back up 30 minutes later. This has been happening for about 1~2 days now and all I've managed was one cup of tea. 
Anyone have any suggestions to fight the vomiting?
Thanks

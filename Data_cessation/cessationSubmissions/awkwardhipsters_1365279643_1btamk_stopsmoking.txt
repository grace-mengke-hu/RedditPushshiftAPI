Day one's over, but this isn't...

So I'm about to go on a run, right? 

My running routine tends to be, cup of tea before, break, run, come back, and then I'd catch myself buying cigarettes, and have that with a cup of tea...


So, I've had my cup of tea, this is my break after I get into my gear,  and after my run I am NOT going to buy cigarettes because why would I want cigarettes? I'm not a smoker ;)

Almost 2 weeks now and no cravings

I've quit smoking soon after I've began psychodynamic therapy. After first four or so sessions I've had so low self-esteem and felt guilty all the time that I just couldn't bear it. Quitting smoking was just one of the things I could have done to not feeling shitty all the time. And was really simple. After all not smoking is easier than smoking...I don't have to buy cigarettes and panic when they're not at hand. And cravings are just one of the things you have to manage.

Not smoking gives me psychotic symptoms.

Hello. Whenever I don't smoke for a while, I go insane. Like literally insane. Nicotine withdrawal has made me cry for hours without any reason, it has made me aimlessly wander about through the city for hours, it makes me think the most random and absurd things. My thought process disintegrates entirely. I even get suicidal ideation. My intelligence also decreases severely. One cigarette makes these symptoms disappear entirely. Why does this happen and how can I prevent it? I'd really like to stop smoking but it seems impossible if cessation makes me feel like a schizophrenic. I'm male, 22 years old, and have been smoking since I was 13. About a pack a day.

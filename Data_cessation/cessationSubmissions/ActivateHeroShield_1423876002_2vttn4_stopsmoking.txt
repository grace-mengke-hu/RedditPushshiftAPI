Started about 6 months ago, any permanent damage? Tips to help?

I started smoking about 6 months ago, I'm 20. I've gone quite heavily since then. Smoking up to a pack a day on some days. 

I can't even get up to get a glass of water without my heart rate skyrocketing to 90. 

I exercise about once a week, mountain biking, and I seem to do fine, so I imagine It'll get better once I stop.

My question is, have I done any permanent damage to myself? Will my lungs make a full recovery? My heart? 

I'm tired of sweating while sitting down, and waking up with terrible breath every morning. Gonna try.

Any tips?

I got upset over the stupidest thing last night.  What minor inconvenience/annoyance have you guys over-reacted to only to laugh about later?

So, last night I'm playing FIFA (soccer video game) with my roommate.  He goes up 1-0 in like the 80th minute, and then proceeds to slow down the pace of the game for the remaining 10 minutes.  He just sort of held the ball in his half.  Not really attacking, just sort of playing keep-away.  It's a dick move, yah, but I just got so mad at him.  I cursed, yelled, and threw what can only be described as a hissy-fit.  After I calmed down, I felt like such an ass.  What stupid stuff has set you off while you're trying to quit?

Edit:  I accidentally a period.

Day 8.5 no smoking (22 days on Chantix)

Went from 1.5-2 packs a day for 10 years to zero in a day. Quit day was supposed to be day 14 of chsntix, I stepped outside that morning and lit up then almost puked because it tasted so terrible. Threw the pack away and haven’t looked back. I️ realized I️ missed my week post because I️ forgot to count days. I’ve heard all the horror stories from people about Chsntix, but for me it’s been a fantastic tool. I’ve always had trouble sleeping. Chantix and quitting smoking have made that a bit worse. I️ can usually get by with a Benadryl but I️ have some doc prescribed trazadone for the really restless nights. So far that’s the only side effect. Mixing trazadone and Chantix has made for some incredibly detailed long vivid dreams. No nightmares, just very detailed. No complaints there.

I️ do still get a small itch to smoke when I️ do things I️ used to smoke during. I️ miss my smoke breaks at work. I️ haven’t and probably won’t try drinking again until I’m off Chantix fully as I’ve read that’s where some of the fun side effects come into play. Keep at it guys, it’s beatable.

Okay... Here I go again. Any tips?

So I've decided to start quitting again. After having that dreadful gag reflex whenever I cough. That's the worst, in my opinion, and is only more reason for me to stop now. 
But of course, this is my 10000^th time "quitting". I put that in quotes because whenever the longest duration I've ever lasted without a cigarette would be about 3 weeks. That's not very long, honestly, and even if I get past the first 3 days, I still have massive cravings whenever I see a cigarette. It's not that I smoke a *ton* (about 5-7 a day), but it certainly has a hold on me.

I was hoping you guys could give me some tips and tricks to just kick the habit. I want to start working out, as smoking has seriously fucked my metabolism to make it that I don't gain weight. Is that possible? Maybe. But anyways! Tips? Advice? Suggestions? 

Thanks so much. Long time lurker, but first time poster. I guess that's my first step.

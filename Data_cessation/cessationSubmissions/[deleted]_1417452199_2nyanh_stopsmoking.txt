Found a way to make driving a little more bearable.

I'm not sure about anyone else, but driving is one of the most difficult times for me since I quit smoking.  The first couple of days after quitting, I was dizzy while driving because I didn't have a cigarette in my hand, so my goal was to get from Point A to Point B safely.  A few days in, I decided I needed to find something else to do (safely) while driving.  While you're smoking in the car, you can't sing because you're puffing away.  So I decided I would sing as much as I could while in the car to keep occupied.  This lead to a "Sing!" playlist on Spotify that contains songs I know all the words to and are really fun to sing and get into.  This has helped me so much over the past few days, so I thought I'd share with anyone else struggling with driving smoke-free.  Good luck to everyone!!!

2 months down.

Really has been a lot easier than I anticipated.  I was afraid that the intense cravings would never go away but I can't really remember the last time I had one.  I used nicotine gum for a little while but I only used about 20 pieces (if that).  I still have 58 untouched in the box, I gave 20 to my dad to try, and I probably have about 5 or so in my backpack.

I think the biggest thing that has helped me is removing myself from the triggers.  I haven't been to any bars in a while, I haven't drank much, I cleaned the hell out of my car to make it smell nice, etc.

I already feel better.  No coughing, not out of breath, I don't smell bad, no bad tastes in my mouth, the smell of smoke isn't pleasant to me, etc.

edit: I smoked for a little over 6 years and ended up at about a pack a day, sometimes more.

Can you guys refer me to quit smoking material/infographics/sites?

I am desperate to help this smoker friend of mine quit smoking and as a last dash, I want to sit with her and show her how harmful smoking is and how much better off she will be if she quits.

I'd really appreciate it if you guys would provide me with any infographics, links etc that I can show and discuss with her. Things like long term effects of smoking etc. Much appreciated.

I'm sick!

So I've come down with a cold or maybe the Flu these past couple days,and I was just thinking: "how great it is to no be a smoker when sick." We've all been there, just tired and feeling like shit lying in bed, when the "oh time for a cigarette" though pops up. So we lie there for a little while delaying the inevitable, before dragging ourselves out to go have the worst smoke possible. And it's just awful, it's gross and it drys us out even more. Standing outside in the cold for 5-10 minutes, just dreaming of our soft warm beds.

This may not be the best motivation. Just something I thought I'd share, for people having a tough time. This is just a little something else to look forward to.

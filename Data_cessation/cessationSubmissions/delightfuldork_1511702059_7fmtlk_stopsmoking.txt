How do I get through the night shifts

Hi Reddit! So in the new year I'm planning on moving in with my boyfriend and I want a fresh start where I'm not smoking. Obviously with 6 weeks to go before the move, I wanna get some of the worst of getting out of the habit out of the way. I'm not nearly as bad as I was at uni tbf, it takes about a week for me to get through a pack, but most of my cravings come on my night shifts at work - most of the night is quiet and customer free so I tend to kill the time by smoking outside. 

Any advice to try and break this pattern? I know it's the one major crutch I still have, and it's not just that to not bring them with me bc we sell cigarettes and I've definitely done it before where I've forgotten my cigs and caved in and bought a pack at work. 

I'm just sick of it haha, time for a fresh start, especially when I need to save money. Even at only one or two packs a week, the savings in the next 6 weeks can be anywhere from £50-£70 I know which will definitely help in the gap between moving and getting a job at my new location.

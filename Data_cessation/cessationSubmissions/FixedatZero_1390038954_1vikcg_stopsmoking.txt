Three days free and I'm pretty proud of myself!

I found a cigarette I had in a pocket of a jumper. I lit it up, took two drags and just thought to myself... what the fuck am I doing?

Why did I light this up? Why am I doing this to myself? This tastes horrible. I don't want to do this anymore.

It took so much willpower, but I put it out. I stomped on that motherfucker until it was just a big squished mess. Afterwards I had no idea how it was so hard for me to do that. It felt so liberating. I almost wished I had another cigarette so I could stomp on that one too!

I know it's not much. Three days isn't a lot right? But after 6 years of smoking a pack a day, and then going to none and being able to resist a cigarette... it's groundbreaking for me.

Here's to getting back my sense of smell/taste and living longer!

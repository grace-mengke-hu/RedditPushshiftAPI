Champix Withdrawal?

This is my third time trying to quit - I have now been 39 days smoke free.

I always knew that in my case the first day, week, a month - are the easiest and the real cravings and threat of relapse come later: when not smoking becomes normal. 

This time though I started experiencing really strong cravings and quasi-nicotine withdrawal symptoms after pulling away from Champix (after 8 weeks of taking pills regularly). I tried to quit with Champix twice already, however never have I experienced physical withdrawal when I put the pills away. This time though I was taking Champix for longer (by about 4-5 weeks)  - may this be the reason why it feels harder? 

I wondered if anyone has had similar experiences?

I think I did it!

So, I have been smoking since 17/18. Anyway, I'm about a pack-a-day smoker. But 4 days ago, I smoked my last cig.  I've never voluntarily made it this long. I know I still have a long way to go and the cravings are there and strong, but I think this might be it.  Anyway, just wanted to come here and get my badge and maybe a few "good job!"s and people who can relate to me right now.   


Congrats to those of you who have started this journey with me.  


If you are here looking to quit, you got this! Trust me! It's difficult but it's possible. Mind over matter.... steadfast in your goals.

Feel like tobacco has more addictive ingredients then regular cigarettes.

Hi! I'm tired of being chained to addiction. Tried on several ways to quit, but it doesn't work.

The main thing is I smoke tobacco, roll about 30 of them a day. When I try to quit, in whatever way it may be, I get very very very tensed. E-Cig, nicotine tablets, even when switching to make cigarettes myself.

So I think there's an additional ingredient in tobacco.

What are your opinions?

Really strong cravings only around nighttime

Im a 10 year- heavy smoker and have been on and off for the past few months, but the nicotine patches have really helped me tone it down and I currently only smoke one cigarette a day, if not none. However, I work in a restaurant, so I usually dont finish work until around 23:00 and after work my colleagues and me finally find some time to actually properly socialize with each other. I used to smoke a lot after work, so even when it's my day off I get crazy strong cravings by that time, which is too early to go to bed for me and too late to meet up with my friends to just ignore it and do some random shit together. Do you guys have any ideas of what I could do to keep myself occupied at night until my junkie brain shuts up or I go to bed? Video games dont work, I used to take a ragesmoke everytime I died some point important or forgot to save.

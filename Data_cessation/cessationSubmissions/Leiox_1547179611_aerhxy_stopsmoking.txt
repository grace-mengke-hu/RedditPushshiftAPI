10 days without a cigarette after 15 years of 1Â½-2 packs per day.

Started smoking at 13. Had my last cig at 1pm 1st of Jan.  

I wasnt planning on quitting, but i had smoked so much on new years that i didnt feel like one when i woke up later at night on the 1st. Following day i wasnt really feeling it either, and was still war torn from heavy drinking. 3rd of jan i thought to myself: "well 2 days without a cig, lets see how long i can go".  
  
Still havent touched a cig, and im feeling very proud of myself!  
The best is my sense of smell and taste has come back so quick. On the downside im eating all the things cause that helps with the cravings. Dont get too much coffee either cause, thats 100% associated with a smoke.  
  
I sleep like shit, in 1-2 hour intervals, so only get like 3-4 hours of sleep per night, but ive heard that can happen to some, and will pass after the 14th day mark (ish).  
  
Just wanted to share, because i dont really have anyone else to share with. Also i was hoping if any of you had some tips on what to stuff my face with, so i dont gain a 100 pounds within the next couple of weeks :P

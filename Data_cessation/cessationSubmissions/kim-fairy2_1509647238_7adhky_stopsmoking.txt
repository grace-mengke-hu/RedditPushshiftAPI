I quit today!!

Been vaping for some time, while cutting down on real cigs. One day it hit me: why wait? I've only been torturing myself, living towards those few real smokes a day.

So.. I ordered the Allen Carr book, bought herbs to smoke my hasj with (nicotine free), and I quit. I haven't finished the book yet because I wanted to quit now. No more excuses. Trust me, I've had loads of excuses and they're all bullshit.

Can't say it's easy but it's not particularly hard, either. Just.. Like something's missing, something which I'm glad to get rid of. I just took it easy today, had a long walk with my friend.

Thanks for all the tips and support, guys.

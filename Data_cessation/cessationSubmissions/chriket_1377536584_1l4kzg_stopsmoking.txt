I haven't been coughing..is that normal?

I haven't smoked in 13 days. I smoked for..what I'm now realizing was about 17 years. A couple of breaks here and there, the last quit was a little over a year ago for a couple of months.
For the past year, I've smoked American Spirit - less additives, but still bad. Could this be why I haven't been coughing?

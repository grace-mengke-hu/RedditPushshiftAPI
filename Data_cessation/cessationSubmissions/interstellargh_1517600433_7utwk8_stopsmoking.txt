Day 4: Gave in yesterday due to unbearable anxiety but still in the quitting mindset.

Wow. I did not anticipate the wave of anxiety that flooded me yesterday. I normally have a mild, constant level of anxiety. I went 2 whole days without any cigarettes, and I felt SO chill. Chillest of the chill. I was like "anxiety? never." Day one I didn't really do anything, maybe one piece of nicotine gum when I'd have my after work cig. That's it. Day two I went for a run then ended up smoking some weed in the evening, and I was proud that I didn't need a cigarette.

Day 3 it was like the anxiety all came at once, rushing into me, and knocked the wind out of me. Right when I woke up, it was so bad. I started using a vape (hadn't really needed it previous days, barely touched it) early in the morning. I had a headache all day. Low level tears all day long. I thought about nothing but cigarettes and I went home and smoked 2 in a row. 

I'm not sure if it was the weed, or using nicotine that early in the morning, or the withdrawal or what. Yesterday was BAD.

I'm feeling better today. I do feel a little less committed to quitting, but I'm going to keep on going. I'm not a smoker anymore. I don't smoke anymore.

Week 3 being smoke free!

I haven't had a smoke in just over 3 weeks! I quit because I found out I was pregnant. I was super stressed when I found that out, but knew I had to quit for my baby's health. 

In this 3 weeks, I've done things I couldn't previously do. I can walk up 4 flights of stairs and not be winded! I also feel great. My throat and lungs don't hurt. 

Even with all of these positive effects of quitting, I still want a cigarette. I'm not going to have one, but the cravings are still there. 

It's hard, but I know I can do it!

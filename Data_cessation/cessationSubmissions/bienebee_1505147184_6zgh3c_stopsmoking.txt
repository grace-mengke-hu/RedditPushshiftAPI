Cigarettes don't reduce your stress levels

One of my aunts died this morning, the day has been idiotic, I have been in denial first, angry, sad, all the normal feelings. A few people offered me cigarettes telling me that today is ok, since it's an exception. I am proud to say i didn't even consider accepting them. My grief and my emotions are a tribute for someone I loved and lost. They are not wrong and they should be felt. Suppresing them with addiction of any kind would be wrong. She was a heavy smoker, workaholic, someone always in a rush and someone with no time for listening to herself and her own needs. I try to learn from her mistakes.

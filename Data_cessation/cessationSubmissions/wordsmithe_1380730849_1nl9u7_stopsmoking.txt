Some thoughts on vaporizers, /r/stopsmoking, and undoubtedly my favorite redditors

I was reading over the vape post and for the first time and wanted to have an honest, genuine, and civil conversation for and against the use of vaporizers and quitting smoking.


I personally believe the act of smoking is a stronger addiction than the nicotine. I never feel chemically deprived, rather I feel I'm missing something in my everyday routine. My problem with vapes are that they continue to promote the mental addiction we have to smoking, not the nicotine. So whether or not the vaporizer has or doesn't have nicotine in it is not my issue against it.


This subreddit, like any other forum, has users who are adamant and vocal about their opinions and stances.  That said, I have never met a group of anonymous people who have offered so much support during a trying period in my life.


To those of you who support vaporizers, do you feel like you are addicted more to the act rather than the nicotine?


Most importantly, to the users who have ultimately quit after using vaporizers, what was your experience like? How long have you stayed quit? Do you still use your vaporizer? What are some of the effects it has on your body, both the liquids with and without nicotine.


This sub has been the most helpful resource on my way to being a non smoker. I would hate to see it fill up with vape/no vape battles. Let's avoid a congressional shut down and see if we can get to a common ground.

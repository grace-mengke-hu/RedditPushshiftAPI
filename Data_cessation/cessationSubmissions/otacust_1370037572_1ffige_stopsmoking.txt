Moving tomorrow. Time to quit.

For the last three years, I've lived with a bunch of heavy smokers. Slowly but surely, and with a few stops but more starts (at the time of writing, one more, to be precise), I picked up the habit. Every time I've stopped, I've started again after a moment of weakness involving one of my flatmates offering me a smoke. But tomorrow, that changes--I'm moving to a new place and living alone. Of course, I can't push responsibility for my smoking onto my old flatmates--simply being away from the most immediate sources of temptation won't make the desire to smoke go away. But it will help a lot. And I've heard a change of location can be a great catalyst for quitting. So I'm going to quit. I think this is the first time I've actually believed myself concerning plans to quit.

Any advice from those who have succeeded, are in the process of quitting, or have similarly chosen to quit after a big move? I don't expect this to be easy, but I'm going to stay the course, and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!

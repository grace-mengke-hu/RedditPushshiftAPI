Tips?

Hello there - I am a 20 year old student, I have been smoking for roughly 4-5 years now. I always get thoughts about quitting (mostly when i have time to think in bed at night) but when I wake up in the morning I'm straight back at it. Recently i've been thinking about moving to an e-cig to try and help me cut down (I'm smoking roughly 15-20 roll-ups a day) and was wondering if they're much help to anyone? The problem that I have with nicotine gum and inhalators etc is that the taste is truly awful and 80% of the time make me want a cigarette more. Being a student I am often around large groups of smokers as well as drinking semi-frequently, which just amps up my desire for a smoke. My plan is to slow down on the drinking and battle my brain to extend my time between cigarettes. My largest cravings are first thing in the morning and after I've eaten -anything- (even a biscuit). Would anyone have any tips on how i could cut this down in my case?

Quit last Tuesday! 3 days in now, 10 year addiction is now over!

On Tuesday I decided to buy a pack of minty nicorette gum instead of a pouch of tobacco! And have been cigarette free for 3 days now :) I was smoking 30-40 rollups a day for the past 10 years!

I'm surprised how easy it was, very little withdrawal symptoms, I don't really have any urges to smoke, just a funny feeling when I finish a meal or something when I would usually have a smoke and now I just chill and have a gum haha

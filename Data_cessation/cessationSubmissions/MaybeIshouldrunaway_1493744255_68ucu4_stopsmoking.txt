It's time to quit this too

I checked out r/stopdipping subreddit and it seems pretty dead, so I hope this is okay since I am a non-smoker, but everyday dipper. I'm currently at the 18 hour mark without any type of nicotine.

Long story short, I somehow found it easier to get off of opiates (nearly 3 months clean!!) than to quit dipping. Just thought I'd check in with you guys. I guess I'm just looking for some words of encouragement/recommendations. I plan on going cold turkey, just like I did from opiates. Thanks! :)

A little more info: Started dipping around the time I started messing with Oxys, which was about 5 years ago now. The last two years of which have been about a can a day habit. I really need to quit... I hate that my mouth hurts and I'm just tired of such a disgusting habit.

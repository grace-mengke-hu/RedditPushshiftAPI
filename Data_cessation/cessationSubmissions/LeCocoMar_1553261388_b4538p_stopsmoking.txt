What do you do with the money?

Turned 30 and have finally decided to stop for good (fingers crossed) my partner has decided to do this with me. We calculated how much we are spending roughly a year and it comes out to Â£1350. Iâ€™ve smoked for half my life so Iâ€™ve spent over Â£10k ðŸ˜±
What do you guys do with the extra cash?

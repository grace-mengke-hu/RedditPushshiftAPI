Many one year posts start...

Something I wrote earlier today

> Have you noticed that many of the one year posts start with "I almost missed this..." *p.s. Mine won't.*

Really, have you noticed?

If you hang out here like I do, you see a lot of 367 and 371 day 'one year' posts.  

Because, honestly, by the time a year has passed, you are not thinking about this.  You are like a bad boyfriend **who forgets the anniversery**!!

Here, that's good.  That is what you want to happen.  Smoking is something you used to do, but not anything important right now.

So my fellow quit-warriors, will you meet me in Valhalla?

*We shall dine around the fire with the heros, because among our fallen enemies is smoking*.

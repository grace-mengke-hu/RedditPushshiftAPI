The conflict on quitting

I'm 20 years old and have been smoking for 4 years. I don't really have health problems from it, ie no shortness of breath or coughing fits. My father found out that I smoke and is threatening to withdraw his financial support while I'm at university. I don't have a job. I'm looking for one next academic year (Long story short, I've been ill since I was about 14 and would get sick every few weeks. Nobody would keep me on as I'd have to phone in sick so often). I see that he's angry that I'm using his money to fund my habit, and I haven't had a cigarette in 5 days. 

Today I've been really conflicted. I want to quit, but why? The money issue is the main thing, as well as making my dad upset. But if I got a job would it mean that I'd be fine to buy them because it isn't his money going on them? I LIKE smoking. 

I like the feeling, I like that I can take 10 minutes out of my life, go outside on my own and think about stuff, or alternatively have a talk with friends. I like that having a cig is "Sin's quiet time" where I can go downstairs with a book or something and then come back up and continue doing whatever I was doing with whoever I was doing it with.

I'm really conflicted and I'm not sure what to do. I'm very close to breaking and going out to buy a pack, but I really don't want to disappoint my dad and I need the money...

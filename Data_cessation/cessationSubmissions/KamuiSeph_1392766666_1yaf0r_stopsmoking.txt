Relapse after ~400 days. Thinking positive!

I will be resetting my badge soon. I was smoke free for 410 days. Then around that time I had a lot of stress, a major life change and I thought that I want to smoke again. So I did.  
It tasted like ass. Absolute ass. I thought I would like it once more, but no, it was just ass.  
So I kept on smoking for about a week, thinking it will taste better once you get used to it! Like a freaking moron. Nope, still tasted like ass.  
12 Days ago I quit again. This time for good (hopefully :D)  
I went through more stress, but didn't want to smoke again.  
So I'm feeling good and I'm keeping in mind that I went 400+ days without smoking a single cigarette after 4+ years of 1-2 packs per day.  
I don't feel defeated, I feel proud as fuck for this achievement  
And I know that it will only get better from here on out!

First cold as a non smoker

Normally when I got a cold and was smoking, itd last for a month, minimum because the cough would never go away. I'd get that mucus smokers cough where every time you try to lie down you hack your lungs out, so sleeping was impossible. 

Last week I started to feel a scratchy throat and runny nose coming on and then yesterday I realized I felt better?? in like 3 or 4 days. Insane. I quit on new years and this is probably the best motivation to keep going!! never again will i keep my roommates/household up all night with my coughing for a month straight.

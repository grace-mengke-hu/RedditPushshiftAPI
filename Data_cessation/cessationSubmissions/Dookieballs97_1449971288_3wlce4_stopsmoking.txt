Day 3 has been hard

I have been somewhat weaning off cigarettes for a while, using a vape pen off and on, and I smoked my last cigarette the evening of 12/9.  The first two days weren't hard.  I have been sick with a cold, sore throat, and coughing my head off-- and that made it easier.  

Today was the first day it was a little more difficult, particularly this afternoon.  My kids were rowdier than usual and I feel sensitive to everything.  I yelled at them today and almost gave in and bought a pack of smokes with the logic that my kids don't deserve the version of me they got today, but I had just found this sub and some of the posts helped me.  I've quit before quite a few times, one time for about 4 years.  I'll be 37 years old in a week and never thought I'd still be struggling with this at my age.  It was supposed to get dropped with all the other stupid things I did in my younger days.  I have a lot of fear about what damage I might have already done to my body with cigarettes.  Anyway I'm hanging in there for one more day.  Gonna use the vape pen for now, but I'm not using it much, so I'm definitely getting less nicotine than I was.

2 Months and 11 Days!!! I'm so happy

I quit 2m &amp; 11 days.  I've done great this time and feel like it's easier now.  I slipped once but quickly got back on track and haven't taken another puff! I love the fact that I'm not tied to my smokes, I am healthier, smell better, feel better and can really enjoy people and activities that don't include smoking. I don't ever want to go back to that old life!

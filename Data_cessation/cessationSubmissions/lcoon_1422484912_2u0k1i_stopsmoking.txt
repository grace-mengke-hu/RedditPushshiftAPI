One Month Smoke-Free

Just found out about this sub-reddit. My goal this year was to be an ex-smoker. I have to say I've learned from my many previous failed attempts that I needed the following to become successful. 

A) Quit Drinking, It's my one vice that will always lead back to smoking.
B) I tell myself I'm an ex-smoker, not that I'm quitting smoking. (It doesn't sound like much but this alone has been a big help for me. Especially when you have that inner monologue with yourself when you're craving a smoke.)
C) Went to the dentist and cleaned my teeth for the first time in a few years. (another great incentive)
D) This year I'm doing one resolution at a time (In the past, I always did a combo of resolutions and if one failed then I would stop doing the others as well.)

I'm will never be done with this goal. But I have reached that point in my progress that I feeling better. My cravings are down to not even thinking about smoking in a normal day. I still get odd cravings and I will always get them.. but they are much more manageable. (I'm not going through hell week again)

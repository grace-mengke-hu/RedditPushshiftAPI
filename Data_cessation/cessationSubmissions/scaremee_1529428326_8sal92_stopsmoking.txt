Chantix? How does it work? What is the process?

My doctor recently prescribed chantix but it was an afterthought at the end of my appointment that I even thought to ask. It’s pretty expensive in my country so I need to save a bit before I fill that prescription so in the meantime, i wante to get some “personal experiences” from people who have used it successfully or not. What was it like? Do you smoke while you take it? What’s the difference between the “starter pack” and the maintenance pack. Any info would be great! I’m also doing a lot of research myself obviously but I just wanted to check on here too :)

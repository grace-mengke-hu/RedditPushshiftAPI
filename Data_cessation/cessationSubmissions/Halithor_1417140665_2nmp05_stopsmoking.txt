Can't seem to find the comment now but they helped in times of want!

I posted here something like 10 weeks ago saying I was going to try quit and something like i'd hopefully had my last cigerette. Honestly the first day went shit and I ended up having one before checking back and I can't seem to find the comment in the thread but I remember someone saying that speaking with words like 'hopefully' I would never succeed as I needed to fully believe in myself. I haven't had one since then and this week ran my first 10 mile :) Only 3 to go before a half marathon which was the ultimate aim I set myself when I quit!

I really couldn't be happier with how healthy I feel now even if my feet are killing, better them than my lungs! Best of luck to anyone else trying to quit and I promise the benefits will outweigh the shit times before reaching that point.

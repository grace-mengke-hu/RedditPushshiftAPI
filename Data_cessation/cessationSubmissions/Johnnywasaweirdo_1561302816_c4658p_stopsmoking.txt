I quenchable thirst since I quit.

Hey guys I’m three months in and still going strong. Now after quitting I expected an increased appetite and to gain weight. I’ve been doing short burst body weight exercises daily to help control the weight gain and to hopefully gain a little muscle mass instead of fat. It’s also a good way to push past a craving.    Now onto my point, since I’ve quit I have been extremely thirsty all the time and I mean that quite literally. I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and put down a 20oz bottle of water in seconds. Milk, juice, water, and Gatorade all day. I’m urinating several times a day, and it has me a little worried. Has anyone else experienced this? I was worried about diabetes so I started to keep track of my sugar and my numbers are always within a normal range.

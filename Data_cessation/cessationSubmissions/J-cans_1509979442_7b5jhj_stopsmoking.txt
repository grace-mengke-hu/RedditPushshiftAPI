Someone noticed

So, I was working on Thursday night and I was working with someone who I hadn't seen on a job in about two years. 
We work some long hours and there are a LOT of smokers in my field. Sometimes it's just boredom, others say it's "stress" but whatever to each their own, right? 

After about hour 4 or so the guy I haven't seen comes up to me and asks "hey cans, did you quit smoking?" It fill me with joy something serious to be able to say "yep I did right around the time of (certain job that I can't name because of NDAs)". 
The look in his face was priceless and mine probably was too. 

Truth be told he probably want to bum one off me and was waiting till I lit up to ask, but whatever having someone notice out of the blue was great!

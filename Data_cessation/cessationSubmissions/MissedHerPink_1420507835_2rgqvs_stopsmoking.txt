My small, small journey

I caught the flu last week, which led me to quitting. Before that I was getting sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, so I decided to reduce my cigarette intake. I'd been at about 4-7 cigarettes a day for the past year, so I started to gradually drop my daily use until I was down to like 2 a day (this whole process took place in about a week).

So yea, then I got the flu and I'm like, "okay perfect. I can't get out of bed, I feel like shit anyways, my throat kills and I'm constantly coughing. No way I'm gonna smoke" That lasted 4 days.

I felt amazing. I could smell everything so much better. I felt happier, more energetic, and in a much better state of mind. I really didn't have cravings either. I thought I was done.

Then today, after almost fully recovered from the flu, I broke down and had a cigarette. I'd been reading these posts all day, and honestly, talking and reading about smoking (even quitting) made me crave one even harder. My head started feeling tight and I gave in. 

I headed to the balcony. The first toke felt so fucking good. Best cigarette I've had in years. Though I felt physically better, I didn't wanna get back in so I went to my room and broke my last cigarette and threw it out. 

That's where I am right now. I want all the benefits that come with quitting. I'm just scared that the tight feeling in my head and all other cravings won't ever stop. And talking/reading about quitting only make me want them more. My cousin lent me The Easy Way by Allen Carr a while ago, but I only read a few pages. 

Right now I'm just kinda laying everything out on the table for you guys. I don't know what to do. How long until that tight-headedness  goes away completely? It comes and goes but when it comes I can't get anything done. I can't think about anything other than smoking.

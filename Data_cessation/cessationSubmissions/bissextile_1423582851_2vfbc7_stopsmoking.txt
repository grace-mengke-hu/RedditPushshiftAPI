It was just a bad dream.

I have been smoke free for 2 weeks now but last night I thought I ruined everything. I was hanging out with some old friends and I picked up a smoke from the ash tray and inhaled. As soon as I realized what happened I stubbed it out, but then my mind tried to figure out where the cig had even come from... then I woke up. It was so real I swear it was like I was there. Thankfully it was just a dream but this is the second one I have had that was so vivid.

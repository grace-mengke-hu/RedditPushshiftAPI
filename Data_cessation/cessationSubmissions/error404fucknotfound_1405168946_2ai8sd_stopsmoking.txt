Need help with my dad's smoking habbit

Hi guys, so i just found this subreddit today thanks to the frontpage. Basically, my dad has been smoking for over 30 years (he started when he was 20 ish, he's now 56) and he's been advised by multiple doctors to stop smoking. I, personally, have tried to get him to stop but have been unsuccessful. He usually smokes a pack in two days, and it's really bad. I would really appreciate any help to get him to stop this habit of his. Thanks guys!

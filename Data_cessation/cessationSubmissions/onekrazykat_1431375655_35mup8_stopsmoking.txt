Tips/Suggestions? (Smoking Force(ish) Quit)

So I have been trying to quit for a few months now (with limited success due to extreme stress). And about three weeks ago started cutting back (I'm down from 2 packs of cigarettes to 22-23 a day.) But... I just found out that I am going to have surgery next week and that they want me to quit smoking 72 hours before the surgery. So now my plan of cutting back to quit is being thrown out the window and I'm faced with cold turkey. So does anyone have any tips/tricks/suggestions?

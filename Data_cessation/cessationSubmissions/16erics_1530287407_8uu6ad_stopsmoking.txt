Am I Cheating?

I haven't smoked a cigarette in nearly three montha, many thanks to this sub. I have, however, been using an e-cig for the past two months or so. Have I been cheating? Has it just been a waste to do this? I feel guilty and want to quit the e-cig, but don't think I can do it. I work long hours in a busy kitchen, and would lose my mind. I feel like I'm right back at square one

easy-mode engaged (so worth it)

It just occurred to me that I was sitting in a smoke pit last Friday, and the little smeagol voice in my head was completely absent. I had that childlike sense of "grown-ups are stinky, smoking is stupid."

When asked if I smoke, I answered "I used to."

It really is true. You just stop wanting it eventually. HANG IN THERE!

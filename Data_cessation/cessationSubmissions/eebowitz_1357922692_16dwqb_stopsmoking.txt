Stopped 100s of times but always start again

About 4 years ago using the patches, I quit smoking for about 6 months. Since then I have started and stopped, usually using the patches, what I guess is hundreds of times. I will go months without smoking (The longest being 8 months.), and then some random night I will be out drinking and bum a cigarette from someone. This will slowly build to the point that I am smoking at work and hiding it from my family when I get home with no small amount of gilt about it. I will then quit again.

I really want to break this cycle. Has anyone had this same problem and overcome it? If so, how what was it that finally broke you the cycle?

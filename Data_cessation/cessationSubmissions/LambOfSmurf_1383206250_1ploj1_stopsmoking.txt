Wow 6 months, with a bump in the road

So wow, 6 months without chewing.  I know this is the stop(smoking) sub-reddit, but there is a lot of good posts here that I feel can be taken as both smoking help and chew help.  I can't believe it's been six months though... but I have a confession.  Probably about 1 or so months ago I had a few dips.  The nostalgia of summer coming to an end and fall coming into play made quitting really hard... until I realized seconds after I threw one in, why I quit in the first place.  Those few dips I had within a few days, really made me hate myself for breaking into the nicotine rush again, but it didn't feel right.  The few days I did it strengthened why I chose to quit even more, it just felt disgusting and sickening.  I feel like, if I am really looking for a little buzz I can just drink a beer or two, given the responsible circumstances, rather than fcking up my lips and teeth.  I will change my badge since I gave in for a few days, but I still feel like I have been 6 months without.  The few days I chewed made me remember why I stopped in the first place, and I thank my weak self for that, because it had made me stronger.

Edit: But Seriously for those of age... one beer can completely negate that lust for chew, as well as save your wallet. Well maybe not your wallet...

Acupuncture or hypnotherapy?

I know it sounds crazy and excessive and maybe like a waste of money but hear me out. I've tried cold turkey, ecigs, patches, and gum and nothing has worked so far. I even went to the local clinic to check out their smoking cessation program which was honestly a bit of a joke. The only thing I haven't done yet is finish Allen Carr's book. Anyways a family member has the names of a local acupuncturist and hypnotherapist and are willing to pay for me to go to one so I figured I'd take them up on it because I'm desperate!  

So I was wondering if you guys had tried either and how it went? I remember in high school my mom went to a group hypnotherapy thing and it worked for a while before she went back to smoking. She has since quit but has been chewing nicotine gum for a few years so I don't know how done she actually is. Thanks guys!

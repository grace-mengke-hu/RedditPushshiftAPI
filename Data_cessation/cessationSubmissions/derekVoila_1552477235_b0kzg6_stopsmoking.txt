30 days without nicotine, and 30 stars here shining

Finally reached 1 month, here is [my sky](https://imgur.com/a/J669T8G) with 30 beautiful stars on it, that proves what I'm doing! Now i don't feel that much the urge to smoke in my daily routine, but i still need to strongly avoid people smoking, because of the smell, and that cigarette.. seeing it makes everything harder. Taste, breath, and my body smell are improved so much, along with my hairs and skins, and probably my general health. Stay strong guys, and NEVER relapse.

The app I am using is New Life - Fight the addiction

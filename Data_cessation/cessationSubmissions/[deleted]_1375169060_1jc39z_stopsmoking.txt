I can't help but snack every time I want a smoke.

I quit three days ago, well, I've come down from a pack and a half a day to two smokes over these past three days, and I can't help but wander to the kitchen every time I need a smoke. I know eating a little extra is well worth being able to kick this for good, but I'd rather not gain a bunch of weight. Controlling my eating was one of the reasons I started smoking in the first place.

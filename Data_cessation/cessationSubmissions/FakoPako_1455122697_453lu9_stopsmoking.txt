New Year non smokers unite!

Day 40! Woot?! 

I hope most of you are still here and keep on keeping on! Day 40 is here!

I don't even think about smoking any longer. I only think about it when I visit here. The cravings are gone. I feel great! My lungs feel soooooo fresh! I can't wait to see what it feels like in years to come.

Hope all of you are doing great. Keep going kids! We got this shit! Soon it will be 2 months and a new fresh shiny star!

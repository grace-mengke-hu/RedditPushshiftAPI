Lot of cravings - day 21

These past 3 weeks have been manageable, I've managed to focus on the positive aspects of my quit and I've distracted myself enough until my cravings pass. This morning I've struggled for 2h when I met a smoker friend, then I've excused myself and left. Today I have all kinds of nostalgia thoughts, I know I'm physically ok, but I feel a kind of sadness, maybe towards being reckless and doing what I want without regards to consequences. I am afraid that I will cave in.

Had a meltdown and no smoking!!!

I was worried about what I would do if I had a mental breakdown because I would automatically run outside crying and light one up. Today, I felt very depressed and started crying because my 3yo daughter has been sick for almost two weeks now with constant coughing and little sleep. I worry for her to the point that I was just crying. But I had no desire to smoke. I didn’t even think about cigarettes at all. When it did finally occur to me that normally I would be smoking 3 cigarettes by now, it made me smile a little. I guess my mind was on other things and cigarettes has finally dropped its priority rank. I hope this keeps up because I know a craving can hit anytime even when it’s been years since the last cigarette. Just wanted to share how my first meltdown went since I stopped smoking.

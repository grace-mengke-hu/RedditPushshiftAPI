Keep stop start stop starting :(

I have been trying to quit for the last 3 weeks. I go a couple of days (with patches) then go and have one anyway. just one, unless I am drinking alcohol then I may have 3 in a night. Then another 2 or 3 days without. Although this is better than the 20 a day habit... I don't think I am ever going to do it.

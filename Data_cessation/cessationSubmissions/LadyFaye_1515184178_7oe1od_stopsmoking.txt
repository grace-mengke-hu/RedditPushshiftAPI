25 year smoker. Day 1

I quit for 2 years a few years back. I was stupid and started again. I remember how amazing and freeing it was when the cravings almost completely vanished after a few months. 

Day 1. I feel like shit. Surprise surprise...

My brain is processing nothing. I dont want ANYTHING to have this much control over me. I still let it. I got this, but damn, I can't believe I am doing this again.

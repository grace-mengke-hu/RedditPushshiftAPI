4.5 months in, still seeing skin improvement!

Hey everybody! This morning I was taking a close look at my skin and I noted some improvement below my eyes, where I had the most visible skin damage. 

I had figured by now my skin wouldn’t continue to improve but it seems to still be repairing. 

I also had some bad acne and oily skin in the months after quitting, that seems to be balancing itself out as well. 

So don’t get discouraged if you haven’t seen as much improvement early on as you wanted to in your skin, things could still be happening. 

Happy to be here with all you non-smokers!

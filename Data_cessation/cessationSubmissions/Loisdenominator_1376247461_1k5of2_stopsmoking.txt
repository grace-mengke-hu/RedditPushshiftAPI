Books other than THE book

So we all know about the Allen Carr book.

There's a couple of other books that helped me along the way in trying to understand the brain, how it works and how you can correct certain things:

* [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/1400069289)

* [Brain Rules](http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Principles-Surviving-Thriving/dp/0979777747)

Does anyone have other reading material to recommend along these lines? Perhaps something inspiring? Something that made you think?

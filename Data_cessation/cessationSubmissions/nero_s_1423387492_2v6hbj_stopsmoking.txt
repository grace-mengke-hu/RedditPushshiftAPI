38 days after 10y yrs of smoking

Hey quitters or those who are trying too. Like many of you I struggled to quit several times but this time everything was different I made the decision and stuck to it. I've always thought smoking is a relaxing or recreational activity for me but in fact I finally understand that it took the very best of me. Not being an addict anymore (at least so far) makes you see everything with a different perspective and enables you to use your precious brain for more substantial matters than just thinking about when or where you can smoke again.

I believe in all of you that you can quit too. Make the decision to never smoke again no matter what and trust yourself that you can do it (I am sure you've already dealt with much worse). Keep the fire inside you and not to light your next cigarette!!

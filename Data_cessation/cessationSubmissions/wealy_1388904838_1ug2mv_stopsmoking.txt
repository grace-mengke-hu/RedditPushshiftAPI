Woke up in the middle of the night with an intense craving

Hey - its 1:48 AM here - I went to bed around 11 and woke up like 10 minutes ago with the most intense craving I've had in a long time. 

I switched from analogues to e-cigs to nothing - I put the e-cigs down 65 days ago - I don't think I've had anything more then the occasional easy to deal with pang since I quit the e-cig. 

This craving I had a bit ago literally woke me out of my sleep and I just had to do something to change my focus - got some water, peed, and made this post. 

Anyway, thanks for reading or don't read it at all. I don't care, I did what I needed to do I'm going back to bed now.

As the clock strikes midnight, I hit 7 months without a cigarette.

And, honestly, it's just getting better and better. I have more energy, I have more breath when doing strenuous activities, and I just overall feel better. Believe me, after 5 years of smoking, you can do the same. The first few weeks absolutely suck ass, but do not give up/give in. You will certainly not regret it.

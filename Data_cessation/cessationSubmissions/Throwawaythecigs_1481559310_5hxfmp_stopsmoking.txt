It has been one week since my last cig

I sometimes have the nostalgy of it, like it was a part of me. i know that it's a subtle trick of my mind to tempt me, so i resisted every cravings i had since the last 7 days. honestly, 4-5th were the worst, now i'm better. still have cravings though, hope i won't fail.

Three weeks smoke free. Woot woot!

I'm 29, smoked for 17 years (gross, huh?!), and have wanted to quit for ages. I tried for years. Then I just stopped three weeks ago and for some reason it was super easy this time.  

In honor of my three weeks without cigarettes, I ran a mile in under 10 minutes for the first time in my life. I almost puked, but it was totally worth it. :-)

Good luck, everyone! Keep up the good work!

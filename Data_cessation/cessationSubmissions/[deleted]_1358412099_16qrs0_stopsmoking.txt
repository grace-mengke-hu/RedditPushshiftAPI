Two weeks!

Officially two weeks smoke-free and I couldn't feel better. I've had hip problems for the past two years and the intensity of the pain is going down, I don't smell, my car doesn't smell, I don't have to use as much air freshener or candles, and, again, I just feel WONDERFUL!

Keep it up everyone, it's worth it! 
and to everyone who is thinking about trying to quit.. "do or do not, there is no try"

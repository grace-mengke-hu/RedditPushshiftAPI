3 months clean

Hey everyone, 

I used to smoke about 10 cigarettes a day. I know that some people smoke way more than that but I am pretty proud that I haven't smoked in 3 months and would never go back. 

What really helped me was when I sat down and made 2.5 lists. 

The first one was just all the reasons why I shouldn't be smoking. These includeded things like cancer, impotence, bad breath, yellow teeth, etc. 

The second list included why I wanted to smoke or why I enjoyed it. Makes me relaxed, it's social etc. 

I then took the second list and for every reason I smoke I wrote a counter point.

For example, I wrote down smoking helps me pass time then countered it with that time passes by anyways and I can do other things to pass time without smoking. 

It was pretty hard at first, but once I got through the first week it was like running downhill. 

I hope this tactic helps someone.

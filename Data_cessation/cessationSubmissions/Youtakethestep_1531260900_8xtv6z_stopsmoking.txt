Question about teeth

Can you regain some thickness in your teeth when quitting or at least perceived to be thicker? I had been smoking for 5 years I'm 24 now so they aren't too bad. Ive started coconut oil pulling which is brilliant overall for oral health. They are looking slightly thin looking at the side. Its no big deal really but I fear that it'll just mean they'll be extremely thin when I'm older.

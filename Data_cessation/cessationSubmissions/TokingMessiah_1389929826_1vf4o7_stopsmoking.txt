Track Your Progress with a "Quit Smoking" App!

Hello reddit,



I found this subreddit today and it's great! Based on some of the comments, I thought this would be useful advice.



Get a "Quit Smoking" app - there are plenty of free ones available. You input your quit date, the amount you used to smoke, and the cost per pack. In return you have a quick and handy list of stats, such as:



- Money saved

- Cigarettes not smoked

- Time added to life

- Time you would have spent smoking (do the math: 3-5 minutes per cigarette adds up quickly



Enjoy, and stay strong!

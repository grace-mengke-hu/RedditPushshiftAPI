I didn't decide to quit

Hello, I'm one of the people that have been smoking for 10+ years and didn't decide to quit, but rather "see how long I can go without, strictly for fun", without feeling like I am giving something up (cold turkey).
Just want to check in. The first few days were horrid, but I pulled through with the help of this subreddit and my "overachiever" and relentless stubborn traits. I just tried to get to a week to prove to myself that I can do it and then resume smoking.
It's day 23 and I am now trying to push through to a month, "just for fun". I couldn't live without cigarettes. I always had at least 10 (usually more), every day, for 10+ years. I had thought about quitting many times, but I was just not ready to give it up, because I loved it (haha, I know). It's been way easier that I thought. I read that nicotine dependence is up there with heroin and cocaine dependence, being of one of the most addictive substances out there.

But I'm feeling fine, and I am feeling great for it, because I thought I am done for and never getting rid of it.
After a week passed I feel like the "rose-tinted glasses" have dropped and I am free, and I can see now that I don't miss it, and now I have actually quit (and I still do not feel like I am giving anything up).

So, I encourage those of you who are zealous or relentless, to just try it this way... Accept that you are not quitting, you are just trying to see if you can "quit if I want to", like you tell everyone. If you make it to a week, you can resume, but I assure you it's really cool to try to make it to 2 weeks, too. And if you make it that far, you'll pretty much feel like you've already invested too much time into it to stop playing the game and keep going to see if you achieve more and more, and besides the withdrawal effects will have subsided a bit and even if you can resume smoking as you promised yourself at the start, you will no longer even want to resume it, after experiencing the benefits of not smelling, not having your partner constantly tell you you smell in bed, or when kissing, breathing easier, running up those stairs and not catching a breath, loving your body more, enjoying food more, knowing you will live longer. :)

Cheers!

P.S. I can hang around smokers in smoker rooms, watch people smoke and think about smoking with no problems at all. I did have a nightmare in which I smoked while drunk at a party, but when I woke up I was relieved, because even in the dream I felt regret. :)

P.P.S. I still keep my lighter in my back pocket, and all the "paraphernelia" and it doesn't bother me or trigger me for some reason. I DID clean all the ashtrays and throw out empty packs from the house, though and I ask my friends to smoke downstairs outside (rather than the usual when we used to go out on the balcony together).

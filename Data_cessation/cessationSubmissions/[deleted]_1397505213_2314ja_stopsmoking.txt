Pre-quit

I would like to quit, as does pretty much every other smoker! 

Anyway, I want to set up a "Breathe Easy Kit" for myself and wondering what I could include. 

So far I have:

Oranges

Sugar-free Gum

Sunflower Seeds

Celery Sticks

Smell good hand lotion - probably lavender to help calm me since I get SO AGITATED when I try to quit.

Vicks Vapor Rub (strong menthol smell, breathing in deeply)

Carrots

Lollipops

Water Bottle

Tea

Twizzlers

Stress Ball

Whitening Strips

Flossies (using this as an after meal ritual since this used to be prime time to smoke)










Are there any other maybe aromatherapy or other items, snacks, foods, music...that would help relax me or help with cravings? All suggestions welcome!!!!!

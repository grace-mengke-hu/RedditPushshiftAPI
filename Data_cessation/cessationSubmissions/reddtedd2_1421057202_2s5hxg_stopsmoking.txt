Mouth ulcers from quitting?

One month into quitting and I feel amazing.  The only problem I've had at this point are recurring mouth ulcers, often quite a few at a time and sometimes rather painful.  Has anybody else experienced this when quitting and if so, what did you do about it?

I was expecting cravings and irritability as side effects and thankfully they've been minimal so far.  But mouth ulcers?

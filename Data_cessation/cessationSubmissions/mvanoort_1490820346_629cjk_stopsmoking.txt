Three weeks and going strong!

I quit smoking for good three weeks ago yesterday. Though I haven't really noticed any health benefits yet, I feel good about myself for finally deciding to quit and sticking to it. I've been around smokers a few times, and even gone out to stand with them while they smoked. At my band practice the other day, the guys in my band were all smoking like chimneys, but I stayed tough and didn't cave in! For all you fellow quitters out there, stay strong, and take it one day at a time. We can get through this together!

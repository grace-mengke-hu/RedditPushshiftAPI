Am on day one. Worried about what do do on breaks at work. Any tips?

I’ve been a smoker for 8 years, and for every single job I’ve had out of high school I’ve spent my free time/breaks at work having a cigarette. Now that I’m trying to quit, I’m realizing that I have these 30 minute chunks that really give me harsh cravings. Anybody else go through this and have advice?!

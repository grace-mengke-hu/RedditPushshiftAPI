DAY ONE

I've spent a good part of a decade smoking cigarettes and weed and honestly I wish I never started. I hate how much control it's had over my life. 

I'm making a promise on here that I'm going to stop smoking for 100 days. 

I have too I can't continue to do this to my body anymore. sometimes I smoke just out of pure habit, it doesn't even have the same feeling like it use too. I'm fucking ready for this. 

P.S. To my London Reddit community is there any stop smoking group sessions you can recommend. I read somewhere that the opposite of addiction is connection, not sobriety. Thanks in advance.

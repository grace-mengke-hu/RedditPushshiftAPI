Right now I am strugling with myself

I want to smoke so much guys. Its been only 2 days 18 hours, after 7 years...

Why do I quit? 

\- I love myself

\- I am not a smokeperson

\- I care about myself and my lungs

I only have one problem. So this time, when I quit, I don't believe that I can actually do that. Like, yeah it's been a day, second day and now it is third day, but I still think that I'm gonna smoke like tomorrow, or even today in 1 hr.....Each minute, every second I think about smoking..about this feeling when you smoke, with a coffee. However, I just sit here on my chair, at work...and I do not stand up for a smoke. I don't smoke usual cigarettes, only IQOS, so I gave it to my boyfried and asked to carry it while I am quiting. The problem is that I have a coworker here, who smokes IQOS as well, and she is not quitting, so I always have a temptation.

The hardest part is that when you give up smoking, you want to smoke very very bad, and you feel yourself unsure, anxious, angry...not happy at all...But in case you start smoking...you gonna have even worse feeling, because you didn't manage to quit..and you will be smoking again with this awful and disgusting feeling that you'll never give up..and this smell will follow you forever...

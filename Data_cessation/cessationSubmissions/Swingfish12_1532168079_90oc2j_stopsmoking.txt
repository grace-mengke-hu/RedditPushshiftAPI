Timing resistance (is it a good idea)?

I have the problem that i do not really want to stop smoking, so the psychology is more important to deal with.

I came up with the idea to make it a challenge of resisting.

As example: day 0
Wake up check the time from a fixed moment (lets say get out of the showers) till the first smoke is light up.

On day 1, the challenge is to beat this time, meaning it has to be longer than the previous day.

At some stage, the time will be longer than the time available which would equals success, as the following day i would be not have any time left.

Is that a doable approach ?

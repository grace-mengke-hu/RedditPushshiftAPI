I have my third chest infection in 12 months. My asthma's come back. I quit today.

Well, technically I quit yesterday, as my sore throat stopped me smoking yesterday. 

I had a bad bout of bronchitis last november, it re-occurred in January, and it's back now. I work in a call centre and there is no paid leave, so I lose money every time this happens.

I have asthma but I haven't needed an inhaler since I was 8. Today they gave me a prescription for a strong one as well as an antibiotic.

I *know* this is caused by the smoking, or the smoking aggravates the cough caused by talking on the phone all day every day. 

So this is me, I quit. I didn't have a throat or chest problem at all the last time I quit (for a year and a half).

Edit: also, what's the best stop smoking App? (for android)

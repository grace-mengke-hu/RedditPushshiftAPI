Help

Hey guys, new around here

Need major help quitting, i am in my late 20s and have been a smoker for the past decade, i smoke anywhere between 3-5 cigs a day

I want to quit really badly, so far i have had no health complications, out of paranoia i even got a chest xray done, everything is fine and as it should be, i do workout a few times a week (cardio, weight training)

My job consists of a lot of travelling, generally about 3/4 hours everday, it has now become a routine to smoke when i am driving along with can of monster and the r/casefile podcast, around mid day i get disgusted with my self for smoking and end up throwing the pack along with the lighter swearing i will not smoke the next day

Come next morning, first thing i do is go get a coffee and buy a new pack, i am fully aware of what i am doing but just cant stop myself, this vicious cycle has been going for ages and i have thrown of cig packets costing hundreds of dollars,   

I dont smoke at home as my parents dont know that i smoke, on the weekends i might sneak one in when i am around town, i dont drink at all

I have tried various methods, paid for apps, tried nicotine gum (end up having a smoke with the gum), e cig (makes me feel like a fag and just dosnt feel the same), i have read allan carrs book, did not help, tried quitting by sticking to 1 a day, end up smoking more!!

I have quit for 3 months or more a couple of times but end up picking it up again, i really feel disgusted with myself and often wonder if i will ever be able to quit, i often worry about my future and getting cancer, my last resort is to go see a doctor for medication that controls the cravings

Any suggestions? 

Thanks guys, hoping to quit for good

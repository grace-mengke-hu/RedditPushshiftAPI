760 days.....wow. You can do it too!

I never thought I'd be able to quit smoking but it's actually happened.  You all can do it too!  By being here you are already on the right track.  This sub is full of great inspirational stories.  I quit for my wife and new son.  He's amazing and if being smoke free gives me even a single extra day with them it'll all be worth it.  Everyone be strong and you all can do it.  Just hang in there!

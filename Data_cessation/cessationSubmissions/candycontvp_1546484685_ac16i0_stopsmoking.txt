Holiday relapse after four months

Hi feely quitters. 

I quit smoking early september. During which time I had a four slips. Got up quickly. I smoked on high-stressed days, just for one day and then would quit again for weeks/months. I smoked for a whole week during a holiday and again went back to not smoking at all. 

I caved during christmas, I have been smoking everyday since, and this time I'm finding it super hard to get up again. I managed one full day without smoking on the 29th but I just cant seem to be able to get back on the horse. I'm craving cigs horribly and my willpower is failing me constantly. 

I've read Allen Carr like seven times already, but nothing does the trick, every day I wake up and say to my self that I'll stay smoke-free, but as the day goes by I cave and buy a pack, at night I through the left overs to the trash but the next day I buy another pack. 

I'm tired of feeling on the edge, that feeling of quitting. The longest I went without a single cigarette during those 4 months was 1 month and two weeks. And the cravings never went away. 

Any suggestions?

Happy new year everyone!!

Motivation please

I’m 24 days smoke free. It’s been wonderful to quit, but I feel so fucking horrible right now. I feel like I’m crazy moody and I can’t regulate my emotions anymore. I’ve never cried so much nor felt so angry as I have in the past month. 

My dog got attacked at the park like an hour ago, and he’s okay, but I’m so furious and upset right now and it won’t go away. All I want to do is smoke. Please please help.

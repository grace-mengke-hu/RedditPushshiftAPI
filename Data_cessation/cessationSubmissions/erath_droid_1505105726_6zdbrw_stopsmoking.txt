The dreams and waking up in the morning kind of sucked today.

Had a strange dream where for some reason I had to light up a cigarette and blow some smoke across a candle to keep people from dying and after I did that the people were mad because I wasn't supposed to be smoking anymore. Then I woke up wanting a cig, and lay there for a few minutes until I didn't want one too much. Got up, ate breakfast, met with a friend who chain smokes.

Still didn't smoke. I forget what day I'm on- I know it's at least two weeks, but not three yet. Still have odd cravings, but they're more situational and thus psychological rather than physiological. Like I drive back home from working and as soon as I get out of the car I want to light up. It goes away in a moment though.

Thing is, I STILL have almost half a pack left from when I quite smoking, sitting next to my TV, and that actually makes it *easier* for me to not smoke for some reason.

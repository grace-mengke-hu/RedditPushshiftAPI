Milestone coming: Reflection on 6000 smoke free days

Quitting smoking is a special accomplishment because it's a mastery of yourself. You guys understand: you can decide to quit smoking and still talk yourself back in. There's something unique about the way this drug uses your own mind to promote the addiction.


One reason I stay subscribed to /r/stop_smoking is for the reminder of how difficult it is to quit and how fragile the quit is. The sub is full of people who thought they'd escaped and then tried to have just one. Keeping that knowledge close reminds me never to roll the dice on a celebratory cigar. 


Also, I think we've actually helped people. Generally just by being present and in particular, personally, by talking about the challenges of the medium term. It's common for people to get over that initial hump but then it feel like an they're dragging through eternity of deprivation. It's good to know they're not alone and it gets better. The rest of Reddit may be mindless shouting and circlejerks but not here.


Finally, here's the message I find myself repeating:

1. It's supposed to be hard
2. Keep it simple: Don't Smoke
3. It will get better

Is vaping cheating?

I've never had the motivation to stop smoking for more than a couple of days. A week ago I bought a vape pen for 50 euros(which is roughly what I used to spend on cigarettes every week), and I honestly love everything about it. It's cheaper, doesn't make my appartment smell like death, it tastes good, it's supposedly much healthier, and I can smoke without an ashtray. I haven't smoked a single cigarette ever since. And it felt great to turn down my friend when he offered me one, especially since I used to smoke at least 15 cigs a day.

But it almost feels too easy... am I gonna relapse? is it as healthy as they say it is?

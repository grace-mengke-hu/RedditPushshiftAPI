28 hours no smoking(Not by choice) and looking to make it permanent.

Hey i'm 20 years old and been smoking heavily for a little over 2 years now. 

Recently i've been pretty broke and when push came to shove i just didn't buy any smokes yesterday. I've been meaning to quit for awhile, but haven't been able to make it a day so far. Simply not buying smokes seems to be the trick.

Honestly, i feel like shit right now. I can't sleep, i have no appetite and everything i try and do to keep myself occupied makes me aggravated.

Since i started, i never made it this long without smoking and any advice anyone has to help make it through the next few days would be welcome.

If i could sleep, i'd just try and sleep through the headaches and stuff but i simply can't. Normally i just play various games all day but today everything i try to play just pisses me off and i quit after a few minutes.

Right now i'm just sitting here twiddling my thumbs and thinking about a smoke.

I’m on day three

It has been a bitch, we had to put down our oldest dog Monday, the wife has been stressed, she is still smoking. It’s been dreary and rainy here all week and it brings my mood down, but I haven’t smoked, I’ve had the urge but I am not smoking. I’ve been going to work trying to stay positive and at night after my kiddo goes to sleep I run about a mile or so, do some pushups and then chill out and drink some water. I’m sore as fuck, I won’t lie I crave a smoke, but I’m not going to, I can finally breathe deep without pain or hacking anything up. I’m never lighting up again, fuck this terrible habit. I’m going to be around for my kid as long as I can help it, I’m going to save ~40 dollars a week, and I’m going to get back in shape, I’ve started playing hockey and will train all winter for spring league, it may not improve my playing but I damn sure won’t be out of breath out there. Fuck a cigarette. If I could go back ~15 years ago when I skipped school and smoked my first one I would’ve just went to that fucking history class. I’m done, I don’t need that shit anymore. I hope anybody else struggling can pull through with me, it’s not easy but I think it will be worth it. Sorry for a long rant, I’m just pumped up to get this shit out of my system.

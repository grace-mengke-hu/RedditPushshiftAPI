Has anyone tried quitting caffeine before quitting smoking?

I'm a daily vaper. I vape everywhere and anywhere that I can. Nonstop. I do smoke cigarettes occasionally, but they don't do much for me now that I use the Juul. I'm also a caffeine junkie. I have extreme (diagnosed) anxiety and it seems to be intensified by both, especially at the same time.

Awhile back a friend told me that she had great success quitting caffeine before quitting smoking. She didn't go into specifics, but when she said that I realized it was true that every time I drank caffeine I wanted more nicotine. Caffeine definitely triggers my nicotine use and vis versa. Although nicotine is definitely more important to quit, I thought that I might have more success with quitting caffeine first or even at the same time. I was wondering if anyone has tried this or even quitting both at the same time. Did it help?

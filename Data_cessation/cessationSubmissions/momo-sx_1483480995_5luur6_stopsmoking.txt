I have been using the nicotine patches and I have not smoked in 2017.

can someone who used nicotine patches to quite please share their experience. 
I started smoking at a young age, now it has been more than 10 years since I first bought a pack. for the first time since, I have not smoked for 72 hours, although I am using the nicotine patches. 
I understand that the addiction is not psychological but I am still happy with this "achievement".  I never imagined I would be able to do it. 
one of the side effects are the vivid dreams which i really hate. I can't wait to finish this chapter of my life.

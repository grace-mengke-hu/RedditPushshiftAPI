Passed my first test :D

So I went out for supper this evening with some friends and ordered a Singapore Sling, which I used to drink years ago when I went out with friends and could smoke in the bar  Needless to say my mind went back to that as soon as I had my first sip.  Fortunately, both of the friends that I went out with do not smoke and we able to keep me engaged in conversation which kept my mind off having a smoke.  I am back home and smoke free  Woot woot. :)

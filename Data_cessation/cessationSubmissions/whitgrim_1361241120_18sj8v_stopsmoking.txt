Quit Cold Turkey

I know people have jobs and responsibilities and children and etc, but I have to share- after trying and failing to quit smoking several times, I came up with a new plan.

Over some vacation time, I bought a supply of weed and literally smoked until I was too high to do anything, for 5 days solid. Basically watched a lot of TV, slept, and ate. BUT I was too high to recognize any cig cravings.

After 5 days, my stash was smoked, my vacation was over, and most importantly, my body was nicotine free. The only residual cravings were purely mental, and I got over those way easier than the physical withdrawal. That was the only way I was able to quit. Good luck everyone!

Good luck!

Day 13 Mixed feelings

So I'm almost at the 2 week mark and am having mixed feelings about quitting. On the one hand, my body feels a lot healthier. It's also nice to not have to worry about smelling like nasty cigarettes all the time. However, on the downside I feel almost part of my personality has been taken away. I used to be real witty and humorous responding to peoples comments and that type of thing. Now it's like I got nothing and a couple people have pointed it out. I know that's not a good reason to start smoking again but I wish I could have that back.

Don't even have one! (I'm quitting again)

Deep down, I knew this was going to happen, even though part of my brain was telling me it was I could have just one, once in a while. It's never just one. I had "just one" almost a month ago and I've been having at least one almost every day since then. I put the first pack that a bought in a long time in the sink and soaked it. 

I'm done with this garbage. They don't taste good. They don't make me feel good. I'm ashamed of the habit. I smell horrible. I'm never satisfied with just one. It's a trap. It's not even just a slippery slope, it's a slippery cliff.


The moral of the story is; Don't do it, not even one puff! I know this is said all the time here, but that's because it's so true. Don't let yourself be tricked into having "just one". You don't want to quit again and again. Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do for your health. Please heed this warning and good luck to everyone here!

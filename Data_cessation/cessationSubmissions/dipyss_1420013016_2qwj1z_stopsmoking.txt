Wheezing after quitting?

Hello /r/stopsmoking! I recently quit all nicotine use on christmas night, after five years of heavy smoking, vaping, and hookah. I've stayed strong since then, and while my cravings have decreased, I've noticed that I've developed a wheeze and consistent cough which mostly occurs at night and was wondering if anyone had experienced anything similar?
Thanks in advance!

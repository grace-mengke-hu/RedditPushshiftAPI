I’ve just started my journey

   I haven’t been a smoker for long, but for the time I did smoke I went overboard. At my worst, I was going  through a pack a day. I know this is not as bad or as long term as some but I have already noticed the adverse affects. I used to be extremely athletic and a runner. My fastest mile time is under 5 minutes, now I’m not even sure I could run a mile. I started smoking very young and I believe it stunted my development.

  I went through five last packs but just recently I was smoking a cigarette(my last cigarette) and I thought to myself “what am I doing” and I threw it done. I will never look back. 

   Thank you for reading, I’m going to continue posting updates if anyone’s interested. And if anyone has any advice to give, please share.

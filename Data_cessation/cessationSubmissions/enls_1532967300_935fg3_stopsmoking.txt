First Day Quitting - 15 Year Smoker

I started smoking as a way to get more breaks at the crappy jobs I had when I was young. I've quit on and off a few times over the years, but it's time to lay them down for good.


Today is my first day tobacco and nicotine free. I am going cold turkey.


I'd say wish me luck, but I don't need it. I'm putting them down for good this time.

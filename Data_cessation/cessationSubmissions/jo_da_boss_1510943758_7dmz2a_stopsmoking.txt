4 months in... Cravings are back!

I’m at about 4.5 month’s zero nicotine. Huuuuuge thanks to this sub. I still check it almost every day. 

Been smoking since I was a kid, this is my 3rd time making it this far in. The other 2 I let a puff slip which turned back to full fledged smoking again, both at around 4/5 months. 

I am NOT SMOKING, but these cravings coming back are pretty powerful and annoying. Does anyone else experience this? Do they go away? It’s been about a week of renewed cravings. Months 2-3 were pretty easy but I find myself almost every hour thinking about smokes and have to keep telling myself it’s not a option.

Almost want a cigarette but had a better idea.

It was to post on reddit! I'm still a little sick, but usually(when i was a smoker)I would wake up and have a morning cigarette. My sister is at my house and I know I could ask for a cigarette and get one but instead I'm going to stay put and post this to reddit! Thank you Stop Smoking! Just kept me from smoking!!!

Now I'm just worried about work. I work at wal-mart and every time we get a break all my friends go outside to  smoke...I have to be strong and just say no before I even get outside!

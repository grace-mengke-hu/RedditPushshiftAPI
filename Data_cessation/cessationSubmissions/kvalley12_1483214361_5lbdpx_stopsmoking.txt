Everything's aggravating me

Day 2 here again and everything pisses me off lol. Not at all times but just got into an argument with mom and dad and wow I was a little too vocal. Not sure how to deal with the anger I don't want to argue because then I feel more guilty and think a cigarette will take the ease away and I'll be able to deal with situations again normally. Damn emotions

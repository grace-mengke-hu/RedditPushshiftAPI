Almost 10 years of smoking and it has completely ruined my life.

I've been smoking since 2007. Picked it up as a "cool habit" because there was nothing else to do and I've always wanted to be cool and different. 10 years later and I'm having heart and chest problems, I'm always exhausted and mildly depressed. Nothing is fun, and I can't even get myself to think of seriously stopping this. I've moved to another city and took a new job, hoped that doing that would make me change my old ways, but it's gotten really worse. I've lost the drive to make myself better and I've become more anxious and depressed. Every single thing in my life is screaming "QUIT FUCKING SMOKING" but I can't get myself to do it. I'm in need for serious help and that's why I searched for this subreddit. I live a North African country -Sorry for my not so good English- in a small state, so there are no clinics or doctors - or even good friends- to really help me get in the right mind to quit. I hope some of you guys take the time to help me tackle my monster. Thank you so much in advance.

Detoxing nicotine from urine?

I'm a few days into quitting smoking he second time (got 2 months clean prior before slipping into old habits) and I am in the midst of recieving an amazing job offer that is smoke free amd urine test for niccotine. I explained that I just quot and am on the patch they said thats fine and were happy i let them know etc. However I really dont want a positive test possibly hurting me if they decide it was too long.

How long can i expect to teat positive and are there any ways to help push the nicotine out lf my system quicker.  Ive smoked half a pack a day for a few years.

Need Help

Hello all, it was been about 1.2 years of fully smoking for me. This needs to stop ASAP. As I write this, I'm enlisting in the US Army. I have just stared to fully run every morning and night. My mile time is normally at 7:30, which sucks for someone who is 19. I have told myself MANY times "This is the last pack" but I continue to go back. I know that I have screwed my body up way to long, help please!!!!!!!

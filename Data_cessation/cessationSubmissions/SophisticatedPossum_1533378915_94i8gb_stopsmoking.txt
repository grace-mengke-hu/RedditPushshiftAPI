Today I decide! Time to get my life back!

After nearly 15 years, today, I finally decided to end this suffering. No matter how much it hurts, how much it calls me softly, I am done!

My baby needs a father to teach him and encourage him, so I choose him over stupid cigarettes.

Any support and advice is welcome.

Smoking as a crutch

Hi guys. So I'm trying to quit smoking, I've been smoking for four years and hit a pack a day last October. I bounce between half a pack and a full pack depending on my days now, and it's getting old. 

I smoke because it helps me deal with stress, I have a fucked up family situation and I realized the career I've worked my ass off to get into isn't what I want. The more stressed I am the more I smoke, and I've been losing allot of sleep over the stress recently. I already know the idea of how to get out of the habit, and I'm working my way there. 

I want to talk to you guys about why people smoke, because I think that's more of a problem than the nicotine itself. I'm more worried about losing the ten minutes I have to just space out and ignore the world than I am about withdrawals and urges. They are certainly a large part of my addiction, but if I could find a way to take time off throughout the day to chill out and ignore what's going on I know I'd have an easier time. Whether it's an excuse created by my addiction or not, I think it's something I could do to help my process of quitting. 

So what is your story? How did you get into the habit to begin with, and do you still have the same frame of mind today?

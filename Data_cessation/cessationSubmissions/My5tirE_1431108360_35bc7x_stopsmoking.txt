Too much shit (literally) and ended up smoking.

Well to start off I was smoke free for 10 days...until right now. I'm in the middle of a cross country move and I finally had enough. I quit with just the help of an E-Cig to help when things got too stressful. It was working good until about 10 minutes ago. Long story short our moving company left a lot of stuff behind so my wife and I have both our vehicles packed to the roofs. This includes our dog and two cats. Anyway I'm trying to check out of our hotel from last night...wife thinks it's ok to check out 45 min later than we are supposed to. I'm dragging the stuff out to the cars while she does make up (why the fuck is this needed to be on while driving down the interstate). Dog shit right behind my vehicle while trying to put him in it. I end up stepping in it 5 min later (bought new shoes the day before). Go to check the bottom of my shoe and ended up kicking my shorts with the shit so now I have shitty shoes, shitty shorts and a hotel manager yelling at me that we need to check out. Punted my suitcase across the parking lot (more like 6 feet) grab my ecig and took a few puffs. It wasn't doing the job so I grabbed a smoke that was in my bag from 2 weeks before. I feel like shit and confirmed that I don't want to smoke anymore. Anyway I just wanted to write this down to get some frustrations out and it helped.

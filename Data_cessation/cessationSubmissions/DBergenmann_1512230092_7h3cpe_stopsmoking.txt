Smoker for 5 years, finally managed to successfully quit (again)

Hi guys, so I’ve been smoking since 16(yeah I know, don’t remind me) it’s been fairly intermittent but I’ve always smoked. Since 2 years ago I’ve been a pretty regular smoker and managed to quit for several months after I hit the pack a day mark. As my smoking has gotten back to the concerning level ( &gt;1/2ppd) I’ve decided to quit again.  I’m also significantly reducing the amount of smokeless I use. 

The thing that’s helped me greatly is a JUUL. It doesn’t feel like a vape. It’s easy. It actually feels the most like smoking that isn’t smoking. I highly recommend it. Seriously. I’ve had 5 cigarettes in the past 3 weeks and those were at the bar and at the beginning. 

I have never felt so confident that I’m stopping smoking before.  My dipping has even reduced significantly. And I’m using my JUUL much less than I smoked to begin with. 

It can be done, I’m doing it. If you’re struggling with cravings and the need for nicotine. I recommend a JUUL. 
If you don’t want any inhalation at all, I recommend snus. 
Snus helped me quit the first time and if shipping from Sweden wasn’t so much I’d still regularly snus. 

Just my .02, figured it could help someone else.

reaching end of day 4, success

Today was my first day back to work since monday (quit day). I brought lots of crunchy veggie snacks and tea tree toothpicks and cucumber water. 99 percent of my coworkers smoke, so I was a little concerned about how hard it would be. I did fine. When I left I was VERY ready to go home, and a little surly for about 20 minutes. Not too shabby. Feeling fine now, looking forward to another smoke free day tomorrow.

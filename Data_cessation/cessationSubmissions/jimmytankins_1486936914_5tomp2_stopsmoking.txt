Ready to quit. Facing some hurdles in the next couple of weeks. Advice?

Smoked my last cig before going into the airport this afternoon. Heading home for my grandmother's funeral this week and the family is a mess. My dad just picked up smoking again too, after having stopped for many years. Then, I'm heading to visit my buddy for a week who's a heavy smoker. 

It's going to be a tough two weeks to quit, but I'm tired of pretending there will be a perfect time to take the leap. I'm reading How Not to Die, by Michael Greger and it's painfully obvious how destructive the habit is. I've been smoking casually+ for 15 years - gotta cut this dumb shit out. Any help from you guys and gals would be greatly appreciated.

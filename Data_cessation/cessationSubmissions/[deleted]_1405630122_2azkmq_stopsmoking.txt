I've had a 15 year smoking tobacco (a pack a day) and smoking about 8 joints a day. I read the Uniquestring and have gone 5 days without any Cannabis and have replaced cigarettes with vaping

And I feel great, it's not the complete success I want, but it's a start and i'm already using this vape thing a hell of a lot less than the pack a day I was smoking previously. And no weed, none. 

Dealing with 2 smoking addictions has been such a burden but that one post has spurred me on more than anything previously.

I'd like to thank this subreddit and Uniquestring for the inspiration.

Edit.. missed out some words from the title.. but you get the drift.

Almost done with 10 days

I've always envied the people who make posts like this on the subreddit. I have gone through the cycle of requesting and removing and re-requesting a badge somewhere around 10 times in the last few months. Now I'm at 10 days and counting. I haven't gone this long without smoking in about a year 

I use an e-cig. I firmly believe it's the single best method after cold-turkey. 

I'm pretty drunk and watched several of my friends smoke cigarettes outside of the bar, accepting how intense my craving is, considering I didn't bring the e-cig. I sat and watched and felt out of the loop. But the gum bleeding and gum receding will continue to become less severe, and I'll be able to build off the 4 days that I've exercised since quitting a week and a half ago

I guess I'm just journaling for others to read and give their nod of approval. Not too many people are very supportive or aware of my efforts to quit. It's a relatively lonely process. I'm glad I've made it this far.

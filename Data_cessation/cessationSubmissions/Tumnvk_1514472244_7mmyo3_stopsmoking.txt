Best birthday present I could give myself.

I'm turning 36 today. Two and a half months ago I had my last cigarette. Still can't believe I've made it 76 days without a single puff. I'm quite happy to be able to honestly say I haven't cheated, even once. That's what makes this quit so special. 

If I can do it after 20 years of smoking and 1,000 attempts at quitting, so can you! 

Not one puff, ever again!

Yippee! I'm a non-smoker!

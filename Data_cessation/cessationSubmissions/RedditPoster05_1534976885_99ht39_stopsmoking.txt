One week down!

So Ive quit many times before. Last year I made it around 8 weeks. This year the thing that is different is one I just really cant afford it. I just bought a house and it has been pricey. Two I have never been in pain from smoking until now. My throat and jowl was hurting. Some of that was from my night time grinding which I got a mouth guard for and then the rest was due to smoking I believe. A week in and id say 50% of the pain is gone. Looking forward to when I lose the morning smokey taste in my mouth. First week is always the hardest for me then I just get really bad cravings based on the past. Ive written notes about how bad the pain was and am trying to make that my big thing if I feel the urge to slip again... Im really trying to make this time different.

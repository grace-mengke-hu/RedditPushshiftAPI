30 days without

Decided to quit smoking on new years (motivated by me running out of cigarettes, and liking clear stopping points). As of November I was smoking 15-20 a day, I decided to cut back on thanksgiving to 2 a day.  Spent about 5 weeks having 2 a day (occasionally slipping up and having a third.) The first couple weeks of 2 a day were absolutely brutal, luckily everyone around me understood and forgave my moments of irritation(my gf is a saint.) The first 2 weeks of quitting were actually really easy compared to cutting back. The last 2 weeks, however, have been much harder. I miss the activity quite a bit, especially when driving. Anyways dont know what else to say, found this subreddit today and figured it couldn't hurt to add even more support.

TL:DR 30 days in, miss cigarettes while driving

I just saw Kevin Spacey smoking a cigarette on House of Cards, and then the carvings kicked in.

I was watching House of Cards, and the scene in the first episode when Kevin is up late smoking a cig almost made me want to drive to the store and buy a new pack.  I actually sent up stairs and had the car keys in my hands, before I realized what I was doing.  It was like I couldn't control my actions, and I haven't had a craving like that since about day 4.  Just thought I would share.

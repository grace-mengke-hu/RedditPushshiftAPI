5 Weeks tobacco free

After 25 years of a pack or more a day I am 5 weeks without tobacco.  I am using the patch.  I started with the 21mg but only used it for 2 weeks.  I'm on week 3 of the 14mg patch and plan to step down to the 7mg in a week.   I am properly motivated (my father was recently diagnosed with lung cancer) so quitting this time has been easier.  In the past I only quit for a couple of days and caved in.  However, I do find myself wanting to smoke.. more for the reward after eating than any other time of day.   I think this is more from habit than anything else.  Looking forward to being nicotine free very soon!!

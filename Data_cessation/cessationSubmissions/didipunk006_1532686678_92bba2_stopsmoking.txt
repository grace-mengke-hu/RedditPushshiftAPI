70 hours without smoking

Hi guys,

First post here. Smoked since I was 21 and I'm 31 now. This may be my 8th attempt but I'm pretty sure my mind is set up this time. I use nicotin patches because cold turkey never worked for me (If I can stop smoking at all without anything I can also start smoking again in a sec ahah). First two night were horrible with realistic nightmares and almost no sleep but this night was fine. I dreamed but managed to sleep 6 hours (I don't remove the patch and yes I asked a doctor and know some say you should remove it before sleeping and put a new one in the morning but I don't trust "craving didipunk006"). Today I'm going to my cousin house and I will do some gardening to pass time. Will update in a week! take care guys

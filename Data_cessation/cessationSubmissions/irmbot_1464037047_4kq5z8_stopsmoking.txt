I'm back, /r/stopsmoking

Hey /r/stopsmoking,

I'm back. I have an e-cig, but I am not buying my usual pack of American Spirit menthol. I recently had 30ish days smoke-free, then my cat got sick and I started smoking again. Coincidentally, my smoking may have caused my cat's illness, I may never really know, since there isn't enough research on the effects of tobacco smoke and cancer. However, I will no longer expose my pets to my bad habits. I'm here, if you will have me again!

The pub and friends who smoke.

My badge is wrong, I need to re set it. I'm at 12 days right now. Has been a great 12 days! Am going to a dinner and then for drinks in a couple of hours. This is where I ALWAYS slip up. I want to succeed this time. Have to remember, smoking will NOT make my night more enjoyable in ANY WAY. It'll just put me back to day one again. Smoking will not make me look cooler. It won't make my drink taste better. I will wake up smelly, hungover and full of regret if I smoke tonight, it is NOT worth it!!!!!! Thank you for listening. May comment to myself if I feel weak throughout the night.

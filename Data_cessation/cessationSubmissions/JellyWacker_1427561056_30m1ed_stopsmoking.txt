What are the problems you guys encounter when smoking?

Shoot! The title should say 'quitting smoking'.

Hey everyone,

Cigarette-free for almost a year now and I wanted to see if we all could help each other out with our problems.  I'm guessing most of us have similar issues and some of us have gotten past them, so I wanted to create a mega-share thread.

I know one of my biggest problems was smoking when I drank (mostly due to all my friends smoking).  I know one of the mantras of quitting smoking is basically disengage from all the people who smoke so you aren't tempted, but in reality I found that to be stupid - these people were my friends and I was quitting for my own reasons.  So instead of ostracizing myself from the group I put a limit on my drinking - two max if out at a bar.  

Yes, it was a little less fun, but ultimately I was able to make sound decisions and not smoke so it was ultimately beneficial.  Now, I can drink as much as possible and still 'say no'.

So what are your guys' problems?

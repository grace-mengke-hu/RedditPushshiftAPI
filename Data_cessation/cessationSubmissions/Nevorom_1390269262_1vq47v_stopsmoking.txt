Thank you, everyone!

I posted yesterday about stressing over my wife traveling cross-planet. I was about one stressor away from buying my first pack in 3 months. You guys (gals) posted what I needed to read to kick my self in the ass and make it over the craving. Thank you for keeping me smoke free and as an update: She made it home safely about an hour ago!

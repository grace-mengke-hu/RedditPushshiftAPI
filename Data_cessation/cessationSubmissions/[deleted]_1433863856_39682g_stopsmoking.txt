Here's something that struck as me being the root of my addiction. And what will be the best gift from quitting.

"Think about it. Once we finished tanking-up with a new supply of nicotine and had satisfied our dependency, the car's tire was still flat, or the bad news was still bad. One of the greatest recovery gifts of all is an amazing sense of calm during crisis, as we're no longer adding nicotine withdrawal atop every stressful event."


A fantastic read if you are quitting or thinking of quitting. Really helps you understand why you're an addict.

Does anyone else know about the Ten O'Clock People, or Quitters, Inc?

[The Ten O'Clock People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ten_O'Clock_People) and [Quitters, Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quitters_Inc) are short stories by Stephen King, in which the protagonist deals with quitting smoking.  I was looking to find some more stories along those lines.. Can anyone recommend anything similar that they've enjoyed?

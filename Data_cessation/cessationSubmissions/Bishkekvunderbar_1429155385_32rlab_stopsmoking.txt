Advice on a relapse

Hey all, so I was doing excellently for 2 months, and then I broke down and bought a pack. Now the last couple of months have been really up-and-down, in a stage of quitting for a week-two weeks, then caving, buying a pack, and on and on. I want to make this happen for good, but I feel like I'm on a roller-coaster where I can't get to the mental state of really desiring to quit as I did the first time around. Any advice on how to close the circle?

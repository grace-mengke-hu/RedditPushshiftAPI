Quit about a year ago - been okay, but intense desire to smoke today

I quit about a year ago, and after the first few months, I've been fine since. But today I woke up with a really weird feeling and an intense craving for a cigarette, that's lasted all day so far. It seems weird and completely out of the blue - anyone else experienced this?

I quit smoking by creating a reward system that involves getting my hair done.

Former on and off smoker for 6 years here. 


What finally got me to quit? After having a moment fully feeling and freaking out about my own mortality, and how I was potentially changing my fate by smoking, I called up a local salon that does crazy hair and booked the earliest appointment. 


From that moment onward I decided that to reward myself (when I feel like I need the reward or motivation) I was going to get my hair done. So that's how I finally committed to quitting. By being vain!


I truly believe a reward system works! Especially if it is a somewhat expensive reward. I felt like I really needed to stick to quitting to justify the $$ I was spending on my hair.

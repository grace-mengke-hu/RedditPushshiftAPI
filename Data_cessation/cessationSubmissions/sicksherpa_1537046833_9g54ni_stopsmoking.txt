What’s your best trick after several relapses? I really want to stop for good tomorrow

Hey guys, first I want to thank you so much for tour help, been reading this sub a lot last year and with allan carr book help I ve been able to stop smoking cold turkey for 10 months... then a trip in Mexico later (chilling on the beach, Just one I can stop again when I come  back) I’ve relapse.. then I stop and relapse at least 5 times since. Last Sunday I’ve decided I would stop for real and wednesday after attending a show I smoked one and relapse. I really want to stop for real tomorrow, but i felt I lost my confidence a bit. I know how good life can be as a non smoker.. but I’m reaching out for the first time here, need some help to boost my determination :) maybe my issue is that Ive lost touch with the basics on how bad tobacco is bad for your health? If anyone would like to share tips to reclaim determination after several relapse, that would be so kind of you! Cheers!

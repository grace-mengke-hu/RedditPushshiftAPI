Day zero... lonely... cigs are not a replacement for friends.

I don't want to buy cigs/smoke anymore. When I feel lonely, I go out for a cig, but cigs aren't friend replacements.

 I'm really pissed about something and I would like to vent here. I was out for a smoke sat night and saw the cops at my neighbors house, I texted her that they were there.... yadda yadda yadda we ended up hanging out all night because she was afraid her abusive ex would come back. We hung out all night and had a great time, or so I thought, she even wanted to Facebook friend me, which is a much bigger deal to me than most. Yesterday I knocked on her door, called, then texted if she wanted to hang out, she said some other time OK. She said calling and knocking were preferred methods of contact. So I'm out for a cig tonight and I see her come out the car and walk to her door, avoiding looking at me. I guess the great time I thought was mural was drug induced on her part. she said in her text that she would hit me up to hang out. I'm not holding my breath. I deleted her number and unfriended her. If you don't say hi to me irl I won't be your pretend internet friend. So I'm like bummed out, I thought i had really made a friend, totally pissed off. I want to go out and buy some cigs... but I need to pay my bills and also EAT!!!


This is the second female within a week that I had to delete. This chick invited me to hang out. Then her little brother was in crisis so she was going to "help him calm down for a little and then get back to me". It's been over a week, I deleted her number and removed her from Facebook. 

Honestly, it has to be me. It sucks!

But I still have my kitty cat as my best friend. Maybe I'll reward myself for not buying cigs by getting a burger from burger King. 


Here's to my first day quit being 9/13/16

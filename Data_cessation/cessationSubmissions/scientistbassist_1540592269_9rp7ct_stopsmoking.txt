Quitting nicotine has also triggered my cravings to Drink

Nicotine addiction is a crafty beast!  During my second week of not smoking, my cravings morphed to not just cigarettes, but to alcohol as well!  

Background: I am 3 weeks not smoking (cold turkey, no nicotine of any kind) AND 18+ months sober.  I have not experienced and held such strong alcohol cravings in well-over a year.  I anticipated smoke cravings, but I did not see that coming. I can only suppose the nicotine creature is bringing all its friends out to play. 

Regardless, I will not drink or smoke today, no matter how hard it gets!  Nicotine is an addition to be reckoned with and something that we all will be victorious over!

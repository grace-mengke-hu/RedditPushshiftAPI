It happened. 100 days!!!!

This is such a monumental day for me. The only time I've made it this long is when I was pregnant. Well, I'm not and I did it for ME this time. I feel great and I am never going back! To the veterans, you are an inspiration to everyone on this sub. To the beginners, the 100 day-ers, the "Maybe I should quit"ers, YOU CAN DO IT! You are stronger than you know and cigarettes are doing nothing but holding you back. Thank you r/stopsmoking, you have always been there for me. Let's all breathe together.

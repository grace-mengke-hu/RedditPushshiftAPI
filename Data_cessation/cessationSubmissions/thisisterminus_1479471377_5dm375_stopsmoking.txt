Third day in after encouragement from people here

Three days and counting and it's hard but with the help of about three to four nicotine gums a day I've made it this far. Every time I get a craving I write it down and note I didn't give in. That helps. I'm having a craving right now just talking about not smoking. I won't smoke. 
Thanks everyone.

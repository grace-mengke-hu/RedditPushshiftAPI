The number of cravings thing

Why do I keep reading that cold turkey quitters only have 2-3 cravings a day, for 1-3 minutes length?

Who is this true for? Maybe people who smoke a few on the weekends?

anyway, on Day 2 of my first ever Cold Turkey Quit. It's going just fine, but I've been awake for 4 hours and probably having mild to strong cravings about 45 minutes per hour, and a reprieve for 15 minutes per hour where I feel very good and calm. 



UPDATE: Starting day 4 now and the cravings are much much much more reasonable. I wasn't joking about 75% of the first three days being cravings-I was/am a heavy addict. But here on day 4, the cravings really have whittled down to 3 minutes-ish and are totally easy to wait out.

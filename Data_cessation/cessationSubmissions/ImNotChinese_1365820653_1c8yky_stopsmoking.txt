One Year Without Cigarettes!

Just want to say thank you to all of you on my 1 year anniversary of quitting smoking! The first month was the worst but it is so much better on this side. Reading everyone's posts, good and bad, have helped me get to today. If I can contribute even a little to the support I've found in this subreddit that I've gotten out of it, I've done something special.  I couldn't have done it without you all (whether you know it or not).

If I can do it, you can do it. I believe in you. Stay strong, brothers and sisters.

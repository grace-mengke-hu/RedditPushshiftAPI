How do you reward yourself for completing a task without having a cigarette?

Hi all! I am gearing up to quit. 

For me, I really associate having a cigarette as something you do as a reward once you have crossed something off of your to-do list. What are ways that I can substitute this reward? I plan on setting weekly/monthly rewards with things like pedicures or a nice meal out, but I am more looking for suggestions that are fast and feasible and can be done multiple times per day.  So far I have: 

\- Spend 10 minutes reading a good book 

\- Spend 10 minute walking or stretching

\- Chew on a piece of gum

No suggestions along the lines of "have a piece of chocolate" please :)

Day 1: Panic starts to set in...

Hi everyone. I've posted here before full of good intentions but I never stuck with it for more than a couple of days. My longest stint was in January when I managed 4 days. So I'm back.

&amp;#x200B;

It's my birthday today and I made a promise to myself that I would give myself the present of being a non-smoker. I just feel I'm too old at this stage to continue ruining my health in the way that I have been. I mean, my health isn't ruined *yet*, but if I keep going the way I am, it soon will be.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the Smoke Free app on my phone, I'm officially 16h 29m 22s in. My pulse rate and oxygen levels have returned to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling a bit panicky and even a bit frightened. Why is it so terrifying to actually stop? I was driving home from work earlier and I was getting so frustrated with myself in the car. Why the hell do I still want to smoke?! I don't even enjoy it that much anymore! It costs me a ridiculous amount of money a month, I'm always ashamed of the smell on my clothes, it is ruining my gums and probably giving me grey hairs. And yet... I know how hard it is going to be to stay away from them. I hope I'm ready when the demons come knocking.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a bit easier today to not smoke because I am so hungover and it is the only time I ever truly despise them and find it easy not to have one. Tomorrow will be a lot more challenging. I plan to get into a kick-ass gym routine in a bid to replace some of my smoking time with healthy habits. It's funny though, but sometimes I find that the better I feel, the more I want to smoke. It's like, I feel like since I'm exercising and eating right, I should smoke to balance it out or something. Crazy shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to report back here every day, I hope that's allowed! You don't have to read if you don't want to!

&amp;#x200B;

I also really enjoy the guy that draws the Pok√©mon characters every day, I think it's a great idea to have something like that to post. I'm going to copy him slightly and post a song a day here that reflects how I'm feeling and how the day has gone for me. I just think it will be something to help keep me on track,  an 'Oh, I won't be able to post my song and write about my smoke-free day on Reddit if I give in to the cravings' kind of thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also going to try to write some personal benefits of not smoking that the day has brought. Today's benefits:

\- Not having to go out in the pissing rain to light one up

\- Not having a stinky cigarette smell on my woolly jacket (wool is the worst!)

&amp;#x200B;

For the Day 1 song, I have chosen 'Don't Think Twice It's All Right' by Bob Dylan. It's a beautiful song, quite melancholic, and I like the idea of Bob telling me not to think twice about smoking again. I also think the last verse could be a fare-thee-well to the cigarettes:

*So long honey babe/ Where I'm bound, I can't tell/ Goodbye is too good a word, babe/ So I just say fare thee well/ I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind/ You could have done better but I don't mind/ You just kinda wasted my precious time/ But don't think twice, it's all right*

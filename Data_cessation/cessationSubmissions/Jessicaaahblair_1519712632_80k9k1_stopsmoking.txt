I am breaking out like a teenager again. Nooooooo

Will be 4 weeks smoke free tomorrow (yippppiee!). And my skin is breaking out SO bad. Big red cystic painful pimples EVERYWHERE. Face, neck, back, chest..... yaaayyy adult acne! Anyone else experiencing this? My skin was soft and amazing for the first 3ish weeks!!

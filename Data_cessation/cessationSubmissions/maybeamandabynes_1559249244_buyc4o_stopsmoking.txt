Should I put a patch on?

Hi ya’ll! I quit smoking and started on the patch almost a month ago

This morning I forgot to put one on and just realized. I’ll only be up for a few more hours before I go to bed where I will take it off and I am not having cravings, should i put one on?

I’m not worried about smoking I’m worried I’ll have withdrawal insomnia

Breaking the relapse pattern

Hi , 
I have been smoking for the past 7 years about 15 cigs a day . I have quit smoking about 5-6 times in the past 3 years with the help of chantix. 

I would go smoke free once I'm off the medication for 1-2 months sometimes 3-4 months but for some reason I'll have 1 cigarette out of the blue thinking one will not kill me and just get sucked back in it .

I haven't smoked in 4 days now and I would like to keep it that way . 

Any tips or motivation would help 

Thanks

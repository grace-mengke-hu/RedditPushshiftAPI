Worst part is over. . .

It has been over four years since I tried to quit smoking, I have been a smoker for about 10 years and I told myself I would quit before I turned 25 so here I am, four days strong. . .

It has been a lot easier than expected, hopefully because of planning on my part. I set a quit date about two weeks ago and slowly cut back all the way to my quit date. Things like waiting as long as possible in the morning for my first cigarette and letting one or more breaks go by at work where I don’t go smoke.

I threw/put away all my cigarette paraphernalia the day I quit and bought a huge bag of lollipops. The first day was naturally the hardest but having a lollipop and something white sticking out of my mouth really helped. I usually go on a walk while eating my lollipop. Now, I don’t really crave a cigarette but I feel the compulsion to have one during my trigger times (after a meal, after a drink, after a bowl, waking up, breaks at work, etc.) and I have this strange sense that something is missing from my life. I also wrote a huge list of ‘things to do instead of smoking’ on my mirror which I will glance at if it gets bad (things like make the bed, go for a walk, clean out a cupboard, fuss in the yard, etc.) Usually just distracting myself until the compulsion fades is enough.

A few things that feel different about this go, first, my life is not nearly as stressful as it used to be, job/money wise (I worked in the service industry, pervasive culture of smoking a given.) Secondly, I do not hang out with anyone that smokes nor do I party or go to bars anymore (thanks r/personalfinance.) Lastly, I waited until my schedule completely changed at work, including days off, so I was starting with a new routine instead of an old one. 

Really looking forward to enjoying the rest of my life smoke free, every morning when I wake up I smile knowing that I am already there!

TLDR; Planning and timing have contributed to my success quitting so far

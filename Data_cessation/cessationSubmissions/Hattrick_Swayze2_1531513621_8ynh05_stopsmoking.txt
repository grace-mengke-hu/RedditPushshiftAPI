Slipped up after 3 weeks

Trying to stay positive. I had been doing so well. No smoking, regular cardio, taking a break from alcohol. Over the past week I’d visited my local pub a couple times to see how I would deal with triggers. Would only have a couple beers and head home feeling proud and accomplished that I didn’t even think of smoking. Last night I went out with a friend and had a little bit more to drink than I planned. I was offered a cigarette and didn’t even hesitate. Next thing I know I’m taking the most depressing drag of my life. I immediately felt like shit and went home. When I woke up this morning I could taste that awful hangover/cigarette breath and have been pissed off at myself all day. I don’t have any urge to smoke, I’m just mad.

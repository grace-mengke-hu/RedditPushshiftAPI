Turned 30 a couple weeks ago and decided it was time. 2 days in and I feel great/awful.

I feel great and, maybe it's in my head, but I think I can already feel the difference in how I feel due to the blood pressure issues smoking causes. I feel almost lighter in a way. I feel awful because I can't shake the urge to smoke. I'm going cold turkey because that has been what's worked the best but god damn. I don't want to smoke but my brain is not agreeing and that is the most uncomfortable part. It's like being in control but not at the same time.

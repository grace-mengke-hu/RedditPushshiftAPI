Weird water sensation in nose since quitting?

It's been almost 4 months since I last smoked.

But ever since like 2 months in I've had this like constant feeling of water in my nose sort of? Plus my chest just feels super tight all the time.

What is causing this? I haven't read of a watery sensation in the nose after quitting anywhere.

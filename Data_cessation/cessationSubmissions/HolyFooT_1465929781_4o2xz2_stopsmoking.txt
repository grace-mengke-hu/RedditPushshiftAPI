Struggling... need help

I have been a smoker for most of the past 20 years. I have quit twice for 6 month periods both times after reading Allen Carr's Easyway. I relapsed because I was overconfident and thought I had outgrown addiction. Now I am trying for a third and final time to stop and I am finding it harder than ever. 
The first time I quit was the easiest, I followed the instructions in the book and really believed that I was done and boom easy as that. This time though I can't get past failures out of my mind and can't bring my mind to that point of certainty that makes it possible to stop. I have read through the book twice this time and I can't shake the idea that I enjoy the cigarettes. I know while I am smoking that I am not enjoying it but when I have gone a few hours, the old cravings creep back in. Any ideas?

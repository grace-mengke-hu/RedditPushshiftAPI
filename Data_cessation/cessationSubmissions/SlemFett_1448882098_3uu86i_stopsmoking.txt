This should have been my 1 year post... hurray for 35 days :)

Sorry for the wall of text... 

So this day last year I decided to quit smoking, it lasted until new years evening when I got really drunk around smokers and caved. I´m a 40 years old male and have been using nicotin since I was 14, with two 6 month quits at various points.

So this past year has been a long journey of quitting for anything between 5 days up to two months and then starting again. This september I had enough and stopped with the help of patches. The day after my 40´th birthday I stopped with patches. Two weeks later I smoked a cigarette, the day after is my new quit day, 35 days ago.  

So since septemeber I have smoked one cigarette, increadibly stupid I know but it is what it is. 

The diffrence between last year and this is that I have met a wonderful woman who is also a doctor, and with her support Im positive that I will not write the same post one year from now. 
I have cravings almost every day but I feel so much better both mentally and physically already. It really is the only possible way forward to stay smoke free. 

Whenever I have bad cravings I come here and read the struggles we all go through and it really helps.

Lastly I wanted to share a tip that help me stay smoke free. When I get bad cravings I tell myself that the choice isnt between smoking or not, but instead between a patch or no patch. The thought of putting on a patch after 35 days is really not attractive so by takig out smoking as possible action it really makes it easier to cope with the cravings.

Again, sory for the wall, good luck everybody, stay strong, and cross your fingers that you wont have to read this again next year :)

SO lit his cig on the stove burner before going outside because he can't find a light. Now the house smells.

Now I'm craving. He smokes a pack a day and I was only ever 1/2 pack at most. Not buying packs was the easiest thing for me to let go of, because I knew I could just bum from he if I ever wanted any. That mentality kept me un-quit longer than I would have liked.

He's talked about quitting, and of course I know it needs to be in his own time for his own reasons. I've told him to not give me a cigarette no matter how much I ask (especially when drinking). He is considerate in that aspect, but my house smells like tobacco now because he had to light up.

I'm quit I'm quit I'm quit I'm quit I'm quit.

I'M CUSSING QUIT.

I sorta gave in...

So I haven't gained any weight which is a huge deal. Today was a really really emotional day. I couldn't see my therapist last week because I was too distraught. So I saw her today. I went in numb and cried for an hour straight. I don't know about anyone else, but when I cry, I want to smoke. I really really really want to smoke. I got angry at the guy at the shop, in my head I'm thinking *fuck you for selling that shit in here! can't you see i'm feeling vulnerable?! stupid fucking cigarette vendor*. I didn't buy the smokes, of course not, it's 30 days for fucks sake, that would be so cliche or at least super sad. I did however buy a giant bag of Doritos and shove half of them in my gob. I don't know if I feel better or not. It was however the way lesser of two evils! I feel kinda sick.

I am making myself sick with cigs and I feel helpless, weak and slightly insane.

Hey all, 

I can already anticipate some answers, and I feel really stupid even admitting that I am continuing to smoke with how sick it makes me, but hey, thats the beauty of anonymous communities right? Just gotta get some stuff off my chest (hah) that I feel ashamed and embarrassed to admit to friends and family.

I am 27, been smoking for 5 years or so, and it is really effecting my health. I have plenty of friends who smoke but do not seem to experience the negative stuff I am, or to the extent I do. I am also overweight (around 5"11, 280) and while I used to be fit and exercise, I find myself avoiding heavy breathing like the plague (probably because my chest feels on fire when I push myself like I used to). Here is some of the biggest shit that I am experiencing:

- I cough a lot, and to the point of nauseating myself/feeling like I am gonna puke. This one is the biggest things that I am ashamed of, and I often hold in my coughs around my girlfriend or anyone else because of this. I would go so far as to say I 'wretch' rather than cough. When I am alone, with no body to inhibit my natural bodily response, I gag often during these coughing spells, to the point I feel I will throw up. Or I cough to the point that acidic fluid comes back up. And yet, despite all my conscious reasoning, with my brain yelling at me "wtf are you doing! stop killing yourself! Are you mental? You are stronger than this!", I feel myself wanting another cigarette, and I light one up and suck it down.

-I smoke a lot. During a regular day, I smoke 3-4 ciggarettes on the way to work (20-25 minute drive) and smoke a lot at work. It doesn't help that I work with all smokers and it is an hourly routine, but that is no excuse. It averages a pack a day. 

-I have quit before, and recently. I had stopped for 3 months after a particularly bad coughing spell, combined with a stomach illness, left me heaving over the toilet. It seems that a mental block arrived and I found it easy to stop for the time being. Then, after a night of drinking, I wanted to "prove" to myself that I had chosen to quit consciously, and it wasnt just some behaviorist, Pavlovian fluke. Well, here I am now, after starting at "a few a day but in control" to full blow, pack a day bliss. 

-When I am drinking or intoxicated on various substances, I typically chainsmoke. Actually, I am feeling the urge to light one now. But I will abstain, at least until I finish this. It is no problem for me to smoke 15-30 cigarettes over the course of a long, party filled night, and feel terrible the next day, hoarse, sick, and want to spark one up. I look forward to the morning nicotine rush. 

-I haven't been to the doctor or had a physical in well over a year. Which is stupid, considering I live in Canada and can go any time, free of charge. I guess some deep part of me fears being told that I am making myself sick, and that perhaps there is a deeper issue. I am also quite overweight and tbh, in the worst shape I've ever been. Diet is not bad though, lots of organic veggies and healthy good, but I drink a lot of beer, don't exercise, and smoke.

That is most of it. I do want to quit, deep down. But some odd, sadomasochistic side of me whispers "not yet". My cigarette addiction is both appalling and fascinating to me, as I am aware of my triggers, the subtle, subconscious ticks that lead me to feel cravings... I have always felt impulsive and prone to instant gratification in favor of long term, slow release success. At the same time, I don't want to use these as excuses. Sure, both my parents smoked, my mom smoked during pregnancy and well on to my adolescence, but it is futile to blame circumstance. The mind and our will is capable of remarkable things. 

I need to quit, and sooner rather than later. I guess I am writing this to relieve some of that shame of KNOWING and feeling how badly cigs are effecting my health, and feeling weak in the face of quitting. I have tried vaping, gum, candies, etc. But ironically, then I quit recently for 3 months, I required nothing, had no cravings. I had just made up my mind that enough was enough. I suppose I seek that same mental resolve, but am not sure when or where it will come... don't want to wait for some magical inspiration or circumstance that may never come.

I know what many will say, "don't be an idiot, go to the doctor, future you will thank you" or "you need to write down a list of the benefits and negatives to remind yourself, download a stop smoking aid, maybe vape, etc... I listened to Carr's book, twice, I have read plenty about it, tried hypnosis, etc. But that's the thing with smoking, isn't it? There is truly no long term (10+ years) smoker I can think of who is happy that they smoke, or don't realize the damage they do. And yet... we go back, for one more smoke, one more rush, one more 3-5 minute break from whatever task we were working on, one more excuse the stay outside and talk to someone insteresting, as you both break the social ice with a nice smoke.

And here I am, venting on reddit about the horrible health implications and life damaging effects of smoking, and reaching for a pack to light up another....

Mad at myself for starting

Hey all,

This is mostly just to get this off of my chest because there is nobody who knows that I smoke on a regular basis. Everyone in my life who knows that I smoke at all thinks I do it occasionally on a weekend when I happen to be around a smoker and can bum a smoke. I keep it hidden.

I don't smoke much - a couple each day, and sometimes on the weekends I go without it without actually thinking about it. But it is part of my weekday routine, and I'm having such a hard time kicking it. I've been trying nicotine gum, and that helps a bit, but I'm pretty sure that after I drop my kid off at daycare this morning I'm going to run over to the reserve and buy another pack.

This has only been going on for a couple of months and I thought that I could stop easily if I'm only smoking this much, but I guess I fucked up. What a stupid mistake. Who starts smoking in their late 20s?

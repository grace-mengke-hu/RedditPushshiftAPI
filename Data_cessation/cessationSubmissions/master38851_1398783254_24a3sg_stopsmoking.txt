Pretty big milestone yesterday.

The wife and I both quit 3 days ago. We have both smoked for more than 25 years and I smoked 3 packs a day during my worst. She smokes a pack, maybe a little more some days. 


Anyway, We where out dodging tornadoes yesterday in our car for 3 hours with our 14 year old son. One missed our town by less than a mile.  We had no idea when we were going to make it home, or if we even had one to go home to.


Stopped at 4 different gas stations to check the weather before our next move. Wanted cigarettes at each stop but neither of us caved. 

I think we can do this!!

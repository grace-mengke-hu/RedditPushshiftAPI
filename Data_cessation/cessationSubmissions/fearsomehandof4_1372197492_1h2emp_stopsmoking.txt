A Thought for Day 8

I've been staying clean despite it being an incredibly stressful week. I keep having the same thought about my cravings, and I thought I would share it here in case it might help anyone else:

When you feel a craving for a cigarette, don't think about it as a temptation to be resisted, but as a loss to be grieved. Imagine that there are no more cigarettes in the world, that they simply do not exist for you. Yes, you still want them, they have been a part of your life a long time, but treat that desire like you would a pang of loss for a beloved pet or a breakup. You can experience and validate that feeling of want while still recognizing that the object of the desire is never, ever coming back. Then think about your new life and all the positive aspects of being a non-smoker until the wanting subsides.

This works for me at least.

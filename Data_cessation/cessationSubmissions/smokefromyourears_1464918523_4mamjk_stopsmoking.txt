31 Days!!

Hey guys thanks for being there to help me achieve this landmark number. Someone had pointed out that its only a number game. Literally maybe but figuratively - I feel its more a mental issue (although nicotine addiction is a part of the game).
And it has been the constant support of moderators and other redditors that makes a big difference to your mental strength.
Hope to reach many more heights of "non-smoking" days, gong forward!!

Keeping your quit at work

Hello fellow quitters, 

Monday, I'll be back in office again. This time as a non-smoker. I'm a bit scared that I'll fall back as it had happened before at work. Usually, it's a stress situation or just my spine getting weaker and letting the junkie take control (the automatisation of my life). 

I really love being a non-smoker. This peace of mind. Really waking up still and not having to puff 3 cigars before I start to function properly. Not skipping breakfast. My running speed and strength improved after 4 days of not smoking. I made my first 10k and I could sprint and slow down for many times, as a smoker I used to sprint once and stop. And yes, the MONEY! 

My future self is a modern guy, living in the 21st century, enjoying every bit of his life, all in a white hallow (not of smoke, mind you). For whom smoking is a stone-age habit that has killed millions of people. :(

Forgive my random rant and please share your own experience of NOT-smoking at work. How do you handle it?

Gracias

My sob story.

 Used to be fit, played sport, and hated the idea of smoking because of my fathers addiction. Had my first smoke on a night out, while drunk, because it would get me 'feel more drunk'. Woke up feeling guilty as fuck, went for an extra strenuous run. Then it turned into bumming a smoke of friends, and associating smoking with drinking, then the odd smoke between lectures. Always saw myself as a nonsmoker until I went to the doctor, and filled in a survey about smoking. I've been trying to stop for the last couple of months now. I always say, at the end of this pack, I'll stop. So I'm going to try stopping mid way through. I guess we'll see from here.

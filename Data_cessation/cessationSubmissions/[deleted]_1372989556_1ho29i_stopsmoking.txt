Time to quit again been smoking a pack a day for a year and a half.

Here's my story. 

I smoked for ten years quit for five years. And a year and a half ago  my wife brought home three cigs to smoke while we were drinking. I had them and they were disgusting but for some reason the next day I bought a pack. And the rest is history. 

I read Allen Carrs book it was good but I've definitely tried to quit before I was ready, so my confidence is low, but I'm going to do it. No more excuses 

I've told myself I'm going to quit like 1000 times but the next morning I wake up and talk myself into to smoking. I'm sticking to it this time. No more putting it off. 

I've had my last ciggerate. Requesting a badge let's do this shit.

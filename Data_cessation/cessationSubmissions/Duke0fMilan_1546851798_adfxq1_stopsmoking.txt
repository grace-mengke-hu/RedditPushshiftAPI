Relapsed Today: I Need Some Advice

So today was my day six. Over the course of my first six days, I handled the physical aspects of withdrawals pretty well. My problem was depression. Quitting cigarettes made me depressed like I have never felt in my life. Tonight, I just couldn't take it anymore. Any advice on how to deal with the depression that comes along with nicotine withdrawals?

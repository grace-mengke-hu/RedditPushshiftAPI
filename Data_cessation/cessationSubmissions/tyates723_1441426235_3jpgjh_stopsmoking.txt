14 days in. Drinking at the bar

It has been pretty smooth sailing until tonight, sitting between two smokers on the patio at a bar I'm four drinks in at for my gfs brothers birthday and she is driving me insane texting me from home about how much she hates me. Still not smoking though
. Just needed to rant in order to keep from bumming one from a Friend

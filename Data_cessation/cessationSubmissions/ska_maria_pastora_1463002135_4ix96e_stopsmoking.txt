Been non-smoker for two years after 16 years of smoking. Then relapsed for a year. Now a week smoke-free.

Tobacco smoking is the craziest addiction I ever encountered. I have been able to quit hard drugs (meth) without that much hardship, but smoking is the most addictive thing I know.

Strange thing is how I relapsed - I have been in treatment for mental illness for years. After being smoke-free for 2 years, I couldn't sleep and took Ambien (Zolpidem) which was prescribed for me.

It's almost unbelievable how strong of a craving Ambien can create. Much stronger than alcohol. I actually went out of a hotel in mid-dream state, found an open tobacco shop at night, bought cigarettes.

Then gradually began to smoke more and more, until I smoked almost every day.

Let's hope it will be better this time.

I think I have made it past the threshold.

So I have noticed it is popular for people on this subreddit to post success stories of avoiding cigarettes while drinking, which is the often perilous choice a quitting smoker must deal with. So I will just tell you my story because I am proud of my choice and I think I can stick with it. I have been smoking for about 4 years since high school. At college it was hard to quit because most everyone refers to my school as a "smoking campus" with ashtrays outside of every exit. It has been an on and off thing. Bumming here, buying there, weeks of not smoking, etc. So I go a successful 5 weeks in the absence of a smoker girlfriend who is abroad and eventually she returns and I take it up again (hopefully my badge updates properly). She has left and I was back on the habit and only stopped about a week ago due to a respiratory illness which felt like shit so I thought this would be a great opportunity to quit. I have been feeling much better and went out drinking and was offered multiple cigarettes, around smokers, and held out strong refusing every one. Not even a drag. I know it's only been a week but I feel I can really stick with it this time, even when she does get back. Thanks for listening, Reddit. I'll definitely be around for support in the coming weeks.

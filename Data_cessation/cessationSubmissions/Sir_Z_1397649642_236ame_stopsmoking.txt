E-cig or Cold Turkey?

Couldn't help but wonder how you guys are going about the quitting process.

I've been going the cold turkey route with great success so far, basically all cravings are gone and I don't feel like a slave to cigarettes anymore. But alot of people I know have been successful using E-Cigs

Which method are you guys/gals taking and why?

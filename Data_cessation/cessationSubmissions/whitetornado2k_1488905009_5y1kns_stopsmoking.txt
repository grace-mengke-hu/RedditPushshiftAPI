6 months nicotine free, today!

Hello everyone,

Today is my 6 month anniversary of becoming nicotine free. No smokes, no chew, no gums, no patches, no pills. I couldn't be more proud of myself, and I feel 100x better. 
To everyone thinking about quitting or just getting started, trust me when I say, you won't regret it. Stick to it! You can do it!!

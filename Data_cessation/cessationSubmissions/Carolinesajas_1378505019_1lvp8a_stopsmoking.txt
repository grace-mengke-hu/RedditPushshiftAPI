It makes me feel sad

I'm day 5! I never really tried to quit but I'm planning a trip to Los Angeles (quite expensive) and decided to pay my trip by quitting !!

I find it easier than I though but still trick(you never know when you will want one and whether you will be able to fight it)
On my side I stopped everything from the first (no alcohol, no cigarets, and diet) I feel that if I stop one it'll give me an excuse to stop all of it , do its a good motivation.

Finally I read a post Bout going out, I went out (no alcohol) with a friend and experienced a massive craving. I asked her to smoke her cigaret normally and seeing her smoking made me realise I didn't want to do it anymore!!

Good luck everyone. We can make it!!!

We're gonna be rich :)

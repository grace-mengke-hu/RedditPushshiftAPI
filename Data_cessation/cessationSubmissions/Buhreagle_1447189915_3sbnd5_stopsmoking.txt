Early twenties, smoked since I was 16. 13 days smoke free, but its not getting better.

I've tried the vape, but I really don't like it. its kind of gross to me, and not really fulfilling my cravings. Plus I feel like I smoke the thing habitually. It almost seems like smoking since I was a kid has caused it to integrate itself with me on a primal level since I basically grew up smoking.
Shits rough man.

edit: Thanks for all the support and shared experiences you guys it really means a lot. The general consensus is to just ditch the vape and tough it out so I guess that's what I'll do. Ill be sure to come back to this thread whenever I'm fitting.
 
Good luck to all of you!

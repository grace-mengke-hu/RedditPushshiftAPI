27 days, 2nd day without patches

wow. it's been a long time since i made it this far (years), though I've basically never quit trying or planning my next quit attempt.

the last couple of days have *really* sucked, i've basically had my jaw clenched since waking up the morning after taking off the last patch, but... the weekend's here now, and my wife will be with me all weekend to encourage me, so I've got the weekend beat. after that it's just more of the same; rinse and repeat for victory.

i owe someone on here a thank you for sharing the thought that's kept me going. i can't remember the phrasing or who said it, but it's been very helpful in bolstering my willpower when i'm struggling: "if you give up now, you're just going to have to do this all over again." 

thanks, stranger. thank you all.

Do urges ever go away?

I'm at day 22 without vaping. I smoked for 6 years and Vaped for the last two. I know I'm technically not a smoker anymore but I used vaping to quit. Anyway, being 3 weeks in I feel myself becoming more normal and less moody, however I do get really stressed out and especially at night I still feel like vaping. I have 0 mgs of nicotine in my tank and if I feel really overwhelmed at night or need the nostalgia I'll go outside a take a few puffs, I feel like it's harmless as long as there's no nicotine and the placebo really eases me. But I'm wondering if this might delay the psychological addiction?

Day 5

I’ve been smoking from age 16-28, have “quit” numerous times, longest time was about 2 years ago for about 6 months. 

My biggest trigger is driving, which I can’t avoid because of work, so that kind of sucks but so far the physical cravings are just annoying &amp; I know I can get through them. 

This time around I am SO SLEEPY. I don’t remember being this sleepy any other time I quit. I fall asleep fine but my nights are spent tossing &amp; turning in between bouts of nightmares, I’ve also been having hot flashes at night too. Somehow I think even if I slept okay through the night, I’d still be this sleepy. It’s so intense. I’m also kind of nauseous this time too.

Anyone else going through this?

Started young, i dread a future in which i'll still be smoking

I started when i was 14 years old. Now i'm 24 and i can't stand to be a slave to this crap anymore. Today i quit. It's a really stupid and dangerous habit that is ruining my look, body and mind.

This is my first thread on reddit after years of reading stuff as a guest. I posted this because it makes me feel like i've sealed a pact, a promise, with everyone who reads it. If i fail i will feel ashamed. I want to prove myself and others that quitting can be done. If i fail i will feel weak because i will actively choose to be less than what i can achieve after i expressed a need to change, thus fooling myself and you readers. 

I'll make another thread in a week. 7th of August. I'll let you know how it goes.

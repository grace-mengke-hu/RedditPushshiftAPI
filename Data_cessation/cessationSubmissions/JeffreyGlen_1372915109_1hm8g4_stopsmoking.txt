I've been smoking two packs a day for 10 years...

I don't know what happened. I have tried to quit in the past, but I could never break the 24 hour mark. I went to bed on Sunday with no cigarettes left. When I woke up, I thought, I'll go later, I don't need on right now. Well, I didn't even realize (I had been super busy on Monday) that by the time I was done eating dinner, I never had gone to get those cigarettes. My son had a long day as well, and was already in bed. I told myself, I bet you I can cheat and go to bed now, and wake up and finally break that 24 hour mark. Well, I'll tell you what... I might have thought I was "cheating" by sleeping, but I've finally done it. I'm on my third day without any nicotine at all. I'm drinking lots and lots of water. Today really, really sucked. I'm just going to take this one craving at a time.

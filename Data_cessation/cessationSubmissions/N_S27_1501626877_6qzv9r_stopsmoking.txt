Arggghh :(

To cut a long story short, i have tried everything to quit smoking before going to the Dr's to get prescribed some Champix.

Now, i am over 2 thirds of the way through the course and was amazed by how well they have worked for me. Barely any side effects no craving & havent bought anything to smoke. Back to side effects, the main one i have been getting is HD dreams that seem to last for ever but are somewhat, "life like"  & "real". 

However, today has been a huge struggle and i feel a high need to smoke! But, i don't understand why. It feels like i quit smoking 4 hours ago cold turkey. I have also noticed that days feel blurry while doing things i don't really care about. Like work, my day goes so fast because im "tuned out". (Which i guess is a great thing really).

Has anyone else been in the same boat this far into their course? 
If so, what did you do to get around it? 

I was thinking about vapeing 0mg, natural liquids but don't want to become dependent on it! :( but im also scared to relapse when my medication stops!

Thanks for any advice or info in advance :) 

 AAARRGGHHHH

Need some help...

So, I've been smoking since I was 14 and now I'm 22. Last year I decided it was too damn much because I was smoking up to two packs a day, so I started to lower how many cigarets I had and now I'm smoking exactly three a day. I want to stop but if I go without smoking a day I get horrible headaches and anxiety. I started running daily when I got to half a pack a day and it has really helped me, but I still can't quit. Any tips?

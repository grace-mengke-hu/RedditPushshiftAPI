Day 1 for me.. Do I get a cool flair?

I'm feeling good about the whole thing, been building up to this day for the past 2 weeks (been on the champix) I'm only 18 and been smoking for around 3 years, though I was a pretty heavy smoker. I've actually been lurking here for a while and you all seem very friendly and encouraging!

Wish me luck :)

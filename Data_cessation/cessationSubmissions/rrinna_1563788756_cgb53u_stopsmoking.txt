What's the point?

Hi! 

During a weekend my friends and I were discussing whether we should go for a beer in the late evening. In the end we didn't go, but my first automatic thought was: what's the point if I can't have a cigarette with it?

I know that if I had a cigarette, it wouldn't even taste good and I don't even physically crave it. And if I had that beer, I would enjoy it the same without smoking and would be proud of myself afterwards.

It's just this mental struggle, the feeling that without smoking, I can't enjoy it as much. How do you deal with such thoughts?

I wish good luck to all of you! :)

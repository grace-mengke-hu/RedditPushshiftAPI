This is my 4th attempt. Wish me luck

Hello everyone,

I'm 27 years old and had been smoking for about 11 years.

Yes, I'm quitting for the 4th time. Last time I quit I lasted about 40 days or so before surrendering to the poison.

Well, I'm paying the price now. Apparently, smoking had affected my fertility since a considerable amount of the sperm is abnormal now.

I was stupid enough to keep on smoking knowing all the effects. My wife quit easily 2 years ago while I kept doing it.

Bottom line, if I'm not gonna succeed this time I might have to say goodbye to my offspring along with a healthy life.

Please wish me the best.

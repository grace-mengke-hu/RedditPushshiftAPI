5 days in, never going back!

I just quit cold turkey on June 5th after finishing the EasyWay book.  Smoked a pack and a half a day since 1994.  I keep trying to remind myself of all the positive things I'm getting out of life now.  I never decided to be a 'smoker', but I'm deciding to be a non-smoker.  Stay encouraged, fellow quitters!  WE CAN DO IT!!!!!

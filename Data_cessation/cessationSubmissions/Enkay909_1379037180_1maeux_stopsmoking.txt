I quit ciggs 3 weeks ago, but nicotine 2 days ago, i have some questions.....

so as the title says i switched from ciggs to vaping all in one shot, i started at 12mg nic, then went to 6mg pretty quick, now im 2nd day going on my 3rd tonight, with 0 nic, im kind of going through it pretty bad mentally, i keep having urges, i don't know what to do with my hands and such, even though i am vaping 0 nic, so i received the audio book from Allan carr, my question is will his book help me even though i already quit ciggs 3 weeks ago, does it help you with the withdraws, mentally and such, and any tips for something to do when i do get the urge? i have 6mg of nicotine juice just in case, so at least i don't go back to ciggs, thx for the help and time.... and sorry for the grammar, im typing this on my phone.

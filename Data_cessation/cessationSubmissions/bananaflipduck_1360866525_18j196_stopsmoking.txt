Am I the only one that found it easy to quit because of social stigma? 

Hey guys, so this might be a little controversial but I felt compelled to bring this up anyways. Presumably, it doesn't make any sense for someone who can quit easily to even go to this subreddit, but I'm just wondering if there's anyone out there like me who can quit smoking thanks to the social stigma? 

I've smoked for 4 years, and in all those 4 years I've always smoked 3-5 a day, sometimes less. It's never progressed to a pack a day, not even half a pack. It's always made me wonder if I was even addicted in the first place, but even I suffered strong cravings if I didn't smoke for 12+ hours. After thinking about it, I think the reason I didn't smoke much (and thus was able to quit a lot easier) was because I was afraid of what people thought of me for smoking. There's no denying it from my part; if I felt certain friends/people would judge me for smoking, I'd either wait until they were gone or until I went back home. It's always been like this. It makes me self-conscious, yes, but in a way I'm kinda glad I am since it helped me quit smoking. 

Anyone else like this?

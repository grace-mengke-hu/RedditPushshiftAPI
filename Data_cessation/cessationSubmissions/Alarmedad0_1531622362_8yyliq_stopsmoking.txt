I created a discord support server to use online!

Hello,

I created a supportive online discord server for people who struggle with any sort of mental health issues, body image issues or anyone who just wants a safe space to hang out!

We have around 700 members and would love to welcome you! We offer:

· Game nights

· Semi-active voice chat and TWO music bots

· Sweet emojis to use with your nitro or without

· Awesome people to talk to

· Wonderful, LGBT friendly staff

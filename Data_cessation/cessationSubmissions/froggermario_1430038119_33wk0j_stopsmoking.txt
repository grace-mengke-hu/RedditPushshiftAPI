Into the belly of the beast

Quit smoking 4 days ago and have been doing really well. Using the lozenges and avoiding triggers. Tonight I had to play a show (I'm in a little band) at a place where I would normally occupy to patio and chain smoke. It was really difficult and I really fantasized about how great one last cigarette would be... But thanks to my awesome husband, we left to a more nonsmoking place. Whoosh! It's so hard but I know it's worth it. I don't have to smoke to be the cool girl in the band, right?

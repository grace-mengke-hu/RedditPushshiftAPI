Well I made it an entire February!

this is the longest I've gone without a cigarette in 12 years. I'm so proud of myself. My friends still don't believe I'll stick with it, which is honestly kind of discouraging, but I am trying not to let that influence me. I will succeed because I want to. not for them, but for me.

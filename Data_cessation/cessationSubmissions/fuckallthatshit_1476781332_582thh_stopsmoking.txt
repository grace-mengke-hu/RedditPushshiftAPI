One entire fucking year!!!! Never going back!

This week marks my one year anniversary of being cigarette free and I can't remember ever feeling this good! I smoked for almost 20 years, and grew up with a Mom who smoked through my childhood until she quit in my early teen years, and several family members who smoked until it put them in their graves. I strongly encourage anyone who is thinking of giving it up, to do it now. If that means you go cold turkey, use the patch, gum, hypnosis, vaping, Voodoo, or anything else, it is absolutely worth doing. It is pretty much the best thing you can do for yourself and your loved ones. We can't change the past, but we can make improvements on our futures, and you can do it too!

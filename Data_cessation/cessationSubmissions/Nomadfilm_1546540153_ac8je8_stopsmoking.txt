I just realised i've been a smoker for 10 years ! :(

Been smoking since late 2009 , its 2019 and 10 years since ive started . Im 27 now . I smoke 1 cigarette a day and around 7-9 twice a week while drinking .  The maximum i've gone on without smoking is 12 days . It is only now that i've realised i need to quit before it gets too late . Im already worried i would've caused damage to my lungs !  My last smoke currently was on the morning of Jan 1st . Its 4 th Jan now and im happy to say i've been smoke free so far ! I hope i can keep this up

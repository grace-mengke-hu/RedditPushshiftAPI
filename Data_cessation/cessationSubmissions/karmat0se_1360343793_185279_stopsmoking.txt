THREE SIX FIVE! I got my smiley face!

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone in this subreddit for being encouraging to each other and being super helpful in my early days quitting. Really helped mentally to think that if I did start smoking I'd have to reset my badge and I'd be letting lots of people (who I don't even really know) down.

Anyway, as a former 10 year, pack a day smoker and now one year quitter; If I can do it, you can too. 

Thanks again /r/stopsmoking

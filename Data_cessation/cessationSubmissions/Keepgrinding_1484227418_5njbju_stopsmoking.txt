2 major reasons for relapse

1.sadness
2.anger

Yeah its about emotions. Cigarettes numbed a few of my rough edges. They made me more passive when I should have reacted. We have all done it. Just going outside instead of facing the whole thing. 

Cry, beat up a pillow. Get it out of your system. But don't light up. We are in this together.

Good luck out there.

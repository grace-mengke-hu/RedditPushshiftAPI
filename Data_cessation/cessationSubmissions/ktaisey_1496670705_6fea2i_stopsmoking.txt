Day 1 - My smoking story

I am 37 - soon to be 38.  Smoked a little less than a pack a day for around 10 yrs or so from 16-26 and then quit for a couple years solid when my GF told me that I stunk when getting into bed on night.

My mistake was that about 5 yrs ago I began to smoke when I would drink heavily - which turned into smoking while on vacation - which turned in to smoking every weekend - until recently weekends became Thursday though Sunday with the occasional one or two Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.    I convinced myself for a while that I was still mostly a "non-smoker"  so it was OK but at this point I just am over it and ready to be done for good. 

I read Allen Carr's book - and (even though it is somewhat frowned upon here) some NRT Gum.   I am tired of "wearing tight shoes just for the satisfaction of taking them off"

It might seem odd, but I really can go 3 days without a smoke and not "crave" them.  My worry isn't for days 1-4.  Day 5, 6 and 7 will be my enemy.  

Anyways, lurker for a while here and thought I would say hello.   =)

Introduction: Back on Day 1

I'm 25, been smoking since I was 19/20. So not terribly long. But this nicotine train has got me hard. Worst drug I've ever used regarding addiction. 

I quit for 4 months back in 2014 and 4 months earlier this year. Used to smoke 1-2 packs a day. Now I smoke 1-2 packs a week. 

I've tried gum, lozenges, and vaping. But my only successful amount of time without tobacco was when I was exercising and quit cold Turkey. 

So here I am. Back on day one. Quiting cold Turkey. Staying away from everything with nicotine. Hoping it sticks this time.

Blowing bubbles is helping me!

I'm an ex-smoker of 5 days!! Yay!

I've taken to blowing bubbles to replace the negative part. I leave my environment and take out my handy Mr Bubbles bottle, take a deep breath, put the wand to my mouth, and blow. I then imagine my stress floating away in the bubbles (which is mesmerizing in itself) and feel oddly victorious when they pop. 

I'm going to win this battle!! Fuck you cigarettes.

Ugh

So I have almost made it 24 hours and I am freaking the fuck out. To add insult to injury my car just got towed and I can't get it back until I can pull money out of my ass that I don't have. I just freaked out at my girlfriend for no reason and the only thing I can do without wanting a cigarette is sleep. I have smoked a pack+ a day of Marlboro reds for about 10 years now and I can't imagine how this feeling will ever subside enough for me to be normal again. I am more stressed depressed and just generally angry than I have ever been. FUCKKKKKKKKKKKK. Sorry had to vent.

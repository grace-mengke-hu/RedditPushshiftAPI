Day 7 and wondering if I made a mistake

Today is my day 7 and I am very proud of myself. I am finding that my worst craving now is missing that feeling of smoke on my throat so I had a couple puffs of my vape. I feel like I will do this every once and awhile. Am I still moving forward or am I taking two steps back by vaping?

I'm doing it!

After 23 years of on and off smoking I've finally committed 100% to this phenomenal life style change. 2 weeks in so far and using Chantix this time to help. It's working wonders for me,  first couple days the cravings were there but bearable.  Day three,  no cravings and none to present. Using smoke free app and one of the missions was to come to this website and share my progress. The app has helped as well,  also I use the Chantix website to record my progress and read up on helpful tips and creative tools to help in my journey. Good luck to everyone that has chosen to take control of their health.

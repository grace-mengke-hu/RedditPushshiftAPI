Almost two years

It has been almost two years since I have quit smoking after being addicted to it for ten years. I thought I could never stop. I tried multiple attempts to quit. Failed, sometimes on the third day sometimes after three months. It took me a year to finally get my act together. I joined various support groups, constantly got pushed by my mother. It seemed to be so hard but now looking back I just think if you have a strong desire to quit you will. Smoking is a cage and freedom from it is a blessing. Once you are free you will never like to be in that same place again.

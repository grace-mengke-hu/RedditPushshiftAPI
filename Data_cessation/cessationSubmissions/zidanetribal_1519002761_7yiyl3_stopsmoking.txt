Stopped smoking a year ago. Cravings went away after 6 months or so. Today I am having the worst craving ever since I quit, what gives? Does this happen to anyone else? Any suggestions please.

Anything to help will be great. I've never felt this bad before and it's been since December of 2016.  Not sure why I'm getting such a bad craving all of the sudden.

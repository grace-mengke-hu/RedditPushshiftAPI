cigarettes and weed

hi. I'm now on day 19 of quitting after smoking 20+ cigarettes for the last 20 years.  I have quit a few times before but never went past 30 and 60 days.

Being away at work makes it easier since I'm on a boat but in 11 days I will be home for 15 days.  I'm already afraid of having beers because the urge will hit again. and I smoke alot of weed also when I am home..  should I try to give it up also? 

looking for feedback from someone who has quit cigarettes but not the marijuana...     

it seems like I always needed a cigarette after a puff. feels good just to type this out

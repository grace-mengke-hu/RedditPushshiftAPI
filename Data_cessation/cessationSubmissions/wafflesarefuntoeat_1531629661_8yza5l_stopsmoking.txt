I finally made it a full day!

I've commented and posted about quitting off and on this year but I've finally made it well past the 24hr mark. Technically it's been 37 hours and I feel great! I feel like I'm cheating because I did purchase a juul but this is how I've made it this far. I plan on tappering off my use of that over the next 2 weeks. I'm so happy though!

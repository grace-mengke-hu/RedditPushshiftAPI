New here, almost 10 years now

Been smoking since I was 15. Ive been working out and getting healthy. Ive quit before. My husband and I enjoy chain smoking while we sit and talk. He's not trying to quit but im ready. Any advice or tips welcome, or group navigation for such things.

Also have a high stress job in a leadership position, i love smoking as soon as I get off, almost exactly like getting off a long day and grabbing food. Smoke late at night too. Its pretty much wrapped in our lives atm

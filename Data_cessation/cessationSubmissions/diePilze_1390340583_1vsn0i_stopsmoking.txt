Relapse

I was nicotine free for almost three years.  
I was really stressed out during exams last month and started smoking again.  Its now become a compulsion or an addiction again and I need to stop it.  
Any tips for someone that is relapsing? 
I'll check back here after I'm done coughing up a lung.

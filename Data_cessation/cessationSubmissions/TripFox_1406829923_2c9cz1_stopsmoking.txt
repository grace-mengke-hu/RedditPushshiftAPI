I thought it had been around a year!

10 year smoker quit cold turkey apparently 366 days ago.  No e-cig, no patch, no pharmas, no gum, no book.  Not too bad.  Still dream about smoking at times, but I still have smoker friends and still go out and drink and don't smoke.

Wasn't easy - but it's easy now.  It's nice waking up and not wheezing - and it's nice to get sick and not smoke.

Just quit ok?  Quit planning it and just do it.  Bullying yourself helped me.

50 Days.

Hi everyone, 

Just wanted to make a post acknowledging my 50 day milestone. It's been a ride these first 50 days and I'm looking forward to many more cough free, healthy days. To anybody on the fence thinking about quitting, I'll say that this hasn't been always easy, but it certainly has been worth it.

Coughing at 29 days

Hi every one, I moved from smoking cigarettes to a vape 29 days ago. Initially I felt good could breath better was not coughing as much, this was until a few days ago. 
I've got both a tickly cough and a deep chesty cough I've never before brought up any crap that is this thick and sticky. Is this late onset "Quitters Flu" and my lungs are cleaning themselves? 
Is it normal for it occur this long after quitting? If it is how long will it last?

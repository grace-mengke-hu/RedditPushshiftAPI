Night out with old friends?

I'm on day 22 now, its not been too bad, but I'm back home for the holidays and going on a night out with friends on Thursday. They all smoke, and I've always been more of a social smoker. I'm already making excuses and having a back on forth with myself whether I can have any, and I can already imagine myself just being like 'fuck it' and having one when I get drunk enough. (I felt the same at a party about a week in, but I couldn't find anyone who smoked otherwise I would have done). I feel like rather than avoiding it its a trigger I have to face, If I made it through a night drinking I think I could manage it in the future, any tips?

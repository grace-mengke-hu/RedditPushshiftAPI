Not really smoking related, but I FINALLY got a job!

Hey guys! 

So I reached a month smoke free a few days ago. Massive achievement. 

I also got a bloody job! After 2 years not working, someone has taken a chance on me! It’s only an Xmas causal position, but a great stepping stone, even at my age (26) and will give me a current reference. 

I’m so excited to start next month! 

They say it comes in 3s, so, what’s number 3 going to be?

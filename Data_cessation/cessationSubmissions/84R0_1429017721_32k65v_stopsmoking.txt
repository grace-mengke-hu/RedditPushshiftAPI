Tooth infection made dip revolting

I had an infected wisdom tooth for about 2 weeks before having it extracted yesterday. When it started, it came along with headache and nausea. Any time I used dip, the nausea/headache would worsen 10x. I couldn't handle it anymore, and just stopped overnight 6 days ago. I think there is some kind of taste aversion going on. I don't have cravings, and the thought of it makes me nauseous. Thankfully my infection and fever also masked any bits of withdrawal symptoms. 

I highly recommend quitting during a health crisis. Has this happened to anybody else?

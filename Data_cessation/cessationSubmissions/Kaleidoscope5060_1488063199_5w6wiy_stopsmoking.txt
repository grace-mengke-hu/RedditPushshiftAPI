How long does the zombie-ness last?

I just passed the 24 hour mark. I did pretty well, even when I dropped my keys into the chasm between the steps and the foundation of the house, but now I'm sitting here like a zombie, staring, unable to move. I'm sure I can move, but can't figure out what to do. Any tips for helping with focus?

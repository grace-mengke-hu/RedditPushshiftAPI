i miss it

Hi, so first of all, even tough i dont post much i'd like to thank many of you for doing so cuz it really helped especially in the beginning. 
Dont really know why i am posting this but i guess i just want to vent. I dont know if its the finals approaching or life in general getting to me lately but i really really miss smoking. And everyday i have a few moments where i am just so fucking close to bumming a cig from a stranger of just flat out buying a pack. 
And i know i'm gonna hate the taste. And i know that i worked so damn hard to get to point where i dont have to fear a longer than 20 minute bus trip, but still...i find myself thinking about it more and more. Sorry for the rambling.

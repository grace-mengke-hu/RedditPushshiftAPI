Has anyone experienced developing cysts as a result of smoking?

I'm a casting researcher for a new dermatology series in the UK commissioned by the discovery network. We're looking for people with various skin conditions, particularly cysts and spots, to take part in the programme and be seen by our award winning Harley street dermatologist.

Successful applicants would receive FREE consultation, treatment, travel and accommodation for the duration of filming. If this sounds like something you may be interested in, please get in touch by emailing [skin@fullfattv.co.uk](mailto:skin@fullfattv.co.uk) or via whatsapp - 07526238856

Hopefully this would be a great opportunity for someone struggling to access help through the NHS !

Since I quit, I have regained my long lost superhuman abilities...

I can run 6k in 35min and still be breathing.  I could hardly run half a km when I smoked. 

I can do minor strenuous tasks without sweating excessively which happened a lot when I smoked. 

I can smell the different flowers blossoming in the garden, someone's perfume from across the room, or be forewarned of damp and badly washed linen through their musty odours.  I can smell how bad I used to smell by smelling other smokers. 

I can determine most of the ingredients in food, just with my taste. 

My focus and self awareness ability have heightened.  Smoking just dulled and numbed me

I can slow down time. Twice or thrice of stuff gets done now than when I smoked. 

Who am I?   I'm the Smokeless Man.

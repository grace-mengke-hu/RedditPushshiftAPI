Got a flu on friday...

... and stayed in bed all weekend, usually when i get a cold i don't smoke, because honestly i don't miss it, Monday morning i was feeling better and i thought to myself "3 days without a cigar, let's stop!".

But today was though, i drank a coffee and a girl i just met pulled a cigar, the hard part was the flavour of the coffee and the crave was getting difficult, but i laughed and tried do distract myself with another thing.

The reason i decided to quit and i believe it helps to have a reason, is that i have a 15 month daughter, and i will be 30 in august, so i said to myself it would be great to stop before i am 30, and increase my lifespan to see my daughter grow up with me healthy by her side...

This is my first attempt to stop smoking, but i believe it will be my first and only!

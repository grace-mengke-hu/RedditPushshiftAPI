First really hard time in a while

I'm 17 days in and things have been pretty good once I got through the first 4 or 5 days. Now I'm freaking out and wanting a cigarette like whoa. I'm in law school and I have my first exam tomorrow and I just feel like one cigarette will help me relax even though I know its not going to do anything.

This sucks.

EDIT: I went to my exam and as I was leaving, one of my classmates pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. He must have noticed me looking at the pack because he offered me one. For a fraction of a second I almost said yes but then I said no. The cravings lasted for another 5 seconds and then subsided entirely. I'm feeling good!

Anyone with sinus issues notice a huge difference after quitting?

I have had terrible sinus issues for the past couple years. I know smoking makes them worse. I've had bronchitis at least 3 times in the past year. Anyone who also had these issues while smoking- what differences have you noticed since quitting? I haven't smoked for 10 days, which kind of happened accidentally because I came down with bronchitis and was scared to smoke. I felt like I couldn't breathe for a week and knew smoking would be terrible. So now I'm just in the mindset of why not just quit because I'm sick of feeling like I can't breathe.

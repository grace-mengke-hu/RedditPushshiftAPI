2 Weeks and improving my runs!!

I've made it two weeks and feel great!  I went for a run yesterday evening and made it the farthest I can ever remember running without having to stop to breath!  Granted it was only about 3/4 of a mile, but I was impressed with myself!  The whole run was a little over 2 miles!

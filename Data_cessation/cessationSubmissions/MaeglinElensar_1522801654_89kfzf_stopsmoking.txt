Crossed the one month barrier a few days ago!

Happy to report that cravings have all but vanished entirely. I can now drive, go out for a beer and make it through work without it. One of the best decisions I've ever made, really.

The only thing I've noticed is that I still get cravings in larger social scenarios. That might be a by product of my growing aversion to people as I get older though. My friends think it's just an adjustment to not having the escape option anymore, which is causing me a bit of anxiety in the process.

All in all, however, it's been mostly good.

The trap

I've quit a few times before, and it's never been easy to do that. The time was never right, and it always required some kind of sacrifice to be able to quit. But it's so worth it. Nevertheless, I came back to smoking each time so far. I want this one to be different. I need to be free, otherwise it will keep dragging me down, ever hindering my chances to make my life better.

Remember this. Come back here and read this again. You are still fresh into freedom and the struggle is still vivid in your memory, but memory is a tricky thing. We are built to forget bad experiences, because it's the only way to be sane. You must not forget this one though. As you get healthier and healthier, you may lose memory of what it was like to be a smoker. 

You might get tempted to have that one while out in a bar with friends. Don't. Don't start it again, because you need your resolve more than ever. If you want to make positive changes to your life, taking steps back will cost you time and effort, that you might otherwise use for something better. You might get angry, depressed, you might want to celebrate, there might be woe, joy, elation, sadness, all those emotions you associate with having a smoke. No need. Break this circle. Don't fall into the same trap again. Prove you are better than that.

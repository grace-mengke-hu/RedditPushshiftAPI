Stopped smoking 6 days ago using Alan Carr’s Easy Way. I’m EXHAUSTED!

Things are going pretty well, all in all, but I can’t slow down! I used cigarettes as a way to reward the end of a task before starting something else. I know that reward is bullshit, but I’m exhausted. Everytime I change my focus, a craving hits, so I keep going to distract myself. I’m am so tired, so tired. I don’t know how to deal with this. Ack!!

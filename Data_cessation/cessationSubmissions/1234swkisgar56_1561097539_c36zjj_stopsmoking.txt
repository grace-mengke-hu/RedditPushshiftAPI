Not quite down to zero but down to 2 cigs a day from chain vaping 35mg all day

Its going to much smoother than I ever expected. I think I'll be down to one ciggarette a day by next Sunday. Before I couldn't go 2 hours without vaping now I'm going 20+ hours without ciggarettes.

It makes me happy knowing I'll be completely off ciggarettes very soon.

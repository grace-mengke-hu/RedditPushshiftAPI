How I quit (maybe it'll help you if you struggle with finding a reason)

How do you quit when you're not afraid of cancer?  I'm not. Sorry, everyone, there's no positive way to say this. I am 100% convinced that I am genetically doomed to die of cancer. Every person on both sides of my family in several generations that I know of has died of cancer. With each family case of cancer, a person's chances go up. Since so many people in my family have died of cancer, I can find some creative ways to math it out to a 98% chance that I will develop cancer.

There. The unpleasant part is out of the way. Sorry for that.

So how did I quit when I'm not afraid of cancer? When I've accepted that cancer will get me, so why bother avoiding it with healthy stuff?

Easy.

I want to be able to breathe in 30 years. I've seen COPY and emphysema. I've cared for someone with it. 

It scares the shit out of me. 

Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, guys and gals, nice people and pricks, all of you, every single one of you - find your reason to quit. 

I had so much trouble finding a reason to quit. I'm stoic, I'm single, I have no kids, I don't find the normal attachments that most people do. I'm not inwardly motivated. I'm introspective and introverted and unattached. I have a handful of close friends and a ton of positive acquaintanceship type relationships with people. But... I don't have anyone to live for. No one *needs* me. I'm sure I'm nice to have around for some people, but would their world stop turning without me in it? Nope.

But I like hiking. I can't hike if I can't breathe. So that's how I quit.

Are you like me? If so, maybe you just found your reason, your way. 

Thanks for reading. I hope this helps anyone struggling with quitting if they're kinda sorta like me.

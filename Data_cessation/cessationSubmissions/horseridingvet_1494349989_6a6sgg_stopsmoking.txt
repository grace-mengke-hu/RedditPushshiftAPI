I had to start over but I never gave up.

As I'm writing this, it's been twelve hours since my last smoke. I managed to go to lunch and not buy any but now I'm having a major craving since I'm done eating. EVERY thought is being filled with smoking. I'm putting this here in an attempt to press on and not give in again. I want to quit so bad but I keep failing. Not this time. This time I will do it. I don't need to smoke. I'm putting my life at risk every time I light up. I enjoy living and smoking only brings me down. Maybe my post will help someone else find the courage to carry on as well. All of us here struggled and we all know how it feels.

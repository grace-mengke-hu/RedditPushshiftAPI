62 days and counting

i quit on november 1st using the patch method. i finished the patches a few days ago. I actually stopped stage 3 a little earlier because i felt that the 7mg patches were giving me worse cravings than just not using them. i managed to make it through new years without smoking. It feels good to not be dependent on nicotine anymore.
Hopefully we'll see how well i fare with zero nicotine now

Don't smoke

For anyone considering quitting their quit... I just smoked after 4 months without a single cigarettes. It's disgusting and tastes horrible and burns like a bitch. I don't feel anymore relaxed and I know that that's it now I'm back despite it tasting horrible. Don't do it. If you wanna smoke just literally don't because it's shit. Good luck

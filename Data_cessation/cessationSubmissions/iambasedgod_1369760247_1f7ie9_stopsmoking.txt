Cigars?

I went to Vegas last weekend and I had absolutely no urge to smoke a cigarette - which I believe to be quite an accomplishment seeing as I was fairly inebriated and people smoke indoors. I did, however, purchase a cigar for celebratory purposes. I have not had a bad craving since and I don't really feel I cheated myself because you don't really inhale a cigar. My question is: is it kosher to have "quit smoking," but have an occasional cigar (maybe 3 or 4 a year)?

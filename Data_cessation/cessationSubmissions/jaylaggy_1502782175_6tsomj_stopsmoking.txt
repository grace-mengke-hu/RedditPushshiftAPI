Figured today is the day to stop smoking

I've been smoking for 20 years about a pack every 2 days. Like most smokers I've been telling myself I'll quit eventually today I am going to. 

I've never said out loud I was going to quit to anyone. My wife quit smoking when she got pregnant and my oldest kid, now a teen, knows I smoke. I've been hiding it from her for 13 years. 

I figured if I said it out loud and didn't do it I'd be like all the others out there who failed at quitting.

This seems like a safe place to say it to others and if I fail at this, you'll never know.

I smoked my last cigarette tonight and I am planning to wake up tomorrow and not stop by a store to buy another pack on my way to work. I'm not telling anyone I know I'm doing this on the off chance it doesn't work. 

My wife is leaving to Portland in 2 days and she won't be back till Saturday, my goal is to not smoke and tell her I haven't smoked since today and hopefully to continue to not smoke. 

Here I go!

6 weeks today!

And it really was not that hard. I have had absolutely no desire to smoke at all. I quit drinking Diet Mt Dew the same day I quit smoking. We were at the grocery store the other day and I saw that case near the registers with those ice cold 20oz bottles of pop and my mouth was watering for a Dew (and I still have not caved yet).


Someone posted earlier about having bypass surgery due to smoking. My own dad died of a massive heart attack in his sleep at 40 years old, most likely caused by smoking. My father in law has stage 4 lung cancer from his 50 years of smoking (new tumors popped up, hes not going to go through treatment anymore, he has a few months left). It is absolutely stupid that I ever even started smoking in the first place (I had only been smoking a few years, picked it up when I was going through a divorce). I still cant convince my husband to 100% quit. But he knows I cant stand it. 

I really cant say this 6 weeks has been terribly bad, once I got over the physical symptoms, I feel better than I have in a long time. I have energy and have been constantly busy, so I think that helps me a lot. 


Good luck to everyone, you can do it!!!

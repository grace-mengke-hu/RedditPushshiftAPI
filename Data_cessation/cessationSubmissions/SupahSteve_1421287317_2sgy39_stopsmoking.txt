2 years down, decades more to go.

If I can do it, anyone can.  I smoked 1 to 1.5 packs a day for 14 years, and tried several times to quit.  One day I felt pretty good about myself, and decided to go all day without smoking a single cigarette.  After that day, I thought I should try to go another day.  2 weeks later I didn't even miss it any more.    I took it 1 day at a time for 2 weeks and now it's been 2 years.

So, what do I do now?

I'm 33 and have probably been smoking for very close to 20 years.  I quit cold turkey last june and went about 6 months without wavering in the slightest....and then something happened. 

I don't know what did it, I don't know why I did it, but I started smoking...very casually.  I'd walk home from the bar, grab a pack, smoke one and toss it.  I wouldn't smoke again for weeks and then do the same thing.  Long story short, I'm smoking again...pretty regularly, although less than I used to.  I'm smoking pretty much every day. 

Very few people know this and I never smoke socially...probably because I'm ashamed a bit, but more likely because I have the mentality that I'm still not a smoker - I figure every night will be my last.

I've tried to read Allan Carr again, a couple times (short version), and it just doesn't really work for me anymore, and I can't remember the last time I went more than a day without smoking at this point...even though I intend to stop every single one. 

Thing is, I know how easy it can be from the last two times I stopped, and I don't WANT to smoke, but for some reason I just stop off at the gas station and grab some on my way home from work.

Kinda fucked, but I'm not beating myself up over it too much, I just think I need a new way to approach this, because something isn't working anymore.  

Just posting this for two reasons:

1.) A word of warning, don't get too cocky.

2. Anyone have a Cole's notes type condensed version of the important Allan Carr points?  I think part of the reason it's not doing it for me this time is that I'm just rereading the exact same words over and over again.  Maybe seeing it in a new format will help.

STAY STRONG!

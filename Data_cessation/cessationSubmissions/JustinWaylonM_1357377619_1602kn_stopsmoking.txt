We are capable of great things.

Guys, I just want to tell you a short anecdote for motivation. know that If I could make it through this past week without smoking, any of you can.

Ok so starting off, I HAD this girlfriend who I had been with for about 5 months, it had been going great. I then find out yesterday through fucking Twitter of all places (confirmed by her) that she had slept with another guy on New Years. So that's great, eh? And just a few days before that I had found out that my ex GF (before my now new ex GF) of 4 months had slept with 7 other guys during our relationship. I haven't eaten but a bowl of cereal in two days because my stomach wont keep anything down. And my stomach feels like it's getting punched every time I sit up. 

But I didn't submit to smoking. I wanted to more than anything, I even had one in my mouth for what seemed like an hour. It was and still is unbearable going without it right now. But I wont quit, for you guys and myself, I wont quit.

You can do it, stress will happen, but you CAN overcome it without succumbing to smoking. I wanted to share this story with you all, even though it kills me just thinking about it. 

Stay strong! Thank you.

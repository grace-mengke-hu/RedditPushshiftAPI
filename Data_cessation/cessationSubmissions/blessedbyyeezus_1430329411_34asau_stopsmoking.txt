4th day, is this when things get better?

I had to post somewhere so this is a real attempt. Haven't had a cigarette since saturday. Started just because I had a sore throat, and now that I feel better I'm just gonna run with this time anyway.

Sorry for the shitpost, I just know myself well enough that if I don't state this, I'll light up a cig and claim I never really tried to quit.

40 hours. Need some help.

I haven't smoked in 40 hours. From two packs a day to this hasn't been as bad as it has in the past. The last time I quit I managed to stop for two weeks by eating tons of grapefruit. (I know, weird.) Now I'm replacing my cravings with walks and working out. Well, I've taken about 7, 30 minute walks through my neighborhood in the past 40 hours and well.. I'm kinda tired. I just hit a really, really hard craving and I'm not sure what to do.

Coping Skills?

First off, I just subscribed to this subreddit a few days ago and have been really inspired by all of the stories and support here.  I'm just shy of four weeks cigarette-free.  This is my fourth time quitting and I really feel this is the last.  I feel like I finally have a reason to quit and have support.

However, I picked a CRAZY time to quit unbeknownst to myself.  The day after I quit, the shit hit the fan in life.  Pretty much anything that could go wrong or be stressful has happened.  Bad and good.  Major changes at work, major changes in my boyfriend's work, a death in my boyfriend's family, my father being hospitalized, hosting friends and family from out of town, one of these friends being my smoking buddy of fifteen years, the gal I STARTED smoking with our freshman year in college.  I have not relapsed yet and I am really really proud of myself but JESUS.

These last few days, especially, have been stressful and I find myself at the end of my rope.  I know anxiety and depression can come with withdrawal, even weeks into the process, but I am over it.

To my point: I am looking for coping skills that are not meditation and exercise.  Those are both great things that I am working on incorporating into my life.  But I am looking for something else, maybe more creative.  Thoughts?

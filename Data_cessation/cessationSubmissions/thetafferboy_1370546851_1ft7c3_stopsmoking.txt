Looking for some advice

Hello.. So I'm on day 6 at the moment, after having smoke for the last 10 years and as long as I can remember 20 malboro red a day.

Unfortunately, where I live it's almost impossible to get hold of any stop smoking aids, but a friend was kind enough to bring me 8 21mg nicotine patches. I used them for the first 2 days, then cut them and used half a patch for the next 2 days and now I've just got 24 hours without any nicotine at all.

I realise this isn;t the "optimal" programme that is suggested, but I am determined this time (I've failed to quit before) and just wanted to take the edge off.

My brain is trying to trick me into smoking again, making up all kinds of excuses that a lot of my friends still smoke and maybe I could still smoke but just a couple a day, but so far I haven't caved.

I'm curious as to specific side effects others have experienced and if there is much you can do about them.

Specifically:

1) Concentration has definitely been affected. I find it hard to focus on tasks for any length of time now.

2) I feel "bored" very quickly, especially in social situations now that I am not smoking. It feels almost as if the smoking is as important as the converstaion (that sounds bad!)

3) My mood, as I expected it generally a bit worse and I don't feel like socialising as much.

4) Although I can get to sleep ok, I seem to be waking up every few hours and having more vivid dreams than I can remember before.

At the moment, I actually feel mentally and physically worse than when I smoked! :(

I can't believe it.

Welp, It's been a little over a month now. I feel so awesome. 
I "quit" smoking once in the passed and only made it a week and a half. I'm not even sure why I caved that last time. 

But I know this time, after the second day; It wasn't really all that hard. I guess the key to quitting, and staying quit, is a strong want to quit. Once you REALLY want to quit, I believe you will. 

Thank you /StopSmoking! I come here often to read all the inspirational quit stories. You guys rock!

I just realized that I've been smoking for over 10 years...

I started smoking when I was 16 and studying in Ecuador. My friends and I thought it was so romantic to buy a bottle of wine and a pack of cigarettes, and walk the through the markets of Quito as the sun set. Looking back, it would have been just as romantic without the cigarettes, but unfortunately I brought the habit back to the states and it has has followed me into my late twenties. Time flies, and it didn't hit me until this morning that I've been smoking so long. I'm no longer a dumb kid, and there is no excuse to keep smoking like it. Here's to quitting smoking and growing up. Cheers!

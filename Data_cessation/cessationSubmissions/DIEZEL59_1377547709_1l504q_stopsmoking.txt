one year!!

And going strong! Quality of life has increased buy hundreds and hundreds of percent over the last year.  Stay strong guys/gals its really worth it if you can pull through!  I still get small cravings once in a while but its more like a craving for chocolate that passes. 
Quitting was the catalyst for me that helped me start eating better and started running and lost tons of weight.  Once the first couple months are over it gets so much better!
cheers!

Breathing question

Havent smoked a ton, im 19 years old, maybe done like 15 packs in my life, and just started feeling a shortened breath lately.  Im done smoking now because of it, my breath isnt even that shortened, but it is to the point where I cant get a full deep breath most of the time unless im yawning.
            
I highly doubt I am sick and need to go see a doctor, just wondering if this will improve over time?  I tend to worry too much (anxiety)

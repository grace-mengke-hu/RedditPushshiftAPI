It's been about 2 months since I've had my last cigarette.

I was waiting for the day counter to turn to 60 but I got busy with school and forgot to post.

I can't believe it's been 2 whole months without a single cigarette. I feel proud of myself. I am not out of breath any more. My throat is completely clear. I can taste and smell things again. My clothes don't smell!!!

I feel less and less tempted every day and it's just a huge victory for me that I can look at cigarette packs in gas stations, maybe think about buying a pack but then always convincing myself that it's not worth it.

The amount of discipline you gain over yourself is incredible and worth more than anything else I've gained by quitting.

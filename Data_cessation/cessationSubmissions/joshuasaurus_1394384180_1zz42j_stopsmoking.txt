On Day 3

I'm not really having cravings. The thought of cigs grosses me out. But withdrawl sucks.  The first 2 days were okay.  I'm wearing the patch each day to help with the problem.  I replaced cigs with minted toothpicks. I have sugar free candies, and stopped drinking coffee and only drink green tea, and water.  I have been going to the bathroom ALOT. and am so Gassy (ugh) :(  I feel sicker than usual today. Anyone have any idea when this is supposed to calm down.  I'm not irritable or anything (I'm a pretty happy person).

The Surgeon General Report on Smoking - 1964

Here's a link to the NBC report which aired the day the Surgeon General released the "game changing" report on cigarette smoking and it's effects.

It's so interesting to watch this report and the reactions that are aired to it. 

Consider this: at the time of the report, US smoking rates were at about 50% of the population. Almost everybody smoked. People smoked in restaurants, bars, at the workplace, on airplanes and everywhere! 
This is when I was growing up.

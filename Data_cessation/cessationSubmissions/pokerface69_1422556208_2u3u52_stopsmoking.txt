50 hours! you guys are magic!

hey guys finally I'm 50 hours sober
I feel so good right now
I used to smoke 1-3 cigs a day. 
it took me 2 days to get to my 'last cig' but I finally got to it! 
day 1 withdrawal were very intense, hard, mind numbing and tiring but you guys helped me a lot. 
day 2 was OK, much better than day 1. sometimes intense craving but very less than day 1

let's see what i face in day 3 tomm. 

I can manage almost all withdrawal symptom but there's a constant weird pain in my stomach that always come during withdrawal. infact it's because of this pain I Ô∏èdin quit smoking until now. 
I was wondering if anyone experienced same and how long before it passes?

Badge reset and a lesson learned.

I had just made it to three months. I was in a bike accident on the way to work and ended up with a broken wrist. I held strong for the first week. By the end of that week triangulating between doctors, lawyers, and insurance companies, I was fed up and only needed one cigarette to escape all the stress. It didn't take long for me to fall back into the old habit.

Its a month later, and I'm ready to be an ex-smoker again. Here's the lesson I learned from the last relapse: It's pretty easy to not smoke. Quitting smoking means being prepared to deal with the unexpected without nicotine. Its going to take vigilance. 

I'm not happy I started smoking again. I'm glad I learned something from it though.

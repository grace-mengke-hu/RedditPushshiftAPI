Suggestion: A follow up bot

Here's a little project that I can't personally take up...

Based on personal experience, I know many of us try to quit, fail and then forget we ever wanted to quit in the first place.

What about the idea of setting up a bit to check in on quitters via pm... "are you still not smoking?" type thing. Maybe it could be something redditors sign up for like the badge. It might help some people get the urgency to quit again...

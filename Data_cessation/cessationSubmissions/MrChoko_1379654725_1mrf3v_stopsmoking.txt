I'm out of cigs. It's time for another go at this quitting thing.

About 14 months ago, I quit smoking weed and drinking when I entered treatment, but replaced it with a nasty pack a day habit.  Now I'm trying to do to take it to the next level of sobriety by quitting cigarettes.  

So I just smoked my last, and I have 8 pieces of gum and half a tank of 6mg ecig juice to ease the transition.  It's not that I don't have money.  I'm just tired of spending it on something that doesn't give me any satisfaction.  I'm losing stamina for simple day to day tasks like walking up stairs.  

I'm really worried about my anxiety though.  I have really bad anxiety and I think quitting is going to make it much worse in the short term.  I'm taking 3 really hard classes right now, and I don't want my grades to dip.  Does anyone have any advice for the engineering student who absolutely has to perform in school regardless of what I'm going through?

I need to share a story.

**Wall of Text**

I heard this story many times as a smoker and no doubt most people here have as well, I have shared past of the story here before but I want to again in its own post it might be long. Just over two years ago I started exercising really hard for the first time in my life, at one point in my training I couldn't go any farther because I could not breathe. I started to consider stopping smoking. 

Around January/Fed two years ago a life long friend of my parents was diagnosed with cancer in his neck(lymphnodes), he smoked for 30 years, his diagnosis came almost to the month of his 5 year anniversary of him quitting. I'm unsure of the type of cancer but I know it was stage 3, he had no health insurance so he had to go to a public hospital. Being South-Africa public hospitals are hit and miss but luckily he was sent to Steve Biko Academic Hospital where he got the attention of a load of professors. 

He was booked for a surgery within 2 weeks of his diagnosis due to the seriousness. At 10am one morning he went in for surgery with a surgical staff of over 40 people(!!!) they worked for just under 16 hours to cut away the cancer. They cut below his jaw from left to right like how a drunk joker would have been cut, from his lower lip to his adams apple and split him open like the predator to cut out the cancer.

He survived the cancer, had a very short round of chemo and was declared in remission around the beginning middle of last year. The surgery went fantastic but some mistakes were made and due to that and the sheer amount of muscles that were cut he lived and continues to live in constant agony. I won't lie because I cannot remember the exact amount but he takes an incredible amount of muscle relaxants each day like 8-15 pills a day. He reluctantly joked that the only think that helps take the worst away is the whiskey or two he drinks each night, even though it is bad for cancer.

Last year November he went for his constant checkups and was once again declared in remission. Two weeks ago he started feeling especially bad again, he went for scans and tests etc and was asked to wait for results, today is his birthday, he got his results earlier today. 

I was at work but my mom went to his party tonight and he announced to all the close friends and family that he is terminal, since his last checkup the cancer spread to almost his entire neck, his lungs and possibly his brain. His prognosis is 3-6 months, he probably wont see his second daughter deliver her first child this July.

I know these stories never stopped me from smoking but if it just shifts the mindset of one person it would be worth it. He is a fantastic person that is a second dad to me and this horrible horrible habit is going to take him from my family and his. Seriously, fuck cigarettes. :(

**TLDR; Close friend of family smoked a long time, now has terminal cancer.**

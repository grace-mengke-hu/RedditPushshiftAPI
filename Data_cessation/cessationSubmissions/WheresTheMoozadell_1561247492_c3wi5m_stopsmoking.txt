Decided to quit smoking today on a whim

I woke up this morning hungover and just sat outside, I smoked an entire pack last night as I normally smoke more then my regular half pack a day when I'm not drinking. 

I was just sitting outside enjoying the morning sunshine and thought thats it I'm done with it.

So Im posting here for some accountability. My mentality going forward is that I'm not a smoker, not even a former one. I just don't smoke and that's who I am.

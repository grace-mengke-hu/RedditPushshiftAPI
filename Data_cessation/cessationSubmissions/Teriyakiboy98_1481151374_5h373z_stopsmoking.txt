Read a post on here a while ago saying "Don't wait till new year's to do something good for yourself"

I used to think cigarettes made me who I am, I used to think that the fun, 18+ joke cracking clown would fade away if I stopped until I read a post on Reddit which believe it or not convinced me to quit smoking, It's now been 8 days since my last cigarette and I'm still here and I'm still Weird as ever.

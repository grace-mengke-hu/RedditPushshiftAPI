deciding on what to use to quit smoking ...?

Hi, all! 

I'm someone who has been smoking off and on for almost 20 years. I will smoke for a couple of years, quit and then restart when life gets to be too much. I quit in 2003 using nicotine gum, which was disgusting in taste. Since then I have quit cold turkey a  couple of times.

I quit last time in 2016 by vaping and then stopping that completely.  I have never used a patch or a pill.

I was diagnosed with a brain tumor in mid-2017. Had 2 brain surgeries and then months of daily radiation and simultaneous chemo. I started smoking again while going through that because it was so stressful and anxiety- provoking. 

I'm on disability right now and currently facing a potential recurrence of the brain tumor. 

I struggle with depression and anxiety and sometimes insomnia, but I'm on meds monitored by a psychiatrist for all that shit. 

I emailed my PCP that I want to quit again and she is of course really supportive and offered a number of aids like a patch, Welbutrin or Chantix. 

The feedback on Chantix is so mixed- I have heard wonderful reviews and horrible ones of it. So I'm not sure about that.

Has anyone tried a patch? or Welbutrin? 

Thanks so much!!

Today is the day!

I'm 26 years old and I've been smoking since I was 15. It's time to stop. I don't wanna be an old lady who smells disgusting. Long time lurker of this sub, proud to call myself a first time poster. I'll be reading through everyone's posts for tips, encouragement, etc. but feel free to post anything you think will help me! You guys rock. Thanks for being a subreddit.

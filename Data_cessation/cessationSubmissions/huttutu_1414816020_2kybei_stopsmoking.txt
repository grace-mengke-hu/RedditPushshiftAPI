I failed after 164 days.

I had thought I had it figure it out. My goal was to relive all the situations I knew without cigarettes enough times.

But today I was really drunk. I was woken up at the final stop by the operator because I overslept my stop. And as I was waiting for my connection I thought 'hey, tomorrow you start the ascetic month, let's enjoy it'

Yeah, I have planned to quit drinking, weed and the mindless internet surfing for a month but I have no idea why my brain thought it was a good idea to have a lust puff of tobacco. I asked the person next to me for a cigarette.

Unfortunately I finished it and it was terrible and I pray that I will not do it again.

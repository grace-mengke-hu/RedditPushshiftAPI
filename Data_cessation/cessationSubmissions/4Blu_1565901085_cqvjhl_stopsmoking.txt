What to do during breaks?

I've been smoke free for a couple months now, but the school year's about to start and I have a pretty intense schedule. I still get occasional cravings so I'm worried that I'm going to give in to the stress and start smoking again. Usually I would smoke during the 10-minute breaks in between classes but I'm looking for another brief activity I can do that will relieve stress. Does anyone have any good ideas about how I can spend my breaks?

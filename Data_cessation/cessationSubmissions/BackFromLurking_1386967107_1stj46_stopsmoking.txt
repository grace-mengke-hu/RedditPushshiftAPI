Can't stop clearing my throat. I quit in October 2012

Hi. I quit more than a year ago and ever since I quit, I keep getting this tickling sensation in the back of my throat as if I need to clear it. Even if I try to clear it, the sensation never goes away. It's very annoying especially since I am a singer. I have read that this can happen within the first 2 - 3 weeks of quitting but it's been more than a year since I quit. I do, however, smoke weed and had a puff of a joint about two weeks ago that contained a bit of tobacco. Could this cause the feeling I have in my throat? Is it from nicotine withdrawal or a real soar throat? If the former, I will simply smoke joints without tobacco.

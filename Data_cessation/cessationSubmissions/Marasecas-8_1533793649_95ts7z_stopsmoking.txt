Thank you!!

I quit for the second time 14 days ago. This is the longest Iâ€™ve ever been without smoking. Two weeks. They felt like an entire year. I think about smoking everyday. I live with a smoker. But I am so proud of myself and I wanted to thank you. Reading this sub helps me a lot! 

Also, this is a good way to make my Summer last forever...

I quit 7 months ago (not really)

It's going to be a short post about my experience with quitting cigarettes and my cross addiction with tobacco and weed. 

I quit cigarettes and stayed nicotine clean for month or so, then i accepted a spliff and that was the moment i got back into smoking tobacco. 

I did not wanted to smoke cigarettes, their smell and everything about'em was still a big no no for me, however when offered a tobacco free pipe or bong i also rejected and pointed to make a spliff with tobacco. 

I understanded it a while ago, im cross addicted and to stay clean i need to quit both - tobbaco and weed - at the same time. 

Good luck to everyone still trying to quit smoking, to be honest once i did i realised that smoking was the worst thing in my life and quitting them - the best.

Edit: currently 3 days clean!

Nicorette mini lozenges- buying online

I've been close to having a relapse recently (been off smoking for a long time) and wanted to know something. So I live in Chile and the local equivalent of Ebay (called "Mercado Libre") has the Nicorette mini lozenges on sale for around 5-6 times the shelf price in Australia. Seems pretty exploitative. As far as I know, they're not sold in any physical stores either. I found the ones I want (4mg) on Amazon and Target, but these seem to be USA only sites. Am I missing something (Taxes? Import regulation?) as to why I'm feeling kind of screwed? Thanks all

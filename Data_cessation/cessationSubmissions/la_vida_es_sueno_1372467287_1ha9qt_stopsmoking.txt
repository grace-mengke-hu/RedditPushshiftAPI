I made it 143 days. Now I have to reset my badge :(

Over the last month, smoking has become all I think about. My mother, my fiance, all of my friends smoke. I ... I just fucked up and bought a pack. 

It's a very stressful time in my life. My father is in hospice with terminal cancer. My fiance and I are buying a house. My family is pressuring me to set a date for the wedding (before my father dies), and my fiance can't even talk about it because he's so stressed with work and house-buying. 

I quit with chantix and "the easy way," so I know that the "I'm stressed out excuse" is just that, an excuse. Cigarettes do not help with stress, the stress is still there, before, during, and after. 

Yesterday I walked into the gas station to buy a pack, and turned around and went home before I did. When I got home I had an anxiety attack, I collapsed in the foyer and cried for what felt like hours. I reread "easy way," and read all of the great success stories in this subreddit. I went to bed and told myself that I'd won another battle. And today... I just couldn't fight it anymore. 

I failed. I don't know any of you, but I feel like I let you all down. I'm sorry, guys. I'm really, really sorry :'(

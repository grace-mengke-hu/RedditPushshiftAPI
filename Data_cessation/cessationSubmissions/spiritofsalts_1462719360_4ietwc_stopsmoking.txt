Stopping vaping nicotine as a one week trial.

I'm a vaper since four years (see my badge) and I used to vape about 20 ml of ejuice each three days at a strength of 9 mg nicotine per ml. This means I'm inhaling about 60 mg of nicotine each day.

I've smoked the first cigarette at the age of five. I've used cigarettes during kindergarden, school, university and later on too. I've always made experiments about how to quit, monitoring myself, setting goals, reaching goals. Reaching goals is cool!

Not sure if you can track how happy I am, since I've managed to stop smoking completely! This was such a long journey (and a struggle)!

While I've had many many attempts to stop smoking, since I've stopped I've never made any attempts to stop nicotine vaping.

Therefor I will use this thread to document how it's going during the next seven days. Or is it six days? However, next sunday 15:00 TAI this trial will end! http://www.timeanddate.com/time/international-atomic-time.html

Just for the records: I will vape without nicotine during this week. 

If you have any questions or just want to encourage me, feel free to reply!

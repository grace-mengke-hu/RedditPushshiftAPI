Day 1. I need some motivation.

So, today is my first smoke free day since I was around 11 years old (I'm 21 now). My boyfriend and I decided to quit about a week ago when we discovered how much money we would save each month. He quit cold turkey, while I cut back to less and less each day. The cutting back didnt work out. I'd get stressed and end up having more than I was supposed to, or I'd say fuck it and smoke as much as I wanted, so last night I threw out my last pack. I do have an ecigarette, but I absolutely hate using it, it hurts my throat and makes me cough like crazy, so I doubt I'll be using it unless I reeeally need to.

Anyway, I really need some motivation. I'm not going to lie, I love smoking. I didn't really want to quit that much. I know I have to. A lot of my family smokes, and I really don't want to end up looking/feeling 10 years older than I am, like them. Everytime I crave one, it's especially hard because I have nothing to remind myself of to keep me on track. Anything at all - effects of quitting you've noticed, things that helped you, things that happen to people who smoke that will scar me for life... I really appreciate it :)

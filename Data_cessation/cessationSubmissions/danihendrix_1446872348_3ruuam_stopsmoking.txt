Do I need to reset my time?

I've been clean since August 18th at 1515. Just now I had about 8 draws of a roll up before realising what I was doing!! I feel like such a bastard it's unbelievable, I quit using Alan Carrs book and have been fine since. I really don't want to reset my time, I didn't even get a headrush from it; is it acceptable to chalk it up as a near miss or should I reset? I'm sorry to myself and all of you trying to quit! What a bastard this weed is!

A little help?

Hey guys I have a concern.  I'm a little over 4 months deep into my quit. I have a girlfriend I have been with since slightly before I quit, maybe 6 months. She was a factor in my success as she provided some much needed external motivation, though it was still for my own sake she helped with the discipline. 

She wants to talk today and won't tell me about what. I'm a bit worried that we're going to break up - and I've had a lot of intrusive thoughts saying that I might as well smoke/I'll be so sad I will smoke, things like that. This is also one of the most stressful things that's happened since quit day. 

Has anyone dealt with similar? Or have any tips? I still don't want to smoke but I'm scared I'll slip if my world is rocked like this.

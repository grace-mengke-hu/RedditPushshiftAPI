Yesterday I almost relapsed but the store was closed. What to do next time?

Yesterday was weird. I was feeling a bit sick and when I wanted to go to the toilet (on a camping site) I felt that I was close to blacking out and eventually I had to sit down for a few minutes (I blacked out in school a few years ago). After that I felt pretty shitty and felt that I needed to smoke something. I was determined to go get a pack but I saw that all stores are closed. I’m so happy that they were but I feel bad that I would have relapsed.
What are some tips if I feel a urging need like this again? I’m on day 9 now and besides yesterday, it wasn’t really hard for me not to smoke, even when somebody next to me was smoking. I started taking care of my skin which is a good reason not to smoke, because cigarettes give me many pimples and I want to look good on an event coming up in 3 weeks.

Another thing is that I’m scared that I won’t be able to say no to cigarettes once I will be out drinking with my friends. Any tips to stay away from cigs when drunk?

Thank you

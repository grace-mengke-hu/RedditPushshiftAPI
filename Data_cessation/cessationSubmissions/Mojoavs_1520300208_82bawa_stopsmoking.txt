More than 12 days smoke free but rather than being joyous I am feeling worried - worried that it will creep back

It is not the cravings anymore.  It feels like smoking will creep back into my life in some weak moment.  I keep visiting this site for motivation.  Whenever I see a post about someone relapsing, I feel so bad.  This group is the only support system I have.  I don't know when I will come to a stage where I can be confident that I have kicked the habit.

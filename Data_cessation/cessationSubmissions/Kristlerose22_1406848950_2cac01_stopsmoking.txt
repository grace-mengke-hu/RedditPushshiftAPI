9 days

So, I've been smoke free for 9 days! (Yay) I'm 34 and feel like I've tried to quit that many times before too! At first it was like a light switch, it was kind of hard, but I didn't want to smoke!!! But these last few days have been super hard..... Temptation???? I don't know why it's getting harder???? Any advice on how to shut out the urge????

8 hours in

I have a busy schedule and I just cleaned out my garage of all of the ashes, cigarette butts, and ashtrays.

The only thing that concerns me is that have a whole carton of cigarettes that I don't want to just throw away.

Maybe I should go down to the VA or something and hand them out... I don't know. 

It's like $70 worth of cigarettes.

My thread.

It has been one minute since my last cigarette. I have been smoking for a long long time. I've just cleaned up my life from people who dont care about me and dont wish me good. I just broke up this morning with the love of my life. Thats it. Either I fix myself or a bullet to the head. I prefer the latter but I'll see where my life goes. I'll be using this thread as a journal and a reminder. Wish me good luck. Thank you.

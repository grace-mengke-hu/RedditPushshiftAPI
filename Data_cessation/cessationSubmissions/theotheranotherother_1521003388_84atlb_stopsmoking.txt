I've been noticing my triggers, and got hit by one that made me laugh.

Backstory below but pre-TLDR - While reading a book/watching a movie, and a couple in a serious relationship get into a fight,  applying it to my own past relationships. Like, "Yeah, take that [Ex]!"  Apparently  thinking something along those lines makes me want to smoke.  Ha!


I've been doing very well with quitting cigarettes, after...let's say 8 total attempts at quitting, 3 of those being "super serious" attempts.  But this time has seriously been going great, I'm about to go to sleep after day 3 cold turkey.  (4 days ago was a patch, 5 days ago was my last cigarette.)

There are the obvious ones you encounter a lot those first few days; after dinner, getting in/out of a car, you know the rest. Then there were some new discoveries of the more obscure triggers.  

My previous best quit attempt was maybe.....18 hours?  I even went out for a first date/drink at a whiskey bar last night, my second full day being totally cold turkey.  First date? Whiskey? Day 2?  

Not only did I get a second date out of it, I didn't smoke, didn't even really want to.  I'm feeling great.

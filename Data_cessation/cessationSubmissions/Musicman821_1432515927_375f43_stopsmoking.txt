Why should I really stop smoking?

Can you guys put it in to perspective without the cancer and heart attacks. What will I gain from stopping. I have been smoking for the past two years and today is day 5 of not smoking. I didn't really plan on stopping I just havent had time or opportunity to get a new pack. I find myself with the opportunity here to stop though. I don't feel any withdrawl except for a little fuzziness in my mind which seems more chemical than mental. Can you guys please help and convince me to stop for my well being and for others too? Thanks guys. I think I'm going to give this a shot

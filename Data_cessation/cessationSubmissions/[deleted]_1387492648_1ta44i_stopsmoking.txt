Nicotine is not going to help, right?

Really stressed out at work. After the 4th round of interviews, I'm supposed to hear a decision this week (looks like not today). Home is very stressful, and my brain is telling me if I stop by a gas station on the way home, my problems and stress will be solved. It's been 16 days - this is difficult.

Chest tightness

31 year old male, 10+years of pack/day approx. It's been 5 months smoke free. I exercise almost every day, eat healthy etc. but my lungs still feel heavy and tight although there is a lot of improvement. How long did it take for yours to regenerate completely? Thanks and all the best.

Over 3 weeks without a cigarette!!!

I don't know if this counts, because I bought a Sourin Air (vape thing similar to a juul) so I still am addicted to nicotine. However, I'm working on weening myself off by lowering the nicotine amount gradually.

I'm only 20, and I started smoking at 18 because I'm in the military and everyone uses tobacco. It's a great way to get a break and relieves stress in times when there's plenty of it to go around. I got up to over a pack a day and a few weeks ago I just decided enough was enough. 

Every couple days though I feel a burning desire to light one up, but it usually passes quickly. I know it's not much of a milestone but I'm just happy to not be smoking cigarettes and wanted to share :)

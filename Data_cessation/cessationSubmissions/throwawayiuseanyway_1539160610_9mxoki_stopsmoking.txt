1 Week. Whew!

It's been harder than I thought it would be, but I'm glad I made it this far. I'm quitting forever but I feel like right now I'm just aiming for week 2. 

In case anyone wants to know, or in case it can help anyone, some quick background on my smoking history:

Smoked cigarettes for roughly 15 years, a pack a day. Smoked rollies at rough points where I couldn't afford cigs, and did the tobacco injector with filter tubes towards the end, what a mess.

I got introduced to vaping around 2013 or so. I will say it was a lifesaver at the time. Once I started vaping full time, I noticed a huge difference the next day. I worked my way down to 6mg at 7watts but never managed to quit entirely.

A month or two ago I decided I needed to quit for good. I started with the 14mg patches and switched my vape juice to 0mg. I was surprised at how much I still held onto that vape. I also cut down a lot on marijuana. Once the patches were done, I quit vaping. Within 2-3 days I quit smoking any marijuana too.

I saw people here talking about the Alan Carr book, and while I was familiar with the book from a long time ago, they also said something about throwing everything out. I realized there was no point in holding onto any of my vape/weed stuff anymore and I threw it all away. 

So, I've eaten too much, drank too much tea, snapped at people a little bit :( but I've made it the first week. While I just want to make it to the next week, it sounds like 4 weeks is where most people say they feel "out of the woods". That puts it right about at Halloween.

Thanks for being here /r/stopsmoking, this has definitely supported me in my very rough journey so far.

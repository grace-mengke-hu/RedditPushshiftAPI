I'm about to walk into the Lion's den. What do I do?

So Saturday night (technically Sunday Morning) I flushed all of my cigarettes down the toilet in a drunken rage at about 2 am. Thanks to the help of my friends and roommates, I haven't smoked one since. But I work in a few hours and I work at a car mechanic shop where EVERYONE smokes. I will get offered a cigarette many times in my 8 hour shift. What do I do? The temptation will be very strong.

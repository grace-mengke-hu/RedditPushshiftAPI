GF quitting smoking - problems with disrupted sleep and nightmares

As the title says, my girlfriend is giving up smoking (from ~6 a day to 0). It's only been about half a week, but she's experiencing disrupted sleep as well as frequent nightmares during the sleep she does get. 

Is this a common problem, and is there anything she can do to mitigate the issue?

On a broader note, is there anything I can do to help support her (we live together, but I've never smoked)?

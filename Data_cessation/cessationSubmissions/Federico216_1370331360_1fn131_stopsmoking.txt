Quitting too easy?

I know this might sound weird to many other quitters, but this is the problem I've been having the past few days.

It just feels like it was so "easy" for me to quit smoking, that now my mind keeps telling me it shouldn't be a problem having a smoke every now and then, like "it doesn't matter if you smoke a few now that you're drunk, just quit again, it's so easy" and it becomes a cycle where the quitting is suddenly really hard. 

Has anyone else had this problem?

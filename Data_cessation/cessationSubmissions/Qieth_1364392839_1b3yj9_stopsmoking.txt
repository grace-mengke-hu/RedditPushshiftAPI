Discussion: Nicotine replacement products

Dear smokers and ex-smokers. I wanted to make this topic and see if we could get a discusison going. While this subreddit is mainly for the support and the confirmation of our fellows, I don't think it would be bad to have serious discussion on something that is very central to a lot of us: Nicotine replacement products.

What are your thoughts about them? Which have you tried and what are your experiences with them? Have you succesfully quit smoking using them? Are you still using them? Anything goes..

I'll start off by making an observation. It seems to me like a lot of people think that as long as you are not *smoking* (ei, as long as you are using NRPs) then you are better off. If you can just use that nicotine gum, then you dont smoke, and then you are healthier. I believe this is a very dangerous approach. The longer you use NRPs, the longer you have to fall back to cigarettes. The sooner you get completely off the nicotine the better.

Thats not to say that I believe they are useless. Because I used nicotine gum to quit smoking. But I only used it for 6 days, and then I went cold turkey after that. The 6 days was to avoid the massive dizzy spells I would get when I went cold turkey, and on day 6, they werent nearly as bad as they had been on day 1. I have gone for three+ weeks on nicotine gum before, but then I would eventually fall back on cigarettes. This is also why I think its important to see NRPs as a short term solution, not something you should expect to rely on for months and months.

Sure, once you quit smoking, you are not bombarding your body with most of the bad stuff from the cigs. But you are still very much addicted to nicotine. And that is what we are fighting here.

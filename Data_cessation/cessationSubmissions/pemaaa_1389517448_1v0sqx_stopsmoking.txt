Had one today after 12 days smoke free - how to overcome certain "triggers"

For new years I decided that it was time to quit smoking. This wasn't too hard since I've only been smoking for a year at about 4-5 cigs a day. I've been using a vapor pen to help and it's helped quench some cravings.

A little background about me - I go to raves quite often. At these raves, I use MDMA. And when I am on MDMA, I chain smoke 5-10 cigs in a matter of hours. If you guys have never felt it, smoking on MDMA is one of the best feelings in the world.

Today, I was listening to music and a certain song came on that I love at raves, and it became an overwhelming trigger for me to smoke. I had a cig, and afterwards realized it wasn't that great afterall, and it made me want to quit even more - I felt guilty and gross.

But the one thing I know is that I will forget this feeling of guilt. Next time a song comes on that triggers me, I will want another cigarette. 

My question is, how do you guys overcome your triggers? Cutting out this music is not an option as I love it in every aspect of my life - studying, driving, etc.

Good luck to all the others who quit for 2014! We can do it!

Day 1, can’t stop thinking about smoking.

I’ve tried many times to quit, I have quit for years, months, days at a time. This time, I really really want to quit for my future health. I have been telling myself I’ll quit later, it’s not a big deal, it’s not the right time (going through a divorce process, really fresh, just moved to a new city, in therapy, very sad and going through a lot every day), I can’t do it. It’s got to stop because my self esteem is pretty fucking low because I smoke. I hate the lack of self control and self discipline at this point, not to mention the smell in my car, and the way I feel heavy and shitty after I smoke most of the time. Instant gratification has been a comfort for me for a while now. I was married to an alcoholic drug addict and smoking became like no big deal compared to the huge issues we were dealing with. 
Now that we are split up I want my strength back! My health used to be really important to me! Now, I’m like ‘eh’ when the craving takes over I just much rather have that fix. It’s gotta stop. 
I seem to trick myself into smoking by having alcohol only once I’ve ‘quit’ smoking again for another try. Self sabotage! 

Writing this has helped me because I’m so tired of losing to smoking. It’s making me angry. Like get the fuck out of my life cigarettes! Non fucking Serviam! 

Anyone else frustrated?

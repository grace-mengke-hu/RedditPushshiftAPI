Switching to vaping? +the morning coffee+after meals problem

So I've been trying to switch to vaping. I like it a lot. It's like a hobby. Pretty cool. . It's fun and tastes great. Satisfies the hand to mouth and blowing out the "smoke". I beat the first thing in the morning issue but the problem is after meals and with certain drinks. I don't drink alcohol at all but with monsters, coffee, even milkshakes it doesn't feel right. I need a cig with it and I give in. Problem is that I want one cig. But have to buy a whole pack. Then I'm screwed cuz I have 19 more. Bumming one cig while around people who are smoking is no big deal when the urge comes. Feel I shouldn't be so hard on myself in expecting to break a 17 year habit in weeks. I just need to tough it out thru the activities where I "need" a cig. 

Agree?
Advice?

I wish I'd listened. I wish I could have understood.

When I was a kid, I remember my Mom telling me about quitting smoking when she got pregnant with me. As I got older, I remember her on many occasions that she still had cravings for a smoke now and then, and that they never really went away. I wish I could have understood that better. I've been quit for a little over a year now, and I know that the urge I have to smoke still will probably be with me for life. I can handle it, but that doesn't mean I don't wish  I didn't have to. I have a daughter of my own, and I just wish I knew how to make sure she understands that even if you quit, nicotine addiction is a lifelong alteration. I guess all I can do is my best, be honest, and hope that she is smarter than I am. Sorry for the fairly pointless post, I just needed to get this out of my head.

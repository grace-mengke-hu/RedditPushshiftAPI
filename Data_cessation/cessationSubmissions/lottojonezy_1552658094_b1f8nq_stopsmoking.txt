Suppressing appetite

I’m 21 years old and stopped smoking around 2 weeks ago after smoking for 8 years 🙄 (don’t judge) I have been using a vape which has really helped me but I’m struggling with eating? A cigarette would suppress my appetite but without that I literally can’t stop eating everything I see, even if I chuck some clouds on my vape...Help me cos I don’t want to put on any more weight! Thanks ☺️

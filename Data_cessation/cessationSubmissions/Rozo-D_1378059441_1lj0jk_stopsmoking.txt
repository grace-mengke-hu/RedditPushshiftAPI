In need of motivation to quit? here's my story.

about 3-4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer.  this came a year+ after quitting.  The ultimate result of 10+ years of smoking a pack a day.  If I had quit sooner this probably cold have all be avoided.  If I had smoked less, maybe even more so.  

I know it's hard to quit.  it's brutally hard.  It's so easy to just go right back to those little sticks and smoke up.  If I were told a few years ago that in 2013 I'd get Lung Cancer because of my habit I would have stopped right there and then.  You, however, don't need a message from the future.  You can avoid this right now.  quit.  just quit.  You're paying money every day for something that WILL kill you.  If you keep this up these packs of 10 little sticks will kill you well before your time.  Don't. Do. It. Anymore.

I was ignorant to it over the 10 years.  I had the "young and invincible" mentality that I wouldn't get cancer.  However here I am at the fairly young age of 29 and I have it.  Please don't be like me.  I don't have a family yet and I wanted one.  I wanted kids and a wife and all that.  Now I don't know if I'll be able to achieve those goals simply because I was stupid over 10 years ago and decided to try a cigarette.  It's not worth it folks.  Stop today.  Never pick it up again.  I'm living proof that it's not worth it and they WILL kill you.  

People have asked me if I'm mad at the cigarette companies,etc for this.  I'm not.  This was a decision I made and a stupid one at that and now I have to live/deal with the consequences.  

If you're worried about quitting don't.  This is quite literally a life altering decision.  one that can potentially save your life.  I made the decision to quit too late.  You don't have to though.  Stop today.  Stop right now.

Thanks.

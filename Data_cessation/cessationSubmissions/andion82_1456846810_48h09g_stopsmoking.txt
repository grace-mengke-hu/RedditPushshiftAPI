It had one more day than usual but one year passed. Thanks /r/stopsmoking for helping and Mr. Nimoy for the initial encouragement!

More than one year ago, after the death of Mr. Leonard Nimoy and he's moving final tweet https://twitter.com/TheRealNimoy/status/569762773204217857 I found this other tweet from him years before talking about COPD: https://twitter.com/therealnimoy/status/428720437711736832

I was always concerned about Cardiovascular accidents or Cancer, but never thought of that. Don't tell me why, but on top of my other motivations those tweets and story triggered a *click* on my brain.

One week after that I smoked my last cigarrete *ever*. I joined /r/stopsmoking and started reading your posts and comments for encouragement. 

During the first month I trekked 200km of a seaside path in Northwest Spain (where I live). It helped me a lot during that time  and I shared it with you on this same [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/30xl4b/the_8_day_seaside_trek_that_helped_me_while/?ref=share&ref_source=link) On the comments promised myself to do the trek again if I lasted one year, and I plan to do so!.

I saved 1800â‚¬ in the process. Here's a list of some things I afforded during this year thanks to that:

* A second hand surfboard. After gaining some kgs in my old [one](https://www.instagram.com/p/9L8DSkkm_H0O0goVTVQzgn-Lv7cDx6zHFkIt40/?taken-by=serasiypunto) was too small for me. No problem, I love the "new" one!.
* I fixed my old car so I could go surfing with it. I always commute by bike so it was abandoned for 4 years in my parent's.
* A trip to London, Manchester & Ireland to visit some friends. The Cliffs of Moher looked [this wonderful](https://goo.gl/photos/WYCgLQrZJeLePiWC8) that week :).
* An 8 day trip to Morocco to celebrate 1 year of no smoking. Here's a picture I took on [Volubilis](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCQv_30or-y/?taken-by=lucasandion).


For those who shared your experiences and encouragement with me: THANK YOU!. 

For those who are new here and reading as I did at the beginning: Yes, you can do it. and Yes, it gets easier and better over time.

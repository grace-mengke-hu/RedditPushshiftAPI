I was 459 days off cigarettes.

I've recently relapsed into cigarettes. Hear me out. I'm a casual vaper and it worked well for me. I go out sometimes and whether I'm shitfaced, just having a couple drinks with dinner, or completely sober, I have felt no need to smoke cigarettes. The only thing I crave from cigarettes is that first cigarette of the day nicotine rush. That's something that vaping can't competewith, even if i raised my nic levels to 6/12mg. I've even tried things such as the Suorin Air with nicotine levels up to 50mg. It just doesn't work for me. I'll be on ciggs for a little bit before I attempt to cold turkey again.



I am a disappointed in myself.

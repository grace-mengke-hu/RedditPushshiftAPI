Withdrawals or really sick?

I quit smoking 4 days ago and have been feeling extremely ill the last 2 days. I am dizzy, tired, sore, my throat hurts, I am having hot flashes and I can't eat or even think about eating. Not to mention I can't seem to focus or talk to anyone without anxiety. It feels like a really bad flu and like I am going to faint at the same time.  I don't have a fever or any other flu symptoms. 

What would you suggest to help this feeling and how long do you think it will last? Do you really think this is from the withdrawals? Thanks for any advice.

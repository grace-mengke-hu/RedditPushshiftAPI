At home alone is easy..driving is the hard part

If I'm at home or at work I don't crave a cigarette.. If I stay home all weekend I don't crave a cigarette at all. At work I never take smoke breaks. The times I crave cigarettes are when I'm driving and when I'm drinking at a bar. I can go all day without a cigarette at work but once I'm in the car I need one so bad. I've quit before and people ask me why I even smoke if I only smoke ultra lights and I don't smoke all day but those trigger times are when I do crave it.

Note to non-smoking future self:

Note to non-smoking future self tomorrow morning, these are the reasons you've decided to quit:

- You don't work out when you are a smoker, because you are OCD and stupid and think that working out and smoking contradicts each other.
- You won't have to see your teeth get more and more yellow.
- You will be more able to do things you want to do, because smoking cigarettes cause time. 5 minutes a day X a pack a day = 100 extra minutes a day to use for something awesome.
- You will be more confident because you don't smoke or have a vice to lean on.
- You decided to quit because you care about your family and you want them to see you have a long healthy live to spend with them.
- You decided to quit because you care about yourself and you want to see yourself have a long and healthy life.
- You are tired of wasting the breaks at work. Two twenty minute breaks plus a short smoke on lunch adds up to 125 minutes total a week = even MORE time to spend on something awesome (at work, like reading or something).
- You are sick of spending so much money on them.
- You don't even have money to begin with.
- Yet you still find money for cigarettes? How?
- You won't continue getting cigarette burns in your car.
- You won't accidentally light a cigarette backwards (so gross). You won't have to break down gross old butts to form one bowl of tobacco to smoke that tastes like absolute shit. Why are you degrading yourself?
- You won't be a slave to something that does absolutely nothing for you, nada, zilch, zip, nothing.
- The more time you have, the more time you can spend scratching your cat, which I'm sure she will appreciate.
- That disgusting smokers cough that you can't get rid of that makes you spit up shit.

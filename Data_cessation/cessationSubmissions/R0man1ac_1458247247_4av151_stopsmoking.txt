I could literally just slap myself.

I don't know why quitting is so hard for me now. The first time I quit for two years, it was fairly easy. The second time I quit for six months, no problem. The last time I quit for 119 days, pretty challenging, and I ended up caving. 

This time, I'm not really even feeling cravings, and YET I still caved AGAIN, after nine days. Stopped and bought a pack today on my way to work. What am I doing wrong? I know I must sound pathetic, but this time quiting has been SO hard for me.

Should I try picking a quit date instead of just randomly stopping in the middle of a pack? 

Should I KEEP just stopping in the middle of a pack? 

I seem to do perfectly find for a week or so, and then I convince myself to stop and get a pack just to have a few after work. 

UGH, where do I start?

New job led me to start again...

I had stopped, but now I am having difficulty not smoking with my coworkers, who offer me cigs. They're just being nice, and I usually only smoke once a day, but saying "no" is so hard because my job is boring and it breaks up these long 12 hour days. 

Tomorrow will be a new day 0. Ill come back and post probably.

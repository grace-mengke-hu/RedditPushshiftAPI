I just created this post so i motivate myself to quit

I have been quitting for a few times so far, clearly not successfully. i have decided to quit 1 of  Jully for good this time, half of my payment goes on smoking. I think it also messes up with my sleep and my life in general, and i don't see the point in smoking so ill just leave this here for myself to encourage  me to really stop. also what is the name of the app that you are all using? thank you

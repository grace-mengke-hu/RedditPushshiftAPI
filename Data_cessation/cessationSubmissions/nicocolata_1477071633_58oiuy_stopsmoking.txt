Setting my quit date to the 25th so I can have my 2 months smoke free as a Christmas present to my family!

I've realized that my family inspires me more than I inspire myself on my own, and I know they would love to hear me say it! I would like to keep it a secret but they always check in on me so maybe I'll try not to make a big deal out of it. Anyone have advice how to keep me successful?

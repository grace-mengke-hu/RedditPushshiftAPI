4 months no-smoke, but I don't feel different

I've quit smoking cold turkey almost 4 months now.

I honestly don't feel any healthier or better, nothing has changed, cravings are worse than ever. 

Everyone keeps telling me to continue not smoking and avoid falling back in, but since I am not seeing/feeling any different, at least when I had my smoke breaks I was in my own world that no one else was invited in. I'm very tempted to pick it up again, but I've reached 4 months now and it would suck to go back

Am I doing something wrong? Anyone else had the same feeling?

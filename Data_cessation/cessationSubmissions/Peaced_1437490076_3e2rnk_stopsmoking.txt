It might be easier than you think !

Hi there, i'm 40 yo, smoked from my teenage years until 37 yo. I stopped cold turkey and the only reason I stopped this late is because I thought it was gonna be hell. I wasn't that bad.

So it seems that for some people, it's easier than for others, the only way to know is to stop !

So if you hesitate because you fear the aftermath, just give it a try, it's better to try, even without faith, than to keep going under the assumption it's not gonna work.

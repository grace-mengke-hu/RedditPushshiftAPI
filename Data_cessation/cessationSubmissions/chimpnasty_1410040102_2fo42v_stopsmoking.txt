Drunk me is an idiot and for once it actually paid off!

So I quit a little less than 3 weeks ago after 7 years of smoking and things have been going pretty well, until last sunday that is. It was the first time I got wildly drunk since I quit, for the second time. I was on a mission to smoke but when I got to the store I saw they had the refillable e cigs so I bought that and a bottle of the liquid instead and have been using it when I drink. I felt like I was cheating which I was until I read the "juice" bottle today. I found out that in my drunken hurry to smoke I bought nicotine free liquid stuff. Just thought I'd share my story here and am just happy that I can still say I am almost three weeks nicotine free!

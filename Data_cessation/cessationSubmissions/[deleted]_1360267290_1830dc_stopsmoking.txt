So much stress right now and all I want is a cig

Uni applications, band, girlfriend, ill mother, schoolwork, a lot of stuff piling up at the moment aswell as my depression not being helpful. I'm craving like fuck right now.

I know that if I start smoking again I'll get stressed over smoking, but I just need something to ease me out right now, I want that 5 minutes back where nothing matters but me and a cigarette and this is getting so hard

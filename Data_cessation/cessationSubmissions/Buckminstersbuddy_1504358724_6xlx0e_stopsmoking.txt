Maybe tomorrow... but not today

I had quit for 10 years after smoking for 16. Last fall I started smoking daily again after having the occasional smoke for the year prior - maybe a pack over the entire year. Amazing how it can sneak back up and grab you! One is definitely too many.

I'm on day 4 of quitting cold turkey again. Last night I finished a long work week, and really wanted one. I decided "not now, but for sure tomorrow." This wasn't a mental game; I 100% planned on buying cigarettes in the morning. Now tomorrow is today and I don't want that smoke anymore. So no trip to the store and I am staying quit. 

I'm going to do the same thing if an urge comes up today. I'll put it off till tomorrow. And if I wake up tomorrow and it's today again... 

This is a great sub. Reading the comments is helping keep me on track. Thanks!

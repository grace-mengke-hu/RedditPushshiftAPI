Just started this morning, needing help.

I just stated this morning. My friend, also a redditor, and myself agreed to quit together and if we cheat or fall through then we get kicked in the nuts. We figured high stakes would make us want to quit more. I am the manager of a gas station, at work, alone, staring down about 50,000 of the little white devils. I almost am willing to give up my nuts for this.

I'm not bringing my vape home for the holidays.

My girlfriend and I haven't smoked in months.  I've been using lower and lower nicotine levels in my vape since then, but tomorrow we're flying home to my family and I'm leaving it behind.  I want to be nicotine free so bad it hurts.  Wish me luck, friends!

I started smoking again and it felt good.

My urge to smoke finally overcame my resolve to quit smoking. I was stressed out about my finals and there was a lot of tension in my house. It had been 3 months since I quit and these 3 months, to be honest, has been hell. I could barely concentrate on my studies. More over to stop myself from rebounding to caffeine, I had stop drinking coffee aswell. I couldn't bare it today. Went out, had a couple of smokes. And it felt great. My nerves eased up. I don't know why, but I felt happy. I felt light. 

Now that I started smoking again, part of me doesn't want me to quit. I don't know where I went wrong. I feel ashamed. I really want to quit. But I'm not sure if I can.

THE BEAST

The Beast is a bigger bitch than my ex-girlfriend. 

The Beast is smart. 

The Beast is tricky. 

The Beast is smooth and slick. 

The BEAST is winning every time you take even a TINY PUFF of a cigarette. 

The Beast is Nicotine addiction and it is winning. It's taunting you. It's so fucking SMUG! it makes me sick. Smug because you always give him. it's smug because it KNOWS how to manipulate you. 

To it, you are nothing but a puppet. A meat puppet for it to control and abuse and destroy. 

Know what happens to the Beast when you die? It FUCKING LAUGHS AT YOU! It dances on your cancer-ridden corpse because it knows it won. It knows you are WEAK and it is STRONG. Is it a smug son of a bitch. 

I learned a lot from reading Alan Carr's EASYWAY to Stop Smoking. The best thing I learned is that I WANT TO KILL THE FUCKING BEAST.

I'm tired of letting it win. I'm disgusted that it's so fucking smug. That is KNOWS exactly how to manipulate me. How to push me. It's so smart and I FUCKING HATE THAT ABOUT IT. 

I'm SMARTER than the Beast. I'm stronger than the Beast. 

I am a non-smoker now because THAT'S how you win. 

Guess what? It CAN be an easy battle. 

In spite of the Beast being smart and strong and tricky... in spite of all that the Beast can be defeated. 

Every cigarette I DON'T smoke kill the motherfucker inside. Instead of me choking on smoke and soot. Instead of me talking into my hand because I know people can smell my shitty breath. Instead of feeling tired and lethargic and like a failure. I have gone through the day a fucking GOLDEN GOD. 

I am killing a horrible Beast that lives inside me. I invited it in. I knew the moment I did it was a mistake and I've spent the last 24 years asking it politely to leave. It won't listen. NO MORE MISTER NICE GUY.

I'm not asking it to leave. I'm not even telling it to leave. It wants to stay? FINE. It can stay inside me and STARVE TO DEATH. I want IT to suffer as I have. 

I look forward to the pangs/cravings/twangs... whatever you call'em. I look forward to them because it means I'm fucking winning. 

You see it as a craving. You think on the craving until you cave and buy a cigarette or a pack. I've been there. I've done all that. The difference now is my outlook. It's not a craving it is a DEATH KNELL! 

I'm not craving a cigarette, because cigarette's are POISON and I'm too smart to CRAVE poison. 

The Beast is DEMANDING I feed him. He's thrashing and stomping and screaming. He's reminding me that it relaxes me (LIES), he reminds me that it makes me cool (LIES), he reminds me that I like the taste and smell (FUCKING LIES!!!!!).... he's a little fucking bitch and he's dying and he's a big baby about it. 

KILL THE NICOBEAST!

Kill it until it is so sick and shriveled and dead that I can simply shit it out like the turd that it is. 

I'm done dying. I'm done being someone's doormat. Someone's fucking tool. Someone's 'host". I'm done. 

NOW IS THE TIME FOR PURE ASS KICKERY! 

I AM A WIZARD! I AM THE MASTER OF ME! I CHEW UP THE BEAST AND SHIT IT OUT! 

I'm a non-fucking-smoker and I'm winning the battle. 

Are you?!

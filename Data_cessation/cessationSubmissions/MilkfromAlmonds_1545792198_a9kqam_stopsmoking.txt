Sub-conciously reluctant to quit

I've been having an on-and-off relationship with cigs for the past 2 months. I've been really trying to quit, but the most I manage to stay quit is about 4 days.

The rational part of me knows I gotta quit, both for my health as well as for my already shit finance. But whenever I'm with my friends, and especially my dad, mum and brother (all smokers), I feel a strong urge to smoke with them. 

Truth is I feel inadequate deep inside, and feel a need to smoke to make up for my lack of social skills and feelings of inferiority. 

I know I'm not inferior. I'm smart, I look decent, I'm healthy, I have lots of friends. But yet this sub-concious behaviour of smoking feeds of my insecurities, like a devil, tempting me to smoke to make up for these insecurities, and always encouraging me to sabotage my smoking plans. Always 'just a stick, it won't hurt'.

I guess there's nothing much anyone xan do to help me, but I just thought I'd post here for advice and encouragement. Thanks for reading.

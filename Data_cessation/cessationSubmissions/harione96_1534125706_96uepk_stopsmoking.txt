Why does it look so easy?

Hi, all. 
I’m trying to stop smoking. There have been an influx of people at work who have stopped, using e-cigs. I’ve had an e-cig for a number of years but always gone back to smoking. I really want to stop smoking all together but am finding that exceedingly difficult. 

I don’t want to be dependent on nicotine and want to get some advice on how to quit without my e-cig. Any tips/help you can offer is much appreciated.

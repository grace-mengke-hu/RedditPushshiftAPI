A little over a month smoke free, now having breathing problems?

I have smoked cigarettes since I was 15, but started smoking heavily at 17...now I am 23 and decided to quit once and for all this year due to becoming increasingly worried about my health and not being able to afford the habit in the first place.

At my heaviest I was smoking around 1.5 packs a day, and I never really went under a pack a day.   

It has been surprisingly easy to quit as my friends know how much I've struggled with quitting in the past and how bad I've wanted it and they've been very supportive.   But I have a problem that I wasn't expecting to come up now that I quit, my breathing has actually been getting really bad lately.    It honestly feels worse than it did when I was smoking a pack and a half a day and I don't know why.


I know I'm not sick and I don't have anything that could be causing other than some connection to when I was smoking...but I thought my lungs were supposed to start feeling BETTER once I quit, I feel like I'm breathing through a straw constantly and sometimes when I'm falling asleep I feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen and am suffocating.   

Anyways...before I go to a doctor or anything I wanted to get some experiences from people here or anyone that can link me somewhere that has information on this if its normal.


I'm really just looking either for some reassurance that this is part of the normal healing process or if its something that I should be concerned about, and I'm not looking for the "its the toxins being flushed out of your body" type response I'm looking for some actual experiences or science behind what is happening.     


I thank you for your reading and stay strong everyone!

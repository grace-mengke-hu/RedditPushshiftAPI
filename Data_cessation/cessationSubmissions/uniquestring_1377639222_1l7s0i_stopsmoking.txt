Two Years Down, A Lifetime To Go

Two years today without so much as a single drag.  It had to be that way, because I was afraid if I took one toke, I wouldn't stop until nicotine was leaking out of my pores! <G>

I am amazed by the fact that I managed to quit the idiot sticks.  I smoked at least a pack and a half a day for over 45 years.  I had some extreme motivation, but it still wasn't easy.  It was, however, way worth it.  I can say it's one of the best things I've ever done.  I now feel better, look better, smell better, and know better. 

I wish I could give you a step-by-step guide to help you get this far.  Truth is, it's not that complicated.  Just don't smoke.  I guess the secret is to want to quit more than you want to smoke.  Then just act naturally. 

I will say this subreddit has helped immensely.  Following the links to quitnow, reading Alan Carr's book, checking out suggestions from other quitters.... they gave me something to do while the cravings were bad the first few days.  After that, it was nice to see folks with big numbers on their badges chiming in.  Now, I'm still here helping folks out privately to pay it forward.

Yes, I still get the odd craving every now and then.  But it's more like nostalgia than compulsion.  Certainly not bad enough to make me doubt the fact that I'm now a non-smoker.  Like most of you.  And may I point out there are now more ex-smokers than current smokers?  That should convince you that it CAN be done.

So keep on keeping on, and thanks again for all your help.

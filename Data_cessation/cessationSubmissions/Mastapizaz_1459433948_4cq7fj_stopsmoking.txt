Guilty Dream

So I have been clean and clear for nine months now with zero hiccups.  Last night I had a vivid dream that I was with friends and stepped out on their balcony and started to smoke a cigarette.  I remember in the dream I took a couple of puffs and was instantly guilt ridden, then tossed the cigarette.  I woke up in a sweat and an extremely guilty conscience.  I have zero desire to smoke anymore so I find it weird I had such a dream.  Anyone with similar stories?

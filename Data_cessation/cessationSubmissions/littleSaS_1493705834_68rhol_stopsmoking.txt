Refused a smoke break today and my workmate's face was priceless!

One of my mates has been away doing relief work for a couple of months. Today he's back on the regular site. Half an hour after I got to work he said "Screw this, littleSaS let's go for a smoke."
I just kind of did the :o face and one of the other workmates, said "You're on your own now buddy, littleSaS is one of us now."
My mate looked so betrayed, but then he was like -O!O-
He is going to listen to my audiobook over the next couple of days, hopefully he'll have a go at quitting too :)

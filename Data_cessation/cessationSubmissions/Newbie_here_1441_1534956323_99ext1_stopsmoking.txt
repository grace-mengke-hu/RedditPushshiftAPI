Day 13 ....

Today is day 13, I was using Chantix but stopped 2 days ago because I was having terrible side effects. I haven’t been having urges to smoke that are too bad.

I got really upset the other night over a Facebook comment and almost went and bought a pack. I am finding it easier day by day, but part of me feels like I’m mourning a loss, on top of the loss of my relationship.

To get rid of some of my stressors I got rid of all social media for the time being, and I am trying to keep myself busy with all sorts of stuff (school, dissertation, gym, wood working). I do find myself feeling more anxious though and in those times I really want to smoke. 

Any advice or encouragement in regards to the anxious times?

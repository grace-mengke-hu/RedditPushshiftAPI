So I Cut My Finger Yesterday...

I was a cook for a few years, so I've nicked myself several times. During my entire kitchen career, I was a smoker. Last night I sliced the side of my finger like I've done many times before. Maybe this is a false attribution to quitting smoking, but I've never seen my blood flow so freely and be such a deep vivid red. As long as I can remember, my blood has always seemed darker and slower flowing. I remember a similar anecdote in Allen Carr's book. I dunno, just a thought.

I quit smoking 3 days ago.

I've tried quitting countless times before, but never like this. I've never once thrown away a perfectly good cigarette, and I've never tried to just quit cold turkey.

This time I did both. On saturday, I woke up and decided that enough was enough. I crushed my pack that had two good cigarettes in it, and stopped. 

Yes, not smelling bad is awesome. i don't notice any positive side effects other than that yet, but I do notice the negative ones. 

I feel extremely irritable, I can't stop eating food, and my body feels weird. I just know it would be so easy to just go buy a pack and say forget it, I'll quit later. But I've always said that: "I'll quit one day." Why not today.

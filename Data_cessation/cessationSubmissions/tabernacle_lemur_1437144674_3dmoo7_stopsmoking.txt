one thing I hope DOESN'T stop soon

One the main reasons I quit was because I would have very real pangs of fear over getting lung cancer.  I could really build it up in my head and start panicking.  Especially after a night of drinking which would equate smoking a bunch.  

Every morning after such a night, as I woke up, I would have this pang of panic as I would realize that I smoked sooo much the previous night.  I would realize that now I had a full day ahead of me of worrying over getting sick and struggling to take deep breaths.  I knew also that I would spend all day creating goals for myself to quit smoking, which would invariably be broken the same day or the next.  It was awful.

I still get these pangs of fear or panic when I wake up, especially after a night out, but now, they don't rule my day. I don't have that anxiety following me around like a dark cloud.  I get the pang when I wake up and then I remember "oh, I actually didn't smoke.  I CAN take a deep breath.  I don't stink. Etc."  That is such a great feeling and a fantastic way to start the day!  

For all the cravings and other side effects of quitting that I hope soon stop, these pangs of anxiety can hang around as long as they like.  They are such a great reminder of what was and what is.

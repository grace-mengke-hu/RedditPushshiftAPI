Need to quit AND lose weight... Feeling overwhelmed.

Basically my doctor has advised me to both quit smoking and lose weight. He said any damage I have done from these two things can be reversed if I get in shape and stop smoking as I am still youngish.

The thing is, I feel daunted by this. I have tried a couple of times to lose weight and quit smoking, and I always give in to one or the other. I feel like doing both at the same time is just too hard.

Any advice from other overweight smokers? I honestly don't smoke heaps... less than a pack a day for sure, usually around 8 -12 per day. But I eat WAY too much. I am scared about gaining even one more kilogram as I am already buying massive clothes and having trouble fitting into seats and stuff.

Should I keep trying to do both? Should I try and lose weight first then quit? Should I quit first and then lose weight? What advice have you got for me.

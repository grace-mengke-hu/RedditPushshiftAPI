BrainHack: Quit while sick!

Im not saying go get sick, but almost a week ago I some how one of my tonsils got really inflamed and I stopped smoking then. I had wanted to quit for a while and thought it was best not to agitate my sickness so I just stopped cold turkey. Now some how I now associate smoking with all the badness from being the terrible sick that I was and havent even wanted to smoke at all. I'm feeling so much better not smoking and enjoying fresh air again. The point of the story is that if you have an opportunity to reboot your brain, do it!

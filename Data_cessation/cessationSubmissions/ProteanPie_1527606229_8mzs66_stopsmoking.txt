Beginning of the 5th day

This morning was the beginning of the 5th day.  My cravings are still there but they feel more like habitual behaviors I'm ignoring and not actual physical cravings.

The downside is that I'm back at work aftet a 4 day weekend and most of my coworkers smoke.  I'm constantly passing them in the hallways or offices and it's like I've become a superman at sniffing out cigarettes on people. 

They smell disgusting...and delicious?  My brain seems to be having a hard time deciding which.  But it is definitely making for a difficult day.

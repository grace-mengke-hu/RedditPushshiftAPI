Psychological Reactions to Quitting

Heya everyone,

This is my first post, but I've been lurking on this page for the past 2 weeks or so, and reading about all of your quits, and how to get through it. Since I quit earlier this month, I've been having odd dreams, incessant anxiety, panic attacks, and feeling rather depressed. I have no previous history with any of these symptoms and am pretty positive it's related to quitting. I'm just wondering if any of you out there have gone through the same thing, and what, if any, advice you can lend me.

Thanks!

Can I do this?

I've been smoking since my sophomore year of college. I was 21-years-old. It started out slowly enough, but I'm 29 now and I've never truly tried to quit smoking. I've had people try to make me quit smoking by stealing whole cartons of my cigarettes, but I always went back eventually. It's what I do during work breaks, if I'm walking, while I'm driving...pretty much once an hour, every hour, from eleven o'clock in the morning til ten o'clock at night. And I'm scared. Over the past seven months, I've lost the ability to talk. I plan on going to an ENT eventually, but what if the loss of my voice is due to smoking? Something that I chose to do to myself? Repeatedly. Daily. So, I've chosen to finally quit, but I seriously don't know how I'm going to do this.

Alternatives to candy/gum

I really like and find it helpful to keep my mouth busy, it makes me not want to smoke purely out of habit or boredom. obviously i can't eat constantly because at some point i'm just full. I've been trying gum and candy, but constantly having sugar on my teeth seems like a bad idea and artificial sugar gives me stomach aches almost immediately. Any ideas on alternatives?

Feeling like I'm close to relapse, not having a good day

My brother is visiting, and it turns out he's smoking. He left his cigarettes on the patio, and now temptation is setting in.

I kinda know in my head that if I have one cigarette, it probably won't be "just one", it'll turn into two, and then another, and another... until it's a full blown habit again, and I'll be back where I started. There's no way I'll be able to have just one.

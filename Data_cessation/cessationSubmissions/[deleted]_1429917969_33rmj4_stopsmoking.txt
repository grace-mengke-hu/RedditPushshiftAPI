Cravings in Waves?

Hi all. I've perused this sub a bit, and it seems like a lot of people have been smoking for longer/more than I was. At my worst I probably smoked 7 cigs a day. It was about two and a half months ago that I got sick, didn't smoke, realized how strong my cravings were and decided to quit.

I quit cold turkey. It was hard at first, but after about two weeks I honestly didn't even think about smoking. That is until the past week. Almost out of nowhere (it has been a stressful week, but no triggers or anything) I've been having SERIOUS cravings and having a hard time not giving in. Has anyone else experienced this?

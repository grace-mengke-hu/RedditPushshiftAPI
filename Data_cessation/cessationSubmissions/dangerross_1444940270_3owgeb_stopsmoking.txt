A big win during hard times.

I had been debating posting this, but what the hell.

A week ago my Grandpa died. He was an amazing man and I was proud to be able to call him my friend. He smoked for 50 years and quit in 1989 and never smoked again after that. He died at the age of 97.

He always told me, "Dangerross, just quit. If you are able to do it, NEVER smoke again. If you have even one puff you will be back at it. Just stop."

He died of lung cancer, and that helped cement in my mind that I never want to smoke again. 44 days in and I'm still going strong. Love ya, gramps.

Freedom to sleepover

I just want to share a bit. Today is my quit date (like my hundredth quit date) but I actually feel ready and confident this time.
I was smoking bongs with tobacco and weed for years so it’s been a challenge getting over both of those together but I bought a oil pen thing to smoke for the weed withdrawals at night and tried it last night and feeling encouraged.
The best part is that my I’ve never told my dad I smoke, maybe he’s figured but we’ve never talked about it. He’s invited my daughter and I to sleepover at his and his gfs house this weekend. I would have never been able to do that before because I seriously could not imagine going a night without a few bongs before bed. And there’s no way I would want to bring it there. So this is like a whole new level of freedom! I’m so stoked that I can finally feel like we can go away for a whole day or night and not be worried about having a major breakdown because of withdrawals! 
Since I’ve been cutting back to lead up to today too I notice such a major difference. I was constantly anxious and never satisfied feeling. Like I could smoke until I pass out almost and still wanted more. But that seems to be gone already just from the major cutting back. Oh my gosh it’s just such a weight off my shoulders. 
I just hope I remember how much work it took to get here and how worth it it is to be smoke free.

Really, really, really want to quit.

Hi everyone,
I've been a smoker for roughly 5 years. It's not been THAT long, but I smoke about a pack a day/every two days, and it's a nasty habit. I am a qualified high school teacher and I don't want to come to school reeking of cigarettes, or have a student accidentally catch me in the car on the way home. I have to provide a good example for my students and if I keep up this habit, I won't.

I have pretty severe anxiety problems, which is why I picked up smoking in the first place- it soothed me.

I've just met a guy who doesn't smoke at all, and we're getting on pretty well, but I know that he finds it gross and really, I find it gross too.

I just get anxious so often that I feel that I need to light up and calm myself down. I don't want to use this obnoxious habit as a crutch or excuse for my mental health issues - I want to be rid of it once and for all. It's not doing me any favours!


So please, please let me know what worked for you - I really REALLY want to quit and am looking forward to living a healthier lifestyle!

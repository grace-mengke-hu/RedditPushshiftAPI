Second time around

So this is my second go. 
I'm doing it for the health reasons in part. But also because my other half hates it and he doesn't want to be with a smoker. Hand in hand they're pretty good reasons I think. Maybe. 
Day six today, I went all that time without one and had half a cigarette today and I feel so awful. Like I've killed a puppy or something! 
I'm using an app and one of the mission is to do this. So... Does anyone have any tips on what I can do when I have an insane craving? I think it's habitual and physiological now though.

Been smoking for 9 years, finally time to quit.

I'm 21 years old and started smoking, not heavily but a few a day when I was 12, went up to 1-2 packs a day between 14-17, then I've been cut back to about half a pack a day, sometimes more, for 4 years.

I recently moved 900 miles away from my hometown, where all of my friends are smokers, and now only one of my new friends are. I have a new boyfriend and we've been dating about 4 months now and he doesn't smoke. I feel so gross when I do smoke around him, and he's a very active person and I can't keep up with him because I'm out of breath if I run 5 feet. 

I woke up this morning with a sore throat, been sick for a month, and it keeps getting worse because I keep smoking.

So I'm going to try to be done! 
I'm going to finish reading Alan Carrs book today and hopefully that will help!
Please wish me luck, I'm terrified.

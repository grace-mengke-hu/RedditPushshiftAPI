Quitting and drinking.

Hey guys first off, just reading peoples posts is enough to keep the everyday cravings away. 

I've 'quit' in the past and found it ok because I sort of rationalised my addictions. For me it was all about the situations I'd usually have a smoke and weaning myself out of those routines. 

For example, in work I would go outside for a fag every couple of hours but I was also going out for some fresh air. When I stopped I found that because I stopped going outside it made it so much worse so I would pop outside and just take in some fresh air. 

This sort of thing has worked for me and I've been able to handle any craving this way. 

I'm starting to feel chest pains and coughing, this was enough to scare me to stop. 

My big problem is when I have a drink. It's like a Jekyll and Hyde moment, as soon as I've drunk my first pint nobody is stopping me smoking. Drinking is something I won't quit, I play a lot of rugby and so do my friends. It's a staple of our social circle. 

My plan was to have a wee dram of whiskey an hour or so before bed and ride out the cravings. I wanted to see if anyone had any tips. I am thinking it's just another thing I need to wrench the routine out of. 

Thanks for any advice!

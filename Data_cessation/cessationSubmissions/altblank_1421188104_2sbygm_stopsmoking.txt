almost a year, and cravings begin...

yeah, so this is interesting. for the past couple of weeks, i've been feeling that i need to bum a smoke somewhere and spend a few minutes smoking.

went to las vegas over new year's, and there wasn't a craving.

had loads of alcohol, wasn't a craving.

suddenly, back home now, i've had the most unnecessary cravings. these hit every couple of hours or so.

haven't caved in yet, and don't plan on caving in, either. but just thought i would throw this out there.

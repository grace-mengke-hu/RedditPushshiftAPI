Quitting smoking when I'm starting school

Hey guys, a little history about me: I quit smoking before using allan carr's easy way for about 3 months, and then I was an idiot and caved in for god knows what reason. I'm ready to do it again, (unfortunately easy way doesn't work a second time, so I'm on my own). My main worry is, when I first quit smoking the entire time, all the way up to 3 months I was just EXHAUSTED 24/7 I slept all the time, even up to the day I lit up again. But now i'm starting school (just upgrading my math, but I need **100% of all my focus** in order to succeed, seeing how much I struggle in math) and i'm very worried that quitting smoking is going to get in the way of that.  Does anyone here have any advice for quitting smoking cold turkey WHILE studying, or doing something new like starting a new job etc.  


(i'm dead set on cold turkey, I will absolutely not use patches, gum or e cigs)

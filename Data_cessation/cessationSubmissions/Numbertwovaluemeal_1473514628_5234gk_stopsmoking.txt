Well...Today's not great.

Guys - first of all, I've been lurking since day 1, and this subreddit has helped me immensely. So thank you.

I'm an hour shy of Day 5. And today has been awful. I sailed through 1-4, without too much trouble. But I'm home today, and I don't smoke at work.  It hasn't been a "wave" it has been a constant nagging since I woke up, and I'm in a real shit mood. I thought I had gotten through the worst of it, but I literally would have just tried to fistfight a sinkful of dishes if that is possible. How do I get rid of this nagging annoying feeling? 

I have had no nicotine, no gum, no crutch. Trying to just be normal sauce. I read Carr's book on Monday and then I just quit. Hasn't been too terrible, just some cravings now and again and no sleep for the first 2 nights. The common consensus seems to be that I'm through the worst of it, so why is today the WORST? Also, I'm a secret smoker so I am relying soley on my significant other and you fine internet strangers as a support system. Help help help (thank you!)

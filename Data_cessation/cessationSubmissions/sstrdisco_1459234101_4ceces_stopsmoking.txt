Still experiencing changes at 11 months!

It is INSANE how much my sense of smell and taste have changed since I quit smoking. And that it keeps changing just blows my mind. At any rate, this week it's like everything is exploding with smell and taste. It's to the point that I'm overwhelmed by it. It's so strange, but so awesome. If you're just now starting out, I promise you that it is the best choice EVER!

Freedom Fund

So I've decided to set up a standing order that transfers every Sunday the amount I have saved not smoking that week (based on the average I was spending) to a dormant bank account. Said account now contains Â£303.30. I figure this is an easy, tangible way to remind myself how much I am saving and not allow myself to get in to an all too dangerous 'I'm not smoking so why not' spending mentality. A day at a time I am looking forward to seeing that sum increase over the coming weeks, months, and years.

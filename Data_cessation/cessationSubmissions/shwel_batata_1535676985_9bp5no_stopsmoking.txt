Today I found a loose cigarette in my purse and I threw it out

I haven’t smoked for 6 days and suddenly I found a loose cigarette in my purse. I made an excuse that if I just smoke it, it won’t torture me and I can get back to peacefully being a non-smoker. Then I told my husband about the cigarette and he gave me some words of encouragement and left it alone. A few hours later, I broke it and threw it in the trash. It’s the first of my many attempts of quitting smoking where I destroy a ciggie, I usually smoke till I run out then stop buying but I’m so proud that I destroyed it myself.

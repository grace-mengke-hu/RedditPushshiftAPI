Just put out my last cig.

Smoked on and off for three years, seriously quit once before, started again after losing my job, and then again after losing my best friend to cancer. I've just had enough with the bullshit, and even though part of my mind is saying 'come on, just buy another pack, you can't imagine day-to-day life without it, the other half is going 'fuck yeah, dude! Come on, just get through tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that, come on'!
      Just felt the need to come here and spout something off, all the stuff i've read here is really encouraging.

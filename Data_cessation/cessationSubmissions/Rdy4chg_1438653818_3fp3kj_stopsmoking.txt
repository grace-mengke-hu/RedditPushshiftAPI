Motivational posters

Whenever I try to get over something in life I like to have motivational posters, quotes, and whathaveyou around my room, on my phone, and share posts on Facebook to give me that motivational boost to help out the determined mind. 

So far in my room I have three papers on my wall that I wrote up myself. Two are the difference between the life of an addict and the life of freedom. I filled up both sheets of paper of the positives and negatives of each lifestyle path and let me tell you there's so many more positives with the path of freedom. 

Then I have one I just made tonight that says, "the greatest enemy you will face today is yourself. Don't let your guard down. Don't give up. Don't lose hope. Fight back!" 

I plan to make more. It's kind embarrassing having pieces of paper on my wall and my room mate laughs at me but it's nice to look at these reminders and motivational sheets when I get up in the morning to prepare me for the day. 

Anyone else do this? Or am I the only one

Made it through a long wedding weekend--feels like a breakthrough moment!

Thank you, /r/stopsmoking, for helping me develop the fortitude to even attempt avoiding cigarettes in social situations that would otherwise have me smoking an unholy amount. I went to the wedding of one of my last housemates before I moved in with my partner, and dozens of our mutual friends from those years came, too. Usually, being around those folks gets me smoking the huge quantities that we all used to smoke, and I'd been unfortunately dreading the trip because of my fear that this would happen again.

Fortunately, I felt totally fine not smoking and didn't have a serious craving the entire trip! We even spent some time in a couple of very smoky bars, which used to be a solid trigger but now is (surprise) kinda gross. It was nice to see that the handful of folks who are still smoking have cut down a lot, some of them even finally talking about wanting to get the gumption to quit, and no one gave any of the quitters any guff or pressure. 

I can't believe how mentally different I feel after this. I'd assumed that some situations would always be unbearably difficult, but only two weeks in and one of the *most difficult* situations was absolutely no problem at all. I'm sure that would have been different if I'd gone on this trip two days after quitting instead of two weeks, so let me put that out there for my fellow fresh-quitters: once you get past the first couple weeks, your resolve is already probably much higher than you could ever imagine.

I'm so glad you incredible people are here. I appreciate all the help you've given me leading up to this.

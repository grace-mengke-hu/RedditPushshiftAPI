Struggling on day one

I recently finished EASYWAY, I was so excited to quit. Finished reading the book last night, gave my smokes and lighter away, I was free!
This morning when I woke up, I gave in and asked the neighbour for my smokes back. I have had 4 today, and the guilt is killing me. I have one left, and now she has none. 
I want to quit, I want to be free. Any advice on getting through the first few days?

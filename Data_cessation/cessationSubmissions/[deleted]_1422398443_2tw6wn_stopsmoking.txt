I smoke because I'm depressed.

I feel like cigarette's are the one thing that I can count on to be there. I don't know if that makes any sense but it sounds so stupid reading that aloud. I don't know why I'm depressed either. I have a great job and have good friends, but still, something seems missing. There's a joy in my life that's missing. That missing void, I have filled with cigarette's and I hate it. Maybe I should talk to someone.

Any way, thanks for reading this. I don't usually write selfposts like this but I had to write this one :/ I know it's really corny. I'm going to go head to the gym and then try to start reading Alan Carr's book when I get home.

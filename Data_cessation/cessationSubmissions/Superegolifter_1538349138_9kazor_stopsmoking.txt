The Three Day Cycle

Continuously running into the same issue, and created a shit pattern this past year. Had a good run of 3 years not smoking, then this past year started back up. after the first few months of this year I've been using vape products as an alternative. Still looking to kick nicotine, as the vape products are a crutch that still hinder my health. For the past few months it's been the same thing every weekend, and after failing once again I need to figure out a strategy to kick the cycle. 

Every week I will smoke during the week days, as my job is stressful, and requires a lot of focus. Then by Friday I'm ready to quit nicotine. Friday night sucks with me staying home, Saturday feels weird and I can push through it. Then every Sunday I cave to cravings, usually because I'm worried I wont be able to focus on Monday. I'm hitting a wall, and after another failed weekend I'm forgetting how good it was when i wasn't a smoker.

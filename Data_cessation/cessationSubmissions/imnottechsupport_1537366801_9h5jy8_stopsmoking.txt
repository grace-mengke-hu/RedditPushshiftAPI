Well, here we go again

The last time I had quit, I made it 20 months nicotine free.  During that time, I lost a good friend of mine to an unknown infection while in the hospital.  Then we lost my mother in law to cancer.  Then another friend to a series of strokes.  All of that took place over about 10 months, and I held it together.

Then my dog, my best friend of eight years, was diagnosed with cancer.  Successful surgery, but just a couple weeks later he had to be put down because it had spread to his brain, no quality of life.  And I finally cracked.  Straight to the store, and spent the next year and change right back where I was (and worse...around 1.25 packs a day).  It didn't help that I was traveling for work for several months, road trips and hotel stays didn't do me any favors.

If I can offer any advice to first time quitters...it doesn't matter how long it's been, how confident you are that you beat it, or how badly you are upset and stressed.  Never pick up a cigarette again...**ever**.  It goes down like you never quit, but faster, and the "I'll just have one more" turns into "I'll finish this pack" and "I'll quit on Saturday after we go out for drinks".  That turned into 16 months of smoking before I could convince myself to really try again.

To put that in a bit more perspective, that's approximately 12,000 cigarettes (16m * 30d *20cigs *1.25packs).

Almost exactly three years after I last quit, I am on my third day smoke free, again.  To my friends and family, I apologize for the next few weeks in advance :-P

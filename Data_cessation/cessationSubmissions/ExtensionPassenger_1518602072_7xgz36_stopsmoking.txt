2 months in

Today (the 14th) is two months since I quit smoking. Fucking sucks. Every day, I think about how much I want a cigarette. Plan on staying quit, because I want to save money and stay relatively healthy, but jesus christ, it is fucking awful.

Made it five months once, but then I gave in (was working in a convenience store at the time, so I was literally surrounded by them). Thinking of getting a vape, but I know it wouldn't be the same. 

One thing that helps-- I saw that a small pouch of TOP costs $8.50 where I am living now. I used to spend $4 for the small pouch. I have a decent manufacturing job at the moment, but that's still just a crazy amount of money to spend on such shitty tobacco. I once found a brand that only cost $3 in Minneapolis. It made me spit up, it tasted so disgusting, but it got the job done. 

The worst part about quitting is that there are no real, tangible rewards. I will be pissed with myself if I start again, but right now, I don't feel especially proud, happy, or good in any way. My depression and anxiety are worse, and there are a lot of moments that just feel incomplete without a smoke. But that's where willpower comes in, and so far I haven't capitulated.

The good thing is that even if I start again, I got a nice tolerance break, saved up some cash, and maybe gave my lungs a minute to clear out. But I'm hoping I can just keep this up forever, one day at a time.

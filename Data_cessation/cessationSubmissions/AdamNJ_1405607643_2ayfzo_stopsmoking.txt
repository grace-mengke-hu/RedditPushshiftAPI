One Month!

I just want to say thank you to everyone on r/stopsmoking.  I have actually made it 30 days!  After 30 years (yes, years)  of pack-a-day smoking, and a number of failed quit attempts in the past, I never thought I could do it so easily.  I really do not miss smoking anymore.  I've had some cravings, but not as bad as I thought they would be, and I've actually focused on my diet and exercise and have lost a couple of pounds in the process.  At my age (47), every little bit helps.

This group is a great support mechanism for me when I do have my moments of weakness.  So, again, I say thank you all.  I now am on my way to a smoke free life.

I'm done.

Im sick of waling up with a sore throat and the taste of hamster cage in my mouth (seems like that to me). Im sick of spending cash that I could be spending on my son, on cigarettes. Im sick of having to go outside in the rain to get my fix. Im sick of coughing up yellow shit in the shower. Im sick of wheezing, and being tired after 2 minutes of cycling. Im sick of looking ten years older than i actually am. Im sick of smoking. Im sick of stained teeth. P.s. Im sick of forgetting apostrophes, but i havent worked out how to use them on my new phone yet.

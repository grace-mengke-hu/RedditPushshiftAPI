At what point can you say you've officially quit smoking?

After having tried to quit so many times it'd be impossible to count; only ever making it two, three, or four days --tops. I'm curious at what point can I say: "I've quit smoking cigarettes"? 

I've gone from half a pack a day for seven years to zero, for the past 9 days. This attempt feels different; I wanna say I've quit for good but I'm worried that'll only jynx myself.

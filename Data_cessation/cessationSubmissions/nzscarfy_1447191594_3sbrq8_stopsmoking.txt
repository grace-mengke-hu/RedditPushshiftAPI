The Right Motivation

I've been at University for four years. Smoking basically crept up on me in my first year. Started with the nights out, progressed to full blown smoker by the end of the first year. 

Over the next three years I told people multiple times I was quitting, then rationalised myself back into through stress and what not. Fast forward to now, and I've just finished my degree and am moving into a professional job next year, I found myself thinking that I simply cannot smoke whilst being in an office setting next year. I remember how much I used to hate the smell when I was a non-smoker and I would hate people to think that of me, especially while working in a professional sense with clients. 

Basically got home from university and decided enough was enough I need to stop now. Haven't had one in over a month and felt zero withdrawals. I was smoking half a pack a day and went cold turkey, and withdrawals were non-existent. Basically the message I want to get across is if you're in the right headspace about quitting and why you want to do it, then you don't have to try and rationalise another pack to yourself. 

JUST DO IT!

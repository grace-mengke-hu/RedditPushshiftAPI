Alright, DAY ONE ALMOST COMPLETE.

I can't believe I've made it almost a day! Holy hell. I've been having pretty intense cravings already. I have almost 4 months of sobriety from drinking and drugs. I've been a smoker for 5 years and I'm hoping I can use a lot of similar techniques to quit smoking. I absolutely HATE all the cigarettes butts I throw on the ground and the damage it does to the environment (i'm pursuing a degree in fucking environmental engineering for pete's sake), I hate giving my money to the monstrous companies, I want my smell and taste back, and I can't stand the thought of being chained down to anything else. I want to be completely free from all addiction. Smoking goes against everything I believe in. I was using the "new to sobriety" things as an excuse to keep smoking but call me a quitter, I'm DONE.

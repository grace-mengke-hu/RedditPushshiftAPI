I relapsed so I came here

I want to comment on every one of these post and share my tips and tricks but I feel hypocritical doing it because I relapsed. After a month and 25 days, I smoked. Now, I set up a date and it's time for round two. Smoke free actually brought me here so we'll see what happens the second time around. ðŸ¤—

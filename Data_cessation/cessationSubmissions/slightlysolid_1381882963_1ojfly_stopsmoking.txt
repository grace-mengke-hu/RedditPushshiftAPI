Free Quit Smoking Classes for Florida Redditors

Hope I don't offend anyone with a little bit of non-profit advertising but I want to let all redditors in Florida know there is a free program called Quit Smoking Now that holds classes to help people quit their tobacco use. Everything is free and all you have to do is call to register for the class of your choice. Classes are in select areas throughout Florida but most everyone should have one near them. If you are interested in attending a class near you, please visit http://www.ahectobacco.com for more information.

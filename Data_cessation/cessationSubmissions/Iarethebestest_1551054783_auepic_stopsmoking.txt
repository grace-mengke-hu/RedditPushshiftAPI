How i managed to stop smoking

Hello everyone, my today's mission is to help at least 3 smokers to quit, so i'm going to share how i've done it.

1- Use the payed version of SmokeFree App, the daily missions sure are a nice way to keep yourself busy and feel like everyday you achieve something

2- Read Alan Carr's, Easyway. This book helped me so much to understand my adiction and what needs to be done in order to quit.

3- I bought a nicotine free e-cig that i would carry with me if i were to have a coffee or hang out with my smoker friends.

4- I replaced some of my smoking breaks with tea breaks, there is something relaxing about making tea.

5- I quitted cafeine, for me, coffee was a major trigger to smoke, also i started to feel  sleepy for the first few days, and napping more often sure made those days go faster.

To concluded, the last 3 were more personal, but one thing i would say it's a must it's the book. Easyway has made my quitting journey a lot easier. 
Hope this helps someone.

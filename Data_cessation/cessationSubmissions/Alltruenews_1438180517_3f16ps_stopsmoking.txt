Even hospitals don't get it.

Non-smoker here. My sister-in-law has lost almost all of her teeth and recently suffered a brain bleed - all from smoking for 35 years. When the brain bleed happened, she was medflighted to a fantastic hospital in Boston (USA) and received amazing care which included two brain surgeries. She was released 12 days later with zero smoking susation tools, alternatives to smoking or counciling and left absolutely free to smoke on release day. She imeadiatly began smoking and continues today. The finest hospitals in the country just don't get it.

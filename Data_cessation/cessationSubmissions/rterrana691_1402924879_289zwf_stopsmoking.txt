Decided to quit last night.

I'm 22 and I've been smoking half a pack to a full pack a day for 8 years. Last Friday when I was outside smoking while all of my friends were inside  I decided this was my last pack. I'm sick of coughing, taking "breaks", having extra bad "ciggy" breath when I wake up. And most of all I don't like not being in control. So I had my last cig yesterday and so far I'm ok. Just took a break with a co-worker and he smoked and I had a dumb mint. But I'm fine, just gotta wait out the physical addiction and i'll be ok.

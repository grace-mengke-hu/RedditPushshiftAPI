What's going on with my lungs? Help please

I've been smoking since 12 years old, progressively smoking more and more frequently. I'm 20 now, went from smoking an ounce a week for half a year to now no longer being able to smoke anything due to trouble breathing afterwards. I quit due to getting bronchitis and having a weird experience from smoking weed. Had pins and needles sensation through out my whole body (even my tongue) and my hands clenched up, I went to the hospital and the doctor couldn't tell me what It was that I had experienced. It's been a week that I haven't smoked anything and last night I had a few puffs from a vape (just normal vape flavouring stuff idk it wasn't mine had no nicotine) and it fucked my ability to breathe. I get cravings but it's not even worth fixing my cravings because I value being able to breathe and not suffocate to death. 
Has this happened to anyone? Can anyone tell me what's going on with my lungs?
The doctor told me I don't have bronchitis anymore.

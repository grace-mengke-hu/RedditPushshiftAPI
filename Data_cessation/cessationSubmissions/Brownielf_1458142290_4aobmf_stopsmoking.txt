Patches

I am quitting. I have had enough, I don't feel well, I don't sleep well, I am spending too much money on something that is killing me.

My question is the efficacy of the patch. I smoked my last at 9:40 this morning and went out and bought some patches. It has now been almost 2 hours, and I feel ok. When I am done with the patch, am I going to have the same type of withdrawal symptoms as if I had just quit without the patches?

Thanks!

I failed...

I failed. I was 9 days in, and doing so well. One bad day, followed by one bad decision and here I am. Back in the cigarette saddle again. I'm so angry at myself. This is the umteenth time I've tried to quit and I just feel like such a failure. I don't want my kid to see me smoking. I don't want her growing up used to me stinking like cigarettes. I hate this. I hate that I'm THIS addicted to something. I quit much harder things without a problem, I even quit during my pregnancy and for a year afterwards. Then, I slipped and haven't been able to fully stop since. Ugh. Sorry for the vent, just feeling low on myself for failing yet again.

I will quit.

I really really need to stop smoking. Many reasons why, like I hardly ever eat now where as before I had a huge appetite. I miss lessons at school to have a cigarette. I cough myself to the point of vomiting. I need help on this. I smoke around 10+ a day. Is cutting down to 3 a day, then slowly cutting to 2, then to 1, and eventually to none a good plan? or should I just quit altogether and try and control the craving? What's the best way?

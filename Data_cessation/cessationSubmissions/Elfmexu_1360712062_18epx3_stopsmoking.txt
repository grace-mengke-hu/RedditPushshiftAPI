Drinking night...and a vote...

so, hello fellow quitters. last week i had my first heavy drinking night since i quit... none of my friends are smokers so i felt safe there, but then someone brought out clove cigarretes(djarum black), and i caved to the smell of them and the peer pressure  (its clove not tobacco blabla). so there i am, borroring my cousing's black clove cigarrete, i took a single hit, and as that smoke went down my then 85 day smoke clear throat and lungs, i felt like the first time i smoked when i was like 17 years old, could not avoid coughing, and it tasted horrible, i felt nauseous and handed the cigarrete back saying, i hated it, and im glad i did, that did actually take the craving out because i realized how horrible they are...

that is my story.. the vote is for..

did i cheat my quit?

should i restart m y badge after caving for that single hit?

What lies did you tell to yourself to keep smoking?

What are some of the lies you used to (or still tell yourself if you're still smoking) tell yourself to condone your smoking?

Some of mine were:

"I'm still young.  I can always quit later if my health gets bad."

"I'll never be able to stop."

"My grandpa smoked for years and he never got cancer"

"I'll quit when I'm ready to quit"

or my absolute favorite lie I told myself

"I can't quit smoking because I love smoking!"

I also used to tell myself I needed to smoke to keep myself productive.  Yeah I know, a weird one.

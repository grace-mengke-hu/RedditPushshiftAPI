To the New Year's Resolution people: You've already done the most important part.

You are here, so you desire to quit. That's over half the battle, *way* over really.  You can't get another person to quit, that rarely happens.  People who quit quit because they have decided to quit, just like you.  Now all you have to do is keep your resolve.  Let the withdrawal symptoms peter out (they will) and allow yourself to be nicotine free.  There will likely be a few bumps in the road but keeping in mind all of the advantages of being smoke free will help with that.  And when you truly *want* to quit, which is why you're here, it just isn't that hard.  Businesses would like to sell you NRT and pharmaceuticals but you don't need them.  What you need is the knowledge that you're not giving up anything when you quit.  I promise you, your only regret when you **do** end your addiction is that you will wish you had done it sooner.  Wait until January 1st if you want, but if it was me I'd get a jump start on it now.  Every day without inhaling those noxious fumes is a day better spent.

I plan to post everyday before I go to sleep. This is day 1.

During a previous quit attempt I found that posting daily before I go to sleep helped me look forward to ending the day smoke-free and being proud to be able to post something at night. 

This is day 1. Thanks to everyone in this community who shows support and motivates us to stay strong.

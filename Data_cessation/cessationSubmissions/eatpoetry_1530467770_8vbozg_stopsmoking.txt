Day 1 - Things I Won't Miss

I set a quit date for July 1st, and today's the day! I had my last cigarette at around 11:50 last night and gave the rest of the pack to my father-in-law. Here are a few things I won't miss now that I've quit:

1. Smelling bad. I always thought there was no point in buying nice perfume because I was just going to smell like cigarettes no matter what.
2. Smoking at work. I work at a school and I don't have a car, so I would always have to trek 3 or 4 blocks away from the school to have a smoke on my break, and then walk back uphill.
3. Coughing. This morning I was coughing a lot, but for once it actually felt like I was clearing my lungs, not just gasping for air.
4. Energy. I swear I smoking makes me so lethargic. When I've tried to quit before I remember having a lot more energy. Also, cigarettes reduce oxygen to the brain and I'm sure that has an effect on my concentration and memory.

I'm trying to chew cinnamon gum every time I'm craving a cigarette. I've also noticed that something I read on this sub is true, if I can get over the craving for 15 minutes, my mind moves on. Last night I was at a big campout with my SO's family, and his brother was saying, "cigarettes were actually one of the easier things to quit", compared to other addictive substances. That really reassured me because everyone has been saying how hard it was, and I was glad to hear someone say it might not have to be that hard.

I've picked a date and am scared to death!

I've picked a date, Monday, and I'm scared to death. The fact is I've been drinking and smoking more than I ever have before in my life these past 10 months or so after my girfriend died. So I'm scared that it's going to be like falling off a cliff! I will use the patch, but refuse to use any other nicotine replacement. What am I truly facing? I've made a top 10 reasons, methods, aids list .. joine this group and another forum. m I prepared, or is there such a thing. 50 years I've been smoking! What an incredible idiot I am! Thanks for any input or suggests (as long as you please don't recommend vaping et al).

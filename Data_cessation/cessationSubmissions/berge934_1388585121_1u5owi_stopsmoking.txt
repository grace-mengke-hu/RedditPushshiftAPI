Two weeks no smoking! Question

I haven't smoked in two weeks. I am quitting a lot of other stuff as well while also starting an exercise regime. My girlfriend says I have become distant. I think I am just in my head because of all of the changes does that seem accurate? Has any of your loved ones complained you are distant?

I also have had a terrible time sleeping, I have read through r/stopsmoking posts and this seems to be normal. Currently I am just trying to be patient and be more present for my girl. Thanks for listening This subreddit has really helped a lot. 

Happy New Year everyone.

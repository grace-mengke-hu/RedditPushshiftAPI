Love/Hate relationship with cigarettes

Hi,  


I've currently just reached 30 hours without a cigarette - cold turkey, no replacements. I'm a pack a day smoker and sometimes more. I've tried to quit plenty of times. For background, I'm 27, female and have smoked for 5 years. It started off as just sometimes, not everyday, to a couple a day, to a pack or more a day which has been consistent for 2 years.

I've been reading websites for tips trying to quit smoking, but even reading about it makes me really want a delicious cigarette. Even when I don't physically crave a cigarette, most days I just go out for one because I feel like I'd be doing myself a disservice NOT to. I wake up and have a cigarette straightaway because I feel like I should.

Recently, cigarettes just started tasting bad to me. I still go out, because everyone in my office smokes and the only way I can talk to my boss about work stuff is to go out for a smoke with him. My coworkers give me cigarettes if I haven't bought them. I smoke a ton when I'm drinking but smoking like 20 or more cigarettes on a single night out makes me feel really sick. I can barely walk up a flight of stairs without feeling out of breath. I sleep all day. I smoke instead of eat half the time.

I'm trying to focus on what I hate. But I can't help this feeling that I'm doing something bad to myself by not smoking. Like I'm wasting my life if I don't smoke. Like I just need a few more months of smoking so I can achieve my best in other areas of life and not to punish myself. I know this is silly. 

  
Does anyone have tips for fighting through this stage? It's 9am right now and I'm still awake from last night. Thanks

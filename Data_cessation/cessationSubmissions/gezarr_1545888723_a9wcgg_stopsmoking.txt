5 days in, constantly feel like I'm overheating

My whole body, (hands in perticular) feels as though it is way hotter than it should be. Ill wake up in the night drenched in sweat even though i have the heat off in my house and it is likely around 50F. Has anyone else experienced this? If so how long did it last for you?

Am I cheating?

Is it cheating to use an electronic cigarette with nicotine in it?  I haven't had a cigarette in 2 weeks, despite some really rough events.  This past week alone, my cousin passed away, I had to put my dog down, and my boyfriend's dad passed away.  I cannot make this stuff up.

Still, I feel like this attempt to quit has been the easiest for me.  Am I just fooling myself?

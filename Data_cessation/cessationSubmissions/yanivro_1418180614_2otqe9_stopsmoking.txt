Pros and cons of quitting.

So guys , i'm holding really good , i feel much better , and much happier since i quit smoking.

I smell all new stuff i couldn't smell before and i can actually breath and climb a hill in my city . that hill was my enemy.


Although , I'm experiencing some problems sleeping lately , it's my second night in a row that i stayed awake in bed...its now 05:00AM here...

Is there any chance it related to the rehab?

Soo.. I've been "quitting" for over a month now. I do fantastic, no cravings after 3 days...then when I drink ugh!

I'm new to reddit too, so I hope I am doing this right.   Does anyone else fall down if they have a drink?  I feel like I won't ever be able to enjoy a margarita again if I want to stay a nonsmoker. I went 8 days last week, then had a few martinis with friends.  My roommate smokes and I had 3 of his when I came home.  Started over, now on day 3 again.  Really doing great so far again.

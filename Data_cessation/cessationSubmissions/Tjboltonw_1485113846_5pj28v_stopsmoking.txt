Struggling

Hey, i found this reddit page and thought maybe you could help. I Havent smoke in over 7 weeks, but have been still intaking Nicotine from a Electronic Cigarette. Moving from 12mg to 6. However i am finding it hard to resist now that university is getting more and more stressful. Any advice?
Thanks Tj

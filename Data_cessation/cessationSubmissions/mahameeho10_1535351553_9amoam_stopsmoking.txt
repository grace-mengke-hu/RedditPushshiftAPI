5th day cold turkey

The first 2 days were the worst , headache, depression, anxiety, moral pain , thank god now I feel much better ,  sure I am still missing the cigarette with the morning coffee or while talking on the phone or during breaks at work , as a teacher I used to smoke every break and relieve stress, and now it’s difficult, but I won’t smoke again ! Enough is enough , 15 years smoking , it’s nothing but shit

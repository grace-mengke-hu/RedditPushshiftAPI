5 days in and hating life

I have smoked a little under a pack a day for the last 8 years and I've been saying I will quit but I never made the effort to because I wasn't ready. Well let me tell you I'm still not ready, but I got a really bad case of bronchitis 5 days ago and smoking felt like inhaling acid. I usually smoke through my coughs anyway but then I stay sick for three times as long, so despite the fact that it physically hurt too bad to smoke I thought it would be a good time to lay off so I can get better sooner. Well now I'm past the worst part of my illness and I'm starting to feel better. I still have a cough but I'm not stuck to my bed like I was a few days ago. I'm back at work and back at my normal routine and I'm having a really hard time. I'm so pissed off and frustrated and all I want to do is go buy a pack of cigarettes and say fuck it. On top of that my boyfriend and I are going to a concert tonight where I know the urge will be immeasurable. I've been chewing gum and I've been using NRT lozenges but it's not the physical cravings I'm dealing with anymore. It's the mental and habitual part that just has me so fucking pissed off. Why? When will it go away? Ugh!

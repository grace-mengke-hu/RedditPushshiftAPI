Everything stinks

I stopped smoking a week ago and now I'm acutely aware of how much everything in my life smells awful. 

Anyone have any good pointers on deodorizing your life? My house doesn't smell great (and I was an outdoor smoker). My car smells absolutely disgusting. My clothing all stinks. Everything.

279 Days: I started eating chewing gun whenever I feel like smoking

I'm not into reading books, but I read The Power of Habit and I learned that I have to replace habits instead of removing them. So I bought chewing gums that come in a plastic container with a lid. So everytime I have the urge to smoke I open the lid like a pack of cigarettes and take a couple. I really recommend it to anyone who wants to quite.

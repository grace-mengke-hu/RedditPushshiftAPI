[UPDATE] re: I am in a hospital bed, about to have a quadruple bypass because of smoking.

On April 28th, I posted about going into quadruple bypass surgery linking it to my smoking.  Although my doctors ruled out smoking as the top cause (faulty stents from 2009 surgery were mostly to blame) they still believe it was a mitigating factor. Smoking causes your veins to contract. By contracting, they are more prone to clogs. It also meant my previous stents were collapsed. Doctors said I was lucky if 1 blood cell at a time was able to make it through that area.

I am alive, thanks to science and timing...but that is it. Had I waited another day, I would surely have collapsed and died.

Smoking almost killed me. Don't let it kill you.

Right now, a simple visit to the grocery store for 10 minutes causes me to sleep for 3 1/2 hours from exhaustion. I can not laugh or my chest feels like it is being stabbed with a hundred knives. I can not hug anyone, push myself up in a chair, or cough without screaming.

I am not sure what is next, but I do know I am lucky to be alive and I'm 2 1/2 weeks free of smoking.

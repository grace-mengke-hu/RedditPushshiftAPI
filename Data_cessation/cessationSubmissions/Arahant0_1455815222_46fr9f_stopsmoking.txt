Why is this so hard?

I've had three of my quits stick for more than a week, the other "attempts" only lasted hours. I give in so easily, it's like I don't even want to quit...but I do. Smoking is eating me up inside. I'm developing a twitch, my life is being consumed by this addiction. It's all I ever think about. Wanting to quit when smoking, and wanting to smoke when quitting. I'm fucking miserable... I'm dating a yoga instructor, the love of my life, and she doesn't push me to quit, but I know she wants me to. How do I do this, guys? I'm going crazy.

What were your nicotine substitutes, and what were your withdrawal symptoms?

Hi /r/stopsmoking!  
I am currently trying to stop smoking, which is going pretty well overall. As for now I am massive sweatings, anxiety, and itching all over my body which I would consider not being so nice at all. However, I have been thinking about different kinds of nicotine substitutes which might ease the transition from smoking quite a lot a day, to not at all a day.  

The most recent substitute I am using as for now is [snus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus) which might not be considered to be the best alterntive, it is on the other hand very easy to get your hands on, and is quite cheap when the urge to consume nicotine rises, at least for me. More specifically I am using this product [Catch Licorice Dry Mini](http://www.svensktsnus.se/en/Products/Catch/), or for a plain text version it contains the following:  
* Package weight: 5,4 grams  
* Portion weight: 0,3 grams  
* Water: 26%  
* Nicotine: 1,5%  
* pH level: 7,5  
The main reason for me using it is quite simple, I want to wean myself off from the behaviours I have condition myself into, such as smoking as a waking up process, or waiting for the buss, or waiting for the coffee to get done, or after dinner. It is super easy for me to forget having it in, and I do like licorice.  

I have also tried using an e-cig for a while, at least during the majority of the time this summer. It was great and had a wide viraity of choices which pleased me, it did on the other hand not contribute to my goal to unlearn my conditioned behaviours.  

How was your journey in choosing a nicotine substitute, which did you try out and which one worked marvelous for you?  

What kinds of withdrawal symptoms did you encounter? Were there some that you absolutely couldn't stand, and did you find something that lessened that particular symptom?  

Best regards.

Ps. I am very unfamiliar with this kind of formatting, in case trouble arises, I will try and clean it up the best I can.

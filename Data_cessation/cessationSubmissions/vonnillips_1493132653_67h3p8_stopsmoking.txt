Are nicotine free disposable e cigs a thing?

Hey guys,

I'm almost at 16 days. In a week I'm driving home from school which is like an ~8 hour drive. In the past I'd smoke about a pack and a half on those drives but of course that's not my intention this time around.

I quit cold turkey so I don't wanna use anything with nicotine in it, but if I could puff on a nicotine free e-cig I think it might help with the cravings that'll come with that 8 hour long trigger.

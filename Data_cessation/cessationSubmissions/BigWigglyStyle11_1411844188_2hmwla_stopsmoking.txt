11 days and im done with the patch

I used to smoke 10-15 cigarettes a day when I was in the Air Force and I decided I was going to quit when I got back to the states.

I used the 21mg patch for 2 days but it was to much nicotine so I dropped down to the 14 mg patch. I used the 14 mg for like 5 days and dropped to 7 mg about 4 days ago.

I've been taking off the patch for like 4 hours a day because of the gym anyways, I'm pretty much over the habitual habit because I'm starting over in an entirely new environment. I just want to get past the chemical addiction. I'm tired of being an asshole without nicotine, I'm just done with cigarettes all together.

 I'm proud of myself for not smoking for 11 days, but I'm ready to go without the nicotine. Hopefully everything we'll work out as I want it to.

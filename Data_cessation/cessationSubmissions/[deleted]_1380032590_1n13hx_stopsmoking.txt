Looking for some word of encouragement :-)

Soooooooooo I was smoking up to a pack and a half a day, and I hated it. I hated the way I felt and more so smelled. Life to say the least was shit this summer between losing my grandpa, grandma and uncle all on the same side of the family within 2  months. Add to that moving to a new city and leaving my dad's firm of 9 years to seek out of ventures. I knew I wanted to change.

Fast forward to a month living here. We live in a non-smoking community, I will not smoke at work and I bought myself a brand new beautiful car that I will not smoke in. I am trying to set myself up in an environment where smoking just isn't allowed LOL I had one this morning before I left for work, and one before I got to work (normally I would have had like 6 by now) and I have to say I feel pretty damn good. I didn't die without chain smoking on my commute! YEA! It seems silly to be so proud of myself, but I have literally tried EVERYTHING and this has been the best option. With my severe ADHD, this seems to be the only thing that is working. I am down to 1/3 to maybe 1/2, and in a month I have to say that is good. I am retraining my brain as I find myself not wanting them, and my brain doesn't seek the "rush" any more & the smell is getting worse which is a good thing! I know everyone says just quit, but I need to relearn habits (like not smoking on commute) and retrain my brain. I guess I just wanted some words of encouragement as only those who have quit or working on it understand. 

TL;DR With severe ADHD I am retraining my brain by setting up a smoke-free environment for myself (literally tried EVERYTHING & always end up smoking again). In a month I am down from 1.5 packs a day to 1/3-1/2 and find every day the number to be less :-) Just looking for some uplifting words from fellow Redditors.

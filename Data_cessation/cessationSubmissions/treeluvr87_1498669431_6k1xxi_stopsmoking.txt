Failed my first try... were the suicidal thoughts normal?

I read Easyway and felt truly ready to quit smoking after 19 years. I honestly believed I was going to be the first person I know to successfully quit cold-turkey on my first attempt (I feel very humbled now). I have some mental health struggles but function well with exercise and meditation. I thought these tools would carry me through the hardest moments.  

The first 24 hours were mildly uncomfortable, but I still felt excited and genuinely thought, "Yippee! I'm a nonsmoker!" Then last night, sleeping was really tough, and this morning I woke up with severely suicidal thoughts that would not go away. I meditated, went for a long walk, chewed gum, came here to read inspirational shit. Found some old posts from others who mentioned suicidal thoughts but not a lot of them...  

I went out and bought a damn pack and decided that I need to switch from a counselor to a psychiatrist and open my mind to the possibility of medication to deal with my depression and anxiety. I think I need to address these issues before I attempt to quit again. I used the suicide hotline this morning... I knew I wasn't going to actually do anything, but not being able to get the thoughts out of my head seemed unbearable. I'm sure if I would have made myself sit through that discomfort, it would have passed, but it kept going for three hours straight before I finally just gave up!  

I know that the next time I quit, I will a) not be PMSing or in an otherwise abnormal hormonal/mental state and b) take a week off from work - aside from being genuinely frightened by my thoughts, I also couldn't keep my cool visibly this morning. Customers were asking what was wrong, I didn't want to talk about it, I went to the bathroom to sob for ten minutes, repeat repeat.  

My question is, are suicidal thoughts a normal part of this process for all of you? Has anyone here dealt with these thoughts but pushed through and succeeded in quitting?

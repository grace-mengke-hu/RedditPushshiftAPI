Are there any of you who have quit but can still occasionally smoke?

I really need to quit smoking, but I would like to know if I will be able to, for instance, smoke a cigar on my wedding night? Or enjoy a cigarette with a friend I haven't seen in ages.

I realize this is probably a very bad idea, but I would like to know if many people get this right? 

For instance, both my parents smoked a cigarette with me when I got my degree (after they both quit many years ago), and although they didn't seem to enjoy the taste, I still want to know to what extent one can smoke like this in the future?

I did occasionally smoke at birthday parties etc for almost 5 years before I started smoking on my own, and I wish I could go back to then.

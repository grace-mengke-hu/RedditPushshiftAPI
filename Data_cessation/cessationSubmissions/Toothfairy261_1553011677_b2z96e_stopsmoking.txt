Stepping down?

Last week, I posted about the strength of my nicotine patches. Tomorrow will be two weeks using 21 mg patches, but I've been concerned that it's a bit too much due to me getting a little bit lightheaded and jittery for a bit after putting a new patch on. Should I step down this soon or keep going with the 21mg for another week ?

Supporting someone else who is quitting?

So my mom, who for as long as I've known, has always smoked. She works at a healthcare facility and they recently put a ban on smoking at the workplace, so she took that as her motivation to quit.

I know it's going to be hard for her as my dad and brother still smoke at home and she also goes out to bars where other people smoke. 

I really want to be supportive to my mom for quitting, and thought I'd come here for some advice. What are some things you'd wish people had said to you, or what are some ways you felt people really helped you? Anything you did to quench the cravings?

I know I have a bit of a bias against smoking as I have asthma and being in the near vicinity of cigarette smoke bothers me, so I don't want to come off as too harsh when dealing with my mom about it, which is why I thought all of you could help.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and good luck to all of you on your journeys!

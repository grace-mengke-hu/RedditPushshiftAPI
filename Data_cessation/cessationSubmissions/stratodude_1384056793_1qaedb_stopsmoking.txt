I plan on quitting cold turkey tomorrow. What can I expect?

I'm 20, and have been smoking a half a pack a day for a year and a half. I'm tired of coughing up shit and smelling like an ashtray all the time. That and a co-worker just lost his beloved wife to lung cancer caused by smoking. I've quit smoking in the past, but I've never tried quitting cold turkey. The hardest part is not having that morning cigarette with my coffee, or taking that much needed smoke break at work after dealing with a problem customer. 
I guess I'm just looking for some tips and support, thanks guys! I hope to be smoke free from now on.

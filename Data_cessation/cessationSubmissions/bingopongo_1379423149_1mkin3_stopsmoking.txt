My success/failure story

I made it almost a month till yesterday I relapsed. My problems were all piled up (school, work, money-issues, family problems) and it boiled over when my SO said (during a quarrel) that I have changed to the worse when i quit!. I didn't throw away my cigarets, so i didn't have to go far - just light it. When I was calmed, I  was thinking things through and came to realize that: I am a non-smoker, maybe the last month has been tought but I'm going to be a non-smoker! My health is more important than our relationship - if it comes to that. Hope it doesn't.

Anyway I'll stay to myself and I be smoke-free.

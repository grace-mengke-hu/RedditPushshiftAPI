Going to start "Project Quit Smoking" for probably the 5th time... Trying something totally different this time and want to see if anyone else has any experience with this method...

This could be a *very* long post, so I'm going to be as to-the-point with it as possible. I don't mean to sound rude, I just want to get it out there without forcing you to read 5000 words. I'm verbose and I write for a living, so it's hard for me to keep things brief :).

**Current age**: 33

**Started smoking**: 17

**My life smoking**:

* Both parents smoked
* Started because someone cool offered me a cigarette
* Pack a day at 18
* First quit: age 22 - lasted ~6 months (the patch)
* After relapse back to a pack a day (started again out partying)
* Second quit: age 24 - lasted ~2 months (the patch, but never got off the strongest ones)
* After relapse back to a pack a day (started again because of cravings)
* Third quit: age 27 - lasted ~1 year (nicotine inhaler, but never got off the strongest ones)
* After relapse back to a pack a day right away, progressed to 2 packs a day over the course of 5 years
* Forth quit: age 33 (last spring) - lasted 2 months (e-cig, but still smoked ~5 cigs/day)
* After relapse went from 5 to 10 to 25 to 40 cigs/day over the course of 6 months

Now I'm trying again.

I can't be bothered with patches/inhalers/e-cigs at this point. I just want to quit smoking. I can't go cold turkey, I know that.

Today I found this app that promises to slowly wean me off of cigarettes. For reference it's [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azati.quit&hl=en) - I'm not endorsing it in any way, I don't even know if it will work.

Basically the idea is that you tell it when you smoke for the first couple of days (ie. hit the "Smoke" button every time you light a cig) and then it will help develop a plan for you. After that when you hit the "Smoke" button it will say something like "Can you wait 20 minutes before smoking?" and gradually it will reduce your cigarette consumption to zero.

I like the idea of it. If I'm at a movie or something I can definitely wait for my next cigarette, so the idea of starting off with small wait times and then graduating to larger wait times over the course of months makes sense to me. It makes way more sense than using nicotine replacement to be honest.

So yeah, has anyone else ever quit using this kind of thing? Any pitfalls I should watch out for?

Thanks in advance for any tips/advice you can give!

Also, why is /r/quitsmoking invite only? That was the first subreddit I typed in and was surprised to see that it was invite-only and advised me to check here first...

**EDIT**: I should mention that the reason I don't want to go cold turkey is because I've tried that dozens of times and failed in less than 72 hours. The most recent time I woke up at 3AM, got out of bed and drove to the store for cigarettes, and then just thought to myself "If I'm this desperate, I'm just going to be a smoker...".  I have willpower in many aspects of my life, but me and nicotine have a *very* special relationship it seems.

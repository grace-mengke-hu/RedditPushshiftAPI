Is it normal to have a cough a month or so after quitting?

It’s been about a month and a half maybe since I quit smoking I was a very irregular smoker either I smoked no cigs one day or I smoked 5 the next day and a half a pack the next day. I have this dry cough and sometimes I’ll cough up a big hunk of mucus which feels amazing. But it’s very annoying because I do vape to substitute for cigs so I cough up a lung everytime I hit it.

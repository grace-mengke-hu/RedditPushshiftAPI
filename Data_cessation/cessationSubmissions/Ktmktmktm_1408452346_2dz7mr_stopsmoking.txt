Switched to dipping. For the better.

So after smoking all throughout high school a few weeks after I graduated I called it quits and decided to ween myself off with dip. And i have to say Im glad I did. Now i know most people think dippings worse but there are many studies that prove otherwise. I also do it way less often then when I used to smoke. Instead of smoking 15+ cigs a day I pack like 3 or 4 lips. And the urge is much less present. I know its not perfect but its a start.

I had my first smoking dream since quitting.

So it was more of a nightmare. In my dream I had involuntarily smoked a cigarette, it was subconsciously, and I remember feeling so guilty but I told my self that it was a mistake but then I smoked another cigarette. 

Then later in the dream, I was in the office and a stressful situation arose, and I grabbed another cigarette. I felt sooo much guilt it was horrendous. 

Man was I happy to wake up!!

Going to Vegas, need some words of encouragement

So, as I said in the title, I am going to Vegas tomorrow. I am a little worried because I am mixing three of my major triggers. I will be going for a long drive, drinking, and gambling. I have been getting really bad anxiety this whole week every time I think about it because I honestly cannot picture myself in Vegas without a cigarette. I was wondering if you guys could shoot me some advice to help me when I start to have some trouble. What are some of your tricks and tips for getting past those serious cravings?

Hang in there, it will get easier... I promise. :)

So I came to the sub to read about the vaping post that was recently posted. Looked over and noticed my badge... 

#628 days and counting!

I never once thought I would make it this far. On day 6 I remember telling everyone how much this sucked and how I'll never be able to deal with the cravings. Now here I am at day 628, with very occasional once in a blue moon cravings. I'll just laugh and kind of shrug it off. Time does make it easier, a lot easier. 

TL;DL: JUST DO IT.

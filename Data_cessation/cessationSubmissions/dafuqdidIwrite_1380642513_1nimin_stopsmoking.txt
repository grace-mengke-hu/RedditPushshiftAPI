What do you guys think about E-cigs?

Tried cold turkey multiple times... Only to relapse. A friend suggested E-Cig...

EDIT: Okay... I've got mixed views here. (Should've actually expected that). But just wanted to share that I guess I'll give it a shot. Have just ordered one for me. Am a diabetic who is smoking around 2 packs of Clove cigarettes (Gudang Garam) a day for last 1 year.... earlier it was about a pack. So, I think it's time to try this... Am a creative by profession who spends walking outside my office thinking than sitting on a desk and just can't avoid lighting up. Have already ordered two sets so that the battery issue doesn't crop up... Thanks a lot to everyone who shared his views in here.... but I guess I need to do this. Wish me Luck. :)

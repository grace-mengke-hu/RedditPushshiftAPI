Reasons I want to quit smoking

My family doesn't know that I smoke and I would be ashamed for them to find out.

I woke up with a sore throat and I feel like garbage

I don't want cigarettes to age my skin

I don't want to die a slow death from cancer

I've been smoking cigarettes on and off for 6 years now. I've never been a heavy smoker. I can go days without one, but if I have a drink I get cravings and can smoke up to 5 in a night. 

I'm quitting again today. Just wanted to share some of my feelings with you guys first :/

NOT done with /r/stopsmoking, and here's why.

I still poke in once in a while and look at my badge. It reminds me what I did, why I did it, and I stop in and like to congratulate people who have hit day 365, day 30, day 7 or whatever.  This sub helped me quit more than anything else, not Allen Carr not any drug or e-cig, it was this sub.  Sometimes people here are grumpy, they are quitting a serious addiction and can be really pissy, it happens, I was. It is worth it to see people successfully quitting and if I can be a little bit of a cheerleader on the side and help someone like I was helped here then cool.

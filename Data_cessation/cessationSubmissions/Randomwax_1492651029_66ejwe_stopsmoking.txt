Is it normal to feel this way quitting?

I can't think of anything BUT smoking. And I can't really think or do anything else? I'm using patches / vaping so it can't be a physical craving must be psychological. 

I have assignments due so this is a major problem for me!

So yeah is this normal at first? I smoked 30 a day.

New free app to you quit smoking

Hi everyone! I'm an addiction scientist and I want to let you know that I recently helped build a free app called "Pare - Quit smoking cigarettes" that I think will be helpful for those of you looking to quit gradually over a few weeks. Its features are all grounded in scientific research, such as structured quitting plans, effortless ways to track your smoking, personalized motivation, and a way to quit with friends and family. Below are the links to the app:

iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pare-quit-smoking-cigarettes/id1295790602?ls=1&amp;mt=8

Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paresmoking.pare

If you have any questions or feedback on the app, you can email me at email@onesci.com. I'd love to hear from you!

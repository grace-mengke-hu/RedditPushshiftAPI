5 months

I quit after so many attempts and it's been 6 months. Around my 5 month mark I drank and smoked 2 cigarettes 😝 I got so sick for days after. Headaches, you name it. I am so proud that I haven't let my slip up affect my goal because I had to come on here and say I'm fucking killing it and I hope you guys do too! I used champix. Makes you psycho, but I had family support. Let's fucking do this! Whoop!

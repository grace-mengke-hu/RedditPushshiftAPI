I need your advice, my new friends. I don't think I can quit. (weight gain fears)

I've lived my entire life overweight. In winter I weighed my fattest, which was 210.
I was a light smoker for four years, nothing too major and at times I'd quit when I felt like it, I honestly don't believe I get addicted to the dirty habit, but now I may be...just in a different way. 
I now weigh 165 pounds, shedding tons of weight since winter. I no longer eat like a pig, I eat 1200 calories a day and on weekends I may allow myself ~1600 if I feel I earned it. 
Every week I told myself I'd quit smoking, but my insane weight loss keeps making me decide the opposite. 
I feel great about myself, so proud I've finally lost all this weigh and counting. I want to keep losing more. I'm scared to change my lifestyle thought, seeing how smoking keeps your metabolism going. 
I do not plan to alter my diet if I quit smoking cigarettes, but for all I know that doesn't matter. I also don't exercise due to wanting to change the process, but I also have a nice/active full time job so I have some decent fitness there. 
I have gone a little mental about my weight loss, it just means so much to me and I want to keep losing more and more, there's still a few more pounds for me to shed. 
Any advice? I want to quit smoking but me finally losing weight has put a real halt on it. I can't imagine gaining a single pound. 


Tl:dr: I'm not gonna quit smoking since there doesn't seem to be solid proof that you can continue to lose weight while quitting. I'm going mental over my weight loss and don't want the numbers to go up.

Yesterday I held a cigarette for my friend

So I am currently on day 5. Yesterday I was at my friends house out the back with him while he was smoking a cigarette - which was already hard in itself. His girlfriend then came outside and he quickly said take this and pretend it's yours. 

Now I was not aware that he hid the fact that he smokes from his girlfriend and I know this is a sign of a dysfunctional relationship and also a sign that my friend might be a bit of an asshole, telling someone that just quit to hold a cigarette... BUT, I took it as a challenge. 

I just kind of looked at it like the disgusting thing it is and patiently waited for it to burn out, I wanted to take a drag so bad, but logically went over it in my head and decided that it would not be worth it. 

I cannot believe I resisted, and feel like this time really will be the time, because if that doesn't break me nothing will!

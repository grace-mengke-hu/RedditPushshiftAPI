It's been a little over three days? I haven't really been keeping track.

Just posting because I find it helps with cravings. I actually haven't thought about smoking at all today until I popped on reddit and a saw the subreddit in my tab bar. 

Feeling pretty good today. Thanks for listening to me babble.

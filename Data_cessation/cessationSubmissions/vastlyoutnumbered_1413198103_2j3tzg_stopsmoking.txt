Where did the time go?

So, I'm back at Uni, working hard. Suddenly, I find myself with a few minutes to spare. I come here and see 90 days clear. Holy shit, that time really flew by. I didn't die, I don't live in constant regret. I am an EX smoker and it feels great. 

Everybody who's lurking or just starting out, those feelings and fears do subside quickly. One day you'll wake up and realise, "I haven't thought about smoking for a while."

I would like to propose a virtual toast, to freedom from what I like to call nicoslaveryâ„¢.

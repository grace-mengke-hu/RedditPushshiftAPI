I get anxiety about quitting

So everytime i go to quit i get really fucking anxious. Every time i quit the first few days are a struggle then on the fourth day every time i quit i have a whole day of headaches and vomiting.

I almost dont want to quit because i hate the fourth day. I cant keep anything down and im mostly vomiting bile. Its hell.

What can i do about the vomiting?

Everyone ive spoken to about quitting says they never experienced vomiting. I fucking hate it. But i want to quit. Im just terrified of the fourth day. Its a complete write off.

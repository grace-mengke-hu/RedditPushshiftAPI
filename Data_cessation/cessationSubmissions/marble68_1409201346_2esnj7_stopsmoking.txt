Just past 3 years as a nonsmoker after smoking a pack a day for 25 years

I stopped smoking Aug 3rd, three years ago. I smoked a pack a day reliably. I called my Marlboro Lights my "Monkey."

I was ready to quit, and I think that's the key.

I quit by doing the gum. I just started chewing it every time I wanted to smoke. I know there are instructions and advisories.. I ignored them. Maybe I'm an idiot for doing it that way...

But I chewed the crap out of that gum until I was sick of chewing gum. 

It broke the hand the mouth habit.

It's hardest when I drink, but I'm past that now.

FWIW - with it being harder to smoke in public, that has really helped. My wife still smokes, so that makes it hard sometimes.

Overall - know that if I can do it, you can do it.

If you want to quit, and are willing not to say F#ck It when you're drunk - you can quit for good.

Good Luck.

I caved in, a little...

I quit yesterday around 12:00 PM. My girlfriend also wants to quit so we decided to stop.

Last night I began reading Allen Carr's Easy Way book. I got to page 60 and it convinced me 90% that I don't need to smoke, and I was actually happy. I didn't had any cravings, but my gf had a lot. Shed couldn't take it anymore so she lighted one up. She usually only smokes half a cigarette so, I smoked the other half like usually but not because I had the urge to do it. I did it so she wouldn't have another half to smoke later. It actually tasted bad and after 4 puffings I crushed it in the ashtray. I was feeling good that I didn't enjoy it.

This morning I was still pretty determined and didn't have any cravings, but she still had them, so she smoked another half. Of course I smoked again the other half but I was again a little disgusted.

During the day I began to have cravings all of a sudden. Everywhere I looked people were smoking. On the street, on TV, everywhere. All I could think of is smoking. I began to ask myself if it's the right time to quit. I know of course that anytime is great to quit and I am fighting with this urge.

I got home and got directly to my girlfriend's pack, got one out and smoked it angry. The first two puffs felt good I admit, but right after that it feld disgusting. I was angry with myself because I can't control myself. My girlfriend is not helping either. I can't watch her smoke without taking part because I feel deprived of my right.

Tomorrow I am determined to not smoke at all. I want to get at least 3 days without smoking at all and see how I feel. I will keep reading Allen Carr's book and hope that in the end it will convince me completely.

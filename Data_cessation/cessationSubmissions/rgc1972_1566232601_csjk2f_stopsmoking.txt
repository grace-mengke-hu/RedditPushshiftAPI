Need advice.

I am so sad today after not smoking for almost two weeks, I gave in yesterday. My spouse and I had a horrible fight and I used it as an excuse to smoke. How do you guys handle the cravings when you are so stressed ?  I always smoked when we argue and now I felt like i could not cope without it.

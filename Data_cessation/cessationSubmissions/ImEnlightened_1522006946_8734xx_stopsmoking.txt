Been smokefree for 6 months, with snus.

I changed cigarettes for swedish snus, it has worked quite well.. I don't crave cigarettes and hate the smell of it, now that I feel quite comfortable because no relapses I'm thinking about quitting snus too as soon as I finish this can, my question is.. this

Too soon?

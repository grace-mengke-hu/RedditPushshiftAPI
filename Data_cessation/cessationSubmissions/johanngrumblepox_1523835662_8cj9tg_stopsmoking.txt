Today is day 600!!!

I saw a post come through my feed and clicked on the subreddit out of curiosity about how long it had been since I quit and it turns out that today is my 600th day!

Let me tell you - I know everyone says it, but if I can do it, ANYONE can.  I smoked on and off (mostly on, a pack a day) for 16 years and I'd maybe manage a few months of being smoke-free and then I'd cave.  I just couldn't picture myself as a non-smoker even though I desperately wanted to be one. 

Hang in there, everyone.  You can absolutely do this!

Holy shit.

I realized today that I'm nearing my half year mark of quitting smoking. It's so easy now. At first I would beg my friends or boyfriend for 'just one drag to get me through the night'. And they obliged. I figured that was better than asking them for a whole cigarette. 

But now it's easy. I can drive for hours without needing one. I can go to a bar and not need to step outside. If I'm having a stressful day, I don't look for solace from my American Spirits.

I'm free. I really finally did it. Cold turkey. I'm so proud of myself. :)

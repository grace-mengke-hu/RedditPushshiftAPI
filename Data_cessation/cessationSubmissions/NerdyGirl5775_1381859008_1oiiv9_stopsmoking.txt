Hit the one year mark...

...and didn't even realize it. In the beginning I checked my "how long has it been since I quit" app obsessively. For the first six months, I could tell you exactly how many days it had been, after six months I could tell you the months and weeks and then lo and behold, my year anniversery went by without me even noticing. 

To anyone just starting, or anyone even just thinking about quitting... You can do this. I am, quite possibly, one of the least self disciplined people in the entire world and if I can do it, so can you. The first two weeks will seem like an eternity and then it gets better. You'll be where I am in no time at all. Good luck!

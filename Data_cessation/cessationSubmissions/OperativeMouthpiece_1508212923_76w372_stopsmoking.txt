Oddly Specific Craving Busters

Hey! First time poster, about two weeks smoke free. Thought I would ask if anyone else has weirdly specific things they notice that can help to bust a craving. Tonight, for instance, I noticed while doing the dishes that the movement of all the parts of my hands had some effect on my craving. I started to wiggle the meaty parts of my feet and that seemed to amplify the effect!

I know there's an acupressure point on your wrist that reportedly helps subdue cravings, so maybe this is somehow related? Or maybe I'm just reaching for some woo woo feel good magic to help explain how I beat a craving WHEN REALLY THE MAGIC WAS INSIDE ME THE WNTIRE TIME! 

Anyway...

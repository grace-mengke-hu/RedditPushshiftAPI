Chantix and Celexa?

I am planning to quit fairly soon. I have been smoking for 17 years, give or take some brief quitting periods. I also have an extensive history of mild to moderate depression. I don't have a history of suicidal thoughts and it's pretty well managed by taking 20mg of Celexa. I have read the published studies saying that they don't interact and have found no link between treated depression and more symptoms while taking Chantix. I'm looking for personal experiences with depression, Chantix, and/or SSRIs.

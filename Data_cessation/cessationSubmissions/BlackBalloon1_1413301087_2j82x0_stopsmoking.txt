Starting day 6

I'm just looking for some advice. The first few days were not too bad, other than being in a bad mood but the cravings were not very intense. Today I am having a really bad day. I just spilled coffee all over myself at work and I have so many tasks to do today so I'm already under a lot of stress. Usually this is when I really want to smoke to deal with everything. 
I still don't even want to smoke because I know it will make me feel even WORSE if I do, but I don't know how else to deal! I hate this helpless feeling like I have no control and I don't know how to de-stress any other way. 
Also, the same goes for when something makes me depressed. I have quit for almost a year twice and both times started up again because of the combination of stress and depression. 
Does anyone have any advice who has had a similar problem?

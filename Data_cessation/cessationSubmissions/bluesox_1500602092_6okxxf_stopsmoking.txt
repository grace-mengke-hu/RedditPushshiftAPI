Day 3

Late Monday night I had been up for three days when I felt my systems shutting down. I felt a tingling spread from my chest up my neck and out to my fingertips. I couldn't move my arms and started hyperventilating.

Since then I've stopped *everything*. No more caffeine, smoking, drinking, drugs of any kind. None of it.

I spent the last two days mostly asleep, but today the urge to smoke is overwhelming. I've been getting cravings every three to five minutes for the last four hours and I'm going nuts. What can I do? I'm on a walk right now, with an orange soda in hand (caffeine free) but it's not helping at all. The only thing that has worked is sleep.

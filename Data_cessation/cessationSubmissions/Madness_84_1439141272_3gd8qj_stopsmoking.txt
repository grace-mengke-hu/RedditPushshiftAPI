What's the deal with Chantix?

Hello, I'm considering Chantix as a last resort to quit. I've tried every method and nothing seems to stick. So I'm wondering what's the general opinion with the Chantix treatment. I've read some really nasty side effects stories and I'm kind of worried. Are there any success stories?

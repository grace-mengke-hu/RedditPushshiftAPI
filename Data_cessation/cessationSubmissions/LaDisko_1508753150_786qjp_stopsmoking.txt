Over 2 Years Cigarette Free.

September 14th, 2015 was my last cigarette. I missed my one year anniversary of quitting and my two year because it's been so far in the back of my mind, I just remembered this morning. I'm really proud of myself and I just wanted to share this as a reminder to everyone that, while the craving never completely disappears, it does get so much easier over time. Just do your best, and just say no. If you mess up, try again. Your life is important, fight to make it a healthy one. At the very least, I'm proud of you for trying, internet stranger.

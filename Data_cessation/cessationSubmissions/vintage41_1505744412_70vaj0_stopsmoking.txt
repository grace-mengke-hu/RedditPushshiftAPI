Hi! I'm new!

Hi everybody, I'm relatively new.  I've been reading some posts this morning, preparing myself and knowing exactly what I'm up against.

I wanted to start a new chapter in my life, I'm 31. I've been smoking since I was 18 and well like that old saying I wish I knew then what I know now applies.  It's fall and things are changing, I want to change with it.  Fall is such a beautiful time and so is quitting.

Anyway, I won't be here much I don't believe but I will as much as I can. I'll mostly lurk around and read, occasionally post.  I work between 4pm - 12:30am and then take my husband to work at 5:45am......so you can imagine how messed up my sleeping schedule is.  As soon as I get home, all I want to do is sleep!

Maybe it might help actually lol keep me busy and then btw I do have some relaxation time, I'll be so tired I'll just sleep.

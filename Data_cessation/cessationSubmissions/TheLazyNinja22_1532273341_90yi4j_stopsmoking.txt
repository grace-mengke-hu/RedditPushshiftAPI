3 weeks in and need some advice

So as the title says I am three weeks into quitting and I need some advice.

I was a three pack a day smoke and i decided to stop cold turkey. No patches, gym or anything like that. Oddly the problem I am having isn't that I have an urge to smoke. The problem is that I feel way worse now then I did when I was smoking.

I have trouble sleeping but I'm always tired now. Basically
th I feel like I have a cold without the sniffling or being actually sick. It's hard to describe. Most annoying thing is a mouth ulcer. I asked around and people told me this is normal but I was hoping to get some advice

My questions are is it really normal to feel so much worse? 
Will this pass soon or is this the new normal?
Would I have felt better if I had used patches or other nicotine products?

Basically need some advice because now I'm thinking of smoking just to feel better if that makes sense.

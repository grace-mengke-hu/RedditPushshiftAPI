Fell off the wagon...advice?

Just short of 4 months.. Had alot of stress going on, deicided to have "just one"... 1 turned into 5 the next day, and I've been smoking about 2-5 a day for a couple weeks.

I am so disappointed in myself. Quitting all over again feels near impossible. If I did it once, I can do it again, right? Trying to stay positive, but I just feel like a failure.

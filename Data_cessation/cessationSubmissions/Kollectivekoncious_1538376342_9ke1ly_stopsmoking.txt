Been smoking since I started college and I want to stop now. What made you finally quit for good? Any tips?

Long story short, when I got to college I was trying to test all manners of things drug related as I was interested in the pharmacology and responses my body would go through. I started smoking weed ,snorting Advil, lsd, popped adderall and etc. but the one thing I regret was picking up cigarettes. Literally it is the only drug that I’ve picked up that I can’t stop. I’ve had 3 unsuccessful attempts at stoping. It’s just when I quit smoking, I feel like everything around me smells like shit(NYC) and the world just feels very overwhelming. I’ve understood that when I don’t smoke my anxiety drops drastically and that’s definitely due to cigarettes being a stimulant despite is alleged ability to “relax me”. So I just want to know like what can be done for this... I tried vaping for about 4 months and I realize that it’s a cop out, I may have stopped getting tar but the nicotine is still very detrimental to ones health. So that’s not an option. The patches never tried and are too expensive. So what tips can you give. I used to work out often until I started smoking, maybe some tips. 

TLDR: been smoking since I was in college and I need some advise on how to do so.

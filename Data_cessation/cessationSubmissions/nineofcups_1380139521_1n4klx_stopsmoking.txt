here i go...

I'm smoking my last cig as I write this. I'm writing to make it official and to gain support :) I said goodbye to my grandpa today, and I'm going to quit in honor of him. He is dying addicted to chew. He gave up cigs when I was a kid, but never did kick the nicotine habit. So, i'm giving up this crap in honor of him. I don't want to be like that. Plus, he is dying never knowing that I ever smoked a cig and if there is such a thing as an afterlife and him looking down on me, I can't handle knowing he is looking down at his granddaughter smoking! Whatever works right? haha Anyway, I will be using the patch. I'm an emotional wreck as it is, so personally I'd rather use a NRT to relearn my life without the habit and step down from nicotine of course and then be addiction free!!! Words of encouragement are greatly appreciated!! Thanks all :)

2 days into quit, withdrawals hitting, nobody to talk to about it because of social stigma...

Yay, I made it two days! But the worst of the withdrawals are hitting now, the kind that make me feel like my brain wants to crawl out of my head and go to outer space (i.e., insane). 

What's really hard is that I live in a community in Northern CA where there's a huge social stigma against smokers. Many people don't get that it's a chemical addiction: one friend keeps telling me, "Yeah, you could just cut back or maybe have one occasionally." No no no! That never works for me, I'm way too addicted to nicotine! That kind of thinking is what got me started again after being quit for a year.

Then there's the other type who would literally consider backing off their friendship with me if they realized I was "trashy" or "uncivilized" enough (in their mind) to smoke. Some of the hidden dangers of living in a health-obsessed, kale-eating, liberal, hippie area. 

Can anyone relate? Got any words of support for "trashy" me?

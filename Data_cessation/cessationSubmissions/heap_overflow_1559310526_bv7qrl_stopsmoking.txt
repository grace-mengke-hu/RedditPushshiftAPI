2 months, but that's not the point

After being an addict for about 10 years I've struggled going in between cigarettes and vaping. Had a nice setup, mixed my own liquid, stashed liters.

Troubles with breathing freely came along, changed set-ups, dumped a shitload of money into gear, started smoking again - can't always smoke so it'll be easier to quit, right? Well, it isn't. It wasn't at least, even NRT vapes didn't help, I was back at the start.

Maybe laziness and smoking combined are the trigger, that's it! And to a point it was - sports was the only help relieving some of the breathing problems I had, but not all. About half a year in I stumbled over Allen Carr on this subreddit - there's nothing to lose.

One minor setback after a few days and that's it. A book. 10 Euros. Done.

My problems are slowly dissolving in to the cleanest air I've ever inhaled. (Although my allergies also played a part in this I've came to now in the last week)

And here I am, non-smoker who's gained more than 10 kilos in the last 8 months by doing sports, improving in other areas as well while not being able to comprehend how I can be *that* happy all the time. Maybe it's everything together, but I want to believe it's sports and not-smoking making me feel high on life. Sometimes it's even scary comparing my mood to those of others. I don't know. But I wish you all the same.

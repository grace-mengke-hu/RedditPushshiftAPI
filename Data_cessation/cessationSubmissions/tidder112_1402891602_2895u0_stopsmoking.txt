I FUCKED up. I can lied to you, I can't lied to myself.

I lied to you all, and worst of all, I lied to myself.

I was blinded by the phrase "Relapse is a part of recovery".

###381 Days

I want to restart the clock, but I can't yet... I just bought my first pack in *slightly* over a year.

I want a cigarette.  I want to get my buzz.... And that's all it is, a buzz... For a second...


I am sorry for failing you all.  I am more sorry I failed my own test.  I thought if I could have one, I could be all right and never ask a friend for one.  I was wrong, and I feel I only want it to distract myself, but it doesn't last, and I want another, and another, and another, and another, and another again.

I bought a pack, and immediately I regretted the purchase.  I walked out of the gas station.  I was *hovering* above myself watching me tear the plastic off the package.  I didn't even remember how to open the damn thing.  I finally found the rip tag, and as I pulled the plastic away I felt, in that moment, the last year of my life, all at once......

I am sorry... I have failed my first test.... Failed like I knew I would.

Please help. I was doing so good.


Tl/dr

I need help with the actual withdrawal symptoms. My issue is the symptoms not me want to smoke.

Backstory

  Newport smoker. Pack and half a day for about 10 years.

About 7 months on keto diet. 40lbs down

On adderall 20mg daily almost a year. Was working fine until I attempted to quit smoking.

 I am well on my way to getting my weight in order. Got my mental state under control. Stopping smoking seemed like the next logical step.

I started vaping about 2 months ago. Stared with the disposables, and have moved my way to a decent mod. When I first started I smoking and vaping throughout the day. Slowly, I migrated to vaping. Now I am almost 100% vaping. ( less then 5 cigs a week, down from a pack and half a day)

I am using 18-20 mg nicotine juice. However the last two to three weeks ( the time when I rapidly moving to vaping) I have felt like shit. I am now sleepy all the time again (previously the adderall fixed that)

I feel like I want throw up, dizzy frequently and I can not stop yawning. Side note,  when I yawn my throat feels different. Almost like like its a different size or opening and closing different or something. Lol. ( hopefully someone else has had this, because I know that sounds crazy)

I know all of these are withdrawal symptoms from lack of the nic and other crap, but it's going on almost a month now. Please advise. Are there any herbs, natural remedies or anything that can help with this?

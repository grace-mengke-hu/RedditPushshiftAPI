Day 2. This is doable.

Yeah, I'm going to be that guy updating you every single the first few days. But, your comments really helped me keep going. 

Today was quite easy. I think these three days were suposed to be the hardest, but they're alright. I wasn't that hardcore of a smoker, max. 3 packs a week, but the social interactions will be the true test (though I thought that about work). The past few times I caved when with friends who were all smoking. The 'social' aspect is the hardest as I try to fit in or make excuses when I see people who I like smoke.

This time though, I'll have to be resisting and I might even be the annoying ex-smoker trying to get others to quit. Besides being a bit annoying for a bit, I don't see the downsides for them, especially if they have fallen for the 'mind trap'. Oh well, I'll worry about that later. On to day three now, after day five I believe it will be mostly a social/psychological game whereas now I get strong, but managable mental as well as physical urges every now and then.

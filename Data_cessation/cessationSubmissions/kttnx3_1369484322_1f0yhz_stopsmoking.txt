So I've decided June 1st is the day! Any tips?

I really want to quit. I hate how it takes time away from my daughter. I hate how it affects me health wise. I hate how much money it costs. I hate the smell. It's such a disgusting habit. So I've picked a day to stop completely. 

The other day I had 4 cigs all day and figured I'd stay low. Well my fiance smokes a pack a day and the smell of him makes me want one(even though it's gross.) I try to keep busy but I'm a stay at home mom with a 7 month old. All I do is sit and play with her which gets boring since she mostly likes to play by herself so I'm just supervising.

I not only need to and want to do this for me but also her. I want to be able to run around with her without getting out of breath. I want to spend those minutes with her not my nasty habit. I want to save the money for her college account. 

So June 1st is the day. Hopefully I'll be smoke free by my 23rd birthday on the 13th!


TLDR: will put down cigs for many reasons. Any tips?






Edit: Thank you everyone for the support. We will see how it goes!

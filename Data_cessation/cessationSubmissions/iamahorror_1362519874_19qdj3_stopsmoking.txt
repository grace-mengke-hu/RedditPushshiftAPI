Day 5!

So I just joined the subreddit but I quit 5 days ago.

A friend text me out of nowhere on Wednesday of last week and said I had smoker boobs. This is really just manipulation for me to quit.

I want to quit and have tried a few times but this time, nobody believes in me, I went through a break up from an abusive relationship last year and started smoking a pack a day (was smoking a pack a week for 4 years before that though). 

I really want to rub everybody's nose in it that I can do anything. And as childish as it sounds, I want to quit because my abusive ex couldn't. He told me the longest he ever got was 3 months. I'm very stubborn and very competitive, I can last for the rest of my life :).

So end rant, and good luck to all of you!

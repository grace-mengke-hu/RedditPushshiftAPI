Quitting smoking advice. (For the Navy)

I'm in the D.E.P. (delayed entry program) in the Navy. I leave in thirty one days. I'm trying to quit smoking. It's proven very difficult. I'm nineteen right now, and I've been a smoker since I was twelve. I know I was a horrible kid. The thing is, I've stopped before. It's just now that I've been a pack a day smoker for nearly three years I find it hard to put down. I refuse patches, gum, or e-cigs for the fact that I want complete nicotine removal from my system. I'm looking for a natural way to ease the process. And YES I have decided to do this not only for the military, but for myself. I'm tired of depending completely on a chemical to get me through the day. Not to mention I love to run, and it's becoming more difficult each day to run. ANY advice is welcome.

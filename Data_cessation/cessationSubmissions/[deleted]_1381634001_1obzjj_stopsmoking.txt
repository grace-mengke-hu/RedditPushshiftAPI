Quit nearly 5 days ago.

4 days, 18 hours, 11 minutes since I put my last smoke out. I've tried to quit numerous times but something in my brain just clicked and I made it through the first night. Then the next. Then the next. And so far still OK. I am a big time beer drinker but have yet to smoke while drinking.

I'm gonna make it this time, motherfuckers!

we quitted smoking!

Hi fellow quitters. I started smoking regularly when I met my bf in May 2017. We would smoke a pack per day together. He was a smoker for 2 or 3 years. One day he said that we should quit, we're better than this. I thought that I was not ready to quit because you know I haven't been even smoking for a year. But I followed. Now I don't know how many days we stopped smoking but I feel great. My problem is I'm hungry more and I eat more but I will deal with this. Plus I don't want to be a doctor who smokes. Anyway I just wanted to share it, good luck everyone.

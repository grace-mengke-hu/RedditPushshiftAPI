Trying to quit, product to product.

23 years old here. I've been using tobacco in some form or another since I turned 18.
I want to quit because I'm tired of hiding it from everyone (very few people know.)
Started on cigars and cigarettes for occasional pleasure, then became addicted to cigarettes. I moved to snus, which I used 10 or so pouches a day and swallowed it. That became a problem for my stomach after a couple years, so I switched to Juul, but have been using it all day for a year now.

I think the final transition for me is going to nicotine gum, then to just plain gum. The job I'm about to take is on tobacco free grounds, so I cant use the juul.

My question here is: although I've used nicotine all day for years now, I am still sensitive to a large amount of nicotine at one time. My body goes a little numb and I get all weird with the first nicotine dose of the day. So will this also happen with the gum?
I'm 5'6 120 pounds. Should I try for a low dosage gum? And what is that dosage? 2mg?
I am adamant on quiting, but I've tried cold Turkey, and it just wont happen with me. I figure if I can get hooked on the gum for a week or two, then switch to just normal gum i may have a chance.
Thank you anyone who can give advice!

My brain

My brain is trying to trick me badly. I took off the last nicotine patch about 2.5 days ago. The cravings are more present, and my brain is trying to tell me that life will be so much better with a cigarette. Having a hard day at work? Have a smoke. Having a fight at home? Have a smoke. But at the same time, the non addicted part of my brain doesn't want to. It's confusing to say the least.  
I am not giving in to the addict part of me. No more cigarettes. I am way too stubborn for that. No more nicotine. The rest of my life as a non smoker. I can do this. We can all do this. I will not smoke with you today.

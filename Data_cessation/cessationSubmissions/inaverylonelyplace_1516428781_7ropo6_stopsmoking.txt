Gonna try quitting, again, all because I've got the flu.

So, honestly I don't feel too bad just a low grade fever and some fatigue (I think it's due to how much fruit and other good foods like garlic and whol-grains and spinach Ive eating while I've been sick, I notice a reduction in my symptoms immediately after consuming these TH ings) but continuing to smoke while I'm sick is making me grow to resent it, so I had my mom pick up some 21 MG patches, and I'm going to try again. I've got lots of Kratom and gabapentin (I'm prescribed 2400 MG daily I think or maybe it's 3200/day), and a weak-ish barb (butalbital). I feel like I will be able to do it. I had originally quit like 2 months ago, had 21 then another 21 days (interrupted by 2 days of very light smoking), and then once I decided to stop drinking to cope because I knew it would lead to very bad things, I turned back to Cigs to cope with "losing" my whiskey habit. But I've done it before, I cna do it again. I know I can. So yeah. I want to go back to having the energy to exercise intensely again, I was to go back to not worrying about if it's too soon to smoke another cig (i try hard to space them out but it's hard), etc. And I also had a health scare where I was exercising soon after I smoked a cig, and started getting chest pains. Sent me into a panic and Went to the quick care and I believe my ekg was mostly normal besides my t wave, which I don't think is a good thing. I'm only 18 but I can already feel the damage being done...  Scary

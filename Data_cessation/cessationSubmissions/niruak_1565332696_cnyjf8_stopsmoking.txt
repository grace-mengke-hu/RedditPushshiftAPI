Dreaming about smoking

Do you guys also dream often about smoking a cigarette? Today is my 20th day smokefree and i dreamt it again. I have no cravings at all and i feel so good now but i dream it all the time. Whats funny about it is that i do not dream how i lit the cigarette but only how i am finishing it and regretting that i have done it. It feels like the addiction has still an imense psychological impact and wants me to fail. Have you experienced that or similar?

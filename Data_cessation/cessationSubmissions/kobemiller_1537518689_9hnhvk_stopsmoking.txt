CBD oil helped me quit smoking

So I’ve been trying for the past 5 years to quit smoking. I’ve tried it all - nicotine replacement, exercise, quitting drinking, amino acids, all the supplements under the sun and nothing got me through the first 3 weeks. 

A few weeks ago I met a friend in Wholefoods where he’d just bought some CBD oil. He told me it’s the shit, Id heard about it but my weed smoking days had long been over so I dismissed it. Well he convinced me to buy it and I dropped a bit in a juice. Felt instantly relaxed. I put it in a drawer and forgot about it but then had a brainwave to perhaps use it to not smoke for a day. It worked so I, being an excessive person spent about £300 on a wholesale shipment from the Netherlands. This stuff is the bomb. I dropped a big dose (400mg) into a smoothie on day 3. It’s now three weeks in and I’ve made a good dent in the CBD. Thing is though I haven’t had a single craving, not only did it make quitting easy but it made in enjoyable. It cost a fair bit but I’d happily spend that to quit smoking. I strongly recommend it..

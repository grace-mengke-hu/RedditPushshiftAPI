Day 4: Cravings are getting a little more manageable, but now I just feel very depressed. Is this normal?

Came very close to relapsing yesterday, was actually desperately looking around my room for an unfinished pack but couldn't find anything. The craving eventually passed and spent the evening laying on the couch watching shitty movies. 

I woke up today not really craving a cigarette but just burnt the fuck out on everything. I get that there's a lot of stuff going on in my life right now other than quitting, mainly I'm very hung up on a girl, but I just feel bad about everything today. It's been a miserable day at work so far and doesn't look to be turning around. I'm not even sure what I want to do with myself at this point. Just kind of feel like I'm being slapped around by life from all directions.

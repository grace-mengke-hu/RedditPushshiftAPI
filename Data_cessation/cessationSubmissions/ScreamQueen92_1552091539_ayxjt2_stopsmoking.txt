6 months and still going strong!!! ☺️☺️

So, my quit date was 8th September 2018. 

Currently at 6 months off the fags, and about 4 1/2 months of nicotine (I used patches). 

And to be completely honest, it’s scary how easy it got after that initial month and a half once off the patches. I haven’t had one craving, can be around people smoking and not have that crazy addictive person switch flick in my brain. I do not miss it at all. 

I was such a heavy smoker, spending most of my money per fortnight on smokes (not cheap here in Aus!). If I can do it, I believe anyone can, once they have found the right method for them!

I quit smoking two (almost three) days ago, and then my in-laws made a surprise visit..

And I am losing my patience and my mind. I can’t seem to get away. All I really want is to walk outside and smoke. The cravings are REAL you guys. I just want to smoke and then quit again once they leave on Thursday. 

I can’t sleep because they’re loud and drunk, and then somehow up EARLY like 6:00 in the morning! 

I know if they weren’t staying at my house for the week I wouldn’t even be having these issues. They came completely unannounced on  my quit date. What do I do!?

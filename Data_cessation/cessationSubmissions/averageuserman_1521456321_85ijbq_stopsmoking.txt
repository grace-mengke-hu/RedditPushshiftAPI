I am quitting today

I am only 25 and I've been smoking for the past 9 years. I am fucking myself up big time. If I keep this up I will be cancer like my mother. Thank god she beat it, but who knows what'll happen to me. When it comes to smoking I don't have much willpower, but I'm gonna really try this time guys. Just wanted to share, have a nice and smoke free day.

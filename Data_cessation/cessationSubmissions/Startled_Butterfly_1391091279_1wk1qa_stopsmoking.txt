Hit a small but important milestone this week.

I haven't quit. Not by a long shot. But since the beginning of this week, I have cut my daily smoking down to one-third what it was last year.

I used to watch the clock constantly, telling myself it's okay to smoke another cigarette if I can wait exactly 45 minutes. If I made it an hour I was so proud of myself. This was the mindset of someone who did not want to quit. I was just going to smoke one cigarette an hour for the forseeable future.

Earlier this month, I realized I haven't been hitting that hour-mark by a long shot. I'd been hitting the two-hour mark and hadn't even noticed.

Then this week, two days ago, I looked at the clock and realized it had been THREE HOURS since my last cigarette. And where I used to smoke 15-18 cigarettes a day, I now average 6. Sometimes 5, sometimes 7.

I feel like by the end of February I could push it to 4, maybe 5 hours. 

I know this isn't actually much, but I'm so pleased. I hate being a fucking slave to the clock.

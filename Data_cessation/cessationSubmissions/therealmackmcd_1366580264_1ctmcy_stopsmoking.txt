1 month down, and the next step begins in the ultimate goal of maximizing my potential...

Definitely proud of the 1 month milestone. Still get cravings on occasion, but the internal argument is very short lived lately.

My largest hurdle this last month has been an incredible drop in motivation and focus, and as someone who's fresh into an executive position with a very steep learning curve, this has caused me to almost be in tears for the vast majority of the work day. Not the desire to smoke, but the apparent inability to think effectively. 

In the last week, I have omitted caffeine from my system as well in an attempt to curb the excess anxiety I've felt since quitting, and I'm noticing a marked improvement in my overall demeanor, but I'm not done yet. I suspect marijuana to be a major contributor to my negative mindset since quitting smoking. 

So here I am, one month into my nicotine quit, and tomorrow begins day one of my marijuana quit. /r/leaves, here I come. 

Please share any stories or techniques you've used to help overcome a feeling of "aimlessness" or a sharp decline in self esteem after a quit. The more help I can get, the better, and to any one who's carrying a circular badge still, it may prove very useful to them as well.

Thanks, /r/stopsmoking. You've made this month much easier than I could imagine without you.

Gave in

I am using the app smoke free, which is awesome. I have smoked for nearly 22 years. I started wearing the patches, chewing the gum, and using an e-cig. I had cravings, but made it through. Then today I became extremely agitated and gave in. My quit time was 3 days 18 hours and 46 minutes. Almost 4 days. The cigarette tasted disgusting!! I am so mad at myself. I took the patch off and I want to quit, but now am afraid that I am going to start off with say three a day and then start right back up. I am a caregiver for my grandmother who has COPD and lung cancer and she will not quit. I see what she goes through and I do not want that to be me. Any suggestions of anything else to try?

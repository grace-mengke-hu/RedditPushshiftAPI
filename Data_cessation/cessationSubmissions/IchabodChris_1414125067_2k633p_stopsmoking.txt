Timelines, stats, etc... does anyone have any?

So, today is my fourth day of quitting and one thing that usually has helped me cool the jets and pacify my nicotine monster in the past has been info-graphics and timelines. Oddly enough, every single time I have "quit" (this being effort 4 or 5 but by and far the most relaxing and easy) I really like to look at the expected physical reactions to withdraw. I suppose seeing what others have felt next to expected benefits is a real instant boost.

Anyway, would any of you fine human beings have any timeline/graphs that have helped you?

And, I apologize if none of the above made sense. I just took a giant Melatonin.

I quit smoking today at 3:30

I smoke 2 packs a day at 21 years old. I was 11 when I had my first one, someone had thrown a pack out their car window and my friends and I found it. I’ve been smoking regularly since my first job at 17 because it was the only way to get a break. Today I decided it was time to actually quit. I’ve said it a thousand times before but today is the day. I bought a two week supply of nicotine patches (step two) and haven’t wanted a cigarette in two hours. I’ll update daily to keep myself motivated.

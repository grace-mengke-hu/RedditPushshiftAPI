third day!

I have been a consistent smoker since I hit puberty. Here and there I've tried to quit, I must have tried at least a dozen times with seriousness and many more dozen times with no stick. For the last five years or so I was a pack a day smoker. I had developed a smokers cough, I have been coughing stuff up. Every time I had "quit" the last few years or so I was actually going through the ashtray to find butts or stealing one or two a day from room mates. I am so proud to say I haven't smoked a single one in three days!!! I have actually done it this time!!! I technically "quit" a week ago but still smoked at least one a day until Thursday. I have recognized what made me smoke was beers and have decided to refrain from drinking alcohol during this beginning faze. After the first twenty four hours without a cigarette passed I felt so happy and proud! I was super cranky here and there throughout the day but man it was all worth it for how I felt at the twenty four hour mark. Now I've gotten to the third day!!! I just turned thirty a month ago and I'm excited at the prospects of being a non smoker in this new stage in life.

I hate to tell you this

Beautiful evening last night, rainy but warm. I awoke this morning to the sound of birds singing. I wait all winter for this. It brings a smile because for me it marks the beginning of spring, early morning walks on the boardwalk & new blooms. This morning along with all those thoughts, a forgotten nagging in the back of my mind. I'd forgotten what it feels like. Hasn't let go. Takes away from the beauty of the moment. Smoking is not an option. Can't wait to have the smiley face star so I can say I've done all this. Have a good day guys & keep quitting.

Edit: I hated writing this because new quitters always tell me their worry about craving forever. Some seem to only see the posts from long time quitters who still talk about craves & missing smoking. I want you all to know, I don't miss smoking, this is not the usual for me, it's not even close to the early days, it is doable and I would do nothing different. I'm still a newbie and still figuring out my triggers. I wrote this to help me release it. Don't be discouraged. Quit on!

Quitting vape

I quit 4 days ago. I got really sick and I couldn’t really smoke it anyways because my throat hurt. I feel so fatigued but I can’t sleep. Has anyone else experienced insomnia while quitting? I wake up about 3 or 4 times a night and stay up for an hour at a time. It just sucks because I haven’t been able too hit the gym at all in almost a week I called out of work today because I didn’t get any sleep last night and I’ve also been horribly depressed everything feels so weird. I feel so bad because my 1 year old has basically just seen me in bed this week when I’m normally pretty active with her. I just want too feel normal again.

I only lasted 24 hours..

I feel so miserable that I couldn't last. 
I set my quit date for November 1st but yesterday I just decided to quit while taking my kids trick or treating.. I last 24 hours and then caved. I'm not done trying yet though!! I will quit! Allen Carr's book should be in this week and hopefully after I read that I will be more prepared..  And my SO has agreed to quit with me once I decide to quit again.. I'll post once I quit again..

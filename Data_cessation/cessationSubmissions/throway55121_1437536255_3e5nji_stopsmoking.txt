No motivation for anything!

Anybody go through this stage? I can't seem to focus on a damn thing. And it's not being distracted by cravings either.

I gave up nicotine 2 weeks ago and have been going strong since and although I feel great and am committed not to relapse I can't help but feel that before quitting I was much more productive!

I will admit I used to use nicotine in between tasks as a sort of break and "reward" and guess it gave me something to look forward to but now that I don't have that I've just been lazy!

Help!

One week down

I believe this is my fourth attempt at quitting for good. One of my previous attempts, I was able to make it almost three years before starting up again. 

I'm one week in and it's getting easier. My cravings are subsiding. Still have those moments of OH MY GOD I WANT ONE!! but they are getting few and far between. 

I've been lurking here all week and reading other's posts. It's made things much easier. You're all a great bunch of people and I look forward to sharing my success and sharing in yours too.

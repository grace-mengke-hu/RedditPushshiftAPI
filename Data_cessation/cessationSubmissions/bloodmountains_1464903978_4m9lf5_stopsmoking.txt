Started smoking 5 days ago. How can I kick the habit early?

So I'm a 19 year old university student and I've been going through a horrible period of depression and anxiety for a year and a half, I'm on antidepressants but I don't think they're working. I used to use alcohol to deal with it but that was very visibly affecting my wellbeing and everyone was noticing it. So I cut that down a lot. And now I've ended up smoking. I dunno what the motivation was, just some sort of relief? Anything that'll make me feel better for a bit. I would just smoke weed but I have no way of getting my hands on it hahah. I finished my first pack today and feel pretty guilty and shitty, especially because I've had two family members die from cancer brought on by long-term smoking. I know 10 cigs are hardly gonna kill me but I don't want this to develop into a new poison like the alcohol did. So what's the best thing I can do this early?

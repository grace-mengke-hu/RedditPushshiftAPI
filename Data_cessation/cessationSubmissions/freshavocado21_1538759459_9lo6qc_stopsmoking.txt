Broke down today and got a pack

I used the stress of work to justify it (haven’t smoked in 4 days, which doesn’t seem like much but is the longest I’ve gone in 6-7 years, I’m almost 23). I’m wondering if anyone has had a successful experience in the “one more pack”/ “after this pack” thing? I’ve told myself that before but the way I physically and emotionally feel now after smoking, I think it might be possible. I’d throw it away but I could use the $12 I spent :p

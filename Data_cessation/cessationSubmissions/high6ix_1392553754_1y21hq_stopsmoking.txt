Insomnia like crazy!

My wife and I have been smoke free for about a week. She is taking chantix, while I am cold-turkey. I'm doing great, working out, eating better, but I have horrible insomnia/restlessness. I am tired when we go to bed, but I wake up almost every hour, and often as if I got startled. It is really wearing on me the last couple of nights. Has anyone else experienced this, and if so what did you do to get back to normal?

33 days in, but faltering

Hi all, 
Made it to 33 days after a 10 year habit thanks in no small part to your support and sharing, and I find myself needing you guys once more. I've been finding myself missing cigarettes quite a bit, and even having those sneaky 'you can have one, as long as it's just one' thoughts. I live in China, where smoking is extremely common and pretty much everywhere, and today the temptation is extremely strong. 

It's a beautiful day today, and I just can't stop thinking of going out to the 'smokers balcony' here at work, bumming from a coworker and enjoying a few pleasant minutes in the sun. This doesn't feel like the cravings of the first few weeks; it's more like a deep questioning of why I quit in the first place. I don't really feel like I've gained much from quitting yet, but that's a topic for another time I suppose. Tell me what I need to hear, guys!

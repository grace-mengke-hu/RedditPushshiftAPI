Flossin

Seriously after you quit make sure you floss your teeth. I might be speaking for myself but oh my did it make a huge difference in everything from how my breathe smelled to how things tasted, as compared to just brushing teeth. It was a truly mind opening experience for me, and I have 100% changed my addiction from cigs to flossing my teeth. I think somewhere a dentist might have just gotten their wings.

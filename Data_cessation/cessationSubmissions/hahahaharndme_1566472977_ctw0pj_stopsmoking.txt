So my Amma died a few days ago and I broke tonight

I have been quitting with a vape. It worked quite well last time I tried to quit, the main problem being I was quitting for financial reasons tied with it's what everyone else wants reasons. I think it ended up failing because I wasn't truely ready to let go.


I have been using the vape when I get a massive craving but otherwise haven't really even bothered to turn it on during my normal smoking times. It's been going well... But my grandmother passed away three days ago and it has made this nearly impossible.


I was actually managing okay, I have a lot of support since I'm partially doing this for her, but I keep a much later schedule than the rest of my family so it's still difficult.


Tonight my coil ran out, some setting got switched on the vape and I have no idea how to turn it back (the instruction manual that came with it didn't help at all), and I came across a video that triggered a ton of eating disordered thoughts (which are very strongly tied to smoking). I tried a few coping methods but I was just so distraught, by everything, but in that moment, it was mostly just the fact that my vape wasn't working.

I ended up buying a pack and having a smoke from it. I wore clothing I intended to wash and a scarf to cover the smell so my family wouldn't know but as of this moment I just want to do terrible things to myself because I feel like such a failure. 


I've hidden the pack in a ridiculously difficult place to reach, and I will likely give it to a friend in the next week or so, but I don't know how to cope with this overwhelming guilt I feel for giving in before I had even hit two weeks. I just feel so broken.

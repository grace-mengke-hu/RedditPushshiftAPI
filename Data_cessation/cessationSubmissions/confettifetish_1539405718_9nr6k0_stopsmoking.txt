Day four, I don't smoke anymore!

I didn't even plan on quitting. I woke up on Wednesday, and decided I didn't want a cigarette that day. I felt great! I smoked ~20 a day.

...until I had a health scare that landed me in hospital for 12+hours that same day. Although, it did feel good to tell doctors that I'd just quit. I was expecting them to roll eyes, but every doctor and nurse actually congratulated me! I'm still feeling unwell, but it's actually helping keep me from smoking.

Of course, I'm at the stage where my junkie brain is trying to convince me to have just one cigarette. I'm not falling for it this time. I quit for three months last time (nearly 2 years ago), and thought one wouldn't hurt. Cigarettes travel in packs, there's no such thing as just one.

I'm also using vanity to keep me going. My skin already looks better, not dull, grey and red like it usually is. My teeth look slightly whiter, and the nicotine stains on my fingers have already faded. Plus, I smell good!

Just wanted to brag. I feel good. I got this.

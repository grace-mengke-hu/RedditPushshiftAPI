Quitting smoking while on a 3-month solo backpacking trip.

11 hours ago I sat near the Mekong River in Luang Prabang, Laos and smoked my last cigarette.
Now I am lying in my hostel bed. It’s only 9pm but I am tired af and can’t stop thinking about going downstairs for a smoke... but I won’t. Instead I am thinking, watching, listening. Just concentrating on the moment. Not thinking ahead.
A lot of things have changed in my life in the last weeks before traveling. Most of them are quite bad and sad I cannot change anything about it, but I can change a lot about me. 23 years of life, 5 years of smoking. And today I fuckin’ stop! 

Maybe it’s stupid to do it on a backpacking trip through Asia. Imagine traveling with no friends to help you through this. Just a bunch of people who just don’t care if you smoke or not, if you stop or not. Image the cigarette prices being under 1$. Imagine all the feelings of freedom that are waiting to be immortalized in a drag of your cigarette. That’s exactly what you’re getting yourself into. 

But also... do not forget to imagine the scenery you see when the sun goes down, turning everything in a certain tone of orange that you wouldn’t even see in the movies. Imagine waking up and your biggest worry being the decision which paradise to go next. Imagine all the people, from every part of the world full of stories and energy just dragging you with them. 
That’s the surrounding you could stop in. Trust me. Cause I will.

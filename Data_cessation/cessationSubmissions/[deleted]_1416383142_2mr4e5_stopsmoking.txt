Relapsed after 80 days, but that's okay!

Hello r/stopsmoking! I'm a huge lurker but I had to post today. I have been 80 days strong. Even as a lurker, this sub has really helped me get through the early stages of quitting. Just reading about the successes and even the struggles let me know that it was possible and that I wasn't alone. I have kept my unfinished pack in my bag as a reminder that I am in control. It felt wonderful to look inside and know I didn't need them. My personal life has been kinda stressful for the last 80 days.. but I got through it. I celebrated my monthly anniversaries in little ways like eating a slice of chocolate cake, I was so proud of myself. But today was different. I felt absolutely helpless and thought I could rely on a cigarette. I was so excited, lighting up, the first hit. It was awful. The cigarette was stale and harsh on my throat; I didn't even finish it. I cried a bit afterwards, I was extremely disappointed in myself. But I know I have to keep moving, keep trying until I get it right! I am sad to see the my flair go away though.

Thanks for reading and thanks for being such an awesome sub!

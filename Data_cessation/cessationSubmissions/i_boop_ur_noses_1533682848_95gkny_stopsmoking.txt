I think I'll move on from my ex this time

Do you remember your first heartbreak? The one that you loved, or more so thought that you loved,  when that person breaks your heart, when they aren't what we thought they were or wanted them to be. Then you break up and seconds feel like days and days feel like decades. Everyone tells you to move on, to focus on yourself and your life, but they seldom understand it's not as easy and there is no 'fix'. You don't even listen to them. Then after a while, don't remember how long it has been, but you wake up one day and you know you ache less, suddenly you want to smile, you feel like its doable, that you'll survive, that the main person in life is you yourself. That day is the day you start moving on, thats the day you are free.
I wish we all move on and be free. I feel this is my time. Multiple attempts, but this time I feel like I ache less.
Hang on, we can do this.

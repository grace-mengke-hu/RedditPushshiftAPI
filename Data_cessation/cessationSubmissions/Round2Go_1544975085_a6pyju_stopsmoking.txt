Quitting day is coming up. Looks for tips

I’m trying to quit starting 12/22. Why that date? I have a week off from work and thought it would help with any initial grumpiness. I haven’t been smoking (vaping) for long, since September. I started vaping on a vacation and it kind of took over. Vaping is very convenient and I’m now doing about a packs worth a day. Not good.  Life’s been stressful and I’ve been dealing with some depression, etc. with a therapist. My boyfriend smokes (but also wants to quit). Being around it, led to trying it, and getting hooked. He is supportive with me quitting and never wanted me to start. He really wants to quit too and has tried several times in the past.

Anyway, I’m hoping to get some advice on quitting. What worked for you? Any tips on the initial push to get off, distractions during cravings, etc? So far I’m planning on throwing everything away. I’ve downloaded the Smoke Free app. hoping that helps too. I’m new to this so any help/advice would be appreciated!

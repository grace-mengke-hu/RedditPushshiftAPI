Okay guys, please help me

I’ve been through so many stressful situations in the past month. I’ve been off cigarettes for a month and a week but with all this recent stress, I’ve been dreaming of just one drag of Pall Mall. I’ve been chewing nicotine gum aggressively and it helped for the first few weeks but now I’d give up my first born for a drag.

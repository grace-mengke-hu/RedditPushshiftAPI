How Do You Start?

Hey Reddit, I'm still pretty young, and I've been smoking for about 2 years now from a half to a full pack a day. I take smoke breaks throughout the day to help destress, get away from people, etc. but I know I gotta quit. Its already gotten out of hand and smoking has integrated into my life too much. How do you replace all that time in the day when you really feel like stepping out for a cig? Also, are there any tips on quitting and then doing something to fight the urges. As shitty as it sounds, I feel like smokings a part of me at this point and the thought of quitting is really a foregein, somehwat scary notion.

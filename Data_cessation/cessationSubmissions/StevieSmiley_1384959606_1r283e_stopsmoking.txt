Smoking and cold weather. Maybe I'm just a nutt.

Lately I've been going out for walks for the fresh air, the scents, the exercise, you name it. Lately, something occurred to me. I seem to be feeling warmer than usual, particularly during the cold mornings. I tried to google it pretty unsuccessfully but did come across a problem with the thyroid gland not producing oxygen, making you feel colder during the winter months. Coincidently, I AM breathing more fresh air. So maybe there's something to it? Does anyone else know or have experienced this?

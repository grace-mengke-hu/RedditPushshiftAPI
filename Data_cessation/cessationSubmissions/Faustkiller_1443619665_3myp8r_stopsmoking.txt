DAY 1 - AGAIN - Started again after 191 days quit

Hello,

I had been quit for 191 days and then stupidly had 5 at a party. That was Memorial Day and I've been smoking ever since.

I have a new username but used this sub last time and it helped a lot. Re-listening to Allen Carr's book (I have the audiobook).

Looking forward to being here and quit again.

It's weird in the past month, I made it 3 days and then 7 days without but went back to it. Maybe it's not weird.

It also seem during the first wk or so after the first 5 I was actively trying to get addicted again. I don't know why.  Maybe to prove that it was actually enjoyable and meant something. Utterly pointless. Oh well. I like to talk about it. It helps somehow.

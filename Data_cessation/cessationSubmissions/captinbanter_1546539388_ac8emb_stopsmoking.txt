The way I’m trying to quit.

Hey peeps just wanted to gather your thoughts on this way I’m trying to quit because I’ve tried multiple times to do it cold turkey and it just hasn’t worked out. 

But basically it stated with me having a cigarette then setting a timer for a couple hours. And during the timers duration i am not allowed a cig. After the timer has run out I’m allowed a cig again, but I have to add ten minutes to the timer. And basically keep on repeating the process add to the timer every time I have a cig. 

It has been going super well for me as I’ve managed to cut down my 20-30 a day habit to just two or three without ever to agitated or stressed. 

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Much love.

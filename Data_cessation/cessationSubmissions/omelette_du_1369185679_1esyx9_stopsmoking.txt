Help Me

Hey ya'll, could really use some reassurance and motivation, seeing as I really fucking want to walk down to the gas station and purchase a pack right now, but as much as I want to, I want to not a smidge more. I've decided that smoking is letting myself know that I hate myself. I'm in a bad place as is, as suffer from depression and some other mental issues. School is a huge stressor right now as well. And I've realized that smoking doesn't make me feel better (though my brain reassures me it will cure all evil once I have that one more), but it over time, makes me feel worse. I start feeling it physically. My lungs hurt. parts of my body I never knew existed hurt. Who am I? What am I doing to myself? Do I hate myself that much that I choose to ignore these indicators of maltreatment for a nicotine fix? Having to sign that "I guarantee to be drug free" sign in 7th grade was so lame at the time, but I wish I has listened and I think about it often in the sense that "7th grade you would be so ashamed. what are you doing" some help, please. Be my buddy. It's okay if you've quit, are quitting, going to quit. whatever. I would just love to have someone here for encouragement. Thanks. Hopefully I don't go buy a pack after I hit send. no promises. will power, be strong.

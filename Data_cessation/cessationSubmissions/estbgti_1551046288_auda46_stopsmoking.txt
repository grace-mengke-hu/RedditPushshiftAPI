Am I associating the craving of nicotine with the feeling of loneliness?

So I decided to quit smoking early December and it has been going pretty well so far, I no longer smoke unless I'm at a bar or a gig, and I just went two weeks without a single smoke while I was away with the family on holiday. I've recently noticed since being back that I've been feeling a bit of loneliness, despite the fact that I live in a student house with 5 other friends I hang out with a lot. I think what may be happening is that I've associated one type of socialising (eg. going for a drink at a bar or going to a gig) with smoking and the relief from the nicotine craving it provides, and now the craving of nicotine is the craving for this type of socialising, and therefore the lack of nicotine in my body feels the same as loneliness. Does this sound logical or does smoking have nothing to do with this? And I think I'll give up the social smoking too from now on in case it is the cause.

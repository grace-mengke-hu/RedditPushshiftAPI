If you think it's a battle or a fight after a week, your mindset is wrong.

Once the physical withdrawal symptoms are gone, there is no reason to feel like you are in a "fight" of any kind. That's your mind playing tricks on you.  The reason you think each new week and each new month brings a new struggle is because you have convinced yourself that you are struggling and missing out on something without smoking.

You aren't struggling due to lack of nicotine, you are struggling due to lack of belief that smoking really was killing you.  The reason the Al Carr method works is because it puts the myth of the "struggle" to bed once and for all for those with ears to hear it.

After the first week, the fight is over. You won.  The nicotine monster is dead. Laying there in the gutter looking like a tar covered rat.  The only reason anyone still relapses after a week or thinks it is a constant struggle after a week is not understanding something: Smoking will kill you, and it's not a friend you need to be missing. Don't MISS IT. It will kill you.

I have noticed here two mindsets on this board:

1&gt;I'm done, cold turkey, that's just the way it is, and I got this. It's done.

2&gt;I quit smoking but woe is me, i'm suffering so much, i've been suffering for months or years boohoo hoo etc.

FACT IS after about 5 days, your mind is the only obstacle left. Stop acting like a victim of your quit, or you will relapse.

Join the ones who owned the challenge to quit, made no excuses, and just did it while being honest to themselves about the fact that giving up smoking is a gift to yourself and loved ones, not a punishment to incessantly whine about for months or years on end.

Sorry for the tough love but I want to help!

Today (May 31st) is World No Tobacco Day! Use it as motivation to stay away from cigarettes just one more day. Or perhaps, this is the perfect day to kick the habit once and for all.

Stay strong folks! What a perfect day to not smoke. Summer is beginning and you can leave your habit behind you, starting fresh with a smoke-free month of June. 

After daily use of amphetamines, weed, and cigarettes for ~1.5 years, I'm a week clean of everything. I promise it gets easier with each day and the sun shines a little brighter. 

[Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day) the wiki on today's holiday. Sure, it's not as glamorous as some other holidays, but why not sprint down the stairs this morning like a little kid on Christmas to celebrate the fact that you're beating cigarettes?

For you, today is the holiday you celebrate 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, or much more sober from nicotine. Or perhaps, today is the day you *start* your journey toward sobriety. Maybe today is the day you forgive yourself for relapsing, and understand that that is part of the process -- you didn't lose! You are standing back up, brushing yourself off, and just not smoking today. :) 

If you've got loved ones who went through this battle with you, tell 'em about the obscure holiday and celebrate together!

Watch out when running into old friends!

I was quit for 2 months when I decided to go out drinking and ended up running into a couple of people I hadn't seen in years. I used to smoke cigarettes with these people all the time and even though I was pretty much strong into my quit at this point I slipped up by getting too comfortable around them. In my stupid drunk state I lit one up and next thing you know I'm back at the gas station buying packs.

This is a huge set back for me and really sucks but I guess the takeaway is to never get too comfortable when giving up an addiction because you never know when you may slip up. Even though I had the alcohol + cigarette trigger covered the fact is alcohol impairs your judgement so even though I wasn't craving one I guess I got struck by some sort of nostalgia and gave in.

I'm going to give this another go because I know I can do it but this a reminder to everyone to always be vigilant!

Day 13, still have thoughts and cravings

Hey there, just figured I would post to get advice, and maybe some support. I have tried all the methods in the past (gum, patch, pills etc) with no success. This time, I am doing Chantix. It seems to be doing pretty good. I am not getting the strong urges and irritability like in the past, but I still often think of it. How long will that last? How long till you know your done for good? Thanks in advance for all the advice and support.

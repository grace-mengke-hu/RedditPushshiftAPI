One Week

I was by no means a "hardcore" smoker. Really only smoked about 8-10 cigarettes a day. But I was hooked either way, and I knew it. I tried quitting cold turkey in May, made it two weeks and an emotional day caught me off guard and questioned my sobriety (almost two years sober). I figured better the cigs than the bottle (I'm actually happy about this cig relapse). Then I decided to read alan carr in july. I wanted really badly to quit so I read the book in about a day and a half. It actually seemed to help a lot, but right around two weeks, again, I had this tremendous urge to smoke that wouldn't leave me all day. I kept recognizing it and feeding it and eventually caved. I was disappointed because I thought I really had done it that time. I came back from that a bigger smoker and could definitely recognize the addiction. I decided to give the book one more shot, this time reading it more closely and taking my time with it (read it in about 5 days this time) and really absorbed the information. I'm a week in today and feel pretty good. The occasional thought here and there about smoking, but when this happens I really try to focus on all the benefits of being a non smoker. What really helped for me is to realize that the physical withdrawal pains are actually very slight. In my experience it is way more mental.

I feel great right now, but clearly the two week point has been an issue in my past. Hopefully if I can keep moving and get passed the 2-3 week mark, and I know I'll be happy with this decision.

Sorry for the long post, but I'm trying this out this time. Thanks in advance for the support.

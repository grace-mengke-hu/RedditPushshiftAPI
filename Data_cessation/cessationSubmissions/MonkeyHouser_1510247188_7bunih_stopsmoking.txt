I'm really doing it this time

Ok so I've been a pack a day smoker for 18 years. I've quit twice before, once for 2 years and once for 3 months. I don't want to tell people I know because I'll get oh you're quitting again eye roll and that will just put doubt in my head that I don't need!

The worst part is my family. They were so over the top proud of me when I quit for the first time for 2 years (5 years ago) that I never admitted to them I started again. I live over an hour away and work week days and weekend nights so I don't get to see them that often, and since restarting I go out of my way not to see them or see them for the shortest amount of time possible and that sucks so much because they are awesome. They deserve better and I deserve better. So I'm fucking done

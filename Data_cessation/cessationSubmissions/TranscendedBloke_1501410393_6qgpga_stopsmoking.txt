Cold turkey just doesn't work for me

I once managed 3 days and suffered severe depression and anxiety which eventually turned into an existential crisis which I was very fond of in my year and half of depression, i did some Shisha, which I'm not a fan of hoping that it's a easier to get rid of, next day I had 2 packs (I smoke about one and a half regularly). 

So my question to you gentlemen is, what systemic way should I go for?

My resolution is pretty firm but when the monkey mind takes over I'm done for.

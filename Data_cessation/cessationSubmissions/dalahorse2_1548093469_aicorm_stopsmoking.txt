Finding it hard to cope without cigarettes.

I'm on day 18 now free from smoking. However, I am really really struggling with some things. I think the worst part for me is that I may not be in a good place right now. I'm not at all what I thought I would be at 23. Every day seems so mundane and dull. I'm in college and I feel so nervous around everyone not being able to smoke. I think smoking is stupid and quite silly but I do feel cool as hell doing it. It's not just part of my routine its part of who I am. I feel out of place without a cigarette in my hand and it feels like everyone is looking straight into my very soul and all of a sudden they can see that I'm fake and that I don't know what im doing. I don't want to be ordinary I want to be special, like most young people I suppose, cigarettes made me feel special. Right now I do not enjoy anything and I'm isolating myself from people and my responsibilities. The worst part is not the nicotine withdrawal, I hardly notice that. It's just that I really really want to cope with my emotions and I don't know how. Does anyone relate at all or do I just come off as arrogant?

TLDR; How the hell can I feel normal without cigarettes?!

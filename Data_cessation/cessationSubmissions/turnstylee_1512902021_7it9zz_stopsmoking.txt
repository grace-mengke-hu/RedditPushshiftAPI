I confess

I must confess I barely made it 2 days without a cig before allowing myself to buckle. Chain reaction unfortunately as I also relapsed on speed and alcohol. Maybe the addict in me planned it all. Regardless, I should be asleep and waking up soon.  I’m trying my best to keep my composure and not allow the crippling guilt to come hot stepping.  A coworker reminded me that “Rome wasn’t built in a day”

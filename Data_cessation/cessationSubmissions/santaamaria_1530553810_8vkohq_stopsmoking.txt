Almost tricked myself into smoking again

I weighed myself this weekend and I have gained 7lbs since I quit.  So naturally the next thing I thought about was how I should just start smoking again.

NOT A CHANCE you addicted little brain, good try though.

However, now that I feel more comfortable with my quit, I am going to focus on eating better. I have gone on walks nearly every day but I have been super indulgent over the last month with my food choices. 

So to all of us that may have added a few (temporary) pounds during our quit, itâ€™s okay, we are works in progress.  And still way better off not smoking.

Day One... I know I can do this... I have to do this...

Ever have one of those moments where you reflect as to when your life started it's down spiral? At least in a being healthy sense... 
I was 18, just graduated high school. I was fit and involved in many sports and outdoor activities. I waffled around 150lbs - but at that age felt like a fatty-fat-fat compared to all of the other gals, but they hadn't grown into their woman figures like I had...
Anyways, on one of those underage drinking  nights, was confronted by a group of peers that were smoking cigarettes. "tracecadet would NEVER smoke a cigarette, she's too much of a goody two-shoes..." I thought I'd prove them wrong with my rebelliousness and smoked TWO. My beer buzz was suddenly heightened, and it was this mix of glorious dizziness and a slightly sick stomach. I loved it. I continued. I lied to my family about it. I've had multiple family members suffer and pass with lung cancer - yet naively, I promised myself I'd quit before I reached that stage.
Fast forward eleven years almost. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being out of breath walking up stairs. I'm sick of the lack of motivation I have towards exercising. I'm sick of waiting for [insert the next big reason to quit here] to start quitting.  I'm sick of the 65lbs I've been accumulating and dragging around with me. I'm sick of how I smell. I'm sick of the obsessive clock-watching waiting for that little ten minute break of "fresh air". I'm ready to change. I need to change.

So, reddit. Thanks for offering a place to vent/celebrate/ponder/change. I know I can do this. I have to do this.

One last request - I remember someone mentioning a small book that helps one to quit smoking once they've read it. Does anyone have a link to that?

Thank you for reading. I can't reach out to my friends and family again, they've listened to me cry wolf on this for too long. Now I need to prove to myself and to them that this time - I'm ready.

I relapsed again today.

I've only been smoking three years.   Over the past year other tried to quit four times.   Each attempt lasted about a week.   I've tried cold turkey,  patches,  gum,  lozenges,  and vapor.  

None have worked.  Nothing seems to take the edge off except smoking.  I can only be satisfied by one certain brand and type too.   I'm a trucker too so I know I probably smoke our of stress and sometimes boredom.  

Is it truly nicotine I'm addicted to or something else?

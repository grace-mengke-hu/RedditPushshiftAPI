4 days in. Does it get worse?

Today I am in my 4th smoke free/no nicotine after 15 years 10 cigs a day. I have been using a vape with 0 nic juice just to help ween off. Day 2 was bad. Like constant cravings all day and some anxiety. Other than day 2 I honestly havenâ€™t had any strong cravings or stress/anger/anxiety. Should I expect it to get worse?

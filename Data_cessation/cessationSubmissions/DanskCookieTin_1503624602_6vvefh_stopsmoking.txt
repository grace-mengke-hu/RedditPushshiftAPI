Procrastination after quitting?

So I quit cold turkey three weeks ago (with one cigarette slip-up about two weeks in - luckily it tasted horrible and I haven't relapsed again since). The issue I'm having is that I used to use cigarettes as a "cue" to start the next task in my day. Like I would come home from work, smoke, then do laundry; smoke, then work on my art, etc. 


Now that I'm smoke-free I'm having real issues managing my time. Does anyone have similar issues, and if so, how do you resolve it?

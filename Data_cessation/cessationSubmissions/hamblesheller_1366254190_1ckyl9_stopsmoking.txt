90 days a non smoker! After 46 years of smoking!

And this subreddit was the biggest help. Knowing that I wasn't the only one struggling to quit, hearing other people's stories. Well you guys rock.  Here is what helped me:

1.  I told everyone I cared about.  
2.  Lots of crunchy crisp bread. Also Mentos gum.
3.  Got rid of all cigarettes and paraphernalia, like lighters, ashtrays.
4.  I used Chantix because I had smoked for so long and, for me, relapsing would be far harder, I don't want to go through withdrawal again. I had vivid dreams, that was all.
5. Lots of water.

I never thought in my wildest dreams that I could quit smoking. I never even considered it.

And look at me, there is a second chance! If I can do it, you can, too. We human beings are incredible when we put our minds to it.

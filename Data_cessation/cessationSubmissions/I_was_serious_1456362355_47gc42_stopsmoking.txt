One Week!! Woooohoooo!!!

Just wanted to say thanks for all the encouragement. Today makes a week and I haven't felt this good in decades...literally. I especially want to thank /u/Jdach27 because the Alan Carr video you posted in a comment last Wednesday is what inspired me to do this. Just wanted to let you know what a difference you've made in a random stranger's life. You actually most likely saved my life, so again, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

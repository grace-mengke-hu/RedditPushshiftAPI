I am so tired of smoking and I want to stop.

I recently went through a very stressful time in my life and my consumption of cigarettes went up to about a pack a day. My weight also increased dramatically, as did my drinking.

For the past year I have been focusing on making many positive changes in my life. I improved my diet. I now drink in moderation (1-2 drinks per sitting on a Friday or Saturday night). I exercise regularly.

I have reduced the amount a smoke to about a half pack a day, but I am sick of smoking and I do not want to do it anymore. Its gross, and I pretty much hate myself every time I smoke. It costs way too much money. 

I have about 18 cigarettes left in the pack I have. Do any of you have any pointers that would help me make this the last pack I will ever buy?

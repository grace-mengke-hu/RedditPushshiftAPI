After relapsing about 6 months ago, today is the day I finally quit!

So those of you in the UK may know about the NHS stop smoking service; if you don't, it's a service where you see a pharmacist on a regular basis who counsels you and recommends products you can use to quit. 

Having tried to quit (and succeeding for a few days/weeks) on more occasions than I can count, I decided on a more tried-and-tested solution. Now, I don't know how accurate the NHS statistics are (apparently the stop smoking service doubles your chances of successfully quitting), but I figure it's worth a go.

I decided to go with the patch and mouth spray, and I've gotta say that unlike every other quit attempt I have had, these first 16 hours have been an absolute breeze! I know that NRT isn't for everyone, but if you're out there and wondering about it, you have nothing to lose by giving it a go!

Here's to being smoke free and good luck to everyone else who is just starting their life as a non-smoker!

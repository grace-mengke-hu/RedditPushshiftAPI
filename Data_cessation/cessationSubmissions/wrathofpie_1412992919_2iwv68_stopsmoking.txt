Tips for quitting with anxiety

Hey, just found this sub and I'm pretty excited. I'm looking to quit smoking, but want to be well prepared so that I can quit for good this time. I was wondering if anyone with any anxiety disorders could give me some tips as to how to handle it. During my last attempt to quit smoking, I made it 24 hours without a cigarette, but I had a panic attack so bad my sister had to call an ambulance. I do have pretty severe panic disorder, which makes it tough to figure out how to go about the whole quitting process. Has anyone on here dealt with the same thing, and how did you successfully beat it?

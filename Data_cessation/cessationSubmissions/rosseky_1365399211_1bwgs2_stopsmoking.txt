It's been a little over a year

I picked March 15th as the day when I quit smoking. I don't know when I actually did, but I know it was in March so I split the difference. Found out a couple days after the 1 year anniversary that that day, as well as that reason, is the same day my Dad quit drinking 5 years previously (it was his 6th anniversary.) Now I have a milestone on the same day as my Dad and I feel even more confident, like we are doing this together.

Anyway, keep plugging away everyone. You will get it. We all support you, we all love you (as much as strangers possibly can), and I hope to hear some success from you in the future, no matter how small.

Good Luck!

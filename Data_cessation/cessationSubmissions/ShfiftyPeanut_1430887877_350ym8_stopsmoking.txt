2 days and counting!

I've only recently discovered this sub, and it might be what I'm looking for.

I've been smoking for the last 10-12 years or so, got up to 20-30 smokes per day.

I've tried quitting a couple times in the past and barely lasted 2 days. At the moment I've had one smoke in 3 days, and that was 2 days ago.

I've stopped smoking in my car (1 month!) and I've stopped smoking at work (1 and a half weeks). If I can break the habit at home, I can do this!

I just wanted to say hi, tell my story, and hopefully help keep myself accountable for quitting.

Sick and tired of this addiction

I've been smoking for about two years. I'd put myself at about 1/2-1 pack per day. My hands and feet are always cold. I'm so embarrassed about the smell. Last night I could smell cigarettes in my dream and I was chastised for how bad I smelled. I'm embarrassed plain and simple. 
I want to quit but I'm nervous to quit. I am in college and I smoke to get away from my stress. I know smoking doesn't decrease stress. I'm nervous to quit because I don't know if I can handle it on top of how stressful school is.
I'm nervous because my brain is afraid of losing its precious nicotine. I know I have to think long term, but I can't get over how the short term will affect me. I need help :(

Whew...

&amp;#x200B;

Boiling my motive all the way down for why I wanted to quit smoking is that I want to live a very long time.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have nightmares of dying before my son has found his "tribe".  Ya know what I mean?  My future 30 year old son sobbing on my deathbed, "What will I do without you!?"....Very grim, morbid, sad vision that kept popping into my head.  I like to be proactive about my fears.  So to resolve this I would need to ensure my longevity and live my life in a way that is conducive to becoming a centennial, or as close to it as possible.  I wanna see my kid get old &amp; gray before I bite the dust.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thats why I quit.  

Thats why I am staying quit.  

So my son won't have to bury me while he still likes me.  Let me get very old a cranky and bitter so it won't hurt him as much : ) .  I wanna get to the ripe old age of death being a blessing, ya know?  When people get so old they become prisoners in their own body, thats how old I want to be.  I want people happy and smiling and partying at my funeral, "God has finally taken her!  Praise the Lord she is now home!"...I dont want people thinking, "She was too young, she had so much life left in her.  Why God!?  Why her!?  Oh yea, she was a fat smoker, duh..."...So, smoking is taken care of, now I gotta work on this fatness.

Im also very hopeful that if I can make it to my 60's, there will probably be enormous medical advancements.  By then we might have that whole, brain transferred to a new body thing mastered so we can live as long as we want to.

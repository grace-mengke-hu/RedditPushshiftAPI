I want to quit

Hi All,

Ive been smoking since I was 14, now 34. I have never in my life before ever wanted to quit, the thought never crossed my mind until recently. Its not so much the health thing (although this is important obviously) but more about money, It costs so much now I just don't want to do it anymore.

I'm looking for some advise really on how to go about it. I was thinking of just saying "right from Monday I quit" and going cold turkey.

The problem is my partner will still be smoking.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated

Day 200:)

One day at a time,two hundred times! I love this nicotene free life. I currently have a nasty cold and am remembering the taste of being sick and still smoking, gross! I put them down on Saint Patrick's day at two pm. The thought just came to me. No one physically needs to smoke. Care to share your Ahah moment?

I'm fuckin sick

Literally, I'm fuckin sick. Called off work, gonna call off tomorrow too. Throat is killing me. Cold sweats. Headache. My hair hurts. Fever. Everything. 

I have been trying to quit for YEARS with varying degrees of success. I once went a year without smoking. Once went 9 months without smoking. I've had more 1 and 2 month stints of not smoking than I even know. Within the last few months, I've also decided I want to quit smoking weed.

What keeps happening is I lean on one as a crutch to quit the other, and then relapse anyways. As of right now, I haven't smoked any cigarettes or weed in 2 full days. Which is the only time that has happened. I have been a pack a day smoker for over 17 years. I have been a heavy marijuana smoker almost just as long. I mean heavy too. I sell weed just to be able to afford my habit. I buy an ounce for 250, take out 10.5 grams worth, and sell the rest to friends and family to pay for the next one. This is a once a week thing.

I'm currently dieting and trying to exercise more. I use MFP, I jog using the c25k app, and starting to get into lifting with strong lifts 5x5. The entire time I've been trying to make all these healthy changes, I've been flip flopping back and forth on smoking weed and cigarettes.

Well, I'm fuckin sick. I don't even want to smoke. I have no desire to right now. Not cigs or weed. Tomorrow will be 3 days. Then I'll go to work on Sunday, I'll have to make it thru a full 10 hour day, after that I'll be off for 3 more. That will be a full week of not smoking anything, assuming I'm able to stick with it, which I really hope I am. 

I don't want to smoke anymore.

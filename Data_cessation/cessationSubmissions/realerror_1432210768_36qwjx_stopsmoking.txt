A warning and a summary of my experiences with nicotine replacements. But mainly a warning.

when I posted here ~10 days ago, a wise user warned me about nicotine patches. I've read it and thought: "ok, he's probably right, but he exaggerates". [His words were](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/35kl1o/first_day_without_smoking/cr5cf2l):

> Be sure to take your patch off before you go to sleep by the way. If you leave it on you're going to have some terrifying nightmares. Seriously take them off before sleep.

And I just want to push that warning and share my experience with you. Last evening, I fall asleep while watching tv (long day at work). And I've had the most intense and scary nightmare I can remember. After an hour, I finally woke up and was totally soaked by sweat, I even broke a glass. I'll make sure not to sleep with a patch again, I wouldn't wish my arch enemy a nightmare like that.

So, I've read the instruction leaflet again. Nightmares or restless sleep is not mentioned, just a notice of possible insomnia. Of course I don't know if the patch was really the reason, but I've slept fine for months and also last week.

**tl;dr? Don't use nicotine patches when you're sleeping. Really don't.** 

btw.: As you read, I'm using nicotine replacements. I started with 25mg nicotine patches and 2mg chewing gums. After the first seven days, I reduced to 15mg patches and the same gums (2 or 3 each day). So far, it works pretty good. I have no withdrawal symptoms and it is actually easy not to smoke (except for the first 2 days). Next week, starting Monday, I'll reduce to 10mg patches. I'm also using an app to count my "cravings" and their intensity, maybe I'll make a diagram in a few weeks.

Well, here I go

I'm a one pavk a day smoker since only 2 years. Today was day 1 of me stopping. I mamaged to stop before but only for 1 months before relapsing. By experience, I know I will only live complete hell for 2 more days . Then, the challenge will only be to not go "just this time"while drunk one month later. 

I felt like sharing this in a support community. And yes I want to keep going cold turkey

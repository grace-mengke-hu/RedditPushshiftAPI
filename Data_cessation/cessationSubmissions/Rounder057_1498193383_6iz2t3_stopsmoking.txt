25 hours in....

Doing the real cold turkey method.  No vape. No patch. No gum. Nothing. I want all of it out of me as fast as possible. I am not looking to draw out my pain any longer than I have to. Also, I hate everybody and my body and mind are exploding with anxiety and jitters and tension and what ever else seems to pop up inside my mind from any given second. 
This is not forever. 
This is worth it.

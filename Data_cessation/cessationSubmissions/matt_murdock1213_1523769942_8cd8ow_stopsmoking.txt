I think I’m being put off smoking

Recently the smell of cigarettes has been getting to me. Also I’ve noticed now that I’m going hours on end without smoking but once I’m back home I smoke almost 3-4 cigarettes and I’m doing it out of habit and feel like shit. 

I started smoking because I wanted to fit in, to be cool, mostly because I was lonely. I realized it was my way of coping with everything. I’ve tried before to quit but obviously relapsed more than once. However now, I’m so sick and tired of this. If you have any advice on beating this habit, or anything, please help me.

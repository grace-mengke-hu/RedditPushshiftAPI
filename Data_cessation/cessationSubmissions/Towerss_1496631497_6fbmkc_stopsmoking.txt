Don't underestimate the fact that cigarettes kill both libido and erectile function in men

For the time I smoked, I assumed I just had a really weak libido since it took a LOT of work to get properly hard, and a lot of work to maintain. I ended up feeling almost asexual and at times avoided sexual encounters because I risked making a fool of myself and not getting my dick to stand upright. Sounds funny and it is in hindsight but it actually became a serious problem.

It only took around 3 days for my dick to be in top shape again. My erections are stronger than I ever remembered, I barely have to think about sex to get these strong erections, and I am horny constantly. It's incredible how smoking has essentially suppressed a basic part of me to the point where it literally crippled me, and I didn't even realize. For the young guys suffering from erectile or libido problems, make sure to consider that smoking is a probable cause.

Here's a few peer-reviewed studies on the matter, it's rather interesting because it appears the nicotine itself has a detrimental effect on sexual function:

This study even found out that no matter what the smokers themselves believed, nicotine lowered the erectile quality in 100% of subjects taking nicotine when measurements were made.

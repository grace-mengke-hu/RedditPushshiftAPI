3 weeks yesterday!

Hello! First time posting in this sub, looking for like minded people. I stopped smoking after I broke my foot and the doc said it would slow down healing time, I originally planned on going back to smoking after, but I'm planning on being done for good now! Problem is everybody around me smokes. A looooot, and at 3 weeks these cravings get pretty rough. I'm looking forward to being able to walk up my driveway without losing my breathe, though!

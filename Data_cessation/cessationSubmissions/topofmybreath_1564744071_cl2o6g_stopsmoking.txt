6 months later a half marathon

So it's not everyone's thing but quitting smoking after just over 20 years made me so proud and want to feel fitter than i already did. But it also  made me stress so much for the damage I have done to my lungs and body over the years. I'm pleased to announce I ran (well jogged but didn't walk) a half marathon on the 21st July. It's amazing how resilient the body is. And of course the mind is stronger... teach it that you hate smoking

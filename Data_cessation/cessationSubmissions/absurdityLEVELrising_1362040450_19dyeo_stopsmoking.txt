Just got out of the hospital to get a throat abscess drained

(Not my first time to stop smoking)

Felt the beginnings of a sore throat last Friday 22nd, but continued smoking. I told myself that the soreness would go away quicker if I stopped after that pack. Well I buy some "lights" the Marlboro 72s. So they are short as well as light, they must be healthier? By monday night I am choking them down, physically holding my throat in one hand while taking a drag...

Finally decide I need to get healthy, I had my last cig Tuesday morning. This whole time I have been taking a bunch of different hippie remedies. Now, I had a lump in one side of my throat and i could barely swallow.

Wednesday evening finally I realized I need true Western medicine to treat me. Good thing I went in, had I waited any more days the abscess could have done a lot of damage to my throat. 

I got poke by a bunch of needles at various points, and it was a relief to have the abscess drained. Sure I had smoker's cough in the past but to have to go in for throat surgery because of smoking? The brain is going to try to trick me back into smoking once I am healed but I am going to forever remember this. It was not even all that painful physically, but the bill in the mail someday soon most likely will be. Hooray no insurance in America!

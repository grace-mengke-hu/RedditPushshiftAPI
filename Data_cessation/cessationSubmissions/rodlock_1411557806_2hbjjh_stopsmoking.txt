Dear self, this is why you quit.

Hi future self. I guess you are looking at this list because you want to have a cigarette and can't remember why you quit in the first place. Let me tell you. 



__Because it smells disgusting.__ You know that comfy, cozy feeling of being right out of the shower and wearing a freshly washed sweater and smelling like you are an angel from heaven? That feeling is not compatible with the stench of an old cigarette butt, which is what you will smell like if you start smoking again. 

__Because your skin will age and you will look like a gray, washed out Yoda.__ Goodbye /r/skincareaddiction. As long as you smoke no moisturizer will make a damn difference. 

__Because your boyfriend does not want to kiss you when you smell like an old cigarette butt.__ Period. 

__Because you will never have to ask new friends if it is okay that you smoke when they are around.__ And you will never have to see them get uncomfortable when you light one up, you will never have to hear them cough because they got smoke in their face. 

__Because you could buy other stuff with that money.__ Like a nice pair of warm, cozy socks. Or a bodylotion that smells like fresh roses. Or a trip to italy. Or maybe a dog. 

__Because you will never have to freeze whilst smoking in the rain ever again.__ Or in the snow. Or when its dark outside and you are a little bit scared. You can just stay inside! 

__Because your energy levels are higher than ever without cigarettes.__ You take walks in nature. You paint more now. You read books and drink tea and enjoy life a lot more without them. 

And, most of all:

__Because of your future children.__ Imagine them having to hug a mom that smells like smoke. Imagine them having to see you spend all that money on something that does you no good. Imagine them stealing a cigarette out of your pack and hiding out behind the garage taking their first puff. Imagine finding a pack of smokes in their room. Imagine the look in their eyes when you tell them you have cancer. The look in their eyes as you drive to the hospital. The look in their eyes as you shut yours for the last time. And imagine that you could have had twenty more years with them but you chose the cigarettes. 




And lastly: even if the things on this list don't matter to you there is one thing i would like to ask you: have the cigarettes ever added anything to your life? Couldn't you just live as good without them? Because in the end, you don't need them as much as you think you do.

Hello /r/stopsmoking. I am 16 and have been smoking for a year or more. And tonight i quit. As my mother and i just got told.. she has lung cancer.

Hello. I just thought i'd drop by and see what this subreddit is about. And i see its about people and giving their progress. Well im 16 now and about a year and a half ago i stole acouple of my moms cigerettes and went outside to smoke them. I didnt k.ow how so i youtubed it and learnt. It burned and nastied like hell but i wanted to see why someone would smoke them. I didnt releaised you got a buzz off of it. And frankly i disliked the buzz it made me feel bad to my stomach. But i kept smoking and idk why. I hated it and still do and i dont even get the buzz now. But i still have the urge too. Its so stupid. And the worse part is, being 15-16 i coyldnt get my own, money wise and age wise. So i would take the butts and take the tobacco and put them in a pipe i made(later bought one) and smoke and inhale it. Now that really put a hurt on the lungs. I can actually feel not being able to take a full deep breathe and it will go away after a few days. And with all that my mother who has been smoking since she was 15 just got told her pains were from lung cancer. It has made me quit. So day 0 starts tomorrow. I threw everything tobacco related away in a dumpster blovks from my house. Lets face this horror i always hear about wheb quiting. I maybe underestimatung it but.

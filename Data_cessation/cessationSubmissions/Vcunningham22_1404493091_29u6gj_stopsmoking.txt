Here I go!

I'm quitting smoking today for the 100th time. Reading this subreddit has helped me a lot this week as I've prepared. I'm 24 and have smoked on and off since 18, with a 1.5 year break that I quit smoking using nicotine lozanges. I'm quitting now cold turkey with Allan carrs book in conjunction with hypnosis since during that year and a half break, I had a nicotine lozange in my mouth the whole time. I'm nervous and have little faith due to so many failed attempts, but I'm ready to do this. Any support or words of encouragement would be awesome, even though I've found a lot of it just reading this subreddit. Thanks y'all! Happy 4th!

Heey everybody!

So today was a work day without smoking im still at work probablynot done for another 5 hours.... But I havent smoked i actually sat with someone who was smoking and she offered me a smoke and I declined! Also didnt get the urge to smoke from the smell! I must say that even tho its only been 2 days I am quite proud of myself. Lets hope it stays this easy!

The Demon Called Upon Me Today

So tomorrow is 2 months for me, cold turkey.  Today, my upstairs neighbor left a pack of butts on the porch.  It took every bit of strength I had not to smoke one.  I walked away, I came back.  It was so overwhelming, and I couldn't let it go.  Every part of my mind cried out for me to smoke just one.  I even took one out of the pack and smelled it.  I just wanted it, with every crevice of my soul.  I put the butt back, walked back in my house, plugged in my old school NES and began playing Blades of Steel.  2 months strong, and I'm not going back. I've come way too far for me to ever smoke again.

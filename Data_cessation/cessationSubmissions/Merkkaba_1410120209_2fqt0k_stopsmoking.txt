Day one for the millionth time.

I notice that my teeth hurt when I smoke.  I quit for days at a time and then pick it up again on a whim.  After two days, my teeth start to throb and every time I light a smoke I think of my teeth melting.  Anyone else get this effect?  Hopefully my willpower sticks this time.

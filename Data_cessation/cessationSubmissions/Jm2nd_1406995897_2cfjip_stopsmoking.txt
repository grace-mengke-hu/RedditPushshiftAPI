Hello everybody, new here.

Well first of all hello to all of you. Im just a teenager and I really want to quit smoking and im starting today! The thing is that I always tried to persuade myself that I don't smoke to get attention or to be the cool guy or some shit like that. The most disappointing thing is that I denied the fact that I started smoking just to be the the cool guy. I always thougt that I liked smoking but apparently I dont. The thing is that because I can't afford buying cigs whenever I want, I could easily go a week without smoking and I didn't even feel the need to smoke. And then I would go out with my friends and for some stupid reason I would always find a cigarette to smoke even though I didn't really want to. I've told myself that I would quit smoking a thousand times yet every time I failed. Smoking doesn't relax me as some people may think. Anyways I'm just saying that I'll do my best in order to quit smoking because I really want to be healthy again. I'll see you around!

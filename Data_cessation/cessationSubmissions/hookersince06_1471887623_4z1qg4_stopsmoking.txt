I am a petulant child. But I'm not smoking, so there's that.

Saturday I laid curled up in bed in the fetal position, sobbing, because I wanted a cigarette and can't have one. Because it's not just one.

After I got it out I had to do about 10 minutes of positive affirmations to be able to get out of bed, but I did it. 

I'm never doing this again.

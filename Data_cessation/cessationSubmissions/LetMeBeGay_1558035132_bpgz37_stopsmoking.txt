Made it three weeks... Relapsed last night :(

I was so proud of myself. I was feeling better, breathing better, living healthier. Everything was better.

And then yesterday I had a very emotional day, got very drunk, started crying about everything in my life and went and bought a pack with the thought that I would “only smoke one” even though I knew that I wouldn’t be able to.

I’ve now smoked half the pack. I’m so disappointed in myself. I was doing so well, now I smell gross. My mouth tastes gross. I feel dirty. I don’t know what to do- I don’t want to go through the withdrawal again. :(

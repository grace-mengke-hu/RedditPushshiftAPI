Nicotine Patch problems

The only thing that's really been able to keep my smoking at bay effectively has been the nicorette nicotine patches. However, after a couple of months of succesfull use my skin became so sensitive and irritated by the patches that continuing to use them simply wasn't an option.

Any quitters in here who had similar experiences and maybe found solution e.g. a different patch brand that didn't irritate as much?

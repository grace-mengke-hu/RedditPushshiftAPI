I'm pretty buzzed. I'm still not gonna smoke.

I abstained from alcohol last time I quit for 3 months.. i decided I was ready to drink, so I did.. and I "just had one" cigarette. I think we all know how that goes.

It's been 27 days and I've been carefully drinking on the weekends since week 2 and I've progressively felt more comfortable. Every time I drink, it feels like a day of quitting. First time felt like day 1, second time felt like day 2, etc. I want a cigarette right now, but fuck that. I want to work my way into being able to drink with friends and not even thinking about smoking. I don't care how bad I want one, no cigarette is worth the mountain of disappointment I'll feel if I have one, or cancer, or smelling bad, or stained teeth.

I'm tempted to buy a pack of cigarettes just so I can PUNCH THEM INTO THE OCEAN! But I think I'll just buy a beer with that money. :)

I am feeling optimistic

First "bad day" at work down , first decadent meal and alcoholic drink after said day at work and I was expecting a 9/10 on the crave scale. In all honesty it was more around the 2/10 mark and was more a fleeting thought that I soon got over!

This leaves me with hope for the weekend when I hit the bar! 
Wish me luck. :)

Day 7(ish): How to deal with the emotional instability

I wasn't myself today at all. I'm normally a little chaotic, but level headed and upbeat.  Today I was up and down more than a helicopter pilot who keeps forgetting things. My internal chaos levels were through the roof. I think I cried like 3 times over nothing serious and worse yet, I was overly clingy with my gf (which is the opposite of normal with me). She was already in a bad mood from being in a car for 7 hours straight and having school early tomorrow, and we had a bit of a fight which I cried again after. Now I'm not the type of man who cries unless I really need to. And nothing today should have caused it.


Sorry for the wall of text. I just need to figure out how to get through this without destroying the rest of my life in the process.

TL;DR - I'm an emotional trainwreck thats trying really hard not to blow anything else up.

Temptation

I had my first real temptation to smoke today. It's been 2 months, and I can handle the temptation strangers I pass on the street smoking bring but apparently not my friends. 

We had a barbecue and the moment one of my friends pulled out a cigarette I thought 'oh, shit'. It got worse when one of my other friends asked if he could bum a cigarette and my brain came to the realisation that 'hey, I could ask for one too'. Then all of the thoughts of 'one won't hurt' and 'live a little' came back and I busied myself in my book as a distraction (unfortunately did not have data to look at horrible pictures of smoker's lungs and all those nasties). 

It was something small but it drove me up the wall. Ultimately I'm my own person and I am in control of my own descions and I don't have to bend to the social pressure of someone I know smoking.

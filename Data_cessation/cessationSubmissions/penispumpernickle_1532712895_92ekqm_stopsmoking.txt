Does it get easier?

Just hit 2 months yesterday. I’m 27 and have been smoking since 16. Just wanted to let everyone out there who is starting to quit know that it definitely gets easier. The first 1-2 weeks will be hard and becomes slightly easier for the 3-4 weeks,but will still be hard. Now that I am at 2 months in I realize some days I go without even thinking about smoking. I  can drink now and a smoking wouldn’t even cross my mind. I didn’t even realize I was at 2 months until someone asked me how it was going and I realized my accomplishment. I was smoking 2 packs a day and it’s all I would ever think about now it feels behind me. I still have to be active in quitting I know, but it’s easier everyday. For anyone is trying good luck. It will get easier.

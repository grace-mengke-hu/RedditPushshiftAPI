24 cubic ft of cigarettes

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone here for cultivating such a supportive community. I'm on day 11 and I feel incredible. 

Second, just wanted to share something real quick. Last week I told my buddy that according to my app I had not smoked 100 cigarettes. I told him it made me sort of sick to imagine 100 cigarettes line up in a row in front of me. This prompted us to do some quick math based on the dimensions of a pack of cigarettes and we worked out that if you put all the packs I've smoked over the years it would be roughly 24 ft cubed. 

I haven't had a chance to find the dimensions of my bedroom to figure out how much of it would be taken up by cigarettes and I'm not even sure I want to. Stay strong everyone!

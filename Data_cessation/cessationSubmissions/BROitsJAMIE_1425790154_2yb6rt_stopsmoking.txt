Milestone

So I'm at 60 something days. I don't keep as close an eye on the exact number anymore and I think that's a good thing. At least for me. Today I ran a foot race with my 11 year old stepson. It wasn't long...certainly less than 100 meters. But it would have killed me before, and I wasn't even winded. I was blown away. I've spent over 10 years trying to catch my breath after any physical exertion or anything athletic. Today, I saw real progress. It was great motivation. Thanks to this sub for being a strong source of strength.

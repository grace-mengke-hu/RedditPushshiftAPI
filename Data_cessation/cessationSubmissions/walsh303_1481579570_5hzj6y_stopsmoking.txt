I've just passed 24 hrs of not smoking cigarettes.

I do smoke weed, but I want to quit these awful cancer sticks. I'm 32 I've been smoking since i was 16. My lungs are constantly hacking up garbage. I want to be in shape and never spend another cent on nicotine. Even the vape pens look like death to me. Anyway, I'm very depressed and I hope that will lift off of me once i get the nicotine completely out of my system. I've been looking at this sub for about a year and I'm finally ready to commit to stop smoking.

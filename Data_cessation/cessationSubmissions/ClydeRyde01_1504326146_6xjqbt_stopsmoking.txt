Day 1 cold turkey

Hi all, newbie here to this sub reddit!

A little bit about me.... I'm 24 from Melbourne and have been smoking for the past 5 years. Today is my first day quitting cold turkey and I'm determined to make it work! I just can't afford the filthy habit anymore and want to live healthier. 

It's been approx 4 hours and I'm already craving so I'm sitting outside where I normally smoke but instead of having a ciggy I'm writing to all you guys and gals. 

I believe Monday-Wednesday are going to be the hardest as I study at tafe and we all know what tafe is like..... filled with smokers having a social ciggy in between classes I'm not sure how I'm going to manage being outside with them all so I may just find a little quiet area to wait in between. Possibly bring a book. 

Morning coffee whilst waiting for public transport is going to be another trigger that I will need to manage...

Anyways that's all from me.. thank you for taking the time to read this and I'll keep you updated on my journey if you're interested :)

Take care all!

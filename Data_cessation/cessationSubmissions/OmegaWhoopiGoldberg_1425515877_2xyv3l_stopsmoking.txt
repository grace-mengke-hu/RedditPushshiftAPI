Questions on vaping?

Hey everybody!

So long story short, I dated a smoker for 4.5 years and picked the habit up probably 2.5ish years ago. At its worst I got up to about half a pack a day. The relationship ended, so now I'm doing the whole "better myself" thing.

I've quit a few times before (we had broken up 2 times already) but typically only make it about a month before we're back together and I'm back on the stuff.

I've gone 23 days without a smoke (or nicotine). I still get some pretty bad cravings daily, usually revolving around stress (bad breakup, family stuff, other smokers, etc).

Basically, I'm thinking about buying a vaporizer. From what I've read they're safer for you (although not as safe as nothing at all). I have a few questions though. If you vape, do you consider yourself to be a nonsmoker? Does it hurt your throat/lungs? Does it smell (or stain you with stank)? I'm trying to get back to the point where I can start to run/work out again without feeling like I'm coughing up a lung.

I guess the main question is: Is/are smoking/cigarettes bad?  Or is nicotine bad?  Am I failure if I use nicotine in a "safer" way?

Thanks!

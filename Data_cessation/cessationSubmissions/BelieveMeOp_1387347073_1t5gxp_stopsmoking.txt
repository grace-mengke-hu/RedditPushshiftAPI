Some Questions

So I'm 16 (17 in january) and I've been smoking cigarettes since I was 10. I didn't really know better at the time how much it would affect me from sports to living day to day but I really wanna quit now but really I find it way too goddamn hard, between me dealing with the severe depression and trying to quitting making it kick in, I'm not sure how to even go about starting. I got a couple of questions:

When do the cravings stop?

How can I make them stop faster?

How long until it starts getting better?

What are the best substitutes to smoking cigarettes?

Should I just go with an E-Cig instead or what?

Thanks.

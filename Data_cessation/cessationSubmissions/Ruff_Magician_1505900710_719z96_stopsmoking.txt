Day 28 and im having my first drink

So im currently on about day 28. Been feeling good this past week. However since the day that I quit, ive always thought that id have trouble when it came to drinking. Ive smoked as long as ive drunk and they've always gone hand in hand... but driving home today, I thought the best way of clearing this hurdle was to take it head on. So im now half way thru my second drink, playing with a fidget spinner to keep my hands occupied, and you know what? Its really not that bad, I can do this....

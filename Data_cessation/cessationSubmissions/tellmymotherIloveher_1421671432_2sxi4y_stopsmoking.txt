Day 19 - CRIKEY THESE CRAVINGS!

Yeesh. Well in to the much documented and maligned week three of being nicotine free. Call it Monday, call it January, call it ending it with a girl yesterday, call it not loving my job... but I really feel like smoking today. I woke up and the craving was on me and though it has eased has not entirely disappeared. I suppose I am reaching for something to change the way I feel and I have to remember that the power to do that lies in me, not Nicotine. Anyway, helps to write these things out and share them. Hope everyone else OK- let's not smoke today.

Checking in...

It's been 11 days. It has been going exceptionally well. I've had few cravings and the ones I have had are easy to bat off. I'm going cold turkey and using Paul mckenna hypnosis. However, I am exhausted. I'm wondering if I'm using all my energy focusing so hard on not smoking.  Last week I was running and feeling fit as anything this week I have been a lazy lump and eating everything.  I'm letting myself off with it as smoking is my main focus right now and I deserve a treat I'm doing so well.

I'm socialising with a smoker and non smoker friend tonight and I'm really looking forward to successfully being in a  smokers company and feeling quite smug haha 

Hope you guys are smashing it too. Happy fri-yay

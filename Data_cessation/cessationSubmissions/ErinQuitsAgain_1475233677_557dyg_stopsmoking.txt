Quitting for good when it is too easy?

I seem to have the opposite problem to most people here. I experience little to no withdrawal symptoms whenever I quit and while I am really thankful for that, it causes another problem for me. Because I have such an easy time quitting I don't mind starting up again for short periods of time, often I go back to smoking for a week or so and then quit for a few months again.

I was a pack a day smoker for 6 years before I quit for the first time, and I did not really experience any withdrawal symptoms after that. I stayed quit for 3 years before I started smoking again at parties and for a few years now I have been doing this on again off again thing.

I would like to quit for good, but I have little incentive to fight urges when it is so easy for me to just put them back down. The worst that happens is I get a few cravings which are easy enough to push aside. It probably has little effect on my health to smoke a pack or two every few months too. So does anyone else experience this? How do you fight cravings a few months down the line when you know you can quit again any time you want to?

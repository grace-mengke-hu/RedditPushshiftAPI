Day 4, guys!!! I'm feeling a little shaky about it. How can I reassociate my triggers?

Ok, so I would smoke in the morning with my first cup of coffee, and I've stopped the craving associated with coffee by drinking it at the kitchen table instead of out on the patio, since there's no smoking allowed inside, and smoking had never been associated with the dining table. This morning I was able to have my coffee on the patio without wanting a cigarette. The association I'm super struggling with is driving. That craving hasn't slowed down at all for me, and I'd appreciate some advice if y'all have any.

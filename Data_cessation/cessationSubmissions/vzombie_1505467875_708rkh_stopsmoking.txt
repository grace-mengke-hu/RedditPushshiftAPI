10 days smoke free - currently eating everything.

Hey guys, I'm 10 days smokefree and really struggling not to eat everything in my fridge. I started walking 5 miles a day in July and now I find myself not wanting to go out and walk because that's when I would smoke. I just walk to the shop and binge buy junk. 

Just wondering if anyone can share what they replaced smoking with instead of eating please?

Thank you.

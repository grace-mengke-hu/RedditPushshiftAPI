Survived a day at the lake

For the first time in close to 15 years I went to a lake and spent the entire day smoke free. I’m about 80 days in, just shy of 3 months, so I’m still “green”. I was a little apprehensive, although my cravings are definitely few and far between these days (yay), because the lake/water and being in the sun listening to music and around smokers and drinkers etc etc etc...one of my FAVORITE things. I knew it would be a huge trigger. 

But I did it. And you know what? It was NOT difficult. I stayed on my little floatie and sun bathed and swam the entire day and did not once have to crawl out of the water mostly drunk and dehydrated from the sun and booze and dry my face and hands off to light a cigarette and smoke. My bf and I both quit smoking (yay again). But when we did smoke at the lake or pool, we used to take turns getting out of the water and lighting cigs for each other to bring back into the water for the other person. We would do this obsessively every 20-30 min or so for the entire day, go through a whole pack (each) in a matter of 6 hours or so. What a waste of time! Probably spent an entire hour solely on cigarettes and fetching them! 

This past wknd we both thoroughly enjoyed just staying in the water and drifting about, without the faintest worry about smoking. It was fantastic. TRUE relaxation. 

Now I haven’t had the courage to drink alcohol, my bf has and he has done it well without smoking, I’m just taking that whole situation easy for now. I definitely do want to enjoy booze again, I’m thankfully not “addicted” to alcohol like I am cigarettes, but I don’t really feel ready to drink yet? Plus I have the tendency to binge drink when it’s a party and everyone around is getting silly so...I dunno...maybe I like being nicotine free AND sober and just don’t care to risk it? This is all new to me LOL. I’ll figure that out eventually 😂  first things first: 
stop smoking. 

So yeah...I feel pretty damn good. 

PS-everyone was super hungover and gross feeling the next morning and hacking up there lungs, scrounging around for their smokes to feel “alive” again....while I was all kinds of perky and fresh and energetic and about to go workout. I would have called myself an “ass hole” for sure, lol, when I was on the other side of things! Just out of jealousy because that’s how I used to feel when I would see someone jogging or enjoying a recreational day outside while I was out of breath and lethargic and stuck in a self deprecating corner of the universe with a cigarette hanging out of my mouth. 

I definitely like it on this side so much more.

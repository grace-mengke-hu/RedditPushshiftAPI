Argh!!!

All week now I’ve been going to give up the cancer stick. But for the first time in my life I’ve run out of money. So tomorrow I won’t be able to buy any cigs. Or the day after. All I can think about is smoking now knowing I won’t be able to. I understand this could be the life line I need. But that doesn’t stop me feeling so bad. Grrrr!

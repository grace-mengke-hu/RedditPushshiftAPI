About 100 hours without a smoke!

So it's been just about 100 hours since I've smoked my last cig. I've been putting quitting off for years because I thought it was going to be unbelievably hard to quit and that I would just be overwhelmed with anxiety. To my surprise it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The first 24 hours was like a make or break it trial, I told myself if I made it 24 hours there's no turning back. The second day was harsh with cravings, and then when the third day came I started to have a little anxiety and depression spells. Im now at the end of day 4 and I'm still having a little anxiety and depression but it's not anywhere near as bad as it was yesterday and the day before.  I surprisingly don't think about cigs as much as I thought I would and to me that's unbelievable. I think im just finally over smoking or im just to damn stubborn to turn back to them after I quit. I know I don't like losing so maybe that's what it is, I challenged myself and refuse to lose. I also want to thank all of you that have given me support for these past few days and hope for lots more in my times of need and I'll always be right here if anyone needs to talk. This site has really helped me with continuing to quit and I hope it helps everyone here on their journey to quit. Stay strong everyone and good luck!!!

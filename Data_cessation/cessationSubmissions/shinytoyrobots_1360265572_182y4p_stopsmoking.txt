How to kick those one or two last "enjoyable" cigarettes?

Been pushing hard to kick the habit since the New Year. I decided that given my smoking habit was old enough to legally drink itself, it was time!

From a pack a day I'm at *almost* zero. I have no problem throughout the day - using the nicotine lozenges. But I have noticed a pattern that sees me have maybe one or two cigarettes in the evening - almost as if I'm trying to justify a "reward" to myself for not smoking throughout the day. Always coincides with being around friends/housemates who smoke.

...which tends to lead into me justifying a larger "cheat" at weekends.

I did, at least, catch myself on this. But I still find it really difficult to avoid the opportunity for that one or two cigarettes. Help me stop justifying this!

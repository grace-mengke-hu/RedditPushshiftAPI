Minute One of Day One

Just spit my nicotine gum into the trash. Giving it a go cold turkey.  Starting right now!

Brief tobacco history:

Started dipping and smoking in teens (now in 30's).  Used both on and off over the years.  Finally was able to give up dipping a couple of months ago, but the trade-off was that I was smoking more and more; about a pack a day.  I've been messing around with nicotine gum the last couple of months, but I always revert back to smoking.

I figure today will be a good test, going to happy hour after I clock out.  

Thanks to all of those who have posted here before me!!!  Spending the last couple hours reading your posts has given me more motivation than I've had in a long time.

If you don't hear from me tomorrow, you'll know that happy hour was a fail.

Day 15 nothin but cravins

After being a heavy smoker for 14 years, I decided to quit cold Turkey because my partners pregnant and if she can't vape I can't smoke.. In university I have absolutely no problem standing with friends that were smoking in front/beside me just shooting the crap.

I seem to have done lasting damage though because every couple of minutes I'll randomly gasp and take a deep breath of air which just happens naturally without any input from me. 

Generally everything I did involved smoking, write some code, smoke, write a little more, smoke, watch a YouTube video smoke, good scene coming up in a movie? Pause and have a smoke, wake up at night? Smoke, what's for breakfast? Coffee and smokes... 

My addiction is now is clean air and I refuse to poison myself with anything else.

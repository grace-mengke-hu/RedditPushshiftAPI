Quit smoking after observing an autopsy

Just wanted to share my story to hopefully help give you guys some motivation to quit smoking!! 

I began smoking cigarettes when I was 13, pack a day most years until I was 20. During EMT school we had to go observe autopsy’s for a day as a clinical. It was not in my intentions at all to quit smoking at this time but after witnessing with my own eyes and touching actual smoker lungs, I was horrified and quit cold turkey. 

Literal black/brown lungs. Pictures they show you in health classes and in middle school etc. do no justice.

I haven’t smoked or craved a cigarette since in all honesty lol and now I’m so thankful I no longer smoke. The cost and your health just isn’t worth it.

Autopsy’s are open to the Public for viewing so if anyone wants some real motivation to quit and think this might help them definitely do it. Plus in you’re in the health field it’s actually a really cool experience and you learn a lot. 

This was in June last year, so I’m about 9 months clean!! Really if I can do it, you guys can too. Good luck!

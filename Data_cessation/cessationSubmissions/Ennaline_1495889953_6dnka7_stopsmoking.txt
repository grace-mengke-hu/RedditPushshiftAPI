18 hours and the cravings are at a 10.

Help I accidentally got to work half an hour early and all I want to do is go accross the street and buy some cigarettes. I keep telling myself that if I smoke I'll habe to re do the last 18 hours all over again and I literally cannot remember the last time I went 18 hours without cigarettes. 

I just started a new job at a hospital in the surgical processing department. I work with all the equiptment used in surgeries, which means I've held in my hands tools used in surgeries like thracheotomies and lung transplants. The past week I've been working with scopes, including one used to look inside your lungs and every time I handle one I feel like a piece of shit because I know I'm putting myself at risk to have one of these shoved down my throat.

The chest retractors are terrifying. These are things used to hold open your skin and muscles in surgeries. They are heavy duty pieces of equiptment,  some are so big they need to be mounted to a table. It really is a fantastic reminder that a lung transplant is not some abstract surgety, it is a serious, real thing that could happen to me.

As a part of my training, I have an opporitunity to watch a surgery in person. I'm really excited for this! I asked to watch something related to the consequences of smoking and my boss said she'll try to get me a lung transplant surgery to watch. So yeah if that doesnt make the consequences of smoking real idk what will. 

Now I dont have enough time to smoke before I clock in and it's been 18 and 1/2 hours smoke free! Woo!

I got sick....

I have been smoking for about 10 years have been smoke free now for 2 months and 12 days. Well a few days ago I got sick with a flu and normally it takes me about a week to recover. Since not smoking I was able to recover in 3 days and I feel great. Just wanted to share this information with you all. Quit smoking and your body works as it should.

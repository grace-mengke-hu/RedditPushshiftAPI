Coming up on two months clean, I can feel the addict in me trying to tell me that I can let my guard down and have a cigarette.

How do I keep these sorts of thoughts in check long-term? These thoughts seem like they're becoming more and more common.

Edit: Thanks for the support everyone. You people are why I love this subreddit. You helped me quit, and you've carried me this far. I'll do my best to pay it forward.

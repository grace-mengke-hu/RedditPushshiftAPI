After MANY tries, I am in it for good this time

This must be the 15th time I've tried to quit over the years. The wife quit 4 1/2 years ago, and I've been deluding myself for all that time with the "I can do it any time" nonsense. I've gone days without one only to relapse quite badly. This time, though, I am laying off the alcohol for a while. That seems to always be the trigger that causes the relapse.

Did anyone else get the so-called "quitter's flu"? Man, that was a rough 3-4 days, felt REALLY bad, and was all clogged up. But it seems to have subsided now, and I'm feeling pretty good. If I stay busy, I don't think too much about a cig, but if I ever have idle time... it's brutal.

It is so interesting how much different everything smells and tastes just a few short days after the last puff.

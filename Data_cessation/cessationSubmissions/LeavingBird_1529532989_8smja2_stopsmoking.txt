Ex smoker going for beer (5w)

I have to share. 
5 weeks free of ciggies, almost.
So I sat down at five today for some beer, I finished some work at the same time (yes problematic whatever, I'm finishing a semester). Some strangers sat down, "older" (50+) smokers, I invited them. It's been a pleasure. They are just normal addicted blokes, but it was so okay. I mean I didn't like their smoking or whatever, but I felt so happy for not wanting to smoke at all! I finished work and had a wonderful evening without thinking about smoking while they smoked down lots and lots :)

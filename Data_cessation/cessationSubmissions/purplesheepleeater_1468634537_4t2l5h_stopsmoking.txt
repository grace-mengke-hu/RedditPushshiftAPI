Back to do it right this time

I quit cold turkey once before and didn't stay quit. Had two years under my belt and threw it away one night when I was drunk and resentful. Been smoking the past two years since. Well, I'm ready to give quitting an honest effort again. I have picked up some nicotine lozenges and am finding them useful. I'm going to take this one day at a time as I slowly learn how to do things without cigarettes. So far driving has been the toughest trigger. This time I'm going to stay vigilant. That "just one" cigarette sent me on a journey consisting of two more years of smoking. This time I understand that "just one" is always more than one for me. I'm glad to be back. Together we can do this!

I made it!

It has been a huge goal of mine to quit smoking before I head to Boyscout Camp for a few days. It is one of my biggest shortcomings in my eyes, to be a respected leader in the eyes of these kids, and yet to be constantly poisoning my self to that addictive drug nicotine. (The boys don't know that I smoke, but I do.) I wanted to quit in advance so that I am not dealing with the worst of the withdrawals, this way I can be out having fun rather than kicking and biting and yelling through those first couple of days! Thanks for all your support reddit!

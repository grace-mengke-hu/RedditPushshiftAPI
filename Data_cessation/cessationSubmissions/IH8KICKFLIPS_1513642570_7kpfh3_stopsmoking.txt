What are your thoughts on “enjoying” a low nicotine vape once in a while after quitting?

My history with smoking; I smoked a cig/cigar a day for 3 years and a pack/day for 8 months. Vaped for a year and quit. I’ve been 120 days vape/cig/cigar/hookah free.

I’d like to enjoy a low nicotine vape once in a while. I never found vaping to be nearly as addictive as actual cigs. Not even comparable. 

What are your guys thoughts on enjoying a low nicotine vape once in a while?

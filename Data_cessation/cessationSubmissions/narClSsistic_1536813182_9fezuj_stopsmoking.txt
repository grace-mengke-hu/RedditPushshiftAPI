It's nothing impressive but I'm about to end week 3!

It's been 3 weeks without a cigarette or using my vape and I have to say that I'm pretty happy. I haven't had any cravings^I^think...

Due to going in for surgery, my surgeon recommend that I stop smoking 2 weeks prior to the surgery. What better time to quit right? Everything went well and I'm recovering now. The earliest I could smoke again is a month from now but hopefully by then I will be able to stay on the wagon.

#Good luck to anyone trying to quit! We're all going to make it bros.

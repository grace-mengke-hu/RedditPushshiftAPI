HALP! Day 5 1/2 Not Going So Well...

I've smoked for 29 years, 1-2 packs a day...

Tonight around 6pm will be Day 6... I'm losing my shit over here... I'm at work and get out in about 2 hours and I'm overwhelmed with cravings... My cravings are giving birth to cravings and it's like a craving-pest problem that's gotten out of hand...

I have run down all of my reasons for quitting, I've asked myself what I could possibly get from having a cigarette, I've yelled at my addict brain and told it to shut the fuck up, I've eaten EVERYTHING in sight (and now might explode)... 

I am even vaping which is not working because IT IS NOT A CIGARETTE (so people who say it's the same thing are full of shit)!  I am out of coping methods and am about to crack!

Just-  GAH!!!

EDIT/ UPDATE:  I made it home and didn't buy a pack!  However, I did eat 10 pounds of broccoli salad, 6 slices of cheese and will end up devouring the rest of a 1 pound bag of M&M's and a pint of ice cream.  The diet must start tomorrow or I'll be a blimp with good lungs.

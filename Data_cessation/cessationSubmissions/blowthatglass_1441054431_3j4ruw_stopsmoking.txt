Just got my Chantix scrip, and a few inhalers for easier breathing while I quit....any pointers or things to know for folks who used Chantix to quit?

Hi, 

I've been smoking 8 years (from 18-26 years old) and have been trying to quit off and on for three years now.  I've used patches, lozenges, vaping, etc. with varying degrees of success, but inevitably have come back to smoking always thinking "I'm only 24,25...etc.  I have time to quit."

Well, I just went to the Doc last week for chest pain, and they believe that if I don't quit in the next year or two I will develop COPD...which I would prefer not to have.  So I'm doing it this time.  I have been off booze for almost two years now without a drink, so I know I can do it...just a mind over matter thing.  

I just got prescribed Chantix, and want to know if there are any ways to make this process easier while on the drug.  AFAIK, I want to continue smoking the same amount I do now for the first two weeks WHILE I take the Chantix, and then start to step down gradually.  The Doc told me that some people take 4-5 months with Chantix to fully quit, but I don't anticipate taking that long.  I smoke 15-20 cigs a day and want to start at 14 a day, and drop by 2 every week for 7 weeks.  

Is there any weirdo effects from stopping too quickly from Chantix?  Anything I should look out for when I start it?  Any help you guys could provide would be great.  

Thanks!

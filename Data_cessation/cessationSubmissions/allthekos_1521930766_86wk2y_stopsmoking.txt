I need help ...

Hi guys,

I see your posts...1 month quit, 6 months quit etc and I so need to do it. I've set my quit day for Wednesday (I have no work for 3 days from Wednesday) and this will be my billionth time going for it. 

Today I thought fuck it I'll do it today. I did pretty well (I'm a 20 a day smoker for 20 years so probably smoke about 1 an hour), I made it to 4 hours and my craving physically and mentally was driving me insane. I couldn't think I felt equally panicky and angry and just awful. 

I have quit before. I know if I get through 3 days I'll be fine, but I'm struggling to get through day one. I've been considering taking some dinners to knock me out, but know that's probably not the best idea. 

I have read that cravings last 5-10 minutes but what I felt today was relentless. I had a stress ball which helped me through several cravings but I just couldn't cope with the stress I was feeling. 

How do I reduce that awful feeling ? I'm considering getting some gum but I really want to go cold turkey

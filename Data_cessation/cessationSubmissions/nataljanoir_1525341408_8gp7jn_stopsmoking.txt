I have been thinking about quitting for a while now (on and off for the past year or so)

I really honestly have been thinking about it, but I always seem to find an excuse so I could just “quit later” I have highly stressful months ahead of me also a smoking family I live with and I have no idea how to ditch this mindset. 

Do you have any advice? I’ve been a half a pack smoker for more than 10 years and have no idea where or how to start the whole process

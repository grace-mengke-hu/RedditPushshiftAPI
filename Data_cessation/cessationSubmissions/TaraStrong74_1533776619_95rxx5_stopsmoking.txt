28 days in with Chantix

I have tried so many times to quit. Patches, gum, cold turkey. Nothing worked. I started chaotic a little over 5 weeks ago. You can smoke through week one, so I thought that these pills wouldn't stop Me! 3days past the first week I quit. I would get nausea after each one until it just wasn't worth it. I have to say I do get lucid dreams and feel like I'm not really rested, and have gained weight. But I have not lit up, and I'm proud. Any advice on the need to eat everything in site?

Below is my quit smoking app homework

Cravings?
deep breathing
water
take a walk

really mind over matter. If you can train your mind, or urge it to think of something else, it seems to help. To bad that's not working with food!!!

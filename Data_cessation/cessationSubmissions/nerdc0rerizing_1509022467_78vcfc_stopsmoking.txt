Slight slip

I had 2 hits of a cigarette. My relationship is falling apart because of how I've been acting during withdrawal and I just wanted to see if I was strong enough? I realize that makes no sense. It was a menthol which I hate but I was able to put it out after 2 puffs. Will I be addicted again even if I stay the course?

Quitting now, today, this minute.

I've been cruising through r/stopsmoking for a while now, and I'm so inspired by how supportive of each other you all are.  Inspired by the stories of success, and the admissions of failure.  Every time I fail at quitting I feel so ashamed, and every time I light one of those bad boys up I am embarrassed.  

I'm done with this nastiness.  It does absolutely nothing positive for me.  Every effect it has on me is negative, and with each passing day I feel those effects more and more.  Why keep doing this to myself? Why hang on to something that has absolutely no positive impact on my life?!

So I'm turning my back on the pack, closing that door and opening a new one, and instead of thinking of it as a negative thing, I'm going to go forth with a positive attitude, and just keep reminding myself what a wonderful thing I'm doing.  I deserve it, we all do!

If anyone wants to buddy up with me let me know! I vow to encourage  you to make the positive change I'm trying to make!

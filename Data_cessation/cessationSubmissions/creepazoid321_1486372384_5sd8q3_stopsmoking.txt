What are the different Allen Carr books and which is best?

Since everyone's talking about Allen Carr, I went to the book store and got the only Allen Carr book they had, not knowing that there were others. "The Easy Way to Pack it In" is an autobiography and so far its quite interesting, but not what I had expected. 

What are the others about and ideally which is the one I should read?

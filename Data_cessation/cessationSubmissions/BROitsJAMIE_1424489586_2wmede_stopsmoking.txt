Jesus Christ

It's been almost 50 days since I've had a cigarette, and I'm still furious at least once a day that I can't smoke. I don't expect the cravings to be gone, but can I ever expect them to diminish at all? 

Like, I'm not going to give in. Most times I'm fine. I just want to get to a point where I feel I made the right decision all the time.

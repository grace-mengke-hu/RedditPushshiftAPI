Getting sick is actually helping me quit

I quit smoking as my New Years resolution (hurray, on day 5!) and, as bad as it sounds, I’m thankful for this horrendous chest cold. In the past I would smoke through any illness, despite the fact that it always made me feel like death. Now, every time I cough or have to blow my nose or just feel wiped out, I think, “how much worse would it be if I was smoking on top of this?” And I know I would feel a hell of a lot worse, so this mindset has helped tremendously. I hope you are all crushing your smoke free journeys!

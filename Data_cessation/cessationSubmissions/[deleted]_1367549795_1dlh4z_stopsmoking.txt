After 382 days of not smoking; I'm sitting next to someone vaping at work.

Oh. my. God.  The nicotine is getting on me.  It smells like someone shit an orange grove.  Then after a while I start seeing colors more vividly.  What is going on?  I'm still fighting the good fight, but having mini cravings that are affecting my concentration.

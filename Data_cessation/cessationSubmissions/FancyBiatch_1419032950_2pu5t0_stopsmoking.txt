Day 12 at the bar. With beer.

I've just arrived back at home, and wow was the temptation strong tonight. Quite a few glasses of beer later, and I'm just hoping spell check works in my favour for once...

Was out with people from work, and out of the 8 or so people who got together, 2 of them are currently smokers. About an hour into it, one of them announces "well, I'll be back! Gonna go for a smoke!"

I had to put my head down and grip the table to control myself. It felt like a movie... it felt like time stopped, all conversation stopped, and everyone turned & focused on me. It would be so easy to just stand up and quietly say "hey, mind if I bum one off you?" He would understand. He wouldn't mind. No one would even notice. All those people at work who have been cheering me on & rooting for me, and counting the days with me ... they won't notice.

In the deafening silence, all that I heard was: Will she succeed? Will she pass this test? Will she overcome this challenge?

It felt like 10 minutes of dead silence & challenge, before the sounds of conversation got through the fog - before I started hearing the bar sounds again. 

And then the moment passed. Whispers of some juicy bit of work gossip got through that fog, and I completely forgot about that moment until now.

I'm glad I didn't cave. I would hate myself.

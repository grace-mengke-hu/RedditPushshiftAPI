100 days!

Hadn't checked in here in about a month I'd say, and I just saw that it has officially been 100 days since my last cigarette! I rarely think of them anymore and my lifestyle has completely changed since stopping. I'm in the gym regularly, eating healthier, and excelling at my job all without worrying about when I'll have my next smoke.

It was tough at first, but now I truly feel I can call myself a non smoker with 100% confidence. To all of the people trying to quit, I'll join you in not smoking today :).

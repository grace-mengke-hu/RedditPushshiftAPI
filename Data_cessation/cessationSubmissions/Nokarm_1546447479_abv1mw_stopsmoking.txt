Tomorrow will be 3 weeks, after 3 years.

I won't lie, I'm cheating by using a vape to combat the cravings, and sure it's likely still not healthy, but the cigarette addiction is gone, and now it's only nicotine left. 

I come from a family with addiction problems, drinking, cigarettes, gambling, etc. I honestly thought it was hopeless to quit, my friends would always give me shit since I seemed to be "quitting" once every two weeks, but this is the longest I've gone, and with the vape, don't see myself returning to cigarettes. 

Not that he'll see it, but I want to thank the guy at my local PetroCan that I would always buy smokes off, because he convinced me last week when I went in for a pack to at least get a vape instead. I've seen that guy 2-3 times a week for the last two years and I'm so glad he remembered when I came in for the 25th last pack on the 12th.

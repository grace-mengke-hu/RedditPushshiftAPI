I "quit" smoking a while ago and while I really want a cigarette, I really don't want one at the same time-- Thoughts?

By "quit" I mean that over the course of the past 48 days or so, I've had approximately one pack of cigarettes.  This was mostly in the beginning.  I used to smoke ~10 cigarettes a day.

I've hit this weird spot in which I feel shitty, my head hurts as if I'm nicotine deprived, and I really want a cigarette.  But the thought of smoking is disgusting to me now after being clean for 2 1/2 weeks.  I tried to light one up yesterday and it grossed me out so much that I felt sick to my stomach after only one drag.  Still, I'm disgruntled and 'feel like I need a cigarette'.

Is this a common phase?  If so, how long does this usually last?

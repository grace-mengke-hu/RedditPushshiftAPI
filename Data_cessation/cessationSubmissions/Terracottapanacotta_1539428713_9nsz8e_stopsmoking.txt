Officially 1 month smoke free.. it’s getting so much easier! don’t give up!

Just wanted to share a bit of motivation for everyone struggling through their early days. I had tried unsuccessfully to quit several times over the past few years but always gave in to urges - until I joined this group! 
I found Allen cars easy way and only read about half way. That was enough, I realised cigarettes were a drug and I needed to quit my addition. Another puff won’t make my stress go away, it’s just feeding my drug craving.

I wanted to post here to let you know the first 3 weeks were tough. My quit app helped keep me accountable and determined. I didn’t think my he cravings would ever go away and i was irritable and tired..

However! One month on and I’m happy to say I hardly even check my quit app.. because I’m hardly thinking about smoking now. It have my gum handing for when the cravings hit - I still get a few, but there are nothing compared to what they were. 

I feel amazing heath wise and so proud to have made it this far. Keep it up everyone, it’s worth it!

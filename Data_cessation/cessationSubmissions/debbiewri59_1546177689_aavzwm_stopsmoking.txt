I can!

Hello, my first time here. I woke up this morning for the first time in a very long time feeling great. My chest doesn’t have the heavy, congested, painful feeling, my head feels clear, I can breath better, I have energy and I feel rested. It’s been only 4 hard days smoke free...but if this is what is ahead I am excited.

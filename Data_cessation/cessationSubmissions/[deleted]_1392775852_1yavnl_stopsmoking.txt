Need some help please.

I'm currently 23 and started smoking around the age 19. I know it isn't long, but I want to quit so bad. I was successful for 8 months, but then I just started back again out of the blue. I'm currently smoking only 2-4 cigs a day so it isn't terrible, but I still don't want to do this anymore. I usually smoke half a cig at a time. For some reason I feel the need to smoke more when it's cold outside, like winter, and just need some kind of help. So If you guy/gals could give me any little advice to help me I'd greatly appreciate it.

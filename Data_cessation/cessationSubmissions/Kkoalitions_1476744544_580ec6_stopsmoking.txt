As of this minute, I am a non smoker.

The last one was an L&M forward cigarette, i clicked the  menthol button halfway through, and after the last puff, chucked the filter out the window. That part of my life is now behind me, and I'm so looking forward to living the rest of my life free from the drug. Bare with me, and help me in my times of need. I'm counting on you.

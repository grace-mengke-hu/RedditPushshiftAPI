Went to my doctor today. Got to watch as he changed my paperwork in the computer to say "Former Smoker" rather than "Cigarettes". He gave me a high five and asked "How many days and how'd you do it?" 93 days, Youtube, reading, willpower, and support groups! Presenting #062 Poliwrath. See you Monday.

Anyone have tingling in the hands and feet, mixed with dizziness after quitting?

I quit a month ago, but was using a ecig to ease the cravings a bit. I quit using that pretty quick into the process and really haven't had much trouble with the cravings. However 3 weeks into the process my hand and feet started tingling extremely bad, according to the dr. And the interwebs that is normal. But I'm curious if it has happened to anyone else and if so how long did it last?

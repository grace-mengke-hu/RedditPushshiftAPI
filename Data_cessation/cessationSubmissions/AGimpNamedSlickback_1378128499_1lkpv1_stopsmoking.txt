I only end up switching delivery systems when I try to quit nicotine.

Every time I try to quit snus(mouth tobacco that EVERYONE in my country uses), I just start smoking instead. And when I quit smoking I eventually start snusing again. This has happened every single time I have ever tried to quit.

Today I decided to quit smoking after being snus-free for little over a month.

 Anyone out there who solved a similar problem in a smart way?

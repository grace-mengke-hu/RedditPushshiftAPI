Day two - on the patch. what are the benefits or good changes i should see in the coming days.

I quit after finding myself short of breath and tired when i knew i should not be. I have probably been a smoker for 17 years (gasp). Never was a two pack a day or anything like that. But, i am trying to see the positive things coming rather than the negative ones.

Anyone remember any points where you suddenly felt like "yes this is worth it" and when they came?

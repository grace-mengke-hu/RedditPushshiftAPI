8 hrs to quit time

Well, I have one cigarette left and not planning on buying a new pack so I guess quit time coming a bit sooner. 

Have downloaded the app, read/prepared, identified my motivations, cleaned my house of any triggers, stocked up on NRT gum, downloaded the meditation app, told my friends and girlfriend to hold me accountable. I feel prepared but know it'll be a challenge. Here we go.

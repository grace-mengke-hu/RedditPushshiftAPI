the actual fuck

So, I have always been a psycho to say the least but I have managed it well it enough to get a degree and find a job and fall in love and all the things that make someone feel accomplished all with a cigarette in my mouth. I'm 30 days deep no slips cold turkey and ALL of the coping mechanisms I thought I had developed over the last 15 years are subtle jokes in the presence of my current psyche without cigarettes. I have LOST MY FUCKING MIND and am on an emotional roller coaster that is testing the boundaries of those I hold dearest to me and also causing me to question my own sanity! I am actually getting a psyche eval to determine if I need some pills to help me cope with life in general. Has this happened for anyone else during their quit journey? I'm at a fucking loss and quite frankly can't stand myself anymore. FUUUUUCK. Lots of love! -A

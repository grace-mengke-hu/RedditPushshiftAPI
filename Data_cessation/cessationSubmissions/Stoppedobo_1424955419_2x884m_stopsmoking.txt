Difficult times

Hello All
So with my app telling me its been 5 days, 20 hours and 48 mintues since I quit smoking. Today is a bad day. I stopped using Allen Carr's easy way. Makes complete sense. I no longer want to smoke. But OMG the cravings! And the ideas that the junkie in my head is coming up with to try and get to smoke again is currently rather depressing! I have discovered that I smoked to reward myself in just about every situation. Happy, sad, bored, etc. And now smoking isn't there I am having to eat or drink something to replace the smoking. Some days haven't been to bad. But as today is a bad one, have been told you lot can help! And if nothing else I can talk to you lot instead of being mean to everyone around me! Thanks for listening! xxx

I really feel like just having one.

I was never a heavy smoker, mostly a heavy snus user. Quitting smoking was difficult only because of withdrawal (I went with cold turkey). However, I was always fond of taking a walk late at night every 2nd or 3rd day and having a cigarette. Recently, I've been really craving that, even though I haven't smoked in well over a month (but I have quit snus 4 days ago). What are some ways I can work around this urge? I plan on taking some tea with me and still doing my usual walk, albeit sans smokes.

Smack down! Five months a no smoker after 46 years of smoking, whoever would have thought?

Thanks redditors for helping me stay a non smoker. I tell you, it was a bit rough the last few weeks, I think any time that an anniversary is coming up,I tend to get nervous. I just keep chewing gum, and last week, another redditor wrote that she or he could not sneak another smoke, if it happened, a check would be written to Focus on the Family, which would be awful for me as well. This has sustained me! Thank you all for helping me kick some ass and take some names.

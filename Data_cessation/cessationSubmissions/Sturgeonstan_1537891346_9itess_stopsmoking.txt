Two weeks!

Hello everyone just wanted to stay accountable and give an update. Today is two weeks without a cigarette.  I am coughing like crazy, but I feel way better! Yesterday I sneezed and then afterwards realize I was breathing through my nose and it felt so clean and clear and it was awesome. I can smell and taste EVERYTHING.  I’ve been able to start running again which is something I wasn’t sure I could ever do. I 100 percent could not be this far without the sub. This is my millionth attempt to quit and I have never been this far at all.  Thank you all for your updates and checking back in. If you’re scared and think you cant do it, you can!

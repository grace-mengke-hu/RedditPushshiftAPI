day 11. I quit

It's my 11th day and I seriously think I can't do this. I've been imagining smoking for an hour now and it would make me really happy. f-ck health, f-ck how I'll look, people around me and all that bullshit. I seriously can't do this. anyone going through this? is it really worth it? I mean, why am I thinking about something bad that MIGHT happen in the future? What about the next time I go out drinking? How am I going to stand next to all my friends who are enjoying a cigarette? Is it really worth it? I'm also really upset because I'm having a fight with my boyfriend. I'm not sure if it's because I'm annoyed because I haven't smoked or I want to smoke because I'm annoyed.

Decided to stop today, after 13 years. I'll be working alone for 10 hours today with a shop a 2 minute walk away. Any support would be much appreciated.

About a 12 a day smoker. Started becoming very aware of the negatives recently; short of breath, lack of energy, sneaky, nicotine driven behaviour around non smokers, no will or drive to exercise. None of my social circle smokes anymore so fewer excuses. I've been up 3 hours and I'm already struggling a little with cravings.

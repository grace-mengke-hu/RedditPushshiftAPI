Getting out of work...

And I had a long, stressful day. I usually go outside, sit on the porch of the building and smoke, thinking of it as a sort of reward for fighting through the day, thinking of it as my "personal time"... I know it isn't so, the cigarette itself isn't the moment, it's just something you do in that moment, but my brain is rebelling and trying to trick me to think there is a benefit, an added value to smoking... I won't cave in, I know I would regret it immensely, but I felt like putting it out there, making myself accountable, in front of you dear strangers... 
If you feel like sharing your "worst" craving/trigger, please do. And hopefully how you overcame it! 
Thanks for listening....

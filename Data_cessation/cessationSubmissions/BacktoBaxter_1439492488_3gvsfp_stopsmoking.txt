3 Weeks today!

I quit cold turkey about three weeks ago. Its been really hard. I've had to parent myself everyday, but I don't intend on going back. I finally quit for myself and my health. Not long ago I was brushing my teeth and noticed that my bottom gums started bleeding really easily. I touched the gum underneath my lower right canine and the blood just started oozing out. I gargled some mouth wash right after. It took only about an hour after that incident that I had a smoke. I kept my usual smoking routine the rest of that night. During the week I started noticing that my gums weren't healing. I thought that maybe I  was brushing too hard or maybe it was the bristles on the toothbrush. That night while I was smoking I finally thought to myself that the cigarettes were probably keeping my gums from healing and actually making them more sensitive. I decided then that I would quit because I'd much rather have healthy teeth than gingivitis. Two days after I quit my gums completely healed. Now I hardly ever have problems with my gums bleeding unless I accidentally floss too hard. I'm happy to say that I'm able to do it, but I keep thinking about smoking. Whenever I think about it I remember my gums three weeks ago and why I quit. I just wanted to say thanks to this subreddit. I've been a lurker on here for a while and I think that it helped me push through those first few bad weeks.

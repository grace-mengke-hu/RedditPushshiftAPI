Day 6, still going strong!  Am surprised at how effective the patch was.  I do not feel much, if any, urge to pick up again.

In my first post, I mentioned how I loved smoking, and not just as part of the addiction.  But, with the money I'll be saving per month, I'll be able to pay off my car a year earlier, or save for a motorcycle I've wanted for a few years, or a sleeve tat I've wanted to get designed and inked for almost as long as I've been a smoker, or save, however meager, for a downpayment on a house, or get a passport and stamp that shit up!  No matter how much I loved smoking, I'm so excited for all that comes with being a non-smoker.  I've been working out this week and forgot how much I also loved being "workout sore", how great it feels to have my lungs burn and be able to draw a super deep breath lol.

But as I roll into the second half of my work week, I say again, cheers!  Keep at it, everyone!  Surprise, we can do this!!!  :D :D

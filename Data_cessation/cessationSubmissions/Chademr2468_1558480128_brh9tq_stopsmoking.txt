Going to quit (again...) soon. How do I keep the novelty of smoking from coming back?

So I’m 27 years old, and I’ve smoked since I was 19. To say I have a dependence on nicotine is an understatement, but even so, the easiest part of quitting is toughing out those 3-4 days of severe withdrawal. As irritable and insane and irrational as I can be, I know it’s temporary and I’ll balance out soon. I’ve done this probably 9-10 times over the years. My favorite part of when I first quit is how much richer my sleep feels and how much energy I have once I’ve been off cigarettes for 1-2 weeks. 

That being said, once the weeks go by, maybe a month or two, and the constant nagging of feeling like I’m sneaking out every hour at work for a smoke goes away, the monetary burden ceases, the smell isn’t on me or in my car, once I see my teeth start to get whiter, and once I see my skin brighten and I don’t look so “worn” all the time, the novelty of smoking always comes back. I’ll see someone smoking on tv (Shameless always destroyed me) and want one as well. I’ll go out with friends and want one once I’ve had a few drinks, and I’ll overall just miss the fun parts of smoking. Then I bum one off of someone, or buy an 8 dollar pack of Parliaments to just throw them out after having one, and before I know it, I’m smoking a pack a day again. 

How do I keep that motivation? How do I stop myself from giving in? I truly don’t want to smoke anymore, but once all the stressors that make me feel that way go away, I seem to have a hard time remembering them. 

Advice?

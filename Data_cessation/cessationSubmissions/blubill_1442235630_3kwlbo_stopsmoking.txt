10 Days!

Still going strong, was on vacation last week so I decided that was my time to make a stand and quit for good.  I made it all week and now I'm back at work.  My smoking buddy offered to bum me one but I turned her down.  I actually went outside and talked with her as she smoked and wasn't even all that tempted.  It feels REAL good to have control over the addiction.  On another note, I found out that my wife is pregnant while on vacation.  I don't need anymore motivation than that.  I am no longer a smoker.

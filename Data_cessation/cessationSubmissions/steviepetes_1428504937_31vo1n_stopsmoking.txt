Nearly at a year and possibly the worst year I have ever had...you can do this.

I'm nearing my year mark and I'm truly just putting this out there for those who think they can't do it because of stress, work, relationship problems, etc. etc. You can do this.

This past year I lost a partner in January and just two days ago I had to put down one of my cats (RIP to my girl Dylan). The last thing that even popped into my head during the aftermath of both their deaths was smoking. The only thought I had about smoking was that if this had all happened last year I would have probably chain smoked myself right into an early grave.

So here I am at 32 - a non-smoker after 11 years and almost at my year. Smoking would not have improved a single one of those tough moments. Instead not smoking made those moments just a little easier to take. 

Best of luck to any of you thinking of quitting!

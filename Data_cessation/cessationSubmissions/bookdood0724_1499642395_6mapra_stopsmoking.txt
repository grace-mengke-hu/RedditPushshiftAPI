Thursday, July 13th is my quit date

I have a big project on Wednesday this week, and once I get through it, I'm done with nicotine. I've built up a bad vaping habit over the past 5 months, which started out with an occasional e-cig but has worked it's way up to near-constant puffing on a Vuse unit that has a high level of nicotine. It's totally compulsive now and I do it all day long. I can't handle long flights without sneaking to the plane bathroom once an hour or so for a vape, and I hide it from friends and family too, by heading to the toilet to take a few big rips when they're around. I have to go cold turkey - I've already tried "winding down" once and it didn't work. I need to suck it up and deal with the withdrawals. Looking forward to reporting back on day one!

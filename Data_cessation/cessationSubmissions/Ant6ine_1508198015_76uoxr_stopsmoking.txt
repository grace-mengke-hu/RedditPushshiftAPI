Slowly killing myself by smoking 30 cigarettes a day at age 19

Started smoking at 15, my habit rapidly increased and now I find myself lighting up 5 or 6 cigs in a row. My grandpa deceased this February because of lung cance after a 40 year 2 packs a day habit , he was a chainsmoker and I think I inheredited the habit from him. I often think I would prefer I never was born instead of ruining my life like this. I cough like an old man. I quit for almost a month after my grandpa died but soon later started again. It would be better never waking up than lighting up 3 cigs today morning. I don't want cancer. My grandpa was the strongest man I ever knew but still cancer completely destroid him to the point he almost couldnt walk. Still he moved his 60kg Washing machine from a room to the other one. This fucking smoke is a trap and I can't get out, my lungs hurt everyday. My body feels like it hasnt much to live and I'm Just 19. I had lung problems even before smoking, now theyre completely gone, my lung capacity is like the One of a 4 yo. I feel useless and unable to accomplish anything because i cant even stop smoking because no matter how much every puff hurts I still love smoking more than anything. See you soon grandpa

6 days in...

... and my cravings went from mild and manageable to huge long lasting and overbearing. I keep telling myself no but that little monster in the back of my mind keeps telling me to just have one. I'm overly emotional and it all just sucks. Are there any remedies that anyone can suggest for these besides sleeping the cravings away lol Thank you in advance!!

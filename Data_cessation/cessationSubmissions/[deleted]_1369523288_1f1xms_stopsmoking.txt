It's becoming a persistent thought to quit.

For me, it's a love hate relationship right now. It's relaxing on bad days, it's been there for me, and I've been smoking since I was 12 (I'm now 27). It's been a long long time now and the thoughts of quitting are now becoming really clear and pushy. I also have OCD and smoking has become one of the compulsions/routines. 

I haven't set a date, I think I might try and wake up one morning very soon and just not light that first cigarette and see how long I go. I've been reading pro's and cons like crazy. I know the pro's FAR outweigh the cons but I need to just get past the cravings and I can do it. I know I can, I just need a push. Who wants to help give me that push?

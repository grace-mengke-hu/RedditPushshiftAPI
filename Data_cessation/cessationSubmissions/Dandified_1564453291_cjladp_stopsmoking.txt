4 months smoke free after 25 years - a retrospective

Things that are better now;
- I sleep better
- my teeth are noticibly whiter
- I have more cardio stamina
- I smell better
- I don't wake up after drinking and smoking a pack of cigarettes feeling like I'm dead. 

Big triggers and successes during my first non smoking summer;
-  Camping.. man I used to love smoking while camping.  Know what? Don't miss it now. 
- Golfing...at a golf tournament...with my group all smoking.    Toughest one so far. Happened around the 3 month mark.  Somehow I just knew if I could beat that day, I'd won.   My confidence went to 100% after that day. 

Now when I get a craving trigger it's more like a "Oh ho... I see you there little craving. You're right, this would have been a good time to smoke.  But we don't anymore, so fuck off". And you know, it goes away so fast, because there isn't any physical addiction there egging you on anymore. 

I didn't use any nicotine replacement. What ended up working for me was keeping quitting.  I would quit for 4 days, break down, smoke again, then try again. It took about 5 tries over a month to get it to stick more than a week.   I didn't beat myself up, I just kept at it.   Eventually I learned that the first 3-4 days were the worst of it, and when weighing that against smoking, at some point smoking just lost the battle. 

At the end of the day, if you don't smoke, you don't smoke.  It doesn't need to be hard, or complicated. Any cigarette you bypass is a victory.   Keep it simple, celebrate any success, and don't be too hard on yourself, because it doesn't help in the long run.  

You got this!

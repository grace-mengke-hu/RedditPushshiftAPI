Withdrawal

Hi Everyone!
How long-- on average-- did your worst withdrawal symptoms last? I don't get physical but much more mental/psychological symptoms, especially a feeling of being disconnected, which I can't fucking stand. And I get super fucking angry super fucking easily.... and I'm usually a very calm, cool and collected man. I've read three weeks is the maximum time its the worst and then it gets better. Anyone wanna weigh in? (apologizes in advance for my profanity)

Don't "give-up" smoking!

When you try quit smoking, just by referring to it as "giving
up", you've already put yourself in a position to fail. "Giving up" infers that you're sacrificing something, and that idolises cigarettes even more. Have you ever noticed that you can go a good few hours without smoking when you're distracted but when you decide to "give up", every single minute is a constant crave. 
You're not "giving up", you're escaping that fatal nicotine trap that many people have died because of. You're not giving up smoking, because there is nothing to lose.
I feel like I have escaped cigarettes at long last! Going into it with the right attitude is everything, and can make the difference between falling back into the trap, or quitting for good!

Hello, new here.

So I just read Allen Carr's book, it was okay. He did change my perspective a bit. Decided to quit smoking Xmas Eve, lasted about 6 hours before I realized that I shouldn't just waste money on the cigs I already have, might as well wait until they're gone to start.

Realized the trap and tossed everything, Going strong on day 2ish, the psychological is insidious, but I know it'll get better.

Anyways, this was a throwaway I decided to keep so I didn't have to keep clicking on the "Yes I'm 18+" button, thought I'd say hi.

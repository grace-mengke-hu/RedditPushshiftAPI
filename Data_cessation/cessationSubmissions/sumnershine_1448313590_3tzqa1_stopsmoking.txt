Focusing tips?

I'm 24hrs into quitting and I think I've got this. The thing is that I can't focus on anything but how much I need a smoke. I know that it will get better, but Im a student and I have homework to get done. Do you guys have any tips to stay focused? I don't want to relapse out of desperation in a couple of days.

Does it matter that I’ve quite whilst on Champix (day 17 today) but I’m using a vape with 0% nicotine to assist?

I’m slightly worried I’ll end up hooked on using the vape but it’s been really useful for those cravings I’ve had where on previous quit attempts I’ve failed.  The last week has been far more difficult and I’ve managed to stop myself going to the shops to buy some but it’s been tough! Any tips or comments would be appreciated. Thank you

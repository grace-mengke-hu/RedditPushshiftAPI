Does the feeling of impending doom and emptiness ever go away once you quit?

Long story short, I smoked roughly 10-16 cigarettes a day from ages 12 til 21, eventually switched to vape four years ago which worked surprisingly well and now i'm at the point where I want to stop all together and quit this little fucking cigalike but just thinking about it gives me panic attacks. Like what the fuck do people who don't smoke or vape do? I'm scared to death that my life will fall apart without it and nothing will feel or be the same and I'll just be an empty hallow shell because nicotine and the hand to mouth ritual is so ingrained in me, that just thinking about doing anything without it makes me feel impending doom. I know that sounds pathetic but I've had a steady flow of nicotine in my system for 14 years. Is this a reality or just my brain telling me this.

Unable to smoke for the next couple of days so thought I'd take a shot at quitting for good

So I got a wisdom tooth took out yesterday, meaning I can't smoke for at least 48 hours, ideally 72. I also realised Stoptober (stop smoking campaign in the UK) started yesterday too. I thought of this as a very good sign that I should just try and quit for good, since I can't smoke for a couple of days anyway. 
It's been almost exactly 24 hours at the time of writing since I last had one, and it hasn't actually been that bad so far. I'm on patches so maybe they're working really well. So anyway, I thought I'd come on this subreddit and see other people's stories of quitting, which is giving me a lot more motivation to do it.

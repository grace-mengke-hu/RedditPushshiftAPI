After 4 months of quitting I'm about to relapse

Says it in the title. Feeling fucking irritated today and can't put up with peoples fake bullshit. I know I'll regret it... I know that. I'm 20, started smoking at 14. 

The last few days I've been feeling like I'm gonna snap and start again but thought yea hey I can overcome this but holy Shit I'm really ready to say fuck it. I figured I would come here to vent a bit before I decide on what I'm going to do. I'm going to think about this for 10 minutes or so and if I still feel like smoking I'm going for it.. I was really proud of myself but man Idk.. 

My anxiety will probably go through the roof so that's a good motivator to stop. Idk. Just need to vent. I'll keep y'all updated on what I do.

Fuck people and their condescending bullshit.

I'm an idiot

I started smoking at 13 to prove to my mom how easy it was to quit. I'm now 33 and smoke 1-2 packs of red 100s per day. My mother lives on oxygen and a breathing machine now after decades of heavy smoking. I absolutely can't end up like that. I have 2 children and dont want them following in mine and my mother's footsteps. My husband is a heavy smoker as well. For the first time I have decided to really try to stop. I've tried vaping and it hurt my lungs too much. All my friends who I went to school with have stopped and I'm the only one still smoking. I'm constantly trying to hide the smoke smell and the fact that I smoke. It is embarrassing and I am ashamed. I've been coughing up black stuff for well over 10 years every day. Lung cancer killed both my grandparents. I guess I need to find a hobby or something to do with my hands. If anyone has any tips please let me know. I have to stop for myself and family.

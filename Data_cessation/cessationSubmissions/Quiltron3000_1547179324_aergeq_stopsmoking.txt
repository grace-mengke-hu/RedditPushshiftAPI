Lets try this again...

Had quit nicotine for 7 days. Got stressed at work and started smoking again. I work in construction so everybody and their apprentice smokes. I just bought some nicorette and tomorrow is the day i actually put effort in to quitting. What are some tips that you guys have for someone who works in an industry where tobacco is everywhere? Did nicorette work for you? Maybe having the flair for how many days I haven't smoked would help me keep track of what I'm working toward. Thanks in advance for all your help. Have a great night!

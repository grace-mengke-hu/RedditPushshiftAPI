Is there a nostalgia stage of quitting? Day 38

I'm as committed to not smoking today as I was the first day. Probably more committed, actually, because I know that if I smoke I will have to go through the hell of withdrawal all over again. 

I'm finding the trigger moments - after work, driving, when out with certain friends - are easier to deal with at this point. But what's new in the past few days is this strong feeling of nostalgia. I wouldn't say I *miss* smoking, but at moments I miss being a smoker. Like the loss of the routines of smoking has left me thinking about the "good old days" when I could just light up and not think about quitting.

I feel like this is a slippery slope and it's the addiction trying another angle to get me to listen to it. After all, he "good old days" of smoking are a lie! Since I quit, I can breathe better, I sleep more soundly, I have cash in my pocket, my skin is clear, my eyes are bright, my teeth are whiter, and quitting has helped me look at constructive ways of managing my emotions which is way healthier for me and all my relationships. There was nothing good about smoking, and there will be nothing good that comes of smoking again. So why the nostalgia?

Has this nostalgia happened to you? How did you deal with it?

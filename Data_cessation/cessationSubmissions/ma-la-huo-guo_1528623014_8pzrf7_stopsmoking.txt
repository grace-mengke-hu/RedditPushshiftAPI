R/stopsmoking got me to join reddit

Hey everyone, I’ve been a long time lurker, and several times attempting to quit. I’m 26, smoked for almost six years and now I’m smoke free for over two weeks! Thanks for being such a great resource and community, look forward to many good conservations here. 

Now that I’m quit, I’m taking up running to enter a marathon in December and learning to cook real Japanese food at home. What kind of new, healthier habits have you all found in your new smoke free life? I’d love to hear your stories :D

3 years, and *SO FAR* I'm urge free.

Just realized tonight, It's been well over 1 year since my last urge, craving, or thought towards picking up a cigarette or any tobacco product. One of the few moments in life I've been truly proud of myself. 

Keep at it folks, we try, we fail, we get back up. Find that reason, find your center stone for each tough moment, The one that makes you look at yourself and say, "it's not worth it". I honestly believe I would do anything for her, and this felt so easy with her in my mind, not to say the road was not difficult of course.

felt like sharing. Good luck, best wishes, and congratulations to all who have, will, and hope to quit.

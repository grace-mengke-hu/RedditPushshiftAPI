NYE quitters, want to do some running together?

So I quit on New Year's Eve like a lot of people on this subreddit. I started running to fight the cravings. Today I ran 3 miles in 40 min. I have a goal of 3 mi in 25 min by February 1st. I figured it might be fun to have some new quitters post there running times so we can all see how much better we get without smoking.

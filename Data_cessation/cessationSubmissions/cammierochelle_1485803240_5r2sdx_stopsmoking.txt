Quitters Flu?

I quit cold turkey 16 days ago. I was smoking a pack a day for the last 23 years or so. I got sick last weekend, chest cold, coughing, sore throat and joint pain. While those symptoms have gone away I now just feel lousy. I'm tired, short of breath and overall weak feeling. Is this quitters flu? If it is I would legit pay someone to tell me how to feel better.

How did you make out with the patch?

I've been smoking half to 3/4 of a pack daily for longer than I'd like to admit. Knowing myself, I don't think I'll be able to fully commit to quitting on my own (absolutely no assistance from an outside source - cold turkey if you will.) Having done no research on the patch method I'd like to get a general idea of what your experience has been like with it. Would you recommend it? The good? The bad? 

TIA.

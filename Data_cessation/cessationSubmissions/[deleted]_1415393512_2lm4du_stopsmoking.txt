Started on 05/11, new quit date is now 08/11 but I have high hopes!

Hey guys, so I think it's great that this subreddit exists and I thought I would get in on the action.

I've been smoking for five years but have come to the point where it's time to quit primarily due to my asthmatic lungs not agreeing with me most mornings and evenings but also because it costs me close to $100 a week (in New Zealand dollars) which is just ridiculous.

I had stopped on 05/11 and was going strong until I got home on Friday afternoon and had a couple of glasses of whisky to reward myself for not smoking. Ended up smoking a couple of cigarettes with my flatmate and buying a pack on the way to my girlfriend's house because I'd decided it wasn't the right time for me to quit.

Had a few more over the evening and then woke up at 3am and realised I was a moron and that there's never been a better time than now. I needed to have that cigarette yesterday afternoon to confirm all the reasons why I am quitting but it's mildly annoying that that's the way my mind has to work.

Also learned that I have to really watch my drinking for the next couple of weeks so that I avoid temptation as much as possible. If I stick to this, I save $5200 or so a year which is damn good motivation though haha!

/yarn - thanks for creating such a supportive and productive community everyone! Let day one begin (again).

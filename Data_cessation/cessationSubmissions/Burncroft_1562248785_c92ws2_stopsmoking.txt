2 years smoke free, today is a great day to quit!

If you're on the fence about quitting, let today be your day too. Declare your independence from the tobacco industry. Take back your life, it isn't theirs to end. You can do it! 

"Not another puff, NO.MATTER.WHAT"

Its gonna be a long month of hell but commit. Throw out all of your smoking stuff. No lighters, no ashtrays, if you keep that around your telling yourself its ok to give up and its not. You can do this, you don't need luck, just remind yourself your life cannot move on to the next stage without taking this step first. Much love :)

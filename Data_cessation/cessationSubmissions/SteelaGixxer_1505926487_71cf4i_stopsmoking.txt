Ugh. Day 1...Again.

I had made it over 1 month. Through road trips with smokers and vacation to a smoke-friendly country...but I got drunk last night, bought and smoked half a pack of cigarettes. I woke up hungover, feeling like shit, THAT awful taste in my mouth, and all day I have been feeling like an elephant is sitting on my chest. 

Much self-loathing to be had today, but also lessons learned: I can't allow myself to get over confident. I can't let my guard down for even one night. And maybe most importantly for me, I should probably lay off the liquor for awhile because nothing good comes from it. So, Day 1, let's be better this time.

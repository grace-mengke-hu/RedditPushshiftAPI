Today is day number 7!

I smoked for 10 years and quit for about 9 months at some point in there. I used chantix this time, which was a freaking nightmare. I was miserable, on edge, and eating constantly. Yesterday was the first day I didn’t take the medication and I feel a lot better. I didn’t smoke, I think of it during my typical times but it wasn’t terrible. I’m still okay. 

I really need to kick this habit for good. I hate spending money on them, I don’t want to have a heart attack before 60, I hate smelling disgusting, I want to have a baby in the future and obviously I don’t want cigarettes around a pregnancy/baby/child

Is it okay to smoke weed and call yourself a non-smoker?

I've been grappling with this question for a while now and I'm not asking it just to clear my conscience with the title of a "non-smoker". I'm genuinely curious if, in terms of damage to the lungs and other physiological symptoms, weed fares any better than the cigarette. 

I've always believed that the reason tobacco is not chastised as much as weed even though (presumably) both are ultimately damaging to the lungs is because tobacco manipulates your neural networks to make you want to consume more, whereas that isn't the case (at least currently, as there isn't much solid evidence to the contrary) with weed. 

What do you guys think?

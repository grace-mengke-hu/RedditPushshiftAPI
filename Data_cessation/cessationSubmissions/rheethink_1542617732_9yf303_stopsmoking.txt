I made a $1000 wager with my friend

Earlier this evening, I made a $1k bet with a close friend at a bar to quit smoking for one full month. It starts in approximately 23 hours (midnight, Tuesday, November 20th).

I'm terrified. I'm scared. I don't squelch on bets, so win or lose, I'm committed. By seeing a single cigarette as costing $1000, I hope that I can fight my addiction.

I promised myself when I first started smoking that I would quit after 10 years. This wager happens to coincide with being 2mos out from that promise.

Thinking about this one month commitment makes me want to throw up.

See you in 23 hours.

Made it through the bar

I know I should avoid places where people smoke. And I associate drinking with smoking. I have for myself for years. But I wanted to see friends.

I made it to day six, and it was hard. I'm glad I have that experience under my belt. I don't want to cut people out just because a place will make me want to smoke. I won't. I'll just stay strong about it and it will get easier.

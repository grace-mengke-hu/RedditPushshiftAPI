14 days..

I’ve smoked on/off for about 15 years with the last year being a pack a day.


This quit has been relatively easy so far cravings wise.. but.. I have this voice in the back of my head that basically says I have definitely NOT smoked my last cigarette. Is that normal? I actively don’t want to smoke but worry about moments of weakness/ drinking etc. 


Great community wish I knew about this earlier

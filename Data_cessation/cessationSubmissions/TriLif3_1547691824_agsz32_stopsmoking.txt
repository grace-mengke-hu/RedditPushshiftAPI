Working In A Room Full Of Smoke And Didn't Sway

Started a new job and I was sent out for training to a call to an office full of indoor smoking. I was there for about in hour and remembered quickly  about the smell I dislikes carrying with me after smoking after the others mentioned it on me once coming back to the office. Ive been 2 weeks clean officially since yesterday and haven't felt so relieved of it along with so excited to start running again soon.

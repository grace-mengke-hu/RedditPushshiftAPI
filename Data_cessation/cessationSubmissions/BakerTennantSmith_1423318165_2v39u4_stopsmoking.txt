Quitting is contagious

I've been quite vocal with people in my life about quitting smoking. Over the past week, I've had two people tell me that they also quit. One is entering week 2, the other is heading towards a month. I was honest with both of them and told them that I slipped the other day. I realized that was doing them a favor. When I first quit a month ago, I was feeling immune to the idea of ever slipping. I was wrong. It's good to be aware of triggers, etc. 

Anyway, it's good to realize that the actions of one can affect others and cause them to also make positive change. Now we can all support each other!

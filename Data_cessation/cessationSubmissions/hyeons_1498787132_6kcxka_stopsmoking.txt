One heavy off-putting factor for me

I've been wanting to quit, and I've had stretches of time of not touching cigs. I've been mentally preparing, but one of the factors that really set me off is something somewhat dumb:

Everybody states that one gains a surprising amount of weight while quitting, and I don't want to go through this. I work pretty hard to maintain good form, so I feel like quitting smoking will add another thing I "need to do" in its stead. 

This might sound petty, but it's actually made me hesitant for a while now.

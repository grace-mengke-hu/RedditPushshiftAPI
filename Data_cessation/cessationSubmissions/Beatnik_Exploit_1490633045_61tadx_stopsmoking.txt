If you want to quit, just quit today. The only one stooping you is you.

So I don't post very often but I stop by here and read every so often and this community is very helpful. I have made it over 2 years and this community played a part in that. The advice and support has been great, my dad quit for a while but has started back up again and I am trying to get him back but he is resisting it and putting it off. I am so glad I quit, I am glad I found this community to attach to and here is for 2 more years and many more after that!!

If you want to quit, it is going to suck but you can do it, and it is worth it on the other side. Sometimes you will want one just to pass the time or you think one wont hurt me but then that turns into, one pack wont hurt if I smoke them every so often and then your back to where you were. 

My favorite thing about not smoking, right after eating dinner I don't want to rush outside to get my fix. I can sit at the table and relax and not try to rush out.

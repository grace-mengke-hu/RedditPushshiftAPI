Help please about song!!

Hi, I was just wondering if you happened to know what the title and/or performer of this song. In the chorus it goes like "Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo..." I know a woman sung it and it was made in maybe the 90s.. Possibly a little earlier than that. As of what my mom says, I guess. She was born in 1982.. So..

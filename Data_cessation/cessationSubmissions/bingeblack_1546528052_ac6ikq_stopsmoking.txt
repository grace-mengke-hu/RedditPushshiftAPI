Can't stop eating!!!!

I literally cannot stop eating . I've eaten everything that I could find and I still feel hungry. I know this is one of the side affects but anything I can do to stop this hunger? It's unbearable. I cannot put on weight anymore. That'd make me depressed and start the cycle all over again. HELP!!!!

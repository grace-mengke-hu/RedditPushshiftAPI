Just started today

I just decided to quit today for my son, my girlfriend and myself. It's already so hard. It's been 9 hours already and I'm feeling anxiety. I bought a path step 1. Is this a good idea. Is there another method I should be trying? I've been smoking for about 10 years now. I started smoking more than 5 cigarettes a day in the past 5 months. My girlfriend also broke up with me. I have been with her for over six years now and that's why I think I'm getting a stronger urge. I've also decided to stop drinking because that was one main reason I would smoke so much.  That's when I decided to just stop it now before it gets worse. I'm trying the heavy breathing but it's not helping much. Maybe there are some tricks you guys can help me with. I keep getting the urge even with the patch. Would the gum make it easier. This is my first time here so any help will be appreciated. Thank you. And congrats to all the people that fought through it.

I just smoked my last smoke.

My girlfriend and I are going to watch some netflix and go to bed. I've quit a couple times before and, I'm hoping this is the last time. I would like to try using this subreddit as a journal for myself. Congrats to those who have quit successfully. Best of luck to those trying and to those who are planning to quit as well.

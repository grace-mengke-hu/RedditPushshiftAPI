Check Lung Health

Folks \- I've stopped smoking for a while now. Though I bum a stick or two while I'm inebriated. But that is occasional, but I'd say I do not have intense cravings that I used to have once.

Now, is it possible to check lung health through some test and see if its normal or sore ?

Sounds lame but I was just curious.

5th day (thank you flair) and so far...

Everything is going pretty swell. Cold turkey quitting after smoking my last one a few days back, and so far I feel fine. No craving for a smoke, no morning dry throat from smoking the night before (best part so far), and I don't have the occasional light cough (could call it smokers cough, but mine wasn't as severe as they come)

And honestly, while I did enjoy smoking (to me, the burning feeling was... I guess you could say relaxing, not all of it was cause I felt better mentally), I do honestly believe that this is for the best, and that I won't end up hurting myself worse than I could be. Sure, I did smoke and the damage from that is done, but better to quit when I'm 20 than wonder 'what would it be like if I did quit' when I'm 50 and possibly in my death bed.

To those who have already put it down, keep it going. To those who just put it down, I believe in you.

I may not make day to day posts, but I will just make the random update, and if I do anything significant, I will hopefully know to post it here.

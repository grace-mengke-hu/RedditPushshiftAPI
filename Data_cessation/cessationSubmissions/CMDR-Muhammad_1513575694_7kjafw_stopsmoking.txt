Idk if I can do it anymore...

Hi everyone! So I started smoking when I was 12 and quit a year ago at the age of 30 and started vaping. I was a heavy to light smoker. Had a few years at 4 packs a day.. was at one and a half when I quit. I have always had issues with severe addiction (am a recovered alcoholic and addict) but I'm have a really hard time now. Almost every night for the past year I've had dreams that I smoke a whole pack! Not to mention I'm a chef so everyone smokes like a chimney! IDK what to do since vaping is just not helping any more. I decided to also stop vaping today since it was messing with my teeth and I'm not sure if it's messing with my lungs or I'm just getting sick. Any advice on what I can do to get past this before I snap and buy a pack? Thank you!

I quit! Cigarettes taste/smell gross to me now

I was a PAD+ smoker of american spirits. After a couple years of trying to quit I took all of my cigarette $ and bought an electronic cigarette. It was rough the first couple of days but then I got over it. I tried a friends real cigarette just to see what I was missing and it was horrible. I don't understand how I've been smoking all these years. Since then I haven't looked back and I'm loving it. So If you want to quit and save some money stop by R/electronic_cigarette read the FAQ and suggestion guide. Get one and don't look back. Just cuz you quit smoking doesn't mean you have to quit nicotine. Nicotine isn't necessarily bad for you its all that other crap that you inhale when tobacco is burned. 
Whats in ecigs?
propylene glycol =used in inhalers for asthmatics, food FDA approved as GRAS
vegetable glycerin used in food 
nicotine 
flavoring. 
It is basically safe. Any questions hit me up.
Good luck y''all!  Hope it helps.

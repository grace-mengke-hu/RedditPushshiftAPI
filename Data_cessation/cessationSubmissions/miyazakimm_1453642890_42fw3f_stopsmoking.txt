Smoked after 46 days, not worth it.

It made me feel so ill its insane. Had a stupid brain fart and I thought smoking would be cool. Ugh.. If you find yourself feeling like having a smoke at any time, take my advice: it feels really, really bad to smoke. Its a poison, it destroys your self-esteem. I wouldn't smoke now if I remembered how fucking horrible it tasted. Next time I get an urge I'll remember.

Peace y'all!

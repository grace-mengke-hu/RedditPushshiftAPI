Back to day 1 again :(

I had originally quit for the millionth time back on thanksgiving weekend. I stopped for 3 weeks and then straight up caved and just bought a pack (backstory- was quitting a heavy drinking problem at the same time and the panic attacks from quitting both were so unbearable that I chose the "lesser" of two evils at the time and smoked)....

Now that I'm sober and getting more comfortable with being sober, I'm truly ready to rid my body of cigarettes, hopefully for good.

Today I'm at day one and SHIT ITS HARD. It feels like it gets harder every time. 

The manipulative voice in my head is like wow you've gone 10 hours since waking up without a cig. You deserve one. One won't do anything you'll be fine.... 

How do I conquer this voice because I still have 10 cigs on me and damn one sounds good right now!!!!!

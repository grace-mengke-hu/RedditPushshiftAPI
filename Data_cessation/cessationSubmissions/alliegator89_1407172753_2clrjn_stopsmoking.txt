So very angry. Strong cravings.

I am livid.  This is the angriest I have been since since I quit. I am having extremely strong cravings.  I don't want to yell and get in a fight.  I am too exhausted for a fight.  I want to smoke one just to say F you.  I understand how illogical that is.  It would obviously hurt me more than it would hurt anyone else, but I am JUST SO ANGRY.

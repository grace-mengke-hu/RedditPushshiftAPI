Help, how do I tell my boyfriend he needs to quit smoking?? He's 18

My boyfriend just started smoking cigs about a little over a month ago. He always told me that we would never smoke cigs because his family did and when his family would try quitting , they would turn mean and really aggressive and now he's one of them too. :/. I want to tell him to stop but I feel like he's gonna hate me or some shit. I already tried and he broke up with me because "I was being too controlling". It's not that. He was born with a heart murmur. He barely has any teeth at all because he was born with a cleft lip, his teeth are already really bad. This is just making it worse and I feel like it's going to affect our relationship.

This is the best I've felt in my entire life. One year smoke free today!

Around January I remember taking a drag from my last cigarette in my pack and asking myself, 'am I really enjoying this?' The answer was no, but nevertheless half an hour later I was on my way to the near by shop to buy more. One of my friends (also a smoker) mentioned that he was going to quit for lent, so I decided that I would do it with him. The first 3 weeks were torture I'm not going to lie but I just focused on getting through the forty day period smoke free, and by the end I didn't even want to go back. 
Fast forward one smoke free year and I've lost a tonne of weight, started regular exercise, and I'm training to do a half marathon this year! If I can do this anyone can. 
Cheers for your constant support r/stopsmoking, don't think I would have made it through those first 40 days without it!!

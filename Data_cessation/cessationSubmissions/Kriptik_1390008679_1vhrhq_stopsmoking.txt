Smoking cessation and auditory hallucinations

* Due to the recent smoking laws enacted on Wednesday in Illinois (flicking a butt constitutes a class B misdemeanor with a fine not exceeding $1,500. A second conviction is a class A misdemeanor with a fine not exceeding $1,500, and a third or subsequent convictions will be a class 4 felony, punishable by a fine of $25,000 and imprisonment of 1-3 years.) many people including myself started our new years resolutions this week.

* I'm currently on day 2 and am having some weird side effects of nicotine withdrawal (cold turkey) that I haven't experienced before. 

* When i was driving home from work today, I experienced auditory hallucinations. I swore that I heard the sounds of a walkie-talkie conversation as if from a road crew/police etc. Assuming it to be my radio, I was surprised to find that it continued for a few seconds after I turned my radio off. I freaked out assuming that I was going crazy, but tried to chalk it up to not enough sleep.

* When i got home I found that auditory illusions/hallucinations are pretty common among those experiencing withdrawal of any substance. Just wanted to see if any of you had experienced anything like it before.

PSA: Don't buy Vuse products from RJ Reynolds!

[Vuse ](https://vusevapor.com/modules/FooterLinks/ProductFAQ.aspx)is a "digital vapor cigarette. It's RJ Reynolds foray into the vape market. It works pretty much like a Blu but uses proprietary connections. I had been trying to quit analogs and this seemed like a neat product so I gave it a shot. The base battery units cost $10 a piece and come with a charger and one cart. The carts cost $6 for a pair and come in packs of 2. The carts have an auto shutoff after (I think) 200 puffs. The product is actually fairly enjoyable.
However I have had 3 battery units break in under 2 months. Supposedly the batteries are supposed to last 4-6 months each. These things are crap quality. Do not buy them!
I believe the state I am in is the test market so I feel it's my duty to warn the rest of you that this product will break and isn't worth your time and effort.

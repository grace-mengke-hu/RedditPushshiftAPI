Almost 32 hours and holding strong!

I'm a long time lurker here but I feel like sharing for the first time! I'm 21 and I've smoked off and on for the last 4 years. My longest quit was for 10 months with the EasyWay method. But alcohol made me relapse in July last year and I've only stopped for maybe a month since then. Recently, I've quit drinking altogether (for unrelated reasons) and I'm getting married next year. I realized I've gotten up to a 2 packs a day habit, and I could save $280/month at least towards my wedding if I quit. I'm also just ready to leave that behind. I want to be free. And I want to be around a long time for my family that I am starting. 

So I am declaring to you all, I am a non-smoker! I am no longer a slave to tobacco!

Quit smoking for almost 3 weeks now. Smoking since I was 16 and turning 22 next month. Switched to using a Juul. Wondering about next step and what to look forward to.

Hello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit! I've finally feel like I can quit smoking cigarettes after switching to the juul. It's been almost 3 weeks (Had my last cigarette on July 5th 2018).  
  
I started smoking since I was 16 and I'm turning 22 next month. I remember my first cigarette on Halloween of my sophomore year of high school. I finally went to my first high school party and wanted to fit and became a social smoker ever since. Then it quickly escalated to smoking a cigarette daily and when I got to college the stress made me smoke even more! I went from smoking 1 cigarette a night my freshmen year of college to smoking more than half a pack a day my senior year of college... I wanted to quit before I became a "pack a day" smoker.  
  
Ever since I quit I noticed that my heart rate went down, my blood pressure definitely dropped, Breathing is so much easier, my sense of smell improved, and (my favorite part) my sense of taste improved drastically. I never realized how good food tasted!  
  
There's only 1 fear that I have. My cravings for cigarettes are very rare, but I feel like I rely on my juul way too much. I always have to have it with me or I feel anxious. I also go through those suckers like hot cakes. If I get to a comfortable point, I plan to end my nicotine dependency altogether, but how would I approach it? Since the juuls are so much easier to puff on and provide a surprisingly high amount of nicotine I feel like my nicotine dependency got worse.  
Also, what are other things to look forward to (improvements in health) as time goes on because I'm really enjoying the benefits of ridding my body of cancer sticks.

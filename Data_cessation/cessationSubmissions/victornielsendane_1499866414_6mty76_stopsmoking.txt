[Help!] My mom uses smoking as an escape from the harsh reality of my dad having gone half paralysed

My dad (55) got a blood clot 3 years ago and is now paralysed in the left side of his body due to the right side of the brain dying (apoplexia).

It has been really tough for my mom (54) as they have been together since forever (they have had no one else but each other). My mom was used to my dad handling everything and now she has to do everything. My dad needs to eat healthy in order to get better, but he keeps making the excuse "yes, and you need to stop smoking". 

I asked her why she won't do it and she said that she needs to be really set on it, because she doesn't want to try and fail. She says that she needs to be committed first. I asked her why she wasn't committed and she said that when she smokes it's the only time she escapes the hard reality of what happened to my dad and the only time she gets to cry without him seeing it (which is the only time he is sad - when she is sad). 

She is seeing a therapist for dealing with her problems, but I just don't know how to convince her to stop smoking, please help!

I need to stop.

I am 21M, have been smoking since ~16. Really started in earnest at 18 when I started college.

I want to stop smoking, I need to. I've started to have a constant cough, often coughing up phlegm. I don't feel that I can breathe deeply. I have terrible acne, and almost never feel in good health.


I just poured out all my cigarrettes, and I will never smoke another cigarrette.


Any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated, I just wanted to put it down in text.
Thanks!

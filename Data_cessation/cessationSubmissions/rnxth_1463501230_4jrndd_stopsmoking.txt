5th (hardest) day, keeping myself busy

Over the weekend and Monday I forced myself into situations where smoking would have been weird or uncomfortable for me. That worked really well.
Today at work again was the hardest day so far. But I kept myself busy and worked like crazy. That's how I managed to get by this day, till now at least. And that's why I'm writing this text, to keep myself busy. It worked for me (5 days now at least, longest I lasted till now)


Nothing really to discuss here, just a little therapy for me. Maybe to inspire others.. I don't know. 

This sub also played a big role in motivating me, thanks to everyone here. 


Now a nice glass of whiskey. Always had a cigarette with it before but I know I'll enjoy it even more now. 


Ps: sry if the formatting is messed up, on mobile and 3rd ever reddit post or so.

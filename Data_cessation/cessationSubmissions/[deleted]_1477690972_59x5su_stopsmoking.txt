Quitters insomnia

I've been off tobacco for just over one week, and my sleep has been total shit.  For the first few days i had a patch on, but, believing it may contribute to my sleeplessness, I no longer use it.  Still, I'm lucky to get four hours a night.

I have no coffee after noon, tried until, and still can't sleep.

Anyone else not sleeping well?

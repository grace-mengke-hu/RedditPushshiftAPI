Side effect?

Switched from cigarettes to a vape, then cut out the vape a few weeks ago. A few days ago my back started aching like crazy. Like, I shake in pain when I stand up, crazy. Dr. Google says this could be related to nicotine withdrawal and quitting smoking. Have you guys ever experienced something like this? And what did you do?

Why can't I sleep, 4am Grrrrr

It is 4am in Texas and here I am in the middle of my bed, my dog sound asleep next to me, drinking yoohoo and contemplating digging into that French Onion dip in the fridge. My ass is going to the size of Dallas if I don't watch it. Beats smoking I guess. I can always jog off my auxiliary ass, can't jog off something like lung cancer. But, more to the point, why am I awake? I went to bed three hours ago. I have had the blessing of sleep most of my life. I have always bragged I could sleep anywhere. Maybe that's lame to be proud of but I could probably sleep in a tree. Here I am, dutifully not smoking, but not sleeping either. I am Cold Turkey, so I won't be taking any sleep aids. Any suggestions my friends?

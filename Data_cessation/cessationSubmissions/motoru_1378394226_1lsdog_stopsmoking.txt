Just quit about 3 weeks ago, question about dipping.

August 11th was my first day off cigarettes, and I haven't slipped up once. I was wondering about dip though. This past weekend I went out with some friends and we all got good and drunk, then I had a couple pouches. Would this set me back to day 1? If not, is there anything I've set back at all?

**EDIT:** Holy hell, I actually quit the 11th, not the 31st.

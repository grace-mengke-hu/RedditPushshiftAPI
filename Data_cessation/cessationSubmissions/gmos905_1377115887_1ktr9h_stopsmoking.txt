So I got wasted last night....

And I didn't smoke at all! I was only two days deep and just finished Alan Carr's book a few days ago. I had a ton of cravings, and my ex girlfriend was texting me all night nagging and adding stress while I got drunk with my friend who I haven't seen in a while. And I made it through! really excited about it, woke up super happy about it today! It truly is better to not be smoking. I was worried I'd smoke on vacation next week but I think I'll be getting through it no problem! Good luck brothers!

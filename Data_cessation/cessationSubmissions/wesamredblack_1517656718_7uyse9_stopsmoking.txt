Second hand Smoking - Need answers (preferably short and concise)

*Tl;dr:* 
1) Does second hand smoking induce nicotine into my system?
2) Does it count as a relapse towards my nicotine dependency?

*Actual post:*
After 138 hours of no nicotine in-take what so ever (**Hell**), my flatmate decided it was a brilliant idea to light one not even 10 meters away from me, I got a high on second hand smoking. (God I'm **fuming** right now) Does second hand smoking induce nicotine into my system and does it count as a relapse towards my nicotine dependency?

A Weird Situation with NRT

So, I was sticking to an NRT regimen. I had no urges to smoke, as I was taking nicotine lozenges multiple times a day. I was "gradually stepping down" and figured to stay with the plan for twelve weeks, as per the directions. Then a funny thing happened: I got the flu. While  feverish and drowsy, unable to go to work and feeling like garbage, I forgot to take my nicotine lozenges at all on Friday. I realized this on Saturday and thought, "hmm", guess I don't need them. Now it's been over 72 hours without any nicotine. I don't want to smoke or take any kind of nicotine supplement. But I am still a bit sick with flu symptoms (clogged sinuses, headaches, sore throat). The illness has been a big shakeup to my routine. But I really don't want to smoke a cigarette or take a nicotine lozenge now or any time in the future. Will I get withdrawals when I recover from the flu? Any advice on this situation?

Day One - Here we go

My last dart was at 10pm last night EST.
Today has been really fucked up, in good and bad ways. 

My girlfriend and I had sex for the first time, then I threw the rest of my cigs in the woodstove and let them burn. Then I went to get a wisdom tooth pulled; complete with drills, cracking, the fears of taking another tooth along the way. I figure, if I can get through a day like today with no cigs, I should be just fine.

Now I'm wandering around the house like a zombie with frozen peas on my face.

17 hours, no darts, the longest in probably 4 or 5 years.

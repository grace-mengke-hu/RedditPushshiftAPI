Starting over

I had quit for 3 and half days... after a extremely stressful Wednesday, I bought a pack on my way home from work.  I went back to the normal routine until I got home from work today, when I decided to throw the rest of the pack out and start again.  I used the patch previously and still went back.  This time, I'm quitting cold turkey.  No half measures!

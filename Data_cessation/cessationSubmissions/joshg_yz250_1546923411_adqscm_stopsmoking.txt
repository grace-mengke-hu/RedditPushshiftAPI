Now is the time.

I’m a 31 year old male who lives in Australia. I’ve smoked daily since I was 15, I’ve spent roughly 120k on cigarettes in that time. I’ve always been active and love skateboarding, riding motorcycles road and dirt and being creative - photography, guitar, woodwork etc. I feel extremely jaded and apathetic, all I do with my time is smoke and drink and I can feel it destroying my soul.

I’m reading Allen Carr’s easy way for the 3rd time, my only serious attempt at quitting was about 14 months ago and I lasted 14 days, I felt like I was beginning to regain my passion for the world. I can’t seem to convince myself that quitting isn’t terrifying, I’m well and truly in the nicotine trap.



Dear Cigarettes,

You’ve taken my money, you’ve taken my motivation, you’ve taken my youth, you’ve taken my health. 

I’m willing to do anything I can to take my life back from you and I’m determined that you will not take me!


Josh.

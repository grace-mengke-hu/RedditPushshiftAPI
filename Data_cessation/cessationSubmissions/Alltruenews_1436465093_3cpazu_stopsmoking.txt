A non-smoker and heart transplant patient here to explain how not smoking can literally save your life now!

During the three years of grueling illness and tests, the issue that came up the most was whether I smoked. The answer was always the same "no" but if I did smoke, my medical care would have been VASTLY different. They would have had to pursue and eliminate all of the pulmonary and other ailments that can be brought on by smoking. Also, smoking would have all but eliminated me from the transplant list.

I received my gift of life 8 months ago and I have my life back. Being able to answer the doctors with a firm "no" to the smoking question is priceless.

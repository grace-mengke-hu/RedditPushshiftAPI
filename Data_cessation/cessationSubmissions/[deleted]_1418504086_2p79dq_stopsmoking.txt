Skin irritation/changes?

This is mainly aimed at the other females out here, but guys, please feel free to reply as well.

So every night I use an exfoliate cream on my face which up to this point has not been an issue.  Last night, however that all changed.  I used as per normal and like pretty much right away, my face goes all read and starts to itch.  It only lasted a few minutes after I washed off the cream.  It never did this to my face when I smoked.  I am wondering if anyone else has noticed changes such as this?

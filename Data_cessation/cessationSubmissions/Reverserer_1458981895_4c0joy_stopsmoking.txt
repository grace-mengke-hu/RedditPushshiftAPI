1037 Days smoke free - sitting in hospital with collapsed lung

Had I continued to smoke my dr told me I might not have survived this.  

Spontaneous pneumothorax - right lung completely collapsed.  So much pressure created in my chest cavity that my trachea and heart pushed to the left side of my chest.  This is day 3 in the hospital - will be going In for surgery on Monday to remove blebs on both sides of my lungs.

This is a genetic disorder (the blebs) and I will make a full recovery thanks to me quitting smoking.  

Go me!  I strongly urge all you here to continue to try to quit.  You might fail, several times, but dust yourself off and keep at it.  Your future self will thank you.  

Edit: TY for all the well wishes all!

Procrastinating until I saw how much I could have saved

The idea of quitting was in my head for a very long time, I've been smoking for 6 years now. My intake is roughly a pack a day. I chain smoke like its a quest to finish the pack. Today while discussing how to save money with my girlfriend, it occurred to me that I should calculate how much I can save just by quitting.

Frickin $2,845 a year. I did the calculations, that's enough for a trip for us to other countries, enough to save up and buy new furniture for my room(Heck even a makeover). Enough to build a monster PC.

So I did it. I just smoked my last cigarette, funny how it's the last stick in the pack as well. As to how I'm starting to curb the addiction? My friends have recommended me to try e-cigarettes although its "illegal" I'm at the point where drastic measures are kicking in.

So good luck to everyone and good luck to me. WE CAN DO THIS!

One of the worst part might be those weird dreams where you smoke.

I think it happens to all of us, but since I stopped smoking nearly every night I dream that I relapse... It seems so real that when I wake up I often have a hard time realising that I'm a non-smoker now.

I guess it's gonna disappear soon, I'm almost 2 weeks in already and I can't picture myself smoking again after seeing all the benefits.

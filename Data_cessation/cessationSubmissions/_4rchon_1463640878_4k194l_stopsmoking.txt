Just hit 1w mark, pot smoker needs help

Hello my fellow warriors,  8 days ago I decided to quit on any kind of smoke and I made it so far with less than few cravings. So,  the main reason I did that is I felt the need of balancing the chemicals in my brain,  -going into a challenging graduation exam-  messed up by years of nicotine and "crystallized" because of my daily weed and hash use/abuse.
The second reason of course is repairing the deep damaging that smoking did to my body. 
Despite feeling mostly great the past days,  apart few times when I felt my senses "cloudy" and a bit dizzy,  I'm having some trouble now,  that is fucking up my morale and makes me wonder how will I get past this damn addiction. 
My goal was to have some time to heal my lungs,  then go back to medicate myself with pot,  however in the past years I developed strong habits with smoking mainly  hash>spliffs and I really don't know what can I do besides buying a vape,  that currently is out of question. Many times I've quit nicotine for months but smoking that spliff always kills any effort and despite restoring a low profile addiction to cigs,  it's still addiction. Tell me your experience,  tell me how to do it,  how to stick only on pot,  that I genuinely need in a system where it's not legal and really accepted... Might nicotine-free herbs help?  Like those sold in coffee shops,  or are they somewhat cancerous as well and not for common use? I seek for help reddit,  because I hate my demon,  tobacco.

Quitting worries

So I've started to think that maybe it's time to quit. At the age of 23, I've been smoking for nearly 12 years (go rural towns with unhealthy youths!).

My biggest hurdle before taking the plunge is socialisation. When I'm at the pub, I love going out, and chatting to new folks, but I have never been able to do that without the forced proximity of smokers shelters. Working behind the bar, it gives me more opportunity to chat to customers, and being out and about it gives me more opportunity to meet people I wouldn't normally talk to. How do I manage that? 

Thanks!

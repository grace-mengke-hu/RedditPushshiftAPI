Did I just have an idea from my cravings or is this already a thing?

I recently switched from cigarettes to a nicotine vape (then soon just friut flavored non nicotine). And one of the biggest things I miss is the cherry going down the cigarette when I would hit it not just the glowing. It gave me a sense of completion.

So I thought, is there an e cig with maybe something like an led tube that when you draw, the cherry dosent just glow, but goes down a little representing a hit? 

For me, the vape works a little, but feels unsatisfactory being that I dont have a timer, I have to mindful and dictate how much is a "break" when originally it took me x minutes to smoke a cigarette, so I was secure in my time margins.

Still happy Im quitting :)

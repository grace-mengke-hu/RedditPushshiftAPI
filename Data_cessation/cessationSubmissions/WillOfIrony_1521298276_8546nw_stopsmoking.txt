Bought a pack..

Bought a pack last night didnt smoke though, i quit since 5 months now but for some reason i have these insane cravings lately. I think its mostly because I am stressed of my master study and working next to it and just the uncertain position i am in currently in my life. I know it could be that i am not making any sense but I just wanted to vent. Stay strong friends!

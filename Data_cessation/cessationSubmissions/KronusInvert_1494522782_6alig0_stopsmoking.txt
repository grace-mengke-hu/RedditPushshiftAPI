Going cold turkey, any tips?

I will be trying to quit other habits that seem to be of a self destructive nature, due to depression I seem to usually see a lack of purpose to continue stopping. I do have an urge to succeed but it seems easier to maintain the habits. If I can end them all at the same time I know I could do it, so yeah any information from someone that has quit would be helpful, thanks.

P.s I did have a half but felt a "nicotine headache", but still a day with only that, I am kinda proud if myself which is weird.

Are patches “cheating”?

I feel like I can’t enjoy my smoke-free life because I’m still on the patches (I quit on July 1). I tried to do without one today and was having a bitch of a time concentrating and properly forming my thoughts.

I feel like I’m doing this the wrong way but I can’t afford to be all over the place since I just started a new job.

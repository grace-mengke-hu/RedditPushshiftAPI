14, parents hate smoking, know my parents would cry if they found out, need to quit by myself.

please help me. I'm 14, been smoking electric cigs and some real cigarettes, i know it's illegal. I've been doing it to stop stress and anxiety, it calms me down, and i feel like i need it sometimes just to function!!

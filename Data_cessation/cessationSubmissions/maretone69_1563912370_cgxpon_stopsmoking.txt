Woke up this morning and decided today is the day

Hey guys, I was just thinking it would help me cope if I was able to let someone know that today will be my first day trying to quit
I have been smoking since 15 and im 21 now, I have been smoking cannabis daily since 18. Yesterday was one week sober from cannabis and I feel so empowered and motivated that my discipline has paid off so far. I now have a clear head space and can focus on the nicotine, I know its not going to be easy, but neither was pot, but youll never know if you can succeed if you dont try

I hope everyone who has quit so far stays strong and keeps their eyes on the prize, life is too short and time is precious. I wish to join you guys soon

Fyi I smoke a 26 pack of jps red a day or a 25g ryo in 4 days

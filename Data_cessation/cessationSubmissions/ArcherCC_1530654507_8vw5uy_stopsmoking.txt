Came so close to buying a pack today, but persisted.

Haven't had a smoke in 144 days, only on 2 other occasions have I come close to breaking, the first was on Mother's Day when I found out who my biological parents were (adopted at birth), the second was when I had a panic attack out in public.

Well today was the single closest I came to grabbing a pack, my wife is 36 weeks preggers (AKA about to friggin pop) and she was rear ended at the store with our 6 year old in the car. Now she, our unborn child and our daughter (and the car) are fine but sitting in the ER waiting to find out if they were OK nearly made me break.

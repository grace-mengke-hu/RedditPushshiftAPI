1 year down

This is my first to me posting in this sub, but I felt like I should post something on this auspicious occasion. 

Its been one year since my last dart, after a relatively short 4 year addiction. I quit cold turkey after a failed attempt with gum and an inhaler.

I gotta say it feels good to be free of those devils, but damn if I don't feel my fingers twitch when I see someone light up - or maybe I breath a little deeper when I smell that familiar smell.

Still, somewhere deep down I know I've got it beat, and if someone with as little willpower as me can kick this habit, then anyone can.

I was that guy

I was the guy who loved smoking and my friends would have never thought in a million years I would ever quit, and neither did I. If I can do it trust me anyone can! I smoked a pack a day or more since I was 14 and am turning 34 next month. I woke up one day and decided to see how long I can go without one out of pure willpower and look where I am at and I don't even think about it some days anymore. Just ignore the cravings they will pass and soon you will be free!

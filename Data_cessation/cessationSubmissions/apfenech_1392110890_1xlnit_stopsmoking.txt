Abnormal addiction

I only smoke one cigarette per day.  Usually before bed when I get home from work (I work 2p-midnight). I used to smoke 3-5 cigarettes per day a few years ago and was able to quit cold turkey. I'm having a harder time giving up 1 per day then when I had triple that. Any tips or advice to help me actually kick the habit for real? I know this is abnormal and I don't smoke a lot, but I feel a really strong addiction and draw to this minimal amount and would like to be smoke free.

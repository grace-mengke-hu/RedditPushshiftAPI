Day 1...again

Well, I am back at another day 1. At this point I've quit so many times, I know all my triggers. I know that for the first week I need to use some NRT but at a low dose and then after week 2 I can go off of it. What gets me? Purely impulse control. I just give in and say fuck it. I'm so fed up but I do not plan on giving up anytime soon.

I"m going to post here everyday for the first seven days. For the support and to hold myself accountable. I'd say wish me luck but I don't think I'll need it this time. I got this.

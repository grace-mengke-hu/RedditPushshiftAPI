10 days 16 hours

I'm so excited to be this far into my quit because I wasn't sure if I'd get here, again. It is so discouraging each time I've failed in the past. But, the past is the past, and right now I'm succeeding! The brain fog has lifted and I can focus on tasks now, which is wonderful!! I just can't seem to sleep like I used to. Having trouble falling and staying asleep. Even with taking melatonin. I've probably gained 5 lbs in the first 10 days but yesterday I started working out and being mindful of what I'm eating. Best wishes to all of you!!

Stopped smoking for the day because I don't want to get sick. I feel like I'm "on something", I'm light headed, my veins feel like they are tingling and the air feels like liquid on my skin. Is this normal?

I woke up today and knew I was getting sick. This cannot happen, not now I have a huge show this weekend. So I made a decision when I woke up not to smoke a single cigarette.  
  
I've been reading Alan Carr's Easy Way and have been preparing to make a quit attempt soon. I don't know how else to explain what's happening except to say it feels like my entire body including my mind is buzzing. The air outside feels like liquid on my skin. I go from feeling completely at peace with my decision not to smoke today and with this feeling I am experiencing to getting snappy with people way to quickly. This doesn't feel like the mild withdrawal Alan Carr describes every smoke to experience on a daily basis. It feels more like a manifestation of anxiety. It's kind of freaking me out and only making me want to smoke more. I feel weird talking to the people at work, I don't really feel like I'm here. Everything is dreamlike and surreal.  
  
Is this something I should be concerned about or is this normal?

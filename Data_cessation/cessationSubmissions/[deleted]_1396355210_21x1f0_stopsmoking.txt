Talk some sense into me?

I quit a bit over 4 months ago, at my fathers 1 year death memorial service. I had been thinking about it for a while and also read Allen Carr in the weeks before the event.


I'm getting a lot of pro's here: 


* I got my gf and her folks to quit smoking. Part of my motivation was to have a child in the following two years that would not be affected by smoke. 
* I learned that cigarette smoke does smell bad and our house no longer smells of smoke, 
* I may be a bit healthier, I'm having slightly more stamina at the gym but I'm overall disappointed with this. I've been fairly active (gym 2-3 times a week, mainly lifting with a bit of cardio) but I didn't notice a real jump in lung capacity. 
* I gave myself significant chunk of disposable income. 
* I also drink a lot of coffee and I would get hearth palpitations every now and then. I haven't had one since I quit. 



But I'm also getting a lot of cons:

* I went through a lot of stress at first and I've been a lot angrier at times. Had a few fights with the gf where I know that withdrawal was a big part of it. 
* I still have a hotter temper than I used to have. 
* Sometimes it feels like I lack the patience that I once did, or some part of the focus I once had. 
* I started to drink at home during the weeknights. It's only a few drinks (2 beers/night) and I started doing it as some sort of replacement for smoking.
* I gained a 4 kilograms and I still have trouble controlling my appetite. 
* My sense of smell and taste  have not significantly improved/changed like advertised.
* I don't go outside every few hours to take a short break. My eyes hurt more and I need breaks every now and then from my desk job to relax. Now I have to find other "reasons" to break like a tea or the water cooler. This feels odd. These breaks also helped to focus my creative thinking for my job sometimes, as the break would help me get a more relaxed perspective of things.
* I'm 28 and I've been smoking since I was 14. Most of the fun times I've had have been smoking related. 
* I feel like I'm getting too old too fast. I'm also getting married in the summer, getting an apartment and a baby soon. Quitting smoking surely helps me with my finances and it will help pay the bills,  but it adds up with the rest and makes me feel way too grown up.  
* I think about starting again like I think about connecting myself to a plug. Like I'd drink 10 red bull cans and my eyes would pop and the stress and head-ache would go away and I'd be at peace and energetic and focused and happy. I think about that one cigarette in the morning that wakes me up.  I think about a constant struggle I've had these past months not to smoke. After the first few days where  the pain was bad and I could not focus on anything it did got better, but even know when I'm supposed to be at my happiest, like after sex or when I'm with my friends having a few beers, I have an urge to smoke and it somehow keeps me from being 100% happy and relaxed. 
* I remember reading that Carr's success rate is 90% for the first 3 months. For the first year it drops to something like 20%. I think that I may be one of the 70% that reconsiders/rethinks it. I'm thinking of restarting smoking like the end of a struggle, a conscious choice that I'd do one morning, perfectly sober - not a drunken defeat that I'd regret the next day. 

EDIT: There's also this feeling of achievement. After the first few weeks, the first month, when It began getting easier, I somehow had a feeling of "Achievement Unlocked" in my head. Now that I proved myself that I can do it, I somehow don't need to do it anymore...

Not wildly impressive, but my best so far.

I've been smoking for 7 years. December 28th, I set a timer on the app that I see a lot of you using. I broke, though. Not terribly. I smoked a few butts from the ash tray. 

I haven't stopped the timer. I haven't really even looked at it. I haven't smoked a full cigarette, haven't bought a pack, and the best thing is that when I smoked those butts, they were disgusting to me.

I'm still having cravings. Not as bad as usual, I guess. I haven't been stressed out enough to truly test myself and I hope that doesn't happen for a while. I'm vaping, which I don't know if you guys see that as cheating, but it's helping me a lot and I feel so much healthier already.

I'm still sitting outside. I've just replaced my coffee and cigarette with a vape and hot chocolate.

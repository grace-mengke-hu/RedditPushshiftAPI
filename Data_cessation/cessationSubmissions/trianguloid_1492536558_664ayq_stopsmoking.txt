3 weeks! wooooooooooo!

well, I did it. After 10 years as a heavy smoker, 2 years quit, and the last year as a heavier than ever smoker, I spent the last 6 months trying nearly every day to quit and completely failing. I finally couldn't take it anymore, woke up one morning, got some coffee and my pack of smokes, and sat down and listened to the entire Easy Way audiobook while doing nothing but smoking and drinking coffee. Book finished, I stood up and was done. I've had the odd pang here and there, mostly when I'm out at night and see someone smoking after a drink, but by and large it's been easy and craving free. SO, so, so glad. SO relieved. I was starting to think I would never be able to quit and was going to end up one of those dudes smoking through a tracheotomy hole on my death bed. But I'm done. and now every time I see someone smoking, I'm reminded how glad and lucky I am to be done. 

good luck! You can do it!

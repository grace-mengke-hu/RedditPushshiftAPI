I need to quit smoking, is there any real advice out there that actually helps.

I know most of the war is the day to day moment to moment battles, but is there anyone who has quit who would be willing to give this hopeless guy some pointers? Iâ€™ve tried to quit several times using different methods. Recently tried with vaporizers but that felt just as unhealthy. Any advice is welcome and much appreciated.

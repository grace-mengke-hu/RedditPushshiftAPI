Young people under 18 who smoke

Hello! 

Just throwing this question out there because I'm curious about - do young people actually follow the age restriction for cigarette smoking. I am from a country in Europe and kids start smoking there as early as age 10. It's just really easy to buy cigarettes. Do you guys think kids in America actually wait until they turn 18 to start smoking? I guess my overall question is, does it really matter if the gov't will raise the age to 21 to buy a cigarette? Will that help more kids smoke less? 

Thanks in advance!

After 25 years of smoking

Today marks exactly 1 year since i have smoked a ciggarette and i feel great! I never thought i would be able to quit, from smoking 2 packs a day down to 0. I did use a vape pen to help me taper down, and it helped immensely. Just wanted to share with you guys. If i can quit, you can too!!!

How do I stay smoke free?

I quit a little over a month ago (thanks to all the encouraging posts on here) using Allen Carr’s Easyway. Even though I had the occasional pang at first it was fairly easy to quit and I actually enjoyed declining cigarettes from friends or walking past smokers thinking ‘I don’t need these things anymore’. 

Fast forward to today and I’m starting to crave cigarettes again. I know these are purely psychological cravings as the nicotine is already out of my body. But now whenever I see a group of friends sharing a cigarette in the park or watch a movie with people having a smoke after sex I think about all the good times I had as a smoker. 
I know I should focus on the bad times and how I used to always cough and not be able to walk a flight of stairs without getting out of breath but the brainwashing of cigarettes seems to have taken over again. 

Thanks for reading, maybe some of you have advice. (And they’re sadly not even light cravings, I almost bought a pack last night)

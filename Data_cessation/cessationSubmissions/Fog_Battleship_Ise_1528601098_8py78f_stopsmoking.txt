Halfway through day 6 but anxiety is killing me atm

Five days 9 hours with the patch, no cravings everything is going perfectly except i have a pain in my left arm and my anxiety is going crazy because of it. The chest pains weren't as bad cause i expected them and i knew it was because my lungs are healing but i can't rationalize my arm hurting and its driving me insane.

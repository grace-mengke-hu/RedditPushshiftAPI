Officially at one week again!

I have been actively trying to stay quit since December. I was not expecting to feel so emotionally attached to them. I was 9 when I first smoked a cigarette. 

It’s been a lot of on and off since December. Well I have surgery next Friday and got up the nerve to drop them again on Friday. 

Withdrawal is fine, I can go days with out them with no problems. 
Sunday we are cleaning the house and I felt I had to sit down and take a break, felt sweaty and strangely tired... I put my head down on the couch and fell asleep for about 20 minutes before my husband (walking by and thinking I looked funny) tried to wake me up. 
Long story short we ended up sitting at an urgent care with me having a 103 degree fever. 
I know we got a diagnosis, medications, and I went home and slept until Thursday before the fever broke. 

I am only allowed Tylenol because of my surgery. And the meds that were prescribed were approved. 

Ear infection 
Strep
Sinus infection
Unusual high heart rate that had to be monitored

My whole upper respiratory system was messed up. 

I no longer feel sad about giving up cigarettes. F’that! I never want to go through that again. When you are ill enough that you sleep for four days with delirium you have small life changing realizations....(Thank you Husband for giving me meds to take) 

I have never been that sick and ai will not end up like my grandmother who smoked with her oxygen mask on.

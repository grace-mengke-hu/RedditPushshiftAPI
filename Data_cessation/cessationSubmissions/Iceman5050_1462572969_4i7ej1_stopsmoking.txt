Warning about drinking

Ok guys so I quit smoking 22 days ago, and tbh ive found it so enjoyable from discovering the benefits of quitting that the withdrawals have been bearable... But lastnight I thought j would be strong enough to go out to the club and a have a few to drink without smoking, but damn I was wrong. I ended up having a few to many, buying a pack and smoking for the second half of the night.

But you know what, it wasn't enjoyable, and this morning I feel so shit about myself for doing it, I feel dirty. I think it emphasised the reason why I quit

But I'm gonna take this minor setback in my stride, and just think of it as a learning curve, cause I now know how shit I'm gonna feel for doing it.

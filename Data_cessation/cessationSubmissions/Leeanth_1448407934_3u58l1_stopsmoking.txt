So, resetting my brain tomorrow...

I've been a lurker and occasional poster on here for years. In September 2012, I quit. I stayed quit for two years and then, after a shitstorm last year, impulsively bought a pack of cigs from a street vendor in Bangkok. It took one to get me hooked again.

I have selected tomorrow as my new quit date. I will be ordering a counter from the bot and holding myself to very high standards. I did it once; can do it again and forever this time. I know where I went wrong last time...

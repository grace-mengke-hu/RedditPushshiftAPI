I don't know...

The first 48 hours were rough, I won't lie. The cravings were ALMOST intolerable, but do-able for sure. 
Now that I'm here on day 3... It's not that hard for me. I haven't even had any real cravings. 
I had breakfast this morning, and right after I put on my shoes and grabbed a lighter to have a cigarette, stepped outside, and went... "Oh! Haha!" 

And walked back in. I didn't crave it, or feel bummed. I was just a little disoriented and too habit formed. 
Even the anger has gone away. I'm just happy now. 

I went to my sisters and brother in laws, and they smoke every 30 minutes. I stood outside with them when they smoked at the bottom of the stairs of their porch, and it didn't bother me, or make me want one. I kind of just thought...

"That's so nasty! How do they even?!" 

I figured it would take longer to hit this point. Guess not. 
Oh, and any cravings that do happen to hit, aren't even bad. I just tell myself to deal with it.

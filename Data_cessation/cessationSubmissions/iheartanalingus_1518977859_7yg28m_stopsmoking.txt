How do you deal with the depression?

I'd say I smoke a pack every 2 or 3 days. I'd probably be able to quit but during those off days I get really depressed. Plus I'm already on ssri and a blood pressure med that helps with adhd.

Tl;Dr Get depressed when I quit, always ends up with me smoking to alleviate the depression.

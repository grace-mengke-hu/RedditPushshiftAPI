Day 5 feeling okay

I am not really feeling the need to smoke which is great, I keep telling myself I don't need to. I just was told that its gonna take a couple of months to loosen their grip. I usually got neurotic after day 2 of trying to quit so this is a big deal for me. I am not going to be drinking this weekend and helping my sister, very anti-smoking, move into a new apartment. I think I'm going to try and quit drinking for a few weeks.

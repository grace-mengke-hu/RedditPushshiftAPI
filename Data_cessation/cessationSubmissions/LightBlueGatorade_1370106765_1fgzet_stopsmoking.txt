Day 1 through 3 was pure hell. Today, wasn't so bad.

I might go as far as saying today has been great. I finally got around to throwing out the last of my lighters, and matches in my apartment. Then I cleaned my car; gave it the whole works, vacuuming the seats/mats/trunk, cleaned the glass, got any remaining ash off my dashboard. It looks beautiful. I also started putting $8-10 in a jar every 2 days just to show the savings from not smoking. To top it all off, its 90 degrees out today, and I just ran 2 miles in 21:46 despite the heat. 

I feel great today, and wanted to express it to you all. Best of luck, fellow ex-smokers.

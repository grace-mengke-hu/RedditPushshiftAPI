Need some support.

Have been a smoker for over 12 years. Living in New Zealand as a smoker is hard as they are planning to make the country smoke free by 2025. Prices have gone up and the stigma of smoking is looked at more negatively than ever. 

I've tried gum, patches and all sorts to help me but no success. The hardest part is getting through the social pressure.

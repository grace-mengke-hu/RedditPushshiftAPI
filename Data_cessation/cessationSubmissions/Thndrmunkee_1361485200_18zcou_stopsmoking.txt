Quit Date: March 1.  Looking for preparation help

ok, it's 9 days to my quit date and I haven't tried in over a year.

I have Allen Carr's Easy Way (which I need to pick up again and read through) and a brief list of reasons that I don't want to smoke.  I also have a currently small supply of sugar-free gum.   I was hoping for some other recommendations for ways to fortify my efforts, maybe there's new info, etc since I had my smoking cessation classes.

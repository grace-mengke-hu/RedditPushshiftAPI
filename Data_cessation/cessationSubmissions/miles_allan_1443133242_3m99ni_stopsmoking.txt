Quitting (again)

I smoked a pack a day for just overnine years, 1997 to 13 November 2006. For eight years I was smoke-free, but a bad end to a relationship and a lot of stress, plus easy access living with a smoker, got me back into the habit last July.

But I'm ready to quit again. I'm almost out of cigarettes, and I don't feel the need to buy anymore (not like I used to anyway). Hopefully this quit will be permanent.

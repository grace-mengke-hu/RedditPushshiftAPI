Social smokers: what benefits did you notice from quitting?

I respect the success of all the quitters in this sub, but I feel disconnected from the experience of many of you. At most I ever smoked half a pack a day consistently, and for the past 1.5 years I've been a social smoker--so I smoke one or two nights a week, probably around 8 cigarettes at most.

A lot of the benefits you talk about don't really apply to me--most of the time I smell fine, my clothes and car and house smell fine too, I don't need to go out in the cold to smoke during the day, I don't feel like I lose coworkers' respect by smoking at work, I don't spend that much money on cigarettes, I don't waste much time on the habit, and I don't feel like the addiction controls me or significantly impacts my life. So when I read victory posts on this sub I am happy for the OP but don't feel particularly inspired by it as I don't think I will benefit from any of the quitting perks mentioned. 

But nonetheless I know smoking is bad for me and I need to stop. So my question is: any social smokers who successfully quit, what benefits did you notice as a result? Any tips or advice for someone try to quit? 

(And I know even smoking lightly has significant health consequences, but I'm asking for short to medium term benefits I could see as a result of quitting that would motivate me)

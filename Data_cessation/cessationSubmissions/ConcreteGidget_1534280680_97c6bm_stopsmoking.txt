I'm 19 and am trying to ween off of nicotine. Any tips?

I started to become addicted about a year ago when I was regularly chewing tobacco. Prior to that I had vaped low nicotine but that wasn't enough to get me hooked. I ditched the reprehensible habit and switched to a JUUL a few months ago and was going through a pod a day. That's a 4 dollar a day habit. Yesterday I bought some 6 nic juice for my old vape. JUUL's have 50 nic so I thought 6 would be pretty reasonable. I am not fiending for more. I plan to go through this 60 ml bottle and switch to 3 nic after that. I hope this will drastically reduce my addiction if I stick to 3 nic for a couple months and quit all together. 

This is my first time posting to this sub so I hope I haven't broken any rules. Cheers.

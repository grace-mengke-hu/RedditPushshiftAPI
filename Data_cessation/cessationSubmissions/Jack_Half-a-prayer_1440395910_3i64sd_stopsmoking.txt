Smoking messed up a date for me...

So today was my third day without smoking, until a few hours ago...

I knew I should've rescheduled cause last time I quit, the third day was the toughest for me.  Our first two times hanging out went very well. But today, I was very distracted, my mind was filled with cigarettes.  It obviously didn't go as well as it would have any other time. 

On my way home, I was a little bummed out. I ended up giving in and bought a pack. But I just threw that pack away ( what a waste of money haha). 

I'm not going to let cigarettes get in the way of my life anymore. I'm super done with them!

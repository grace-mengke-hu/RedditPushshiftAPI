Quitting for good after 40 years

Hi all. 
Just found you guys and I thought I'd post something as a distraction. As the title suggests I have smoked for 40 years (20-40 a day) and I'm on day 6 cold turkey. I have stopped for periods of time in the past but I'm now doing it for me. Not the mrs or work or the kids or all the snobs pearing down their noses in restaurant and pubs or anything else. I'm strong in my resolve because it is my choice. I have tried just about every kind of method in the past and they have all failed. Once the method stops so does the quit. The difference this time is my belief in me. I've always been able to control my life because I believe it belongs to me. My smoking belongs to me too and I can decide to smoke or not. For 40 years I choose to smoke now I choose NOT to smoke for the rest of my life. Thank you for reading me dribble. It helped me even if you find nothing in it. So feel good about quitting because by reading this passage you helped me quit.
Cheers

Trying to quit again come new years.

So I have been smoking for 15 years. A pack a day when I can afford it, I have tried many times over the years. Patches, gum, lozanges, pills and cold turkey. 

My best result is usually getting to about 6 months. Then something major happens. Something so stressful I reach for a pack and don't look back.

You see I am 30. So yes I have been smoking for about half my life. I realize now that starting so young smoking has ingrained itself into almost everything I do. Get up in the morning, have a smoke, drink of coffee that's a smoke, call someone on the phone (even the quitline people lol) That's at least 1 smoke.

My main problem is though not the habits, it is how smoking is tied to my mental and emotional state. I'm sure everyone on this subreddit knows how cravings feel, and how bad they can sometimes get. 

But the three things I really need to figure out are: how to deal with stress (starting young seems to have taught me that smoking is good stress relief); What to do when I am bored (I get bored easily and am currently unemployed, I read or game but bordem always creeps up on me); And finally how to deal with feeling down, I'm not a depressed person, but often after my angry outbursts when quitting or just plain out of smokes I tend to get depressed (for lack of a better word).

I honestly don't know why I am writing all this out. Maybe it will help me think clearer.

Oh and the reason I am quitting in the new year and not right now is simple. I don't want to be a dick to my family over Christmas and new years also my mother would kick my ass if I was acting like a dick.


For those of you who read this post.

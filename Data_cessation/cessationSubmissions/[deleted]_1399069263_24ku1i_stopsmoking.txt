Day 15... 2 weeks without cigarettes and nicotine

Well... going from a pack (or more) a day smoker for 24 years to a total ex-smoker has proven... interesting.

On the down side, this week I slipped and fell at work and went to the hospital and then home. My back hurts and I've been crabby all week... getting angry with people at work and biting people's heads off.

Despite all that... I haven't smoked.

On the plus side... my breathing and stamina has improved so much my legs literally ache from walking so much. I used to barely walk anywhere because it was so hard and I would feel like I was going to have a heart attack. I guess my thigh and calf muscles aren't used to the work out.

My voice also seems to have begun changing. I used to have that low, rattling, scratchy smokers voice. I noticed today that it's much smoother and even a little higher pitched.

Something odd... for some reason I keep accidentally choking on things. Whether it's a drink, or a little food or even my own saliva. I'm guessing maybe because my breathing was so weak before and for so many years ... now that I'm breathing harder I'm not used to swallowing and taking longer, stronger breaths. So I'm accidentally breathing before I finish swallowing.

Odd shit. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. :)

First time on this sub

Found this sub today, and feel like this is definitely a great site for me, to keep me strong and moving on from the old cigarette smoking days. I have been smoke -free for 13 days, and today had some strong cravings since I am taking a vacation from work and I am bored out of my mind, which is usually when I decide to light one up, I am definitely trying to keep it up, I feel this sub will give me the support I need!

30 days? Are you kidding me, I can't believe it.

I had been a pack a day smoker for a decade, finally decided to give it another real attempt. I totally forgot I had quit until my quit smoking app said I had made it 30 days, I can't fucking believe it, I've never made it past 1 week before.....I never thought this would happen.


edit: I know my flair says 29 days but its wrong. Don't believe everything a flair tells you.

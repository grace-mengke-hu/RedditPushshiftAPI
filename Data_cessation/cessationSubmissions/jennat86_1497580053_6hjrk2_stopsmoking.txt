Passed the 4 day mark... over a drink

So I am not much of a drinker, but when I drink I can go through a full pack in a night.  Had an out of the blue invite to have a drink with friends and proud to say it was one and done with zero cigarettes smoked over  2 hours. Chantix does however really effect my alcohol tolerance, so one was plenty enough.

Know what's better than a cigarette with a drink? Coming home for a buzzed oral hygiene routine. Flossing never felt so good :)

what are your reasons for quitting?

Or what made you quit? I know this is key in staying clean.  

My reasons:
My bf is allergic to smoking. 
I already have enough of a medication addiction,  unwillingly. (Bipolar/anxiety)
My grandfather died from emphysema, my father now has it. 

What made me quit:
I read a blog by a woman who got cancer from smoking. She was in so much pain and wished so hard she had never smoked. Hey life was ended a week before her 40th birthday. I've never read a story that scared me more. I'm 26 and I have night terrors due to my anxiety where I will wake up thinning I was going to die/was dead. It scared me to think it might be true sooner than I'd like.

People used to tell me it’s mind over matter and I never believed them.

Here I am sitting at 4 months and 2 weeks smoke free. 

90% of the people I regularly hang out with smoke. I can sit in the workshop to socialize with them. The smoke actually bugs me immediately the same way smoking too much used to. 
Now I have been tempted multiple times and I know I can easily grab a smoke from my boyfriend but it’s different now. 
I don’t actually want to be a smoker. The temptation has had its moments, but I just don’t want it. I can tell myself no very easily. It is mind over matter and has been since about a month in. 
I actually have friends jokingly get mad at me for being smoke free. I tell them that when they are ready to, they will be able to. I’m around if they want help. No one has taken me up on that offer yet, though.

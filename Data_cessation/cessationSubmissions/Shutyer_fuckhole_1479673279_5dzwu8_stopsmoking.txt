Made it 60 days. Fell of the wagon for a week, now I'm back and ready to focus again!

Went 60 days without a cigarette and then got overconfident thinking I could enjoy one after a party, I was wrong! Started sneaking more and more until I had 5 or 6 while I was out last night. Im stopping this before I get completely hooked again!

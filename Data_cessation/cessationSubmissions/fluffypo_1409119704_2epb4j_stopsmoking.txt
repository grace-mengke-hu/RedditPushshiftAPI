Distract myself by going on a diet!!

Hi everyone, I find it so useful for female smokers to give up smoking.

From yesterday, I started to go on a diet as well as quit smoking. 

What I did yesterday is do some basic heavy training mostly for muscles of arms and leg as well as shaping a well-looking butt.  I did 60 Squats in total ( 15 times per group, and repeated 4 times, the last group I used two 5 pounds dumbbells for strength training ) And I did several other strength traing with other machines under the direction of my boyfriend who is quite familiar with the training methods.

I feel tired for the whole day today,  cuz since I began to smoke, I rarely did the exercises and my body is getting worse.
I'm 170cm in height and 53kg in weight, with the waistline of 61cm, and my plan is to train my body and get some muscle, to be fit rather than slim.

I find it dusgusting to stand beside my boyfriend when he was smoking yesterday night, then I realised that once I began training my body, I will be resistant to the cigarettes.

So, why not have a try, though this is my first day without cigarette, I feel so good. Will keep trying and hope I can quit soon.

At 1m 22days, and the last week has been awful.

Every day I have multiple cravings at the strangest times (even halfway through a 30 minute cycle). I keep on telling myself, I'm only 24, I have plenty of my life left to quit, but I know this period of my life is probably the easiest time to quit.

I have made a list of reasons why I should quit which I look at regularly that makes me reassess whether I really want a cigarette which sometimes helps, but it hasn't been recently. 

What techniques have people been using around the 2 month mark which has helped?

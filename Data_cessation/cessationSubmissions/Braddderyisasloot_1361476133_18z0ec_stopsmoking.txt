Got strep throat, quit smoking. 

I got sick on January 1st with strep throat and I was so sick I couldn't smoke for 2 weeks and bam! After those 2 weeks I just didn't feel like it. I stopped thinking of cigarettes, I threw my pack away, and I haven't looked back. Im grateful I got sick because in the long run it probably saved my life. I am now feeling a lot better throughout the day. Im less winded all the time. Im not coughing constantly. I couldn't be happier!

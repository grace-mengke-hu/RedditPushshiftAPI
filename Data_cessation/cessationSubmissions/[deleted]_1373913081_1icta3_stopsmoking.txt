Day 10. No Drinking and No Smoking

27/M
Cold turkey both the same day. I have to say it hasn't been too bad. I find myself consuming a lot more caffeine but thats a battle for another day. (2-3 energy drinks + 1 lrg coffe /day)

I have dreams of smoking and drinking. I wake up and feel like I have an ashtray mouth and a hangover but moments later I snap out and realize I'm feeling great.

Every day I'm feeling better and everyday I want to relapse. I hold onto the fact feeling better outweighs the quick fix.

Frustrated with myself

I quit smoking on April 20, 2014. I know I made it over the 100 day mark. I moved to a new city in July to start nursing school. I was determined not to bring back my old habit to deal with the stress of adjusting to a new life. I did fine for the first couple of weeks but then I used the excuse of having a rough adjustment period in order to not feel so guilty when I went and bought a pack of cigarettes. I'm pissed at myself for restarting the most difficult to break habit that I have ever formed. I've been telling myself every morning for the last 2 weeks that smoking does nothing to benefit me and that I am going to quit. I miss waking up and not being congested. I miss being able to taste all of the flavors of my food. I hate being completely out of breath when I walk up stairs. I know that I get no benefit from smoking cigarettes but I'm having a hard time flipping the switch this time. When I've quit in the past I've just woken up that morning and decided that that was the day. I want that day to come now.

My most favorite part of quitting so far

Even after only 8 days I love being able to taste and smell things again. Everytime I eat or drink something it's like I'm having it again for the first time. If nothing else, this thouggt keeps cravings at bay. I don't ever want to have food and drinks "muted" ever again. 

Just had this delicious meal that I've had before, but it was likes completely new meal today. I could taste aspects of this fine smoked turkey sandwhich from a bbq joint that I've never tasted before.

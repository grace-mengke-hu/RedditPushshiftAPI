Its a new day

I started on the patch today. I feel better and am not experiencing any withdrawal. I am aware that nicotine is a harmful substance, but just the fact that I am not choking and coughing constantly will be well worth it. I didn't smoke for very long on my last period of smoking, but the fact I did did obvious harm to my body. It gave me an attitude that I wasn't worth taking care of. I was deep in the closet and had to worry about carrying gum, the way I smelled and hiding my smoking from other people. It feels like for the first time in my life that I have an opportunity to be happy. This feels like the first day that I can feel comfortable in my own body. I want it this time. I want to push my quitting time well past 5 years and make it for the rest of my life. I feel so happy to be able to do this now and am motivated to begin exercising and taking care of myself again. How does everyone else feel today? Is it anyone else's quit day?

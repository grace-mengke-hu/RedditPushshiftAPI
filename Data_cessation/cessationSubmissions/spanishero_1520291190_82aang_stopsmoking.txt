My grandfather was diagnosed with lung disease at 82

Hi Guys

I know it could look odd but life is matter. I normally used to like smoking cigarette but the doctor examination last week shook me. I somehow woke up and realized that smoking cigarette cause you a damaged health and broken wallet. Still I could not find what to do with the money that saving of the daily cigarette money. :)

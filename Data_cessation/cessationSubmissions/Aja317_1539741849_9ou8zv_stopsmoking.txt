One week in. Had my first vivid dream last night

And i remember telling my sister i couldnt wait for some freaky shit. 



I take it back so much. Im also experiencing extreme fatigue so the dream went on and on and continued even when i stirred. I couldnt wake myself up.


It wasnt any scary stuff like the boogeyman or anything. It was me. Going into super extreme detail on how i was going to murder someone. Stalking and planning when to strike. I gave them a poisoned lollipop and locked them in a room. 


For some reason and it blows my mind was the scary part - the whole world knew it was me and i was walking from work and i literally remember taking the scenic route and having dna tests sent to me like Aja, spit in here pretty pleaaaase. Never been more frightened in my life and im the most chill will never get into trouble ever boring type of person.


Id love to hear more from you guys and some more vivid dreams you have had.

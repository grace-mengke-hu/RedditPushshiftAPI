Day 10... For some reason I feel to smoke.. :(

Hi fellow non smokers :) can I just thank you for keeping me sane during my quit..  First post here - I'm on day 10 of my quit and for some reason the internal critic has been nagging. I do well in managing day to day my cravings by telling myself I do not need one, as it does nothing for me except make my clothes and hair smell, discolour my teeth etc. But today its like my brain is waiting for that little reason for me to smoke. I did pretty well on friday not to smoke at my departments Xmas party, as I really thought I would cave then as I was drinking. Since then its like my brain is telling me I want to smoke as I've done so well in not smoking for this long... Words of advice would be much appreciated.. Thank you

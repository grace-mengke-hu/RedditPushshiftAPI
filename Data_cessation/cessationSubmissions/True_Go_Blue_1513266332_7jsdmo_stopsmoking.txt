Jut hit a year-completely forgot!

11 years of smoking, now I didn’t even remember my anniversary! 

My life is so much better just in the last year.  I spent more time with friends, family, coworkers, classmates.  

A year ago I would leave the office every 2 hours for 20 min(can’t smoke on campus).  Maybe an hour a day of extra work, not even considering how I would get distracted before leaving as I started to think about my next break.  

I’ve had conversations with people that I never would have been able to have either due to being outside or because I would reek of smoke. I always had the excuse that I had great conversations with people while smoking... there are happier, healthier, and more diverse sets of people everywhere besides who’s outside smoking.  

Saved around $1500 extra and it went right into the 401(k). 

I still keep nicotine gum close by.  I don’t think about smoking much.  However I’m very aware that the addiction can breech again at any moment and I’ll still have a piece here and there. 

Keep up the good fight!  It gets easier and better every day!

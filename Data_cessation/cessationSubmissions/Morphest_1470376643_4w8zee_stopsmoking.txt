Swallowing razor blades

It's been 3 weeks since I smoked and the other day I woke up with a really bad sore throat. I first assumed I was getting an infection as I used to get tonsillitis a few times as a kid. How ever I have no fever symptoms and have heard that quitting can cause a bad throat because your body is getting rid of all the toxins, has anyone else suffered this? If so did it last long? I'm popping throat lozenges like they're going out of fashion.

Helping my Fiancee quit smoking, would like to know what has helped you through your journeys.

Hey all, 
First of all I would like to say big congrats to all those who are in the midst of their own personal battle to quit smoking. By making that decision you are making your life and the lives of those loved ones that are always around you much better.

Now I personally don't smoke, however my fiancee does. 

I was wondering what tips you guys could give to someone who is supporting their significant other through this. 

* What's the most encouraging things I can say or do for her?

* What were the most supportive comments or things people have done for you?

* What are big 'no nos' for people to do or say while you are trying to quit

* When you were at a low point in your journey, what prevented you from picking up that cigarette. 

* During the quitting process were you different to the people you loved? Either good or bad.


I just really want to be there and support her through this


She is really keen on quitting for several reasons:

She has just started her dream job as a qualified nurse; this has given her an opportunity to start a fresh at work. No one knows she smokes and so no one will ask her to come outside for a cigarette with them removing the risk at work.

At home, we live in clustered apartments with several smokers whom we are good friends with. They have decided to all do [Stoptober](https://stoptober.smokefree.nhs.uk/) together which is excellent.


Although I worry slightly that they wont take this as seriously as her, so I see them as a serious weak point for her.

We plan on going travelling soon and settling down and starting a family together in a country we fall in love with the most.

She sees this and me as her forms of motivation.

Your stories on what has helped you so far, or what helped you to quite would be much appreciated! Include your low points and what helped you through them.

Thank you all for your help, and for those of you on the journey through quitting. See you on the other side!

**TL; DR**  Fiancee is quitting smoking using [Stoptober](https://stoptober.smokefree.nhs.uk/) to help. Would really like tips on how to support her through this.

Was I always a terrible bitch, or is the withdrawal talking?

So, Two weeks and a half. YAY! I don't crave cigarettes as much as I used to in the first day. I don't think about cigarettes as much as I used to. Relapsing or "Just one Puff" Isn't really an option in my book. nifty!

Problem - Since the begining of week 2 I've become a terrible bitch. I shout at people, I cuss them quietly and wish horrid things upon them. I'm moody, cranky and prone to short bouts of depression.
Imagine something like hyper PMS.

Usually I'm a perky person, but in the last week or so everything is terrible annoying to me. Is it normal? When should it pass? Is it something I should mention to my pdoc, or is it just a phase? (I'm taking zoloft and klonopin for depression and panic disorder in remission)

Almost slipped but managed to overcome a craving

I was having a nice big lunch and after I finished, a momentary flash of thought popped up in my mind. Buying cigarettes couldn't have been easier. A tobacco shop was a few steps away from me, but I quickly recalled a list of [common relapse triggers](http://www.tobaccofreemaine.org/quit_tobacco/staying_tobacco_free.php#relapse) and said to myself, 'Ok {{ username }}, your willpower is drained by a lack of sleep this week. Let's wait until tomorrow morning when you get enough sleep and think again whether we should smoke that cigarette...'

Worked like a charm. Still smoke-free.

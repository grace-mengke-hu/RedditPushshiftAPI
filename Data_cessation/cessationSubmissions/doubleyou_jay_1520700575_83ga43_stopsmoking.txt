Going out tonight

So I’m on day 18 and going out tonight with friends. Dinner/drinks and then a couple bars. First time really doing this since my quit and super anxious about it. This is when I started back last time I quit. I’m trying to just psyc myself up and tell myself I’m not smoking but there is this little voice in the back on my head that is saying it’s going to have one once I get drunk. I know that’s my addiction talking and at this point I don’t need it but struggling a little. Just needed to get it out there I guess. Going to try to limit my drinking to not lower my inhibitions too much. Most are non smokers so that helps as well.

Day 1

Here we go! My first day as an official non-smoker! Been lying to myself for years that I’m not hooked but after several failed attempts I’m super nervous. One day at a time... It has helped tremendously reading all of your wonderful posts, very inspiring. May your days keep getting easier. Looking forward to positing about my success later

I threw out my nicotine patches last night and wow, the withdrawal is bad today.

I've had such a bad headache for the last couple of hours. At first I thought a coffee would help but no, it's still here.  And don't worry, I won't give in, I will not buy cigarettes or take in any form of nicotine.  I'm simply going to ride it out but damn, it sure makes for an interesting day and so I decided to write about it.

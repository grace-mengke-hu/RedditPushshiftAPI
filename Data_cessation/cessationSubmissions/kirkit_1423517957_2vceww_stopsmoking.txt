I Quit

I used to smoke on and off. When it got stressful I smoke one. I am going through a painful divorce process and this habit of mine got out of control. I smoke 4-5 cigarettes a day now. Recently I got out of my shell and went on a date. Things got moving pretty quickly and on second date I was invited to her place. Well it was all fine until my major went back to sleep after saluting. Also, I've been watching a lot of porn and masturbating recently which combined with cigarettes is a killer for my sex life. 

Anyhow, the chick was pretty understanding and took it in good spirit. But I've decided quit all three at once now: No more porn->masturbation->smoking for me.

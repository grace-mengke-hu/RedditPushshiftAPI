12 Days and Counting

Hello everyone. I'm not new to Reddit; however, I am brand new to this sub. My girlfriend and I have been smokers for the last 15+ years and recently decided to quit together. I think we had both arrived to the final straw because we were tired of being tired and having no energy to operate our days. We started using the Smoke Free app, which in turn, led me here.

Some observations about our progress so far: the first few days were actually relatively easy; probably just because we had arrived at a place to where we had a lot of willpower to not smoke. By day 3 or 4 the headaches started. That has been the most difficult part to cope with, because it happens at random times throughout my workday. We have combatted these by drinking lots of water and getting up (when possible) to walk around for a minute. We're still powering through everything, but the one thing I can say works like a charm is EXERCISE. You'll start to feel your energy levels increase after a few days, so when you get cravings, it helps if you keep your brain active on some other activity. After 10 days, we picked up Fitbits and are now trying to take control of our lives again.

Bottom line - it is totally possible to do this. Just keep at it, and surround yourself with good information and support!

How can you focus on anything while quitting?

I had my last cigarette 4 days ago because of excruciating pain from an infected wisdom tooth that the dentist said smoking would make worse/more likely to come back. I am a student and I am trying to write a dissertation that is in for like a month's time and I can't get anywhere because of this anxious/ragey/angry withdrawal feeling which I presume will not suddenly go away in the next three weeks. I have my finals this year and this all just makes me want to take up smoking again through my exams to help the stress, because smoking is my built-in study breaks and all my friends smoke. How can I get through this without smoking?

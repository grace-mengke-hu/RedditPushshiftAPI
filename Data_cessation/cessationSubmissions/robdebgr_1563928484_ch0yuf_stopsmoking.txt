Hiding in the shadows for too long

Hi clever people, I've been watching you  from afar for a few months now, while I've been going in and out of quitting. 
You have all inspired me and shown me that there's no shame in quitting and we  all have to start somewhere!!! Well today is day 3 of my (don't know how many) ?? Attempts. 
This attempt  is different because now ive put myself out there, joined the community and publicly committed.
I feel stronger this time than ever before and that is because of all of you....so it begins....
3 days and 11 hours old!!!

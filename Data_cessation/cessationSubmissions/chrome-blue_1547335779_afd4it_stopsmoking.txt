I REALLY wanted a cigarette today

I had such an intense craving for a cigarette earlier that I almost caved. But that’s the key word — almost. I realized how awful I would feel if I smoked, so I immediately got busy distracting myself with something else and that helped tremendously. Today is 44 days smoke free for me!

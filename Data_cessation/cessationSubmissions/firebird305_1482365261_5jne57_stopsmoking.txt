Day 3

Just checking in after getting home from work. It's weird driving without smoking. That's really my biggest trigger. I need to clean out all the built up ash and dust from my car.... 
I went to the gym last night and boy am I out of shape. I ate healthy today except for a few holiday cookies I couldn't resist. 
I truly feel that God is helping me quit. I decided to stop smoking when I realized that God's will is for me to be an ex-smoker.

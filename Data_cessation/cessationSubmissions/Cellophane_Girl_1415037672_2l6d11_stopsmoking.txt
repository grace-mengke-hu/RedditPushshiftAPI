Damnit I already screwed up.

So I went one day... not even a whole 24 hours actually and screwed things up already.  I feel like cold turkey from a pack a day isn't going to work for me.  My sister surprised me with 3 packs of cigarettes.  I hadn't told anyone I was quitting and I gave in.  But I have a plan with those three packs. I'm going to cut down half a pack a day on the first pack. 2/3 a pack a day on the 2nd pack and then finally 1/4th a pack a day with the last pack. 

I think that will help me better and give me time to read up more about the affects of smoking on one's body so I have more will power. And who knows if I get an extra push of will power I'll give the remaining cigarettes to my friend that lives down the street. 

I don't feel like a failure. I just feel like I need to reassess my strategy and get back in the fight.  Usually when I fail I just say "fuck it" I'm not gonna try again. But this time I'm going to keep trying. Even though I'll be smoking I'll be controlling myself and using my willpower  to train myself that I really don't need the cigarettes while weaning myself off the nicotine. 

I just needed to get that off my chest and be accountable to someone for what happened.

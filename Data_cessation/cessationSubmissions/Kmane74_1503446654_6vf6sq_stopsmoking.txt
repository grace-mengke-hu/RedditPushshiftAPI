30 Days!

Today marks 30 days on my stop smoking journey. Without any nicotine replacement therapy, I quit cold turkey. I could say that jogging helped a ton I'm surprised after 7 years of smoking I can jog even a mile, although 30 days doesn't sound so long it's a huge accomplishment to me. The only way that I quit smoking before would be in Jail, now I really want to quit. Thanks for reading my post, have a wonderful day!

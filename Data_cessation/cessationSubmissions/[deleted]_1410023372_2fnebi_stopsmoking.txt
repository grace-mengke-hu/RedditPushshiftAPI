Wellbutrin AND nicotine patch

I'm going all out this time... I'm on the nicotine patch and on wellbutrin. Has anyone used this combination? How did it work for you guys?

I read some studies saying this combination has the highest rates of long term quitters.

I also downloaded an app, I'm here frequently to get motivated, and I read Allan Carr's book (I know he advices against NRT's, but I'm not the kind of person who could ever go cold turkey... and most of his advice applies anyway).

Thoughts?

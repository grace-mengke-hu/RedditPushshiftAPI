Quit a 2 months ago, but I relapsed over the last week.

I was going strong until I hit a depressive mood. I bought a pack smoked 2 then threw the rest away. Today I bought another pack smoked three then threw the pack away. I feel worse after every smoke not just emotionally, but physically. My stomach goes into knots and I hate it. The sensation is a reminder as to why I stopped, but sometimes, like this week, the craving break me down. 

What is a solid strategy to overcome the cravings during intense emotional moments?

Day 26 and I finally got to say it: “no thank you, I’m a nonsmoker”

And it felt AWESOME!!!! 

This has actually been the hardest week so far. Started a new thing that is basically the opposite of fun, it’s 12-16 weeks of rage-inducing annoyingness but it’s gotta be done. And anger is not my friend! Nor is grief, and we said goodbye to my brother’s little dog today. But I’m just keeping on keeping on. I’m adopting the position of a passive observer to my cravings: “huh, interesting, a craving. Well, it’ll be gone soon so nothing to stress about.”

But yeah: was asked by my brother today if I wanted to go for a smoke. And I got to say it! I can’t wait to say it again and again! 😁

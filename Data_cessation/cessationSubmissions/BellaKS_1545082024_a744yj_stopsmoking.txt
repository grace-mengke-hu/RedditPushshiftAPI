Anyone here successfully quit WITH bipolar!

Successful in more than 3 month way.

I have bipolar NOS or not otherwise specified. I'm now 10 days quit with wellbutrin and nicotine patches.  Everything was going good.....which also on lamactil and buspar.  (Mood stabilizer and anti anxiety)......basically all forms of messed up lol

Anyway starting  about 2 days ago I started getting really irritable. I figured withdrawal, I'll get through that and I did.

Yesterday SEVERE depression, not just the blues but true depression episode.  The blues don't include hearing yourself think you're worthless, lonely, etc. with your husband right beside you. 

Today was okay at the beginning now I'm manic! I took my meds.  I'm on pins and needles, I can't fully concentrate oh hell I can't concentrate at all, I'm scattered, I'm disorganized, I'm screaming in my head.  I've been off of carbs for 6 months, now I want to eat all carbs everywhere! I want to have sex with 20 people lol no I'm not doing that trust me but it's just my drive right now.

Now I know a lot of people, I've dealt with it in real life chatize me for saying this but smoking helped! I don't want to hear how oh it just realized the stress brought by withdrawal.  It's so funny how for years now, I haven't had this type of rapid cycling every few hours going from depression to okay now manic probably by 6 I'll be okay again.  DO NOT TELL ME THIS IS NORMAL AND THIS WILL PASS!  This is not normal brain functioning.

I'm seriously considering going back to smoking right now and kicking the wellbutrin for a while.

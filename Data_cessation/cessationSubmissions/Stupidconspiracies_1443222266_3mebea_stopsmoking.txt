Reasons for quitting

I did not quit smoking so I could taste food better.
I did not quit smoking so I have a better mood.
I did not quit smoking so I could relax more.
I did not quit smoking so my clothes would smell better. 
I didn't quit smoking to have more energy.
I did not quit smoking so I can save money. 

I post this list so that on days where I'm contimplating smoking again I remember the only reason I quit smoking. 
 
For my future. 
We gain a big old benefit by not smoking. We get our futures back.

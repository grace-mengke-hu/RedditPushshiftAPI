When the heck all I going to stop eating?!

Ok, not really. But my compulsion to eat is 10x than any cigarette craving I've ever had. I am eating healthy ... just find it near impossible to not binge. I just ate an entire head of broccoli! (And bag of dates ... and prunes ... and quite a few almonds ... and a cottage cheese ... And a cucumber ... and a couple small steamed potatoes ... and .... well you get the picture).

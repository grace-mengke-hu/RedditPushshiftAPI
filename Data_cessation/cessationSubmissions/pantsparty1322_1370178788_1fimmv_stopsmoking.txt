Could a sore throat be connected to quitting?

I'm on day 4 and was even able to drink a bottle of wine last night without giving in to my nicotine monster, but I started to notice last night and now this morning that my throat hurts as though I had been chain smoking last night. I've also been coughing the past few days which I've experienced in previous quit attempts and thought it could be my body trying to expel the leftover nicotine/tar...does anyone know if there's a connection?  I could just be getting sick but I rarely get colds so that would be a big coincidence if so.

three false starts, but this ends now.

just wanted to make it reddit official. wanted to quit for a long time now, and it feels right. 
I'm just worried about how it'll affect my relationship, my SO and I have been going through a rough patch, and I get really short tempered and yell-y when I need a smoke. any tips for that?

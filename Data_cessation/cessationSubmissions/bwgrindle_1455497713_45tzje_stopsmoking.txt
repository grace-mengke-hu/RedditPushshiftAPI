Just over 3 weeks without a smoke...

So I've been smoking on and off (mostly on) for nearly 20 years.  I'm getting towards middle aged and I thought about and tried quitting many many times.  Pretty par for the course.

So to sum it all up I made the decision to stop cold turkey.  I've tried to patches and gum etc etc and I always went back.  I had had a terrible cold for over a week and decided that "now" was the time.

So its been over 3 weeks now.  It was pretty rough for the first week but I was getting through it ok.  Not to say that there weren't times I would have killed for a smoke but I managed to push through so far. I've told very few people because I fear a relapse and don't want to look like I failed again.

So I've been doing alright overall but I've been very closeted since I've stopped smoking.  I haven't had the desire to go out and do anything at all. I've not been interested in any of my hobbies (playing music) and I don't want to leave the house. Frankly I think I'm a little depressed.  I know it sounds stupid but I've stopped doing something that I honestly loved to do.  I liked smoking and I miss it.  I know logically that its a terrible decision to make over and over and I don't want to do it again.  

So can anyone give me any advice on getting motivated?  Will this stop and will I get back to normal?  Should I stop being a wimp or what?  

Don't get me wrong, people go through much tougher things but I don't know how to get motivated.

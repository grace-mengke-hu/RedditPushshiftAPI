Just noticed its been 1033 days since I did it Cold Turkey

A few pointers to help you from my experience:

* Don't try to quit when you are in the middle of personal crisis or a down trend in your life. Not that you can't quit it at this point. Smoking would be an easy respite at this time. When i quit I was going through a personal crisis and quitting at that time made my resolve stronger.
* Keep a bottle of water handy for the first few days and sip on it when you feel like lighting a stick. Water is better than Coffee in this case because you don't want to find yourself sipping on 5 cups of Coffee within 1 week of quitting.
* Don't try to make excuses like, "I'll smoke when I drink", "I'll smoke when I travel" etc...It will never work.
* If you have a smoke buddy at work let them know that you've quit so that they don't call you during a smoke break.
* Eat healthy and eat whenever you feel hungry. That is just your appetite coming back to its normal state.
* Use an app like 'Quitnow'. It helps you keep yourself motivated.
* Don't announce it your friends or on social media until it is a month. Motivation should come from within you and the last thing you want to hear is a demotivating statement.
* Don't plan to quit tomorrow. Do it NOW!
* Don't try to go from 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Will never work.

All the best and ask me if you have any query.

Day 1 in a new part of the world, seemed like a good way to do it.

I've recently come to East Asia for study and I've decided to stop smoking as part of my goals for studying abroad. 

My physical withdrawal symptoms from cessation are never too bad(right now my body is just kinda achey and I'm a little tired), just some sleepiness and mild irritability, but my weakness is always the ritualistic smokes, and the cues from social context. But I know very few people here, I've only met one smoker(who just left the country), none of the people I live with are smokers, and I don't really need to be drinking much anyway(another trigger). 

So I have lots of reasons to quit, and a lot of my usual hurdles are absent. Here's to doing it!

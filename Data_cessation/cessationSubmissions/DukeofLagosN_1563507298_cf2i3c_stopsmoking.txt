After 5 Years And, I Smoked My Last Today and Need Help to Fight the Beast.

I have been smoking since 2014. I picked up smoking when I went to live with my cousins. They were all smokers in the house. Ever since then, I have been hooked on cigarettes. Many attempts to quit, longest streak was 5 months, and that was due to the fact that I fell sick with a lung infection.

Since I took up smoking, I have suffered two bouts of pneumonia, bronchitis, and shortness of breath. I have failed to gain any weight (26, 120lbs). I smell unpleasant all the time. I smoke two packs a day. My apartment smells like crap. I waste time smoking instead of working. But the truth is: I am done. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am seriously done.

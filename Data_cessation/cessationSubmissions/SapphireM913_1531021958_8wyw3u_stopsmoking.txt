Boyfriend cheated

I was at 9 days. The longest I'd gone in 11 years. I felt strong, I felt like I was a nonsmoker, I felt like I could pull this off.

Then he cheated on me. I caught him today. Details unnecessary.

I read a thread on here where smoking was that little thing that guy did to harm himself. Something he did because he hated himself and didn't really want to be ok. It struck a chord and set me working on that with my shrink, we had it almost worked out. Then today happened. And my first instinct was still "do something to harm yourself. Do something to shorten your life because living in emotional pain for another 40-50 years is unbearable".

My choices were smoking or something worse. I verged on suicidal again tonight. I chose smoking.

I guess I wasn't ready for emotional turmoil.

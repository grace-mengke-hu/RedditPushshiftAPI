Day 4 no nicotine and feel amazing!

Hey guys, just following up with my previous post. I’m on day 4 without my juul and I feel AMAZING (back story: heavy vaper, 1 juul pod a day which = 1 pack of cigs in nic) 

Everyone experiences the withdrawal period differently, but for me, my hardest days were 1 &amp; 2. I actually broke down and cried the first two days and was completely miserable. I didn’t see an end in sight. But I kept going.

Now on day 4, I woke up with a smile on my face this morning. I feel better physically, emotionally, and mentally. My dependence on nicotine weakens every single day, and soon it will be nonexistent. I’m getting my life back. 

If you’re struggling, just know it gets so much better. Every day that you push through without nicotine is one day closer to your new life - Your freedom. 

Stay strong!

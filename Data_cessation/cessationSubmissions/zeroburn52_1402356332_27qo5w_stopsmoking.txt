101 days!!!

I made it to day 100 and didn't even notice. Haha. Thanks again to everyone who continues to post here. I think little else helped me to quit more than knowing there were other people out there struggling just as much as myself. If you're new to the subreddit, welcome and I hope you find the resources here as helpful as I have.

Day 200, here I come.

Three colds in two months since I quit... Is it correlated?

I quit seriously about two to three months ago. Had one social cigarette that I didn't even enjoy (hence my counter) but that's it.

For the first time I actually don't miss cigarettes... Which is great!

However I've had three colds in two months since I quit. They were really strong (one got me bedridden for an entire week) and yet I was almost never sick before in my life.

I've heard of the infamous quitter's flu obviously and how you can become sick when the body cleanses itself but... Isn't it weird that it's now happening so often to me?

Earlier I came back from work and since then I've been feeling SO weak and my throat hurts a lot. I'm also having small gag reflexes like what cigarettes would do to me sometimes.

I wasn't even a huge smoker at all. So yeah. Is it correlated to quitting cigarettes or should I worry and see a doctor? It really sucks feeling so weak when I'm actually living an healthier life...

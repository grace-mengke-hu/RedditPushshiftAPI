72 hours without nicotine

Feeling pretty good.

Had a few too many drinks last night and didn´t smoke. When a craving comes, I just visualize my nicotine monster and realize that "I" don´t want a cigarette, only "it" needs one to sustain its life. Makes the whole process quite easy and comfortable.
Pretty happy!

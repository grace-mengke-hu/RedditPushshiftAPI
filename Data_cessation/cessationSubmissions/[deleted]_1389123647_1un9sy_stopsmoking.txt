For the relapsers

**I am not suggesting to relapse! But if you do....**

Catch it quick. I was at 60+days and was feeling great until I decided to try "just one" and then another and another and ended up getting addicted again and up to a pack or more a day. 

Luckily, I recommitted after 2.5 weeks and this second requit is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much easier than the first time. I think a huge part of it is that I spent a few months as a non smoker and dissolved a lot of mental and pure habit triggers.  


But I think that if I had waited any longer and smoked for longer, I would've been back to square one.  


Don't do it. That feeling of being addicted again is the worst feeling ever. 

Ifeel so proud and lucky to be free again and a real non smoker! :-)

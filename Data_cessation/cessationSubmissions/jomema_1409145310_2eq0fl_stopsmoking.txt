New badge!

I'm not afraid to say that I'm proud of myself. I'm happy with my choice and I'm already seeing the health benefits of quitting. I ride my bike to work everyday. Yesterday was the most enjoyable bike ride so far. No shortness of breath, I could go faster, and I made the Pillsbury Hill my bitch on the ride home!

Thank you reddit for the help, resources and everyone's kind words and support so far.

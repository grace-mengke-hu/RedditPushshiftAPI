Is it worth reading 'Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking' having not had a cigarette for a long amount of time?

Hello!

I am writing this at 130 days without a smoke, yet I still get pangs every few days/hours, depending on current stress levels, where I feel that a smoke would help immensely. I know that I am not going to give in just yet, but it is annoying becoming consumed by a thought that I do not wish to have. 

I have been saving the book  just incase I do slip up again. Before this attempt, I got to 98 days and was put into a situation that I could not deal with and felt the need to start smoking again. I know it is easy to slip up, and the idea that I have a safety net incase I do is comforting.

The book suggests that you carry on smoking as you read it, yet this is obviously not something I would do when reading. Will it be effective at 4 months + of not smoking, or should I just ride it out for a bit?

Thanks for reading.

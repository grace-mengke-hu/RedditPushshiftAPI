On Day 4 and struggling

I have smoked for 30+ years and am on day 4 of quitting cold turkey.  I am miserable, emotional and constant cravings.  I think about smoking all day and have turned to reading these posts to try and help me through this.  I do not want to give in and be defeated but much of my life has been as a smoker and I am having a hard time adjusting to life without cigarettes.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

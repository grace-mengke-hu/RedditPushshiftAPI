One week! Today sucked and I would have loved a cigarette (still would) but didn't smoke!

I took my cat to the vet this morning. I don't drive, so it takes a while to get there. Today, we walked a bit, then we got on a light rail, then we waited, then we took a bus, then we walked some more. That was exhausting in and of itself. Then I had to leave her at the vet for a bit. I went out for breakfast, walked around, visited a friend, and then went back to pick up my cat. Then we missed the bus, so we went to a bar and I got a beer while we waited for the next bus. Then, when we were on the bus, my cat decided she just had to poop right then and there, in her carrier, so we got off the bus. I called a friend who lived nearby and we walked over there and I cleaned everything up. Then (bless his heart) my friend drove us home. Holy shit. Today sucked. But I didn't smoke. It's been over a week since my last cigarette. I still want one. But it wouldn't fix anything. So, yay. :)

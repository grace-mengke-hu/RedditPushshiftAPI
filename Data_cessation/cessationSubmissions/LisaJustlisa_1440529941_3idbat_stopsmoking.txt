I quit Smoking!

I quit smoking in may, after trying for several years with patches, cold turkey, gum to quit smoking after a 30+ year habit I have quit.It is sometimes sad to think I turned my back on my old friend of 30+ years but i seriously can't even stand the way cigarettes smell let alone taste.
My setup is an Atlantis v2 Tank and an Innokin Coolfire IV. I am currently vaping Lenola Cream by Kite in Cloud. 
Thanks for letting me share here!

I've decided. I'm quitting and I'm quitting for good.

I've been smoking since I was 11, am now 23. I've started to take working out more seriously, and I've felt how much the smoking is affecting me. My doctor has also told me that my heart rate is way too high for someone my age and I might have to switch birth control if it doesn't go down. I've just decided now, once and for all, that I'm done. I know it's going to be hard and I'm not going cold turkey. First things first, I've downloaded a quit smoking app that will tell me when I'm allowed to smoke, and will decrese the number of cigs I'm allowed during a day over the course of two months, until I'm hopefully smoke free. Might want to decrese the time period to one month, since I'm just feeling super confident. 

Just found this community, and since all my friends and most of my family smokes, I felt the need for more support. Hope you guys can help me keep my confidence. 

What are your best tips/tricks? Do you have any apps that you recommend? How did you guys do it? I wanna know more so I can be prepared for D day.

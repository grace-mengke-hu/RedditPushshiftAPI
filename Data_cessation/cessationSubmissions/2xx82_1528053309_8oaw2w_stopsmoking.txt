LSD and quitting smoking

I believe it's a common experience among smokers who have used LSD that while you're tripping, the act of smoking is laid bare, stripped of most of its allure and kind of disgusting. This has happened to me on many trips, and the last trip I did, I was smoking by the campfire and painfully aware of how strange smoking is and how viciously ensnared I was by the addiction. But it was also plain as day that there was a way out.

I simply threw the cigarette I was smoking as well as the rest of my pack into the fire and didn't smoke again for four months. It was far and away the longest quit attempt in my twelve years of smoking, and it was honestly incredibly easy. 

Not to put it on a pedestal, but when you're on acid you realize certain things about yourself; it allows you a peek behind the curtain. If you take these realizations into daily life they can be incredibly useful. But as the memory of the trip wears off you have to keep reminding yourself of what you learned because it starts to become a bit unreal and distant. Things don't just click the way they did during the trip and in the days after. This happened to me and long after I started spending entire multiple days without cravings, I smoked "just one" at a party and here I am six months later still smoking.

Has LSD helped anyone else quit? I've been thinking about going on another trip and seeing what comes up, but as always it's best to go into it with no expectations of where it will lead you.

Why?

Hi, I'm 19yo and I smoke for nearly two years now, but not that much (2 cigarettes a day) and I just don't know why should I quit since it give me a break for a looong day and i control the shit(I can live for two weeks without it) besides it can't really hurt me(i think) so will any one give me a reason why I SHOULD QUIT!

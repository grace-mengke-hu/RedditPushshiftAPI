It's time to stop.

I am constantly spending just a little bit more than what I make but I just realized cigarettes are my second biggest expense. I smoke about a pack a day. It's a bit more than $7 so I'll just set it at $8 a day. $8X7 is $56 a week. $56X4 is $224 a month in a year that is $2688. I've been smoking for a bit over 5 years. Which comes out to $13,440. 

That isn't an exact number because there have been weeks that I haven't had a cigarette since I started, but up against how much I have it really is a negligible amount. My math isn't perfect, but it does still suggest that I have spent about a years worth of wages for 5 years of smoking. 

When I think about it it isn't even something I really enjoy. I mean I love the smoke break and gathering around a spot and talking to the same people every day, but the actual smoking part of it is just what makes me feel normal, not good. I shouldn't have to spend $200 just to be at a baseline feeling. And I know after a week or so I will feel normal anyway without a smoke. 

It used to be that I had a shitty job that caused a ton of stress and I would smoke as a coping mechanism. A little over a year ago I got a new job and started only working the stressful job once or twice a week. Earlier this year I finally decided to completely let go of the old job and focus everything on the new job. Work can be extremely boring at times now, but pretty much the only thing that ever stresses me out anymore is not having a cigarette. That's unacceptable, we are not meant to worry about stuff. Especially something so small. As I was writing this out I was smoking what is hopefully my last cigarette. It's done now and I don't want to spend my money on it anymore. I want to finally be able to have money left over at the end of the month.

Day 3 - Did I quit nicotine or crack?

OK, I'm still a few hours short of day 3 but I feel like shit. I am still at work (where I cannot smoke) and yesterday the day went by really fast, but today is dragging so much that I'm starting to get scared about what I may do after leaving. Yesterday I had awful cravings when I left the office but nothing compared to what I'm feeling now. I'm nauseous, dizzy, sweating cold, my head feels heavy, my chest is tight, and I feel like I could throw up any minute now. My whole body just wants to lay down and curl up in a ball of misery. 

I honestly don't know if it's the withdrawal, come to think of it. I didn't sleep so good last night and I had several teas in the afternoon and a coffee half an hour ago. Maybe it's my body reacting different to the caffeine, I heard that can happen. Anyway, I don't know, I just wanted to get this off my chest and maybe hear some words of advice. I knew it was going to be tough but I was definitely not expecting to feel so bad so quickly.

On a positive note: it's been almost 72 hours since my last cig, the last traces of nicotine should be out of my system tomorrow morning. I guess the sooner I feel like crap the sooner I get to feel better.

I'll be here for another hour and I promise to update when I get home. Looking forward to hearing your input.

edit: Got home, everything is fine now. I drank some juice like Louisdenominator suggested and I was already feeling a lot better leaving the office. The trip home was actually better than yesterday, many less cravings and I actually enjoyed the bus ride for a bit. Thank you ALL for your support. This truly is the best subreddit I've seen

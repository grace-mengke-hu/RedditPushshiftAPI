Day 13.

So my job has been increasingly busy over the past few weeks (ironically, started getting crazy here around the same time I quit smoking), and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.

Between suppliers that I have to deal with being out of stock on items that customers demand in a matter of days, or the same suppliers shipping what they do have to the wrong locations, I still have not smoked. Regardless of this stress from all fronts, customers yelling, bosses yelling, etc... I still have not smoked. I haven't even wanted to for that matter with all of this.... until this morning when my wife called me at work to tell me she was fired from her job earlier this morning. This was the first time in 13 days I've wanted a smoke, but here's the thing.... I STILL HAVEN'T SMOKED.

Some people think quitting smoking is tough, but it's not. Here I sit at this job in the 7th circle of hell, with a $500 income tax bill due in 6 days, no emergency fund, a car that needs some repairs, debt out the wazoo and now being awarded the position of sole financial provider for my family of 4. If stress was ever a reason to smoke, I'd say I'd have reason... but I don't actually. I never had a reason to start smoking, and regardless of the crappy hand of cards that life dealt me currently, I don't have any reason to start again.

Despite the situation, I'm focusing on how proud I am of myself for not entertaining that idea of "boy today sucks, I should smoke", because it's not like that would make the situation any better. Not smoking today is my little ray of light on this cloudy day. Not smoking today is me in a raft with no paddles, going down the violent rapids of life, only to stand at the front of the boat with a grin on my face, saying "Bring it." 

I'm proud of me, and you should be too because I'm proud of you.

Done For Good!!!

I smoked a pack and a half a day for almost 10 years. I attempted to quit multiple times. Patch, gum, pure willpower. I even posted in this subreddit over year ago to get encouragement. Nothing worked. Closest I got was replacing with e-cigs. Well, some random post about smoking from a random subreddit a few weeks ago had a comment talking about a book that helped them quit. I thought "Well i haven't tried reading a book to help quit. What heck, Ill give it a go." The book is Easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. I'm sure you guys have heard this a million times, but this book changed everything for me. Quitting for me was super easy. No withdrawals, no urge to smoke, no irritable temper. I thought about it all the time, still do. But that book prepared me for it. I went in thinking "reading a book cant hurt, the worse that can happen is nothing changes." But it did change the way I think about smoking. I highly highly recommend reading that book. Its been about 2 and a half weeks and it feels amazing. :) Thanks for reading :)

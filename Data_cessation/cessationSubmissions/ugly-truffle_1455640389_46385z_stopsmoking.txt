Almost 2 months

...and all of a sudden it's a problem for some reason. All last night and this morning I've wanted a smoke. Not gonna let it happen - my sleep and mood have been way better since quitting, I haven't got sick as often, and I've been able to run at the gym for the first time since high school.

After the first few weeks stopping got pretty easy and it sucks realizing I'll probably feel like this off and on for a long time. Oh well...time to break out the cinnamon gum.

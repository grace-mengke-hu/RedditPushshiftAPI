Is vaping to help with urges still considered quitting? Just curious about a "quitter's" thoughts...

16 year smoker, and hadn't gone more than 3 days without a cigarette before this last attempt. I've not had a cigarette in 24 days, however, I have had a little vape that I take a few puffs on when I feel the urge to smoke. It has gotten me through a few rough patches without having an analogue cigarette when in the past under similar circumstances, I have. I'd love to say I haven't had a cigarette in 24days, but I feel like that's kind of cheating. And my boyfriend (who smokes) is saying it's the same thing as smoking, robbing me again of my triumph. I feel conflicted and I know if I get rid of my vape, I'll go straight to the cigarette when I feel weak, and I want to feel good about what I've accomplished.

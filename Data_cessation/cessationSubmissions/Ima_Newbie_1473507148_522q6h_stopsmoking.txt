That lil STAR, signifying One Month!

Wow, I can't believe I've made it 30 days/1 month already! A huge shout-out to this subreddit... so many times in the early days I was wrestling the Nicotine demon and came here to commiserate and seek advise. This big virtual support group gave me so many resources to keep my antsy mind busy, and so much motivation and belief in myself.

Thanks, guys and gals! It's so, so nice to be free. To ride on a trip in the car with someone without plotting my next cig break. To sit and watch Netflix without wanting to impose a pause on someone. To see my funds grow with extra cash. To see my stamina increase. To feel calm an relaxed... 

So glad I found you folks!

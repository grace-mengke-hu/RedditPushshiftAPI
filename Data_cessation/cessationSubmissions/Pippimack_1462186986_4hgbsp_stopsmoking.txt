Discovered vaping is SOOO much better than smoking!

I stopped smoking just cold turkey a couple of weeks ago and it's been great. But I got to about day 4 and remembered the tricks my mind has played on me before to get me to start smoking again. So I went to my local vape lounge and got myself a sub-ohm vape! It's so cool! Zero nicotine (I guessed I wasn't actually addicted to the nicotine anyway as I was already 4 days into my quit), but it's just like smoking, only it doesn't stink, kill me or cost me loads of money - plus I can do it indoors! It's one of the ones that blows serious clouds and allows you to do cool smoke/vape tricks with it. It's almost like a whole new thing to smoking and it's so much better!

I love gadgets and I love smoking - so vaping is the perfect arrangement for me!

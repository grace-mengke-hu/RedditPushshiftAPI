Day 20. Feeling very good!

Hi everyone! It has been 20 days, an believe, the first week was not easy at all but know I feel much better. So, I decided to stop by an let you guys know about some little things that made a difference for me, maybe this helps someone else.

1. If you feel a craving, sit down, relax and just let it pass.
2. Going to the gym everyday
3. Cooking something nice when I feel like I have nothing to do
4. For me smoking was a way of killing time so now, instead of killing time I do something from my to-do list
5. Download an app that keeps track of the good stuff, I use Somke Free

We'll, I hope this helps. Keep going, it's just an idea you have to get out of your system!!

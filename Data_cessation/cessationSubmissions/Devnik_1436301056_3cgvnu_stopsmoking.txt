Let's do this (again), for real.

I've tried to quit about 4 times now. The shortest attempt lasting 5 weeks and the longest 5 months. I've been a smoker since I was 17, I'm 24 now. So that's about 7 years by now.

About 3 years ago I developed a severe anxiety disorder which I'm still battling today. I'm hoping quitting smoking will introduce more relaxation into my everyday life.

Wish me luck. Smoking sucks.

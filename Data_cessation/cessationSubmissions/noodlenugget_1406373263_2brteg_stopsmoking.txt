Return of the killer taste buds...

We all know by now that our taste will or has returned, but... Has it come back stronger in any one certain "range" for anyone else? My taste buds seems a lot more sensitive to bitter tastes now. I almost don't like drinking beer anymore because it tastes bitter to me. Anyone else get this?

This is attempt 7, lucky number 7!

Over the past year I quit, eat like crazy to help with quitting, crack and smoke, repeat x 6. 

I am now about 20kg heavier, rarely exercise due to smoking, and have atrocious diet.

I took a good hard look in the mirror and realised I'm not just a little curvy, I'm not just a little unfit. I have become actually unhealthily overweight and am in real danger of dying from a smoking related disease. And I did it to myself. 

On hour 55, loving my smoke free app that is helping so much with the craving advice and the mantra - not one more puff no matter what! That has been my downfall, one here, one there, then boom back to smoking. No more my friends, no more!!!

Loving reading this forum when a bad craving hits. It's helping.

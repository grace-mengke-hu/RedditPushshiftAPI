One week rant: I'm dying inside.

I can't mark anything anymore. If I finish eating, i can't mark it, can't mark my homework being done or the day beginning and ending. 


Driving doesn't even make sense, how can I enjoy it if I'm not smoking? I can do nothing if I'm mad or frustrated, especially at work. And I will just look lazy if i decide to sit down for five minutes at work now. It also removes any excuse to talk to friends at work. 


I keep coming so close to smoking, because "it would just be one," but i know that's a lie I'm telling myself. I haven't smoked in a week, but mentally, I'm telling myself i can smoke if I really want to, i even have an unopened pack on the coffee table. There's nothing stopping me from smoking, and there'd be no punishment, but I'm just choosing not to. 



I'm putting off doing the dishes. I let them pile up in a depressive episode, and when that happens, smoking always helps as a reward for getting them done, or as relief in breaking it up. Cleaning in general is going to be a giant pain without my cigarettes. 


I can't wait til i see any rewards. I don't recall when I saw them last time i quit. I dont even remember what felt different.

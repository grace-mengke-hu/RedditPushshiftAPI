Quitting for Fathers Day

Been struggling with smoking forever. Pack a day / 20 years now (\*jeez\*). My badge is off since I last made a hard attempt to quit and it's time to do it for real. I thought about how to motivate myself this time around and thought what would be a better fathers day gift for my dad than my 30 day smoke free badge.   


He's asked me, begged me, to quit for years. He quit drinking for us, I should be able to quit this for him (and me).  


Posting this here to hold myself accountable. May 16th - June 16th, June 16th to Forever.

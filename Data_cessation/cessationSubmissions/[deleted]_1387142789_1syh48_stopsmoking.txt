When do I not feel sick? :-(

Congested beyond belief. I feel sick as a dog, and have been for over 24 hours now. Which is just strange for me, I never get sick. The last time I had an actual illness was like October of 2012. It's my understanding that quitting cigarettes usually means some kind of sickness? I don't know how true that is, but it just sucks! I can breathe clearly through my mouth, my cough has subsided almost entirely, but my head and nose feel like they're going to explode! :-(

Anyone have a similar experience? I'll take being sick for a year before I smoke again. But since I'm so used to not being sick (seriously it's very rare for me>.<), I don't know how to make myself... Not sick. I don't know how to kill a cold, and a weakened immune system is a really, really bad thing for the job I work; it means I can catch something much, much worse. (Nonemergency medical transport).

Tl;dr - I'm sick, I'm **never** sick. :-( Dunno how to fix it. Any similar experiences? How long did the sickly feeling last for you?

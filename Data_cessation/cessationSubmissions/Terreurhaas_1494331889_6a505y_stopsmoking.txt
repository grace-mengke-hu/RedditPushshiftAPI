Day 2, it's getting tough keeping my head sorted.

As most of you know, the nicotine should be out of my system by now. I'm on my way to recovering from the damages I have done to myself yet again.

It's getting harder and harder to keep my head sorted. Every few minutes I lose interest in what I'm doing, and start to think about having a smoke. It's both a blessing and a curse that I'm broke at the moment.

Coincidentally today is also an exercise day! Heading to the gym at 1600 hours local time. Just two hours of distraction is all I need now!

We got this!

Stay strong fellow 7th of May quitters!

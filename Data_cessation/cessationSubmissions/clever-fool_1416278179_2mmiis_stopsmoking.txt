Slipped around day 100. Really disappointed in myself. Hoping for some advice.

Its been a real struggle since I moved to my college town, and I finally gave in. I don't have friends, and smokers always seem the most friendly. I want to be around these people, I want to relax and enjoy the pleasure of smoking and company, but I know I shouldn't. Now my stress levels have been perpetuated by smoking and the college life...

Should I throw out my pack and call it quits now, or should I finish my pack and try again after a small break (when I feel ready again)?

Quitting Smoking

Hey guys, it's been around half a week since I smoked my last one.  I admit I've been wanting to find "relief" a lot since I quit.  During stressful times from work, or even days off and I want to relax, I keep thinking about cigarettes.  I even bought a pack last night, and just sat outside staring at it.

It's been really hard to keep this going.  I always used to wonder why people needed support groups for anything, but I understand now that you don't need to go through things alone.  Only a few of my friends knew that I smoked in the first place, so it was a pretty decently kept secret and now that I'm trying to quit, I don't have that many people to turn to for help/support.

But I just want to say I'm glad that you guys have this community to help each other out.  If I didn't sort out my thoughts here, I probably would've ended up lighting one up before going to bed.  I know it's not going to get much easier, but I know it will be worth it.

Let's do this together, you're not alone.

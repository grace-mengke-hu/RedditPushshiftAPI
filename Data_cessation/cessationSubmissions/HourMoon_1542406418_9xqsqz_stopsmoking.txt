Day 10: White Strips!

Hello Folks!  


I just joined reddit to be a part of the r/stopsmoking forum. I am 22 years old and have been smoking since I was twelve, haven't missed a day! I finally quit impulsively 10 days ago.

Today, I came up with a cool idea I wanted to share with the community.

I was thinking about how Joel Spitzer comments on how it's important to make as many incentives as possible for yourself to NOT smoke. Today, I bought white strips for my teeth because...

1. It is not good to smoke while using them because there will be minimal results.
2. It's a financial investment therefore makes smoking seem more unreasonable since money was already placed on something that is contrary to it
3. It shows daily physical improvement while quitting smoking which can add to confidence!
4. The process takes 2 weeks, so thats a whole 2 weeks of having a practical reason to not smoke.

Has anyone else tried this?  
I am trying to come up more random incentives like this one. Has anyone else come up with any? I will update this posts with my results.

Good luck everyone!

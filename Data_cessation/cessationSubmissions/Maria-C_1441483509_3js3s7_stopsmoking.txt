If you're worried about your first trip smoke-free...

When I first quit smoking I admit I was most concerned with how I would survive vacations and holidays. Would they ever be as enjoyable again?

I just went on a five day camping trip with a mix of caution and trepidation, but quickly found out there was no need to worry. 

Yes, there were many possible triggers: the 7 hour car drive, drinking around the campfire, hiking, amazing views of the mountains, star-gazing at night, and, well every single other moment, because ordinarily it’s a trip I would have puffed the entire way through.

But damn, it was sooooooooooo awesome without smoking. I didn’t want one the entire trip! I loved the fact that I did all of that and more and never needed to smoke, never needed to stop to buy ciggs, never felt breathless on our hikes, didn’t wake up tried and drained. 

The funny part is that my boyfriend still smokes and he smoked the whole trip. We went on the exact same trip, and did the exact same things. Was his trip better than mine? Where the views more majestic? The night stars more poignant? Hell no!!! We had the exact same experience, except I’m not trapped by a vile addiction. 

I just wanted to share, not to rub it in anyone’s face, but because I’ve seen some posts on here lately from people who are still discouraged that they still want to smoke. By and large the addiction slowly disappears, and there are more and more benefits to reap with every passing day. 

Look forward to your first trip smoke-free, it will be wonderful!

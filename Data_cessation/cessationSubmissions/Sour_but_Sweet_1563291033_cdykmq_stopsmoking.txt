Chest Pains

This might sound bonkers -- but has anyone encountered chest pains as a withdrawal symptom?

I had laser treatment/therapy for the third time on Saturday (it's a sort of acupuncture to assist with stopping) and haven't had a cigarette or any nicotine since Saturday at noon, so going into 3 full days in a couple hours.

However, since early last night, I've had sharp chest pains when breathing (upper left side, above my breast).

I should note --&gt; It's NOT a heart attack (I would run to the hospital if it were, not sit here and ask for advice on social media). It's emotional stress induced ischemia &amp; angina.

 I'm a 40 year old female with chronic stress/anxiety and have had chest pains in the past as well, for many years, due to stress - however, they usually subside after half an hour or an hour.

Last night, this pain lasted until I fell asleep (a good 3-4 hours) and now it's started at work again (1 hour or so).

Anyone experience the same symptoms?

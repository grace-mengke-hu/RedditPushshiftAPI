Here I go AGAIN. Super-original, I know.

So I'm not even going to go into how many times I've tried and failed to quit, but I'm hoping the combination of this and the strategies of r/theXeffect will make this THE time.

I mainly just feel bad because my boyfriend and I both quit for a few months a couple of years ago, and then I HAD to have a cigarette after watching a football game and started him smoking again. Now he's back up to like half a pack a day, that I know of. I don't smoke much, less than one a day, but it's time to make that none, because maybe that'll make it easier for him to quit altogether. 

Here goes nothing!

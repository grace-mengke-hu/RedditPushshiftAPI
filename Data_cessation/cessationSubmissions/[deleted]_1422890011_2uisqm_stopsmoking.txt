StopSmoking Buddy

Hello all, I thought of an idea that might aid me in quitting - buddying up with someone who is also on the same journey. I have been smoking for 5+ years and am currently fighting hard against cravings. If anyone would be interested in a pen-pal type format that could potentially be mutually beneficial, or if others want to use this post as a place to find their own buddy, feel free to get in touch or comment here!
Thanks

Almost ready

I quit drinking a bit under a month ago, and I think that smoking is the next thing I want to tackle.  Since I stopped drinking alcohol, I'm sleeping better, eating better, and overall I'm happier and feel healthier.  Now that I'm committed to living a healthier life, I'm looking forward to being free from tobacco.

I know this is going to be hard, but I've done other hard things before.  For years, I didn't think I could function without alcohol, and quitting was easier than I expected.  What do you folks recommend?

I currently smoke about a pack a day, and have for about 16 years.  That feels like a long time, and I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't stopped yet.  I smoke when I want to take a break from work, after meals, or when I want to spend time alone (my girlfriend doesn't smoke, so when I do she tends to give me space).  

I enjoy smoking, but I don't like the idea of being dependent on something so unhealthy.  Saving money and smelling better will be a bonus.  

Are there any tips or books you folks recommend?  Thanks.

Update : Day 55+

Cravings still there but for a much shorter span , nothing a deep breath could not help. 

The only issue I’m facing is lack of motivation/less ability to focus. 

Used to be really hardworking and will complete a task on hand in time, able to concentrate well. 

And nowadays I’m feeling less interested, concentration level has dropped as well. 

Wondering if there’s anything I could do that would help. Maybe supplements? Thanks

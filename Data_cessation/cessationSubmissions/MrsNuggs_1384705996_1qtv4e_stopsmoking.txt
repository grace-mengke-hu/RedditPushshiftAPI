90 days. Awesome, but bittersweet.

I'm very proud of myself, but I wish I had really done it on my own. I feel like the only reason I quit was because I experienced a medical emergency. I wish I had been strong enough to do it long before it came to that. It's also upsetting to think about how long it's been since I quit because that also marks how long it's been since my troubles started. 

I smoked my last cigarette as I drove myself to the ER. All day I felt weird, with symptoms of numbness and weakness on my right side. All day I was having an internal struggle. I'm having a stroke. No way, I'm too young. I know people who were younger than me when they had strokes. This can't really be happening. When my handwriting suddenly went bad I couldn't deny it anymore. I called someone into work to cover for me, then drove to the ER. I smoked while I drove to the hospital because I figured it would be my last one. 

The next day the docs said I had a small stroke. Not a mini stroke, but a minor stroke. Fast forward a couple of months. I'm feeling better. I'm healing. Things are getting back to normal, but I've changed some things about my lifestyle. 

Then my symptoms come back. I went back to the ER. My new MRI showed things happening on both sides of my brain. The docs order so many tests. I finally get an answer. I never had a stroke. I have MS. 

This has been such an emotional roller coaster, and I have no idea when this ride will end. Today I am happy and sad. I am proud and ashamed. At least I know that I won't be smoking. That is something good I got out of this, and I won't lose that.

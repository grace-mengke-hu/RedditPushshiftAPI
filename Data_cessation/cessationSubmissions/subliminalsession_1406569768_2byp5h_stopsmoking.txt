something bad happened

i haven't relapsed... yet. but one of the many reasons i quit was because of strange health problems i had when i was a smoker, that i had to pin on smoking - i used to get this awful sleep paralysis, where i'd be paralysed asleep, and then all of a sudden my heart would be beating at a million beats per minute and my ears would have this massive ringing and it would just feel like i was going to die/my head would explode. my doctor said it was harmless hypnogogic auditory sleep problems, 'exploding head syndrome' / caused by stress, advised me to do a few things, including not smoke... 

anyway. seven weeks down the cold turkey, non-smoking line, with no problems in my sleep at all and felt healthier than ever... and i had exploding head syndrome last night. this has made me feel awful. i don't know how it looks on paper on here but this sleeping problem terrified me, put me off sleep, made me feel like i was due a heart attack or a stroke or something, and as soon as i quit smoking it went away, and so i feel like my motivation to quit was inspired by the sleeping problems stopping. if it's coming back, i'm already losing the motivation to not smoke. i'm also really worried it's gonna happen again etc. 

it's really difficult to not smoke after all this, as suddenly i feel stressed and hopeless :( need some motivational words of wisdom from you wise wise redditors please.

Day 9 and my neighbors are assholes...I'm trying not to break!

Help me! For two freaking months I've been dealing with neighbors from hell but it gets better, a pair of neighbors from hell! Neighbors below me and neighbors next to me. For two goddamned months I've been dealing with their incessant loud obnoxious noises! Loud tv's, loud guest, banging and crashing, screaming, loud sex noises, loud singing! I'm done for two months I'm sitting here trying not to cry, trying to hold myself up high and not smoke. I'm being bullied by my neighbors and I don't know what to do! I've called and complained so many times I'm tired and stressed from complaining, I use a fan on high for white noise, they are louder then that, they are louder then my fan on high and me watching Netflix with head phones on, noise canceling headphones! 

I'm losing my sanity! I'm on day 9 and I've never wanted a cig so bad in my life, I know it'll be gross, I know it'll be bad, I know it's a crutch, I've read Carrs book, I know, but it's either smoke or cry and I'm at work. I'm getting home and doing my taxes and praying I get enough back to move.

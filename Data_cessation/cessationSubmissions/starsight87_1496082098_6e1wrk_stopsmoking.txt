24 Days - A little over three weeks under my belt

I have been quiet for the last few days. Been getting outdoors more and more each day and just decided to get comfortable with not needing to count the number each day. 

I still come here or look on my phone when I need a reminder but I want to take the time I have been given and continue to apply it towards my health. So, I will continue to focus on my running and start my weight lifting program. 

It has been a long time since I have successfully worked on a strength building program but I have overcome one challenge and I am excited by the possibilities ahead. 

Thanks everyone and see you all in a few days.

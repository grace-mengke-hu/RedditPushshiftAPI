starting day 4

The last 3 mornings have been rough.
Today doesn't seem as bad.
Yesterday afternoon I was drinking an ice cold Dr. Pepper and 
my brain really started to screw with me. My brain was telling me to hop in the car and go buy a pack. That lasted for about 10 minutes.
I'm discovering all kinds of triggers, but I'm fighting them off.
I won't buy any or bum any today. 
I'm a non smoker!!

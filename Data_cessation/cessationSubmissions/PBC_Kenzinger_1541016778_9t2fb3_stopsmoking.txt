Two years today

Quit on Halloween 2016 after 25 years of pack a day smoking.

I smoked my entire adult life into my early 40s. It wasn’t just a thing I did, it was a huge part of my identity and all my habits. 

I can’t say the first few days weren’t hard but in hindsight quitting was actually a lot easier than I expected. It is also extremely freeing to not have to constantly buy cigarettes and worry about where and when I cane smoke like a slave all the time.

I also took up running and dropped almost 20 pounds. I feel great. 

Trust me if I could do it you absolutely can too.

That's it I need to quit

I hit a low today. I water logged the rest of my pack of cigs after I realized today that a friend from high school die of colon cancer. I did know she passed till I logged into an old Facebook account. She died in 2010 and I only realized this today because it was her birthday and people where posting. But just now I really had a bad craving and took one of the wet cigs and tried to dry it out. I then proceeded to go and try to smoke it. As I was smoking this nasty fucking thing I realized I have hit a new low. It's going to be hard but I'm just gonna have to use this subreddit to motivate me daily.

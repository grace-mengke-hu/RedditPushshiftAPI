Thought I was gonna die last night

I had a really scary experience and reality check last night. I can’t carry on living my life like this. I’ve been smoking on and off for about 6/7 years. The longest I’ve gone without smoking since I started was probably about 3 months. I’ve been trying to quit for ages but keep relapsing. This time, I’d been smoke free for about a week when I stupidly decided to have a cheeky one last night.

It was definitely the worst thing I could’ve done as my heart started racing really fast. My left arm felt a tiny bit numb and I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and I was going to die. I prayed and prayed and tried to sleep it off but my heart could not just stop racing. I decided to write a quick note for my mum &amp; sister just in case and drove myself to the hospital. Luckily, things calmed down a bit whilst I was there. They did an ECG and blood pressure, took some blood samples and told me everything looked alright thankfully.

I’ve just woken up and I was in a reflective mood. I really felt like I was gonna die last night and there are so many things I haven’t yet achieved in my life. I don’t wanna go to an early grave. I don’t want to leave my mum and sister behind cos of my own stupidity. I’m NEVER touching a cigarette again and I promise to live a smoke free and healthy life from here onwards. Sorry for the rant

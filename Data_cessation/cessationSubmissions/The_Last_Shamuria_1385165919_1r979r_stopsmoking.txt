This quit smoking app is pretty cool

It's called QuitIt and it's free. You can input your quit date and other things like how many cigarettes you smoke per day. And it keeps a running tab on everything. Including how many cigarettes you haven't smoked. Even how much tar you haven't taken in and how much money you have saved. It also tells you about the status of your health returning from not smoking. Like how much longer till the little hairs in your lungs grow back and stuff like that. Anyone else use this app? Or know of any other good apps like this? I find it helps to look at all my stats when I'm having a craving.

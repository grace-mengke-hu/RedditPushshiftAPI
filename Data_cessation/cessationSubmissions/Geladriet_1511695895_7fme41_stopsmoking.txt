60 days

Stopped 60 days ago, 10 years 20 cigs per day smoker. Last two weeks were complicated because a friend started again to smoke, but I could resist.

Never thought that I could make it. Had some help with vaping to start with and now on 0mg nic. Can't wait to be not addicted at all in the future. ðŸ˜€

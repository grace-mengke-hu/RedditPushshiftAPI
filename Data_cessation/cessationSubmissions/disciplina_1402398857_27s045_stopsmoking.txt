Anger is slowing me

Its probably my 100th time quiting and maybe my 3rd or 4th time posting here about it. So this is not much to be taken seriously but whatevah.. Haven't smoked for 3 days now and im really, really , REALLY FUCKING ANGRY. Everything is going on my nervs and i dont know for how long i can take this fucking shit. If something or someone doesnt happen today im smoking like hell again

EDIT: Thank you all for the time and the will for helping me but unfortunately i am a smoker again... it just wasn't working for me

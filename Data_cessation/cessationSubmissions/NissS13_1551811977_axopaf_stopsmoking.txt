Quit NYE, I started reading on breaks at work when I used to smoke. Just finished my fifth book of the year.

Thank you everyone in this sub, I lurked for 2 years before finally having the courage to stay quit for more than a few days.  If you're still trying, don't give up, you will know when it's the right time and you CAN do it!

Relapsed a while ago, forgot about this sub...

I lied, I didn't forget it, I went back to my pack a week habit back in October from a 5 month quit and just ignored all the posts that showed up on my front page from this sub. I quit again today, thanks to a vaporizer that I bought and it seems to be doing the job, I use it whenever I get cravings. I still dislike the fact that I'm not changing my nicotine addiction, but as Frank Underwood says... "Addiction without the consequences"

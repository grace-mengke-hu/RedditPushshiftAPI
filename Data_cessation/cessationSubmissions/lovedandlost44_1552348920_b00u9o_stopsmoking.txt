One week of no cigarettes!!

I haven’t touched a cigarette in 7 days, and I’m using my vape WAAAY less than I anticipated. Saturday I went whale watching with my (non-smoker) dad, so I took 3 puffs of my vape before I left and didn’t have any more the whole day! Yesterday I used it more as I was doing my delivery job, and today I’ve used it a couple times, but it’s mostly due to boredom/empty hand. I’m reading Carr’s BootCamp, and I’m trying to keep an open mind (the lack of scientific/peer-reviewed citations is driving me nuts), but I’m on day 2 today.

Keep it up, y’all!

this time I quit. really. two weeks ago I stopped for 5 days.

Last weeks I smoked too much and I fear for my health. 20 years smoking! It's time to quit. 

Now I have no money with me, my debt/credit card is broken and I asked my boyfriend to not give me _any money_ so I don't buy tobacco.

Wish me good luck!

Day 19 - i'm on a mission

Day 19 Smokefree

Mornings - distract myself by making a cup of coffee or having some milk from the kitchen, brush teeth and think about how great it is for my mouth to not taste like 100 yo copper tubing

Commute to work - used to smoke one before entering and one after exiting the subway, this was kind of hard at first but instead of walking i ran as fast as i could the first few days, i'd be so out of breath my windpipe would be sore and the last thing i'd want was a smoke, all the way to the office

Work Smoke Breaks - i still take them, but i changed to ritual, go downstairs, buy some sparkly water and take a walk around the building takig big gulps so i trick myself the burning in my throat is the same... slowly i started joining my smomer colleagues and observing how disgusting it is that they smoke and so cool that i don't anymore

evenings - i take breaks from the pc by going to the store, i never shop for lots of items at a time, this makes me do some physical activity and provides that 5 minutes or so distraction i need for a craving, buy a single loaf of bread, a single bottle of water and be in awe at how easy it is to not order a pack of smokes after 14 years

quitting is great, everyone should do it

2nd or 3rd time quitting as of today...

Technically, I quit smoking on sunday, but with it being today, I had to have a celebratory cigar for all the real heroes out there that make this country great (no, im not a "'murrican," I'm an American. Fuck DJT!) That will be my last cigar ever. 

What makes it different this time? 

I bought a pack of cigarettes. 

WUT?! 

You asked, now hear me out:

* For the next 10 days, I'm going to break 2 cigarettes each day for the avg number of smokes i've been sucking down daily for the last ten years of my life. Yup. It's gunna feel real good to me once I crack past two weeks. I've managed to quit in the past, but that didn't last. Now, it will. AND I WILL KEEP MY LUNGS!!

* All my life, I was surrounded by 2nd hand smoke and eventually picked this shit habit up formally when I was 16, turning 17. I've lost too many family members to cancer and tobacco related illnesses (Fuck you, Mike Pence.) My only living grandfather, whose 75, was able to quit after 65 years (yeah, he's been smoking since he was ten,) I think I can do it as well.

I Believe in All of You!! Mind over Matter! No cessation aids, just keep calm and find a new healthy alternative. And no, I don't mean E-Cigs: Go walking, pick up a hobby, begin a sport, meditate, learn a craft/trade. Anything, Anything, ANYTHING!!! but smoke more poison.   

Happy Indie Day 

Light and Love,

The more I educate myself on smoking, the more disgusting they seem to me...reading is truly fundamental :-)

I've been doing a lot of reading lately, 
The Easyway To Stop Smoking 
Freedom From Nicotine
And of course WHYQUIT which has tons of information...and many others...
My opinion is this...if you read daily and educate yourself on what you're putting into your body...EVENTUALLY something will click and the process of quitting will become painless! Good luck everyone! :-)

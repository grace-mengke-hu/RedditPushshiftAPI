I quit smoking on Thursday. I hope it's for good, but I'm unsure. Am I on day 2 or 3?

I had my last smoke Thursday. I quit because I had a dental implant installed Thursday morning. I smoked a about 2 packs a week. I am hoping I can quit for good. I got an implant about a year ago too, quit for a couple weeks, but picked it back up. Any tips for the long haul would be helpful. Can you ever cheat and have a couple puffs or is that just bad news? Also, was day 1 considered Thursday or Friday?

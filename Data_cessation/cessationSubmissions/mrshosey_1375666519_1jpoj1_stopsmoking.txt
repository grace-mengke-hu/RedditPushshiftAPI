Pretty sure I'm about to pull out my hair and eat all the things

I have been 84 days without a cig, and for whatever reason today is just bad bad bad! I want one even worse than day 3. I'm chewing some gum and trying to relax but it's not working. I'm sure I just need to wait it out, but paired with a messed up back, and no pain meds, I'm about to snap. And (As my poor husband has learned) telling me you're proud of me and telling me how long it has been will make me want to rip your throat out. I'm equating this to telling someone to "calm down"

Severe exhaustion. Day 1. Anyone else experience this while quitting?

I quit today only a few hours ago. I’ve quit before and started back. Longest I’ve went was a month. Last time was a week. Now I’m confident I can get through it and I will. Each time I’ve quit I get severely tired for a few days. I also have added stress recently of my dad breaking his ankle. (He can’t get up from the couch at all) I had to take non fmla leave which means no pay and have been doing housework, deep cleaning, taking care of animals, and my dad. I was just wondering if anyone else experienced this? My dad told me when he quit a long time ago he didn’t. Also wish my dad and I luck because he’s quitting tomorrow since he has surgery on Thursday. We both realized it was a good stopping point. Anyone else?

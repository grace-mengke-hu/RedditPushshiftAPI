Feel shitty. Should reset badge, but that'll make me feel worse. Need some moral support.

I haven't touched a cigarette in 590 days, like my badge says.

But this past summer, I started smoking hookah. I don't feel good, and I am definitely just as addicted to that as I was to cigarettes.

Right now, I'm sitting next to my hookah, and it's lit, and I haven't smoked anything in 5 days but oh I want to so badly but I don't want to feel shittier about myself.

I just needed to tell someone, because I feel like I'm drowning. I hate that I get addicted to things like cigarettes or weed or shitty habits. I hate that I have so much trouble quitting them. I hate that I feel so bad about having to reset my badge that it makes me want to smoke more. 

Agh dslkjghsldkdfjgh fuck

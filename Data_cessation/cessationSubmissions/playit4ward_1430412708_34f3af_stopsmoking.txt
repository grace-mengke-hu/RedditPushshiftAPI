Has anyone had a similar Day 10-14 experience?

Hello all,
               First off, want to say thank you to this community for the constant inspiration.

I am currently on day 13. I know I will not smoke ever again. I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience in recovery.

On Day 10 I woke up with cold like symptoms (runny nose, stuffed up, hot/cold, headache and irritated/sore throat.) Today my face is super hot. It could be related to my job as I have to work in a stressful environment with people I don't see eye to eye with. 

I'm curious, have any of you that have quit experienced these physical symptoms and/or been a hothead heading into your third week?

Thank you all for your time and inspiration.

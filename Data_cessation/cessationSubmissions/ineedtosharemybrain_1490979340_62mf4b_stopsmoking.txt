4 weeks!

The extra intake of sweets and other random stuff that I ate as a reward for quitting, made me feel guilty so, I started walking a Kilometer a day which then turned into 2 km's and so on, I am now at 5 km's a day and I feel great, I also lost 4kgs! I am very proud of myself! I deserve a an internet cookie!

[EDIT: As cheesy as this might sound, I would like to thank everyone on here for sharing their stories and for the support. As I mentioned in my first post, I smoked for many years without anyone in my family knowing, and believe it or not you guys were my only support.]

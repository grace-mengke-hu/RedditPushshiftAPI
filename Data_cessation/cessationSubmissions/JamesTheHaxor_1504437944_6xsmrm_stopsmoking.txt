Just put my last cigarette out. Time to quit.

Here goes another attempt at quitting. My first cigarette of the day became my last. I contemplated quitting before I smoked this cigarette, but I lit it up anyway and it felt disgusting.

I'm on day 4 quitting alcohol and it's actually going very well. I feel confident I can handle both.

So here goes.

Edit need to reset that badge.

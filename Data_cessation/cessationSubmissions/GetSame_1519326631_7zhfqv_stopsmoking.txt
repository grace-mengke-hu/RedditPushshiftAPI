Either quit or don't

Enjoy the shit out of your cigarettes. Stop using them as an escape and distraction. Set a fixed date for when you will smoke your very last cigarette. Until that date, smoke as much as you want to with the only condition to enjoy it as much as you can, knowing after that day you set, you will never be able to smoke again. 

Worked for me, 4 months and 12 days clean :)

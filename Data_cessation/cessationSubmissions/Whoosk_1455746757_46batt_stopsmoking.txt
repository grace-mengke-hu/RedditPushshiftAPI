Day Two. Trying to hold on.

Pack a day Newport smoker for 11 years. About halfway through day two and trying to ignore every justification I come up with to go buy a pack right now. Is there any truth to when people say that the physical nicotine withdrawals pass after about 72hrs? Trying to keep the real reasons I want to quit (fear of cancer, death, want to watch my kids grow up, enjoy old age with my wife) at the front of my mind but everything else tells me "Fuck it, we all end up in the dirt eventually, just smoke now."

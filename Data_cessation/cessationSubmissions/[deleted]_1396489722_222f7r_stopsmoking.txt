Light smoker for 4 years, "quit" in January, cravings still here but psychological effects are worse

Need a throwaway for this because too many people know my main.

I've been smoking what i consider lightly since 2010.  Never smoked a whole pack in a day, but there were definitely spans of weeks where I was smoking between 2-5 cigarettes a day.  

I continued this when I got to college.  I would smoke heavily at parties and occasionally during the day, buying a new pack every 3-6 days.  This continued into the summer months, but since I wasn't lobbing off a pack a day I didn't really consider myself a smoker.  I'm young, so I thought I'd just save the quitting for later.

I recently spent 4 months living in Germany, and anyone who has ever been to Europe knows how socially inclined people can be to smoke.  I ended up with a steady pack/3 days habit (reds) and it became my coping mechanism for culture sock.

In January when I moved back to the States, I decided I was done.  There have been two nights when I caved, once in mid January (5 cigs) while drunk and the other in mid February, ditto. 

It has now been 6 weeks since my last light.  I'm getting spotty cravings, but what concerns me is I haven't been feeling quite myself these last few months.  I'll go a week feeling totally normal, then the next 4 or 5 days I'll walk around in a blur.  My head hurts, I have trouble concentrating, and feeling genuinely happy is impossible.  Occasionally I'll be relaxed on the couch, then suddenly my brain just revs up gives me anxiety.  Almost like "Hey, you're not gonna give me a cig? Cool, I'll just fill your head with depressing thoughts instead."  

It's starting to become a bit better, but it still fucks with me in ways I can't imagine.  I knew quitting wouldn't be a cakewalk, but I wasn't expecting this much psychological fuckery.  

Anyone else have similar experiences during their first few months?

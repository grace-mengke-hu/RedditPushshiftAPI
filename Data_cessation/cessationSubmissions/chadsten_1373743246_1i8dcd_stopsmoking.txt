They say the first week is the hardest...

I did it! One week without the nasty sticks. I've been cheating and using a vaporizer, but I can already tell the difference in taste, smell, and breathing. I can't believe I kept the habit for over 10 years in the first place.

I'll post again once I've hit a month!

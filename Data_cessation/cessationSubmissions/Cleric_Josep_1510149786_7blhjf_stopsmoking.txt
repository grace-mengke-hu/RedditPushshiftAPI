So I am smoking what I hope is my last cigarette.

I've been smoking for ten years now, started when I was 25. It's gotten so outta hand that I sometimes don't know what to do. I can guarantee that I smoke two packs a day some days, at least anyway. When I think about it, it makes me sick, yet I still do it. I have Chantex and patches, yet I don't use them. It's just so damn easy to smoke again and again. The quitting is compounded by the fact that I live with two other heavy smokers. Both of whom don't give a shit that I want to stop, and leave everything I need to keep going right at my fingertips. But, here's to hoping that maybe, just maybe today is the day I can finally just stop.

Advice on quitting my vape?

Hey everyone. 
I’ve been smoke free for around 2 weeks I believe.
I’ve been using my vape instead. But lately, the anxiety attacks I get from using my vape is unbearable. Literally a panic attack. The only reason I use my vape is because am afraid that the withdrawals will slow me down in taking care of my responsibilities. I know that quitting nicotine entirely will help. But I need advice, of those who stayed busy and still stopped using vape — how did you do it? Are there tips or experiences that you can share? 
I really want to put the nicotine monster behind me. I am so tired of it. For years I have battled this addiction. Now I want to be rid of it forever...

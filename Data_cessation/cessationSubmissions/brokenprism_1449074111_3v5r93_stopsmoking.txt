155 days, random thoughts on the experience.

One day at a time, When I quite smoking months ago, I was worried about picking it back up. But with my one simple trick I am now certain I will never smoke again. I quit every day, 10x a day. Anytime I see someone smoking, I leave. If I smell smoke wafting by, I leave. 

Its a life hazard. Avoid it at all costs. 

I survived thanksgiving. I hosted my family and my in-laws. My wife and I cooked everything and set everything out. Well into the meal my inlays said "you don't have to be polite, you can sneak out to smoke if you need to" I said no. I quit 149 days ago. Their faces light up like a christmas tree.

Quitting is one of those accomplishments, that becomes more impressive every day. Today is 155 days. Tomorrow it is 156 days. Next week when i'm with my monthly gaming group it'll be ~164 days. 

I travel for work, I'm in sales. I cover the north east region. In the winter its dark and cold and depressing and makes me want to smoke. I don't do it. I don't smoke. It's insanely freeing. Approximately 80% of the businesses I sell to are Gas Stations, I'm in them every day, behind the counter, $4-$12 between me and a relapse. But I dontspendthatmoney.com because I know that those $4.00 are better off invested, than burned up and littered along the roadway.

Anyhow..... at 6pm today i'll be at 156 days, how cool is that?

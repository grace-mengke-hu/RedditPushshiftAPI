A suggestion for the mods

I don't know if you guys would be up for it, but I think putting a link in the sidebar to /r/electronic_cigarette would be a good idea. It has helped me and others I know quit smoking with relative ease and some people lurking here may not know about them.

thanks for reading.

Edit : it looks like some of the community is too strung up on their high horse to even consider, so never mind. Don't bother commenting, I don't care how much you think you're better than everyone who vapes because you don't. Good for you, asshole.

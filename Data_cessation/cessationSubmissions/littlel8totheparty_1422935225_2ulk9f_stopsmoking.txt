17 days 11 hours and it just gets easier!

I quit on my last day in mexico and haven't smoked since. I've even been around people who were smoking at the bar and chain smoking in houses and haven't had a single one. I had a weak moment when I was upset where I asked a guy for one on the street but as my luck would have it it was his last one! I took that as a sign and have stayed strong ever since. Keep up the good work friends! The cons are not worth risking the pros and the cravings do pass! :) also I've saved about 60 dollars and that feels great too!

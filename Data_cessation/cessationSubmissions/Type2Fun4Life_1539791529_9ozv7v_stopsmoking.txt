I'm on Day 9...exhaustion has set in...

I have felt great every day so far since quitting, until yesterday. It's like I hit a brick wall and all I want to do is sleep. How long does this part usually last? I've read that I should expect to be tired while quitting because nicotine is a stimulant, but I didn't realize it would be this bad. When will my energy come back? I feel like a dead girl walking and NOTHING is helping me.

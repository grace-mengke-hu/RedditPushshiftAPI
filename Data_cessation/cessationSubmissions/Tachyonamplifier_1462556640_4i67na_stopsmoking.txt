One year. Twelve months. 365 days.

However you want to say it...that's how long it's been since my last cigarette!

I'm very excited to say it's been a whole year since I tasted the filter of a cigarette. In that time, I've had stress induced dreams, cravings, and even opportunities to smoke without anyone every knowing. I dealt with moving, a vacation with a group of smokers, family problems, and a death without reaching for a stick of nicotine. 

What I'm saying, I guess, is if I can do it then anyone can. Good luck to everyone out there because I know it's not easy...but it's very, very worth it. Have a strong day!!

i have a set date for when i'm going to quit smoking, feeling pretty confident about it, not as confident as i'd like to be... but i'm getting there.  getting there as in compiling all the knowledge i can to possibly make cutting the habit easier. and this is most of what i've come across in the past couple hours i've been browsing this subreddit and a couple other sites. just dropping this hear for the old cliche (if this can help one person then yadayadyadad).

ps sorry for the structure, typos, or anything like that. 
pss i wouldn't really recommend the getting sick one, but one time i got sick, like the flu or something, didn't \ pretty much couldn't smoke for the duration, and by the time i was better cigarettes tasted like straight ass. almost had to force myself to smoke. not sure why i didn't seize that opportunity to just quit then and there. 

just facts:
- smokers who quit before age 35 have about same life span as someone who's never smoked
- much harder to quit for those who started before age of 15 [developing brain & more vulnerable to addiction]
- nicotine by itself possibly helps in cognitive function
- can use patches\gum & smoke at the same time says FDA
- former smokers > smokers (quanity)
- smokers are biologically dependent, normal = nicotine
- nicotine acts on acetylcholine receptors - normalize in 3 weeks
- nicotine is out of the body in 3 days
- cravings only last 3-5 minutes
- more stressed when a smoker
- cigs [after a week] will start tasting bad \ make you feel worse
- the need goes away after around 6 months
- ecigs aren't fda regulated
- nrt proven low success rates
- endorphin rush > nicotine fit \ craving

preparation:
- supportive people 
- consider NRT
- throw away everything on quitday [lighters, ashtrays, etc]
- psychologically analyze why i smoke
- figure out triggers for smoking
- figure out how to counteract triggers (avoid, distract, etc)
- want to actually quit [powerful personal important reason]
- quitting buddy [someone to quit with]
- change mentality [easiest way] books, meditation, hypnosis
- timing, when to quit [busy week]
- log when\why cigarettes (a week before quitday) [what i'm doing \ trigger + craving on a scale 1-10]
- survival kit [hard candy, mints, toothpicks, plastic straws, stressball, etc]
- list reasons whyquitting & read daily [motivation & strength]
- get sick
- trial run (fix whatever went wrong then seriously quit)
- practice week
 fight first urges of the day & wait 5 minutes

Really trying here... any advice would be much appreciated.

I went thru some posts yesterday, and I made my decision that that was it; today was the day I would quit smoking. I woke up and immediately failed. To make matters worse (excuses, I know...) I had surgery about a week ago. I bumped my incision today pretty bad, and that immediately drove me to want another cig.
I made a promise to my boyfriend yesterday that today was the day... and I failed :(
I am going to tell him the truth when I see him later tonight, I just..
1) Can't stop!
2) Don't know how to break it to him that I failed within 3 minutes of being awake this morning, and now the pain from smacking my belly doesn't help my situation any further.

UGH, just some enlightening words for me please? Or scare the living crap out of me so I don't go out on break here in 20 and screw up again...
This is my first-ever post on Reddit... Kindness is greatly appreciated :)
Thanks everyone in advance

Patches + Walking Dead Marathon = Craziest dreams of my entire life.

Seriously, what the fuck has happened in my head the last two nights? It's been terrifying and wonderful and vivid and holy shit.

The last time I quit I took the patches off before bed, but now I think I might just leave them on.

.... does this impede the body's ability to get restful sleep at night or just dreams?

1 week today! Woot!

I got a week today!  Maybe I'll celebrate with a...  no, j/k!

FYI, I used the 21mg patch to break the initial habit for 6 days, then went to the 2mg gum.  This is the best way for me, that first week is the worst, but then I want the nicotine out of me and my will power is strong enough after that.

Now, as they say, *staying* clean is much harder than *getting* clean.  That's why I'm here now...

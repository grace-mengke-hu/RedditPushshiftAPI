Having an extremely difficult time quitting

I am 22 years old and have been smoking cigarettes since age 13. Smoking has really started to have an effect on my physical appearance, and in turn, my confidence. I've enjoyed smoking and have almost used it as a security blanket (I also suffer from anxiety) up until about a year ago. Now I am disgusted with my habit, and would really like to quit. I made it for 5 days a couple of weeks ago after trying to quit cold turkey. At the end of day five, I caved when I saw my friend smoking. Now I'm back to smoking daily, but less than half of a pack. I'm hoping that some of you would be willing to share some helpful tips for quitting and staying quit. All of my friends smoke, as does my boyfriend. I also live in a really big city which doesn't help with "stress smoking". Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Took my first chantix right now..help needed

Started with chantix after reading so many good things about it.
Sick and tired of being a smoker,read alan cards and quit then started again after a month,told everyone ill quit,then restarted again.
I love to lift and feel my progress has plateaued since I've started smoking more,almost a pack a day.
I hate being the guy who thinks where to eat out based on whether the restaurant has a smoking area.I use at as a stress buster and in between work breaks and have tried everything to leave it.
This time ive made up my mind and want to kick this off forever,i want my energy back,i want my health back and i want to be able to live healthier for a long time.
Please anyone who has tried chantix or whatever worked for you guys help me out,any tips or advice will be helpful.Sorry for the long rant but ive had it upto my head with this stupid addiction.

I haven't smoked in 15 hours. The longest I've ever gone.

To be honest, I've never REALLY tried. But I've been coughing more and feeling more and more groggy in the morning. I've been spending all day reading about the benefits, then I found this place. 

I'm gonna do it. I don't need to smoke. 

EDIT: you guys have no idea how great this was for my first day. I felt very accountable and now just feel, I don't know, clean. It feels great. Thanks.

Is chantix going to drive me crazy?

Yesterday was day two of taking chantix. I couldn’t sleep. Didn’t fall asleep until 2:30-2:45 or so. Mind you I was in bed by 10-10:30 and was actively trying to fall asleep by 11:30. I’m a busy person and rise early each day so I can usually get myself asleep within 20-30 minutes. Last night was not so easy. I could not stop thinking. My mind was all over the place. Things I hadn’t thought about in years. Then once I finally fell asleep I restlessly dreamt about fucking up at my job and woke up in a panic to my alarm not understanding what was reality. I don’t really know how to explain it any other way. I didn’t know if I was dreaming. I didn’t know what was happening. I was just completely confused. 

This is only day two. Doing some research this morning is making me really nervous about taking this drug. Should I talk to my doctor? Now that I am awake and writing this (an hour after I woke up) I feel clear headed... but damn that was a weird night and it’s only been two days... thanks in advance.

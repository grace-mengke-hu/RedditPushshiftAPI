Re-set, but not ashamed!

I made it way farther than I thought I would! I danced in a summer solstice parade without gasping for breath, but then after the parade was over I ran into some old smoker buddies and...well, you know the rest. 14 days feels like a lot to get back, and I am bummed that I broke. Resetting my badge, but I am not afraid of what is to come.

You have all been so wonderful and supportive. Thank you for everything. Maybe I will post a picture later of what it looked like to do the parade without gasping for air :)

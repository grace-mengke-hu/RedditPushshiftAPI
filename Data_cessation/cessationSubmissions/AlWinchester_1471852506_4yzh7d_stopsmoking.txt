Wow, it's been a month. I can tell you a few reasons not to smoke.

Hello guys.

I was a smoker for 6 years. Exactly one month ago, after a lot of unsusccessful tries, I decided to quit again. I am nicotine-free for one month. No single cigarette, no vape, no nicotine replacements.

And I have to say this, not smoking is awesome. I can clearly see effects on my health. And I can tell you a few reasons to quit now.

- Smell. Imagine you don't smell like shit. Your clothes don't smell like shit. People don't stay away from you in elevator. It's really nice.
- Better breathing. My coughs and sneezes almost completely disappeared. I can easliy breathe, I can run couple of miles or ride a bike. I don't feel like my heart will blow, which is nice.
- Exercise. I don't feel like garbage after a few sets and enjoy my time at gym. And after quitting, exercising helps.
- Better, much better sex life. You see, one of the worst things about smoking is bad blood circulation. When your circulation is affected, it means you have problems in bed. And it will be worse with years. You may need little pills or retire young, mark my words.
I can easily say this, it's much better now. Add improved stamine to this, you get what I mean. 

TLDR; not smoking is awesome. In only one month, you'll see improvements in your life. So quit. It's good.

What happens if you quit and then smoke one cigarette?

Would the chemical addiction come back or does it need more time to properly build? I had successfully refrained from smoking for about 13-14 days and was offered one cigarette. I ended up saying yes unfortunately. How would this affect me quitting?

One week later, same stuff happened. We were out town with some guys and went into a head shop where one of us bought a pipe. Having never tried a pipe before I figured I had to give it a shot. That day I smoked a ton which was yesterday. How is this gonna affect addiction etc?

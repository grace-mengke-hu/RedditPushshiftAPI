Two weeks!

Man, I'm happy to write this. Two weeks smokefree again.

After the first days in which the withdrawal was very noticable, it has not been very difficult this time around. That may come from the fact that I only smoked for around two months since my previous quitting attemps (which lasted around five months).

I do feel more confident in staying quit this time around, mainly because the reason I started smoking again was stupid (of course).

It's absolutely worth it! Good luck everyone and thanks for being here!

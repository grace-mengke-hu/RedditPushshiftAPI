Use a patch and a (Nicotine Free) E Cig?

Gotta quit smoking.  Want to quit smoking.  Ready to quit smoking.

I smoke a little over a pack a day.  I quit for about 3 months last year, but had a stressfull moment in my life and ran for a pack of smokes.   

Want to quit again.  Last time I used the patch and it worked ok.   
Im thinking about using the patch and also a Nicotine Free Ecig to kinda help with the mental aspect of it.   The old "something to do" comes to mind.

Anyone try this?  I am assuming its generally safe as theres not nicotine in the fluid, only from the patch.

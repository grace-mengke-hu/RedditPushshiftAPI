This time it's for real

After being a heavy smoker for 10 years its time to call it quits. I'm looking forward to being able to wake up and take a deep breath and not cough up a lung! Being able to smell and taste properly! Its all looking up from here! As far as I'm concerned this is day 1 of the rest of my life!


\sorry for the super enthusiasm but I'm exited to finally do this

39 days so far and I can't figure out why it worked this time. =)

I've been a smoker for 12 years and I've mostly smoked a pack a day. Tried quitting several time before, even had breaks for a couple of months one or two times before as well.

I've blamed everything for not smoking, stress, health issues (yes I've had issues that made the doctor recommend me not to stop smoking for a little while), co-workers and so on. For the last 2-3 years I've worked with smokers and I've said I can't quit because of them. I worked my last day at that job on the 11th of April. Took my last cigarette with my closest co-worker before I got in the car and went home for the last time. Never smoked since then. Now I'm even working nights occasionally and when I did that before I smoked like a chimney. Were worried before I worked my first night again but it went just fine.

I can't say I noticed an increase of money in my wallet tough, eating quite a lot of candy at the moment but that will change as well I recon.

Anyway, keep it up guys!

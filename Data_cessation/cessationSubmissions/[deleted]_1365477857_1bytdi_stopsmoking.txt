Trying to quit..

Okay, so I can go without smoking when I am not drinking anything, but not drinking is pretty much out of the question. I don't depend on alcohol or anything, but I love drinking beer. Not drinking to get wasted or anything like that, but since I started liking beer I try every beer I can find. If I haven't had the beer, I want to try it,  but after 4 or 5 beers the front side of my head (right above my forehead) starts pounding. I don't smoke a full cigarette (usually just 1/2 of one).

I love going out with friends and drinking some beers, but after that 4th or 5th one my head starts hurting. The only thing that seems to make it stop is a smoke. I want to not have to have that smoke. During the day I am fine, but I don't want to need that smoke.

I have quit cold turkey for basic training and again for a few months here and there (even while drinking), but after a few months my head starts to hurt, and I need that smoke.

Basically... How can I stop for good?

P.S This is the first time I have ever asked for help for pretty much anything, and I need to stop. Thanks.

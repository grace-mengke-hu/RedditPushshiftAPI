1 became 190,000

As I'm thinking about "that one" that I want so badly in this small moment (which will soon pass), I realized my first cigarette was simply the first of nearly 2k to follow. How fucking disgusting is that!?!

So no, I don't want one more, because I know what that becomes. Piss off brain, your loosing this fight!

I'm 7 months clean - but now i really want to smoke.

I haven't smoked for 7 months. Basically 2-3 puffs during this period. 
Today i have a terrible urge to smoke. The thing is when i did those 2-3 puffs throughout past 7 months, i never enjoyed feeling after. So i am thinkking to take another puff but am afraid of this, cause this might be a trap. 
Not sure....

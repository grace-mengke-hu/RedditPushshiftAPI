Just finished my first smoke free week. Getting ready for the second one.

I'm one week in and it haven't been as bad as I thought it would be. The only drawback that I'm facing right now is that I'm gaining weight fast. I'm trying not to use food/candy as a substitute, but I find that it helps a lot with the dizziness and lack of concentration I've been feeling during stressful times at work. I'm exercising daily as I did before quitting, but it's not helping getting rid of the extra pounds. Any thoughts?

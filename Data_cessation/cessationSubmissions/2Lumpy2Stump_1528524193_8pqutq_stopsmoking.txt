Advice? I hate the effects of smoking but really enjoy the act of it. Thinking of quitting lately

Anyone here have any good success stories, or advice for someone who really likes smoking, but knows it’s so terrible?

I hate reeking of smoke, and oh god the bad breath.  I hate knowing that it has a hold on me, and that anxious feeling of needing a cigarette after an hour or two.  Airports are the worst place for this..  

However, I love smoking.  I love the act, the feeling of the cigarette in my hand, the social contacts and friends I have made, just because were smoking buddies.  If there weren’t any adverse effects, I wouldn’t mind smoking all day every day, which is not far off from what I do anyway.

Anyone who shared this feeling have any stories or advice they can lend my way? I’m sure this is fairly common, but I haven’t really considered quitting for a couple of years now.  Guess it’s time to reconsider.

2 weeks!

I hit my 2 week mark yesterday and I am very proud of myself. I am still struggling. Some days I feel like I'm getting no where! Other days I feel extremely proud and confident in myself. The hardest part is everything that I was using cigarettes to suppress that I didnt even realize I was at first. Like i feel like my anxiety is through the roof and i feel so a.d.d. and like i cant concentrate on anyone thing for too long. Idk i known it gets better and i keep pushing past it. I know I can do this.

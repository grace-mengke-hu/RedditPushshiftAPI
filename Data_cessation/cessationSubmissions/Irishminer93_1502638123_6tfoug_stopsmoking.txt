Update

I was looking through my post history when I saw my old post and realized I never updated. So here goes, nearly half a year later and I'm nicotine free. Still vaping on occasion but not as a need, more along the lines of enjoying it. Purely nicotine free liquids. Definitely not everyday, I actually forget about it every once in awhile. Its good to know I have no excuse whatsoever to go back to cigarettes. Energy is good, breathing is normal, no coughing unless I need to change my coils. All in all everything is good.

Why I'm Quitting (Day 1)

I want my free time back.  I want extra money each day.  I want to feel healthy.  I want to be a good example to my kids.  I want the pain to go away.  I want to stop hating myself for allowing this to happen for so long.  26 Years of smoking.  I don't know if I can reverse that, but I'm ready to try.  Maybe if I can turn this around, I can turn around the other things in my life that feel out of control.

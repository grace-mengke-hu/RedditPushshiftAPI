Only 18 years old, been smoking for a year and need help to quit.

I really started smoking when I went to college and was living on my own. Lately I've been feeling unmotivated and not like myself and I feel like something has to give. So I want to start with one of my worst habits (smoking). I need some guidance on how to go about this. Do I go full cold turkey? Or decrease the daily intake until I don't want it anymore? I smoke just about a pack a day.

Please help me change social behavior and help smokers quit! (Brief Survey)

Hello /r/stopsmoking!

I'm finishing my degree in communication design and my final capstone project regards the current climate of smoking media and addresses issues relating to smokers and quitting.

I'm looking for as many people as I can to fill out this survey so I can gather primary qualitative research to move forward in my project.

It would mean the world to me if you could take a few minutes to fill this quick survey out (no writing or anything just clicking!). I don't want to reveal much more about my work or goal as to keep the responses objective.

Thank you all so much, I will be sure to keep this subreddit informed on my progress as it happens!

(If anyone knows of other subreddits that this would be appropriate to post to please let me know, especially if it was inappropriate to post here in the first place!)

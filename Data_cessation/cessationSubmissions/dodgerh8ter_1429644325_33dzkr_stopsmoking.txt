I slipped up

I'm such a loser. I was just so tired of thinking about cigarettes all the time. After 10 days I was still thinknng about cigs ALL THE TIME and I was sick of it. I just want to go back to my normal life. 

So I blew it. But it didn't even taste good and now I feel guilty and am back in quit mode. Flair reset. Fuck me.

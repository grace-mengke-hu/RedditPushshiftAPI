I have 47 days under my belt

I am so happy and proud of myself. It is not easy but it is not as bad as I anticipated. I feel a lot more confident after the 3rd week. I was actually very nervous before I quit. I failed multiple times in the past. Mostly because of the 'just one cig' thinking. This time it is going to be 'not another puff. No matter what'. I smoked a pack a day for 40 years. It feels so good to be out of the nicotine prison.

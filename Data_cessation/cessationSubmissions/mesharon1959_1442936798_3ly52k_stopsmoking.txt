I Made A Promise....

My father who was a non-smoker passed away in January at 82 years of age from a bleeding stroke. I flew home to Canada before he passed and held his hand as he took his last breath. I spent the next five days with my mother, brother, and sister-in-law going through things to get a handle on all things financial. It was a grueling week, but we survived it somehow. When my brother took me to the airport to drop me off, he said "You know smoke = stroke". I said "I know - I'll quit" and he said "Thank you!". It took me 8 months to get around to it but I knew I needed to fulfill that promise. As a closet smoker, only my parents, brother and his wife knew I smoked. I kept it a secret from my children, their spouses, my 8 grandchildren and my co-workers (hopefully!!). I have a lot of blessings in my life and I want to be able to enjoy and bask in those blessings for many years to come. I know my Papa Bear is proud of me for quitting as he watches over me.

My sister-in-law is trying to quit. She's on Champix and the patch and still can't seem to quit. Today I ordered her Allen Carr's book (which I've not read but heard raves about) for her from Amazon.ca and it's being sent to her house. I hope she will read it, and I hope she will be able to quit. I know it would make my brother very happy, and she would be happier and finally free.

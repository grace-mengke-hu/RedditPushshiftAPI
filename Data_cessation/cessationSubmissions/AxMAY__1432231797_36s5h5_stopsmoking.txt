Sooo after a little debate at work I need your guys help about whether or not to change my badge date

Yesterday as I was driving home from work and sitting in traffic (huge trigger for me) I did it.

I lit up.

But, it was more out of curiosity. I didn't NEED the cigarette. Just more of a "will this taste like shit" 

and it did. 

ONE puff and it was out the window.

So now some of the co workers are saying I need to start over as day one today.

I don't think that's very fair.

I was curious, not tempted, and I got that last urge out once I remembered how shitty they taste.

So do I change my badge or no?

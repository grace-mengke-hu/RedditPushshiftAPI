Day 10. I think I'm in Hell.

First of all - great group! I've enjoyed reading posts everyday, it helps.
So I'm nearing the end of day 10. Quitting has gone better this time than the last few times overall, but today feels like i'm back at day 1! Not only have I been thinking about smoking all day, I also get these weird, intense rushes of feeling lightheaded. As if I'm high as a kite. Maybe it's due to the fact that I haven't slept more than 4 or 5 hrs a night for the last week, when i'm used to 8 or 9. It's wearing me down. Is it true the next 2 weeks are the worst? I am going to be unbearable!

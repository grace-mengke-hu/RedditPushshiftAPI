Day 12, how the hell do I start exercising?!?

Doing pretty well on the not smoking but am a little worried that I might have to switch up my exercise routine in order to be successfully quitting long term. And by switching it up I mean starting to exercise. I have no idea how to do that. Maybe I'm just lazy? I think I need help to start exercising. What do people do to get their asses out there?

I fucked up

Two cigarettes 48 hours in. But that is not the habit by any means. I am still planning on going all day tomorrow without a smoke. 

I still count it as a victory however. I went from smoking a normal 40+ cigarettes in that time frame to breaking down and smoking two after a long night of freaking out and stress due to my job/personal life. 

However, I felt I couldn't lie to you all, seeing as you have provided me so much support up until this point. :) 

Thank you for your help, and any encouragements and advice are always appreciated.

working up to cold turkey

Yesterday I smoked a whole pack of cigarettes.
Today I am done with smoking in my apartment or my car. It's been such a trip and a vast change of perspective. I now have to think about smoking and consciously not smoking. 
I have a solid quit date in mind and marked on the calendar and I'm working up to it. Recently I have made a couple attempts to quit cold turkey that were unsuccessful, but I think that with planning, preparation and the emotional process of anticipation and *looking forward* to being smokefree will all help me through the transition. My plan, in effect, is to establish some non-smoking habits and lifestyle so that it doesn't just come as a shock as it did the last time. I feel as though I'm building tangible and psychological infrastructure I can rely on in the coming months.

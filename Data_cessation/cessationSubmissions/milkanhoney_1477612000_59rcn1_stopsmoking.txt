How I decided it was really time

The past month has been full of bad news, accidents and stress of all different kinds. I figured...I'll be stressed out to the max continuously for another couple of weeks whether I smoke or not so I gave up the idea of "I'm too stressed to quit right now" because things will always stress you out at exactly the wrong time. The only way I could think to make it LESS stressful is to know that I'm making healthier decisions, I'm not going to be sick and coughing by my own doing, my kids won't be upset with me for telling them to "get away because I'm smoking", I get more kisses when my kids don't hate the way I smell and I won't be wasting money on something that limits me so much.  I'm almost a week in, I AM using an electronic cigarette but I'm feeling much more free right now!

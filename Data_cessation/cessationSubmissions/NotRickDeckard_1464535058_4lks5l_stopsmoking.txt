A Wake-up Call

In the midst of a long bike ride this morning, I get a text saying my best friend is in the hospital after having a heart attack. He's been a 2-pack a day smoker his whole adult life. He's just 41 now. That is a big shock. I don't think you have to be a cardiologist to know there's a connection.

So I guess my point is -- those "in the future" consequences may not necessarily be so far in the future.

Day 2

Day Two. Constant feeling of being under tension. I've never been able to figure out if this is one long craving or something else.

Irritable? **WHAT THE FUCK IS IT TO YOU?**

At some points almost feel stoned, giddy or light headed. I get the smell of stale cigarette smoke periodically, for no apparent reason. Very short meditations at my desk seem to be a good thing. Lock the chair upright, sit up straight, close eyes and concentrate on breathing and what is going on inside the body. A couple of minutes of this and then concentrate on what's going on outside; noise, temperature, odours etc. Quick relaxation and “centring” (whatever the fuck that means, but it helps).

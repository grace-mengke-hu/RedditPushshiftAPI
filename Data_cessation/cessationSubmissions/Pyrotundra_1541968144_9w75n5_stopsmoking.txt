I quit vaping two days ago

My biggest problem is that while it’s not good for you it gave me an immediate release of stress and anxiety. I smoke pot which helps with these mental issues but I can’t go into work baked. It’s been hard not being able to rip my vape to relax. Any tips for coming to terms with this?

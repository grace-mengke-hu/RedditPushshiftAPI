Addiction is the problem, not smoking?

Yes, I was a smoker for 20 years, 20/day. I quit smoking cold turkey more than 60 days ago. It was definitely not easy but it was not as difficult as I imagined for all those years. I can live without fags. I don´t smoke anymore. So far so good.

The real problem lies elsewhere: I realised that I´ve got a general problem with addiction. Since I stopped smoking I developed some more or less unhealthy behaviors: I stuff myself, the more sugary the better. And I run - at least 5 times a week 10Km each. "No problem" you may say - but it feels like a problem. Because I really can´t contain the cravings. I am forced to go running even if my legs hurt and my muscles are cramped and I am forced to eat candy and I can not defend myself. I´m scared that there is more like that comming. There where episodes in my past life with alcohol, porn and videogames too. I realized in the past days that I got problems with addiction my whole life and smoking was only one facet of it. 

Anybody feels the same? Any tipps?

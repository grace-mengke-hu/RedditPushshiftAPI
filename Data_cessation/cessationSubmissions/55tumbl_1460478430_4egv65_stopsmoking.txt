Passed the one year mark without noticing

A couple weeks ago, I thought "wow almost one year". But then, the day came and passed, and I didn't even think about it. Pretty sweet uh.

Anyway, I still vape, with nicotine (although I reduced the concentration)... so I'm well aware some may not see this as a legit stop. But I don't care, I haven't smoked a single "killer" in more than a year, and that's good enough for me. And I guess it's at least worth one lousy reddit post.

Good luck to all of you out there. My little get motivated contribution: don't believe those who say it's about willpower, and failures are because of weakness or lack of will. I'm sure every single smoker who wants to stop (or even who doesn't really want to stop, but feels like they should) can do it. Mostly a matter of finding the way that works best for you.

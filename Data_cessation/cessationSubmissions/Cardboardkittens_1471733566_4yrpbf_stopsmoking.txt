day 5

I'm amazed I made it this far. I'm very proud of myself. On day 3 I hung out with friends who are heavy smokers and I was nervous about caving but I stayed strong and they walked away from me when smoking and didn't offer anything and I'm thankful for that. 

Vitamins daily, drinking mostly water and more fruits and veggies. I have 10 days til my test. I'm hoping that my levels are low enough to pass as a non smoker.

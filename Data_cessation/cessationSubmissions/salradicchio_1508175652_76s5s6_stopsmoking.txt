Need to rant, so I'd better do it here

Edited to add, I just needed to vent because I'm clearly going through withdrawals and overreacting. My partner is doing the best he can, and I have no intention of attacking him for not being perfect. But I had to get it out somewhere. ;)

My partner texted me this morning to ask how I was feeling and I sent him a series of unhappy emojis. He told me at least I'm over the hump! I asked him, what hump is that? He said the one week hump. I just want to kill him because a simple, "Good job, you're amazing, I'm so proud of you" would be great but instead I feel like he's shitting all over my feelings by trying to make me see silver linings, or like he wants me to stay positive about this or pretend to be positive even when I feel like complete shit. I didn't get out of bed yesterday and today I can't open my mouth because I've been gritting my teeth so much. I feel like hell and it would be nice if the person I'm seeing would just accept that and let me have my feelings. But I'm not going to get in a texting fight with him so I needed to get this out of my system here. :(

Nearly 24 hours in, damn this is hard, we're going to do this though!

My fiance and I decided to throw in the smoking towel, pretty much cold turkey (had set our quit date a while back, so saw it coming). Finally! This is tough though, not going to lie! 

Have been having a lot of cravings, even purchased a smoking alternative the day of quitting - snus pouches, but I have yet to touch those because I want to drop nicotine all together, not just trade smoking habit for chewing habit. 

WE CAN DO THIS, keep telling ourselves and each other that. It has to be now, we've been smoked for about 10+ years each. I personally was smoking more, nearly 1 pack a day. Thanks for all of your stories and support, it's SUPER helpful.

Good luck to everyone else here, let's do this together.

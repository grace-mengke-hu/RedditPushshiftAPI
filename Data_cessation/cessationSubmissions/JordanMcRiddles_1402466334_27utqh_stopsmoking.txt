Please motivate me. It's only been 6 hours.

It's only been 6 hours since my last smoke, and I yold myself it would be the last. I've already been fighting a headache and urge to go light one up for over an hour. I flushed my pack, but I could drive 5 minutes and have a pack in hand. I know I'm the only one that can stop myself, but goddamn if somebody could give me some words of encouragement that would be great.

Quitting now. Looking for support / advice.

Hi everyone,

I’m new here and happy to be a part. A friend of mine recommended that I join this community, telling me “you can’t fight addiction alone your head.” 

I’ve been heavily using nicotine for almost a year now. Since I have been vaping rather than smoking cigs it’s been harder to use health as a motivator, but I still really want to be free. It’s hard to trust myself after so many failed attempts to quit (upwards of 20). I’ve thrown away my vape many times only to find myself the next day digging it out of whatever public trash can I buried it in (or buying a new one). 

Many of my friends manage to vape or smoke cigs casually, and I find myself wishing that I could be like them, even though I know from experience I can’t be moderate (I always end up using all day long, every day). 

I want to quit before I run into a real problem, like getting caught using it in the bathroom at work, or discovering some serious health issue, but without the intensity of a “crisis” it’s hard to feel fully committed. I read Allen Carr’s book, and it really helped, but I find that I am never certain that I’m “done.” There is always some doubt in me. But 90% of me wants to stop - for good.

Anyway, I’m quitting today. I’ve downloaded the smoke free app and set a time. I’m all set up. But I’m scared of failing again. I don’t trust my decision to quit anymore after so many failed attempts. I’m worried it won’t stick - that I don’t understand my addiction or reasons for quitting enough to really follow through, but I’ve thought through it enough to realize that there isn’t some tricky “easy way” (unless you know of one, in which case please tell me). I desperately want to stop, but I feel like I don’t know how. 

Looking for support, advice, and a community who understands. Thank you all ♡

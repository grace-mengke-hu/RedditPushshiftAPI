Day 5, I'm finally putting on weight. This is so rewarding!

In all the years I've smoked (and even before that), I've always been a real skinny guy, always weighing in around 56kg. I was never hungry in the morning. Sometimes I would skip lunch out of laziness... Food was just something I could do without (hell I'd just smoke one when I was hungry and the hunger would pass.) Even on days when I would randomly fast, I'd still weigh 56kg... I had tried to put on weight, change my diet, exercise, etc... Nothing worked. 56kg still... 

Now that I've quit, I feel hungry all the time. My girlfriend can't believe it, I eat 6-7 times a day, and even when I'm full, I still feel the urge to eat. (no don't worry, I'm not turning bulimic). But I just weighed myself after 5 days smoke free, and guess what: 60kgs!!! I can't believe it, in just five days of quitting, I put on the weight I had tried to put on in five years.

This feels great. Thank you all of you for your support!!

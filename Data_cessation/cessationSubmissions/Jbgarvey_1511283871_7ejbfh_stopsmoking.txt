Don't miss cigarettes, but...

This is an odd quit, but maybe that's a good thing.  I'm two weeks in (today!), on the second level patch, and still feeling periodic physical/emotional pangs.  Like how I would have felt on a long plane ride.  But...the one thing I don't want or even consider is a cigarette - I think this is good, right?

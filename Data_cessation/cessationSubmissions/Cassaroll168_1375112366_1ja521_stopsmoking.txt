Approaching the end of my gradual reduction - Panicking

I've been gradually reducing my consumption for the past month or so. Every five days I reduce my daily budget by one. I'm down to the last five days of my plan and I'm freaking out about how to end it. I only smoked two yesterday but the 50% reduction down to one a day is a sharper transition than I've handled this whole time. Should I smooth the transition and do 1 1/2 for the next two days and gradually reduce down to a half of one on the fifth day and none after that? I know I need a hard out where I don't ever smoke after that but how do I land on that day?

Anyone had luck on the gradual reduction? How do you end the schedule?

Quitting and weight gain

I have been working out, lifting and football(AFL) and I wanna quit smoking but I'm worried about weight gain. I have lost about 12 kgs, about 20 lbs for the US and I'd rather not put it straight back on. If I'm working out nearly everday, eating relatively well and cardio, how much weight gain will I expect?

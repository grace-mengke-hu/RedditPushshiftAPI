Resetting my badge today...

After over 250 days smoke free I relapsed.  I went to Iceland for 2 weeks as part of a summer school type program and there were a lot of smokers on the trip, and a lot of drinking.  It started out as one cigarette ever couple nights but by the end of the trip I was smoking half a pack a day again.  I swore I wouldn't smoke once I got home 3 weeks ago, but I did.  Usually 1-2 cigarettes every few days.  Last night I bought a pack and smoked like 5 cigarettes, gave myself a headache and a sore throat which continues this morning, so I smoked again.  It's amazing how I went from not even thinking about smoking to smoking again so quickly.  All the reasons I had quit just disappeared from my mind.  So I'm quitting again today.  Hopefully I've learned my lesson this time...

These cravings are so amazing.

I really am so excited to be having these awesome cravings. Just one after another. I love it when I wake up in the morning, or eat food, or the kids flip out or my partner has something stupid to say, or our house guest gives me advice. Man oh days I just can't wait to have another craving. They are amazing and make me feel so wonderful. Yay. These added headaches and sleepless nights are just the bees knees. 🎉☺️👌🏼🚭‼️

After 11 years, I quit from smoking 27 days ago. The first two week was a lot easier but after that my hard days were started. Strong craving and i had been so emotional, day by day it got harder, really recent years of my life have been with depression always. And cigarette was  my loneliness's buddy. During quitting i were thinking i have lost my buddy and a enjoyable thing that could help me to control my emotions, my sadness, my anger and leave the past behind. This thought was always in my mind that if i could smoke now i would have been in a better state.
Finnaly in the 27th night my stamina was ended and i bought 4pack of cigarettes. My senses was like a lover who have joined to his love after a long time. But when i took my first puff i said WTF! The taste is so terrible That was so disgusting and made me feel sick, i never could enjoy from that. i tought perhaps my next smoke be better. I smoked 8 cigarette during last night and today but i don't find any of them enjoyable. Just terrible taste and disgusting. So i decided before again i addict to this shit stuff, destroy all of my 4pack in water. I start quitting again but this time with more awakeninng since i have noticed that cigarette is just a fucking shit. During my quitting i always thought i have lost an enjoyable and good thing but now i know how terrible is cigarette. I start quitting again and i wish i could do that this time.

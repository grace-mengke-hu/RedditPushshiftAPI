Took up vaping nearly two years ago, now am having a HELL of a time quitting.

I replaced smoking cigarettes with vaping two years ago. I intended to use the e cig as a step down method to quitting... not as a replacement nicotine delivery system. So on Aug 29th I threw the remainder of my vape juice and my e cig in the trash.

If somebody tells you that vaping is less addictive than smoking analogs.... maybe they're lucky but my experience says they're dead bloody wrong. I thought I'd experience fewer and less intense cravings coming off the e cig but I'm here to tell you it's the same crap! Stomach cramps, irritability, waking up every couple hours at night, relentless, you're-gonna-DIE-IF-you-dont-smoke style cravings... I'm not gonna have the mental fortitude to go through this again. 

Just needed to vent to people who get it. Thanks folks.

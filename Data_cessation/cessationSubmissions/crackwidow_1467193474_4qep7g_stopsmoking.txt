Dreams

Hi all,

Long time lurker, first time submitter.

As per my badge I'll be two years quit in August (yay!). Over the last two weeks though, I've had recurring dreams in which I'll start smoking again. They're quite vivid - it always happens when I'm right in the middle of something. Out of nowhere someone will offer me a packet of cigarettes, and without a second thought I'll light one up.

After I've done it I always feel guilty for blowing my streak, let myself down for no reason etc. It's the weirdest thing. They've come completely out of nowhere as well; I've had zero temptations during the day, the thought of smoking doesn't even cross my mind. But when I'm asleep it keeps happening, last night must've been the 4th dream I've had about it recently.

It's so strange. I have had dreams like this before but never so concentrated and vivid. Anyone else ever experience this after being quit for so long???

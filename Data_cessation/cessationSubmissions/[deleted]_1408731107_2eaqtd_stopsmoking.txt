How do I start to stop?!

I'm 25F, smoking since I was 12.   
Use to smoke a pack/day. I'm at about 0.5 pack/day or less.  
My siblings and father smoke, as does my significant other, and 90% of my friends - *feels like I can't get away from it.*   
   
I think the big problem is that I've convinced myself that *I love smoking*.   
I know this is wrong, its not the cigarette - its the "break" I get from everyday life.   
I've tried the patch, the inhaler, the books, the "support/info hotlines", the pills (Champix - they were awesome at first, then when the double dose came I began throwing up).   
I need to end this already, I can't financially afford it and I already have enough chronic illnesses (two confirmed, possibly three, auto-immune diseases, and chronic migraines) and I don't need more on top of those..   
   
Where should I start, how can I get through this. I feel hopeless.  
Any advice is appreciated.

My life.

So I started smoking at the age of 12, young I know. Me and my mates all smoked, 3 of us started, and the rest followed. Our whole school class (pretty much) smoked. This wasn't serious, a few fags here and there. It got worse, we started stealing cigarettes from shops, lighters, anything like that as we were too young to buy them. We used to sneak into restaurants with cigarette machines and try and use them secretly, this went on for years. When I was about 15 years old, my Dad found out, went fucking mental and flipped out at me, I was pretty scared that night and it was all to do with smoking. I have never felt so scared in my life, he really hated the idea I was smoking. I carried on, like most teenagers, I rebelled (idiot) I continued to buy more cigarettes, different types, small, normal, tobacco, whatever. At this point, he knew but my mum didn't, she HATED the idea of anyone smoking as it's what really messed up my Grandad, badly. I first tried to stop at the age of around 16/17 but fucked it up royally on the first day. Around 9 or 10 failed attempts after this led me to where I am now. I am now 22 and after a week of partying, smoking and drinking, my throat and chest were completely fucked, really bad. Me and a mate decided, this is it, this has to be the end, we need to stop this. Prior to this we smoked like it was going out of fashion, a horrendous amount of cigarettes. This really felt like the time had come, this was it. And here I am now, 45 days without a single puff and I am never going back. He has done the same too, both on 45 days now. We support the shit out of each other and it's a really good thing to be able to do. I would suggest anyone to do the same, give up with a friend and support each other as much as possible, it really IS possible to stop guys. Thanks so much to everyone here for the support, let's keep it going!

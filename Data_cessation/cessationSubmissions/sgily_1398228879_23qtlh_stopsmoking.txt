Dealing with episodes / panic attacks?

I read that these are common symptoms about a week or so into quitting. (Quit 9 days ago, smoked for 7 years). About once a day I get an episode that feels similar to a general adrenaline rush. Heart starts racing like crazy, breathing gets shortened, and feels like head is spinning circles. Any general advice on how to push through all this? About the only thing that has stopped me is

1) Admitting to my friends and family that I failed to quit again

2) These symptoms only go away by actually quitting. 

When the episodes do come, I find myself just pacing around in circles yelling at myself like a mad man to not be so weak. I also have been practicing breathing exercises / meditation.

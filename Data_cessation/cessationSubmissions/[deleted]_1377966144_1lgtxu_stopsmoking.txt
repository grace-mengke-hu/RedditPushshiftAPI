Going to my first party since I gave up...

Hey guys, first time posting here! After a lot of failed attempts I recently decided that I was officially going to kick the habit. So far it has actually been pretty easy for me, but I know the hard part is coming tonight.

In a few hours I'm going to a house party with all my friends, of which a good 70% smoke. Smoking has always been a really easy way for me to interact with other people and I'm worried I'm going to feel out of the loop and left out of conversations. Obviously not smoking is something I really am serious about but I'm worried that once the drinks start to go back the thought of smoking won't sound like such a bad idea.

Has anyone got any advice on how to still remain a part of conversations and having a few drinks without giving in? Thanks for reading!

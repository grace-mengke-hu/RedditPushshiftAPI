After 20 days, i've smoked two cigs.

I don't know what to do, everything was actually fine till yesterday. Yesterday i was so nervous and had HUGE cravings, wich i didn't have till yesterday. Today i woke up, and i was so nervous i had a feeling i have to break something. After lighting a cig i feel so calm. What do i do guys?

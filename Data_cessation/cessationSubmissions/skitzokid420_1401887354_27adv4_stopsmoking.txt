Today marks day 30 cold turkey after smoking for 10 years!

I crave a cigarette every day.  But within a minute the craving goes away.  I've had issues quitting in the past because I frequent bars that allow smoking and I have friends who smoke.  But this is my last time quitting.  I can even say no to a cigarette while I'm drunk now. I know I am done smoking for good!

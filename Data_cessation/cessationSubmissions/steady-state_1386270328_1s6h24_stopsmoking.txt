A year and a day! Woohoo, hooray!

I didn't really think I'd have a proud moment at a year until I thought about it for real today. I can hardly remember what it felt like to want to get up, go outside and have a cigarette. Sure I still crave nicotine occasionally. But just getting up and walking outside to stand for 5 minutes seems like the craziest idea ever. Obligatory thanks to this subreddit, Mr. Carr, and my friends that pushed me.

Trying this again!

Been trying to quit since Friday.I figured after Thanksgiving would be a good start since I have the week off from work. Only problem is I live with another smoker. It didn't go well. I really want to do this cold turkey. I've tried the patches in the past (I've quit for up to a year at time) but don't like how they make me feel. Tachycardia, constantly slightly nauseous and difficulty sleeping/weird dreams. 

I tried again on Monday since I would be home alone while they were at work. Only problem is they left half a pack of cigs behind. I tried distracting myself. Cleaned the house. But, I knew the pack was there. So, I smoked one, then two.  I decided to go shopping to get my mind off of it. I picked up a pack of cigarettes with the intention of replacing the opened pack with the new one. I thought it would be less tempting to take "just one" from an unopened pack. My plan was to destroy and throw out the rest of the half pack. Out of habit, when I arrived home, I opened the new pack by mistake. So much for that plan. I wound up smoking the rest of the half pack plus a few from the new one. 

Thought I would reset and try again this morning. Exact same scenario. THE PACK IS RIGHT THERE! Oh, and I've already had 2. I reset my quit date/time on my smoke free app (again!). 1hr 36min. At this point I just want to make it 24hrs.

Anecdote I want to share in honour of my 3-month anniversary

So at a family gathering a few weeks ago we were hanging out outside and my step-mother and step-sister decided to have a smoke. The smell of those things reminded me of that numbing rush I used to get when I had one after a while. Needless to say I was very tempted to ask for one.

So my step-sister then asked me "do you still smoke?" to which I replied "Mehhh, I could have one" and before I could end my sentence the rest of the family went, "No you don't! You've been so far yet, you don't start again now!" I was so surprised, it brought me back to Earth and I remembered again all the reasons why I stopped: smokes cost money, they fuck up my lungs, they make my life revolve around the addiction, etc.

So I thank my family for being so supportive even though some of them smoke. Now when my step-mother asks me if I mind the smell I answer that I do get more tempted when I smell it, then she gets more cautious with the smoke.

My point is: If you feel tempted, it's better to acknowledge it and get over it than to fight it by trying to ignore it. Also if you have supportive people around you it makes it that much easier.

6 days... 

I can't say that I willingly quit at the time, last Wednesday I got a serious upper respiratory infection. To the point where I had to use an inhaler again. I had asthma when I was young, and it got me thinking... I can't go back to inhalers. I can't. Plus the fact that I have been incapacitated for this long has just completely turned me away from it all. I don't need it, but I want my hands to keep busy. 

I can honestly say I've been 6 days without a smoke now. At work, I'm bringing books, not snacks, because I'm trying to maintain/lose weight and get healthier in more than one way. Here's to kicking the habit and saying I don't need it anymore. Here's to me saying I don't want to do an injustice to my family, and having them watch another family member die of lung cancer. Here's to me finally saying that I forgive, and love my self...

My name is James, and I say no to this slavery.

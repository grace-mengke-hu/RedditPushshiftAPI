im at 5 days on the dot of NO nicotine

it was a random decision that surprised everybody i know (including myself), i went from 2 packs a day to nothing at all and i am confident in saying that i will stick with it and anybody else doubting themselves just say FUCK IT and do it, you can stick with it if i can, smoker of 15 years quit cold turkey, im 28 and i will not be going back to the dark side

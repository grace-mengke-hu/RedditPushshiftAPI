so, um i stopped smoking last night? cold turkey

its been roughly 12 hours so far... only slept for 4-5 hours of that, considering i would smoke 20-30 a day, to go basically 7-8 hours, without having a fag is amazing for me! any ways its a start, im still young ( 20 ) , and ive been smoking for around 4 years.

 i wish i could just give up on the spot, but so far so good!
never posted here before, but i was just hoping, that if i have something like this to write about my days, aswell to get me concentrated on quitting, it should give me even more of an incentive to do it! wish me luck (:

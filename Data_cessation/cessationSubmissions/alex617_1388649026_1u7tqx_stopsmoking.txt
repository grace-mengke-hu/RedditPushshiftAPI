3 weeks - my new record, don't know how I did it...

First time I've made it this far on my own since the first day I had a cigarette that gave me a nicotine rush. It really feels different this time, I wish I could explain it to other struggling addicts but I have this unbreakable inner belief that this is it for me.

I hope I'm not speaking too soon, maybe at the 3 month mark I will write my guide to quitting if I figure out how my mentality switched. Today is the first day I had a thought about a cigarette and for a moment it felt like something foreign for me.

I made up my mind to never smoke again, nor entertain ideas of smoking someday. I purposely quit before new years because I don't want to be a cliche new years resolution quitter. 

I never thought I could stop, I've read Allen Carr, tried the e-cigs, zyban(wellbutrin), therapy etc yet still felt absolutely trapped to the addiction. Now I'm on the way to freedom and it's far better than I expected.

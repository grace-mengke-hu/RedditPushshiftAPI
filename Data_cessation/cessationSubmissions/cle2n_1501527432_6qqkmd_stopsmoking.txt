Just need to vent...

This is the longest I've ever gone cold turkey. It's going... alright

PROS: I started exercising every other day, been going steady for 2 months now (I just ran 5k without stopping for the first time in my life). Needless to say I no longer get winded going up stairs. I'm no longer having chest pain (which is originally why I decided to quit). I can smell properly again. The biggest bonus though is that when I'm in a good mood I enjoy it more because I'm not craving that additional hit of dopamine as a "celebration" for feeling good. When I feel good, I just enjoy feeling good. I feel more present. 

CONS: When I'm not feeling good? I feel fucking awful. Unmotivated, depressed, borderline suicidal (I'm not going to kill myself but I sure as hell don't want to be alive), self-conscious, and I get these anxiety attacks that feel like there's a hummingbird where my heart should be. Smoking was keeping all that in check, or helping to bottle it up... I just know I was a more stable and confident person in my down periods when I could escape life for a smoke. I've had multiple breakdowns in front of my girlfriend where I just can't sort out my thoughts and I feel like the whole world is against me, and all I can do it cry in a massive release, or stare blankly at nothing while my body bottles it back up and it feeling fades away.


Anyway, I just needed somewhere to put this all down...  it's been a serious struggle the past month and I needed to share it with people who don't know me, because that's an oddly comforting feeling.


Thanks for listening.

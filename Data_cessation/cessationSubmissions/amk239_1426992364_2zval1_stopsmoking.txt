Advice to get my Dad to quit smoking?

My dad knows that smoking is bad for him, but he won't quit. He was in the hospital over a year ago for a few days and when he returned home, he did not smoke for a few days. But eventually he started sneaking them, even if it was just one a day. Now he is back to old ways of smoking probably a pack per day. My dad is retired, I am away at school, my mom works 8-5, and my siblings are all older and living away from home, so my dad is home alone a lot. Because of that, even if he tries to stop, there will not be anyone home to help him when he has an urge to smoke. I know it is his decision but I was wondering if anyone has any advice that might help?

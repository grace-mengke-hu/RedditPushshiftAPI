Weird question

I'm just past my first month after having been a pack a day for about 20 years (YAY!), but why haven't I started coughing up all the garbage from my lungs yet...? My lung capacity definitely feels larger and I'm no coughing in the mornings anymore at all, but I feel like I should be hacking up what must be in there. Anyone else going through the same thing?

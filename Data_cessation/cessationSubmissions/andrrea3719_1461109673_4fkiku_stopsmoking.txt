Day 1 complete :)

Day one is done!  Had about 6 or 7 cravings throughout the day but I think they were more out of habit - regular break times at work, walking to and from the subway, after dinner, etc.  I do feel a bit super-hero ish - I honestly don't think I've gone this long without a cigarette for 15 years maybe?  

Plus as a bonus I went to the gym this evening and I feel like I actually had more endurance (not sure if that's in my head, but I'll take it!).

I am kinda worried about tomorrow - wonder if that's when real withdrawal will kick in?

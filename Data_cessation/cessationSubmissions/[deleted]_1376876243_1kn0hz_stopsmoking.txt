Joining the navy want to quit.

I joined the navy August 26th and I really want to quit smoking before I ship (Dec 2nd) I am 18 and have been smoking for 7 years which is horrible I know. Are there any tricks to help with doing it cold turkey? I usually smoke a little bit after I wake up after dinner and several between. I am not sure if this is the right subreddit but it seems like a good one.

Best support?!

My husband is on his 4th attempt to quit smoking. At his worst he was smoking about 1-2 packs a week, mainly when we are with friends. He's associated smoking with drinking/socializing and has asked me to not have any alcohol in the house while he's trying to quit (sucks for me but it seems really important to him so I'll oblige the request).

I've never been addicted to cigarettes, they make me incredibly nauseous so I cannot relate to his plight. That's why I'm asking the people who know what he's going through, what can I do to help him?! 

One thing I will say is that I am Native American and Tobacco is a sacred plant in my culture. I use it Traditionally and unfortunately it'll be in the house (and on me at all times) where it needs to be Traditionally stored and not hidden away. I certainly won't use it around him but...it will be present for me and the children to access for ceremonies, cultural norms. How much of an issue might this cause? So far he hasn't said anything about it as I've been super mindful to not draw too much attention to it since he's trying to quit again.

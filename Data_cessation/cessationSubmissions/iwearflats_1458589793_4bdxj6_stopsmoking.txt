I 'quit' just under 2 weeks ago - withdrawal symptoms.

for someone who used to smoke just over a pack a week, it has been hard to quit cold turkey, but luckily I was sick for a week and that kind of kickstarted everything. 

But obviously I got all the withdrawal symptoms - anxiety, irritability, dizziness etc. Which were starting to fade away. However, this Saturday I had 3 cigarettes (1 in the morning and 2 at night). And now my throat is scratchy and I am losing focus. Is it normal that my withdrawal symptoms have come back from 3 cigarettes? (In the two weeks I haven't had any cigarettes except for those 3).

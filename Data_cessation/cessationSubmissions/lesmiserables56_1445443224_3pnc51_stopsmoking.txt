I need help...I don't know what to do

About 2 weeks ago I went back to smoking after being smoke free for over a year. I thought I could control the addiction at first and not smoke a lot but within 3 days I was smoking over half a pack a day. My quit date was this past Sunday, October 18th, and I was using the 14mg patches, but I didn't use a high enough dose, and that day I found out that everyday next week I have either an exam or a major paper due. I have bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety, so of course, after finding this out, I had a major panic attack and caved and bought a pack. I'm in nursing school so it is very demanding and high pressure. I also have a very stressful fast food job and I work 4 days this week, along with my early clinical days. I don't know what to do. There is a part of me that doesn't want to quit, even though I know I have to since you aren't supposed to smoke in nursing school. I have quit before, but it wasn't during school so I am very unsure of myself. I don't know if I can handle the stress of quitting smoking, along with the intense stress of school, and also of work. I'm also afraid that all of this stress will trigger a depressive episode with my bipolar disorder. I know what to do to quit but I'm scared, unsure of myself, and I need to motivate myself to truly want to quit smoking 100% rather than only 60%. Sorry about the long post, I just really need some help to figure out if I should postpone my quit date until after my exams next week or just bite the bullet and get it over with.

afraid of relapses

I made it all the way through my wedding and a super drug-filled after party, surrounded by smokers, and didn't smoke a single puff or want to. But then I got reeeeaaaally drunk when I was feeling depressed a few weeks ago and I dug up this super old cigarette that had fallen between my fridge and the kitchen counter like 8 months ago. It was broken and I drunkenly repaired it then went for a drunk walk and smoked it. I still haven't told my husband about my relapse.

I'm ashamed, and embarrassed, and I'm still scared of going back. There are so many reasons to stay smoke free but I've stopped reminding myself of them all the time, and it gets easier to think it's not a big deal to smoke just 1 when I'm not constantly thinking about how happy I am to not be smoking anymore.

I know what I have to do - watch my alcohol intake, think more frequently about the benefits and life I've regained from being smoke-free. I guess I just wanted to come clean.

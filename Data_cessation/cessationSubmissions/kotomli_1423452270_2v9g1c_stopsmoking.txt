was almost at 2 weeks, and ended up smoking last night.

I posted on here yesterday before I went out to drink with my sister and then some friends, I was very worried about drinking and wanting to smoke and what did I do? I ended up smoking and buying a pack. I also smoked one today. You really can't just have one if you go back. I have thrown out the rest of the pack and have reset my quit smoking app/ my badge on here.  I have also decided to not drink anymore( I never really drink anyways) until I feel confident I will not want to smoke while drinking. Sorry this is so long, just needed to vent >.<

I Won't Miss: Part II

It has been 22 days since my [last confession](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6zhb7b/still_at_it/), and a whole month since my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6tm608/i_wont_miss/)....

I'm inching ever closer to Day 1:

Some further notes to myself:

I'm currently 96 days alcohol-free, and delighted with my progress...

I no longer smoke any combustible plant matter in bed, and my smoking has been successfully confined to the kitchen...

I now have a working e-cigarette (more-or-less), which dribbles fruity goo and makes me cough, but it's still better than smoking...

My bong is in working order, should I wish to partake of the Devil's Lettuce... I no longer feel it appropriately professional or courteous to smoke a joint when I am doing work for someone, even if they don't mind and I can get away with it...

As further motivation to myself, here is a [picture of the contents of my ashtray](https://imgur.com/a/MxG0J).... at a quick count, that's about 80-ish fag ends.... I smoked all those over the course of a mere few days... yuck.... 

I've been at this for over 15 years now, that probably adds up to enough fag ends and nasty dirty ash to fill a swimming pool... Quite aside from the horrendous expense, which has lined the pockets of Big Tobacco and the Gubmint Coffers while I am flat broke...

I will ask myself: *do I want this cigarette right now*?

Maybe I feel like I do...

*Do I want ALL of those cigarettes in the Past and the Future*?

I rather think not....

Further thoughts to follow....

Edited to add:

I have a Doctor's appointment tomorrow for an unrelated matter; I'd better not have a cigarette before I go... Perhaps I'll ask her to tell me sternly that I need to stop smoking (tried patches and gum and Zyban before but that didn't really do it for me) in order to imprint that message into my brain.... 

I've also spent the last couple of weeks smoking through a really heavy cold, as usual, which I virtually predicted in my very first post here... that was silly... I've been coughing up all sorts of yick... hopefully this'll be the last time I smoke through a cold....

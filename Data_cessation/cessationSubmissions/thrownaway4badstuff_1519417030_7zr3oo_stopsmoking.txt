Decided to stop 5 hours ago- wish me luck.

So I have something like a 30 year smoking habit.
 On Tuesday night I didn't sleep well, running hot and cold and getting a little disoriented. To summarise, I'm experiencing very bad fever that's landed me on my ass. Chest is making a rattling noise and I can't inhale on a cigarette without a painful coughing fit.i normally really enjoy a smoke but at the moment it's vile. 
 I think I'm going to have another few days of feeling horrible at least. Temp 38 right now. I'm pretty much lying in bed dozing, in pain,actually smoking is painful and I was stubbing them out. 
So I figured why not get rid of cigs and tough it out. I've got a 1mg Nicotine spray and that's taken the edge off for me. 
I got my daughter to give away my cigs, honestly I don't think I can face getting outside to buy any replacements or even drive to a shop. It feels like climbing a mountain to do much of anything. 
I'm planning to take it an hour at a time and do deep breathing to help me out. I expect to be waking up during the night and hopefully can just chill until the morning comes. I'm 5 hours in. Want to come back here and say I've reached 24 hours. 
Maybe documenting this will help my resolve.

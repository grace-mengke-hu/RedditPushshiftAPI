smokefree since yesterday

Hey,
I quit smoking yesterday and its pretty hard.
I have been a smoker for 10 years and as my best friend stoped smoking this was the point for me to finally stop it too.
I really struggle with the negative sideeffects the toughts about a smoke are always on my mind, im sitting in class and im thinking about it 24/7.
Also i feel pretty downcast, i have no other "physical sideeffects" yet only the (maybe typcial?)mental ones: feeling down, feeling like you are missing something, feeling depressed, being unable to be happy..
I also suffer from slight depression which i treat with meds when things get to serious.
but i know i can do it , i've alwas had a strong will and reached most of my goals which i once set myself as a target.

maybe you guys have a few words for me how to get trough the first few days, also i would like to know how long did that "strong withdrawal" last as you guys stopped.
i hope the turkey goes away soon.

P.s excuse me if there are some grammar/spelling mistakes, im not a native speaker

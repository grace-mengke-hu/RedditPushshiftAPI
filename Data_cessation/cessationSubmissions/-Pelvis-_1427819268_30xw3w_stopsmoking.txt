I was a smoker for ten years, and quit a few days ago. Here's my story so far.

I started smoking when I was fifteen, and I quit four days ago. My twenty-sixth birthday is in a few days. 

I figure I've done it for a little over a decade, I know what it's like, that it's expensive, and that it's detrimental to my health. Why make that eleven years?

I had an epiphany yesterday.

I was on my bike, pedaling fast through a light drizzle, working up adrenaline.

It is the first time since I was fifteen that I didn't feel short of breath in this state, and it felt amazing. Normally, my lungs say "slow down a bit, or it will hurt later".

I told my body to go faster, and it did without complaining. This was so liberating.

I yelled with joy as I sped past the cars.

It just felt so amazing to feel the oxygen feed my muscles without anything gumming up the works!

I keep thinking about how badly I crave a cigarette, and I have to leave my wallet at home because I don't trust myself yet. I think yesterday's experience really helped to remind me why I'm doing this, and I'll think about that the next time I feel weak.

Any tips or words of encouragement are welcome! Stay strong, everyone!

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your support! I think the worst is over. I can now trust myself with my wallet (haha!), but I'm still avoiding alcohol for now, since that was a huge craving trigger for me in the past.

I'll stick around and help the new people out, as you did for me.

You have convinced me, and my (previously) addicted brain, that I am making the right decision!

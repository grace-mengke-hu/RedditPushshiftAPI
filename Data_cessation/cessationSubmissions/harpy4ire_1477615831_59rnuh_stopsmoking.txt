Reset

The past couple of months have been hell. My brother nearly died, my cat did die, my sister found something that may indicate cancer. Through it all I was so busy I didn't have time to think. Until yesterday when I finally got to finish processing something about a 'friend' that I kind of wish I'd never found out. And I smoked.

But the cigarettes didn't make anything better. They actually made me feel worse. Stood through hellfire just to let some two-faced spineless twit get to me that much. To let someone who in reality is so insignificant have that kind of power over me, to let cigarettes have that power. I am so disappointed in myself. 

Let the counter start again.

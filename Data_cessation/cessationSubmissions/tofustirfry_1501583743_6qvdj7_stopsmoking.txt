Day 20: 3 mile hike, tricep/trap/ab lift, no snooze, no smokes, no drinks

The big 2-0!:-) it's funny, it now feels so long ago that I was a pack a day smoker and 12 pack a day drinker but saying it out loud, 20, seems so little. Oh well, I'm sure the next 20 will fall by even quicker.

Woke today around 7:30 and quickly made breakfast and a packed lunch. Girlfriend, pup and I went on a nice hike that ended at some swimmable waterfalls with fruit trees along the way. Got home by 1pm and was able to start on a deep clean and rearrangement of the home and office. She worked in the yard while I repaired broken appliances. Bought some new plants for the garden and spent time planting them together. When heading to dinner - I noticed a really nice gym only 1 mile from home (!!!) that somehow I've missed all these years. Popped in to check rates and now here I sit at 12:30am just finished a nice long two hour workout :-) wonderful how life works out.

Anyways, how was your day? Hope you found a way to grow and better your life.  Tonight - I will not smoke or drink with you. Night night

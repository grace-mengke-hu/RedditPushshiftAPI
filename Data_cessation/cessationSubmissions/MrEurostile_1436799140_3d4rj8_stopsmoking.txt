I feel like I'm empty

I thought 3 first day were the hardest, well maybe I was wrong !
It's not just that I don't know what to do with my hands, it's that I don't know what to do with *myself*.

I never felt so out of energy and unmotivated than I do right now...Worst thing is, I don't really *crave* for cigarettes. I know it possibly could give me some energy to go through the day but I just don't want to smoke. But neither do I want to work, or go out, or see people.

So I was wondering whether some of you were in the same situation or not.

Good luck to all of you quitters :)

Binge eating?

Today is my 49th day being smoke free. I had actually *lost* weight the first couple weeks or so after my quit date, wasn't eating any more than usual, I exercised when I could and I was doing and feeling great! This last week and a half seems like I am totally in control during the day of what I'm eating, never really hungry, but once I get home in the afternoon I binge eat whatever I can find. I then of course immediately regret everything, not exactly sure why I'm eating, I wasn't even hungry. I understand this usually happens right after you quit smoking but I'm not even sure if it has any connection to my quitting or what, its been almost 50 days! I hate it. Is my binge eating related to my quit this far in? Has this happened to anyone else?

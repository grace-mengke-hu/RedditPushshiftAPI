Yes! 50 days!

Sheeeeesh that felt like a long time, but I feel FUCKING BRILLIANT. I'm learning everyday and I can keep track of time again, not to mention boners. I actually quit most other drugs including alcohol for a little over 50 days, but I still need morning coffee (since I was in high school).  

I also cannot STAND the smell of tobacco anymore, and my cravings are minimal. Cheers, and have an awesome non-smoker day!

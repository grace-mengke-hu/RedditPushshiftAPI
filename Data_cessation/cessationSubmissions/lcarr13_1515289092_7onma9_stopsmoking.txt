Smoker's Flu

I have recently quit smoking, but I have not been a long term smoker, perhaps smoking on and off for a year, having quit with ease once before after only smoking 3-4 cigarettes a day, but more recently it had got a proper grip on me, I would feel incredibly uncomfortable without having smoked in a few hours, and increased my amount to 6-10 a day. I quit two days ago and have been feeling incredibly unwell and been vomiting, however there is also an illness going round my town at the minute. I was wondering if it could be smokers flu, or if I haven't smoked at great enough levels to be susceptible to that?

How Meditation Will Give You Super Powers

Several years ago, Jon Massmann attempted suicide. At the advice of his therapist, he decided to try meditation. Against the advice of his therapist, he decided to dive in head first with a 10 day Vipassana meditation retreat. These 10 days changed everything for Jon.

Meditation literally saved Jon’s life. It also transformed him into an entirely new person. With a new outlook, Jon is currently traveling around the world learning about different styles of Buddhism, while simultaneously writing his book “The Skeptics Guide to Liberation”.

**Learning meditation can be one step in assessing your emotions and controlling your behavior. Just like excessive angriness, happiness, and sadness, meditation can also help control your smoking urges.**

**In this video clip, Jon explains why meditation returns you to the state if childlike wonder where you can lose yourself into nothingness and learn to fully assess your emotions. He highlights that this is the superpower that we all lost the moment we viewed this as "childishness."**

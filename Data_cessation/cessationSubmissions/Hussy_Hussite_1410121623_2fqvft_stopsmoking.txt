Advice needed, trying to avoid triggering a relapse in friend who has recently quit.

A very close friend of mine has finally taken the plunge and quit smoking after a 15 years of the habit. I am so happy and proud of them I can't even put it to words. They are only two weeks in, but I feel like they have it on the run this time. You can only imagine my trepidation in bringing up something with them that needs to be addressed.

Without divulging too much, the core of the problem is that I need to set some boundaries in our friendship.  I know that they in no way intend to cause me hurt, yet their use of avoidance strategies and negating my existence plays right into the words of someone who once abused me.  I can't tippy toe any more. I may need to step back as a friend for a small period of time if they can't treat me as I feel I should be treated. It is this stepping back that I fear will cause a relapse on their part, since I am one of their few remaining close friends.

If you were my friend, how would you want me to approach you with something that may be difficult for you? How do I assert my needs, while still showing support for you? 

Thank you for listening.

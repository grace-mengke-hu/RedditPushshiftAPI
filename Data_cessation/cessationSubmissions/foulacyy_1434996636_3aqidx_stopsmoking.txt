To those with 6+ months....

What benefits are you experiencing? I'm 27 days cold turkey and my energy is a lot better, food taste better, I've actually lost weight through being able to run. I have the occasional craving but nothing awful because i deeply believe i said fuck cigs and am not going back. What do i have to look forward to in the days to come benefit wise?

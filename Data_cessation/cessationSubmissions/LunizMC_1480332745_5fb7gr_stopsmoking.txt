It's been a while, but I haven't forgotten

3 months today.  I haven't really been on for a few months either, but I'll never forget the support this website provided during those first few weeks.  Not sure I could have done it without a lot of people from here.  Still going strong, and still determined not to go back.  I still think about it quite a lot, especially during the weekends, but the inclination to actually smoke is really quite subtle, and easy to dismiss.  I've started dreaming about it much less, that part of giving up isn't pleasant at all, so thankfully that seems to be subsiding.  For you recent quitters, keep it up, just the feeling of being free of it, is worth it alone.

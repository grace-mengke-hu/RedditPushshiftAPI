Vaping is a godsend

Bought my first vape today. Cold turkey hasn't really worked for me the few times I've tried it and other NRT like patches or gum make me feel gross for some reason. But I bought a vape today figuring that it would pay for itself in about 2 weeks. This is the first time in a very long time that I haven't felt panicked by not having any cigarettes nearby. Also not having to stand in the cold and no more tobacco smell is a huge plus. I think this is going to be my last time "trying" to quit.

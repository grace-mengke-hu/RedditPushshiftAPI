Day 20

Woke up at sunrise and feel good today. It’s so nice to begin to stack on top of each other.  I think it’s been over 20 years since I went 20 days without inhaling some sort of smoke.

I’m proud of myself, however I am aware of the risks at this point. It’s easy to slide back. My resolve is ratcheting up and I am going to recommit to all of the tools I have at my disposal to insure success.

- /r/stopsmoking
- pushups when cravings come
- staying away from alcohol until further notice
- staying away from energy vampires and those I know will easily anger / hurt me
- plenty of snacks around
- morning shower meditation
- gallon of water each day
- reading Allen Carr on kindle instead of mindless internet
- daily posts to this sub as my journal
- no pot until further notice
- stop smoking app to track progress
- humbly letting those around me know I do not smoke cigarettes


What else am I missing??? Is there anything else anyone might suggest to help my journey???

Many thanks to everyone for the help and support.  It means a lot.

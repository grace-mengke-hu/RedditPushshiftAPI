How do you stop, when you don't want to stop?



I've heard several times, "When you want to, you will quit smoking." But the only thing I want more than to quit, is to smoke one more.

I heard, "Don't try to quit, just stop smoking." Which seemed smart in a way, but was of no real use. 

Sometimes I think, if I stop smoking and i'm still depressed, then what? What windmills will I fight then? So I say, "I'm trying to quit, that's why i'm being a depressing asshole."  Then upon realizing how I am being perceived, I eagerly identify the cause and buy another pack.

It feels like the ritual of smoking has become so enmeshed with my psychological, emotional, and spiritual battles that unless I can tackle them all at once, I won't be able to tackle any separately. Yet part of me blames smoking to some degree for all the other problems. 

Every once in a while, I will want to quit, but like sexual shame, the urge always seems to be mounting an offensive (too depressing a post for puns you fucks). So how do you quit when you don't want to, when it's all you have to punctuate the hours?

My problem and worries. Talking it out while I begin my journey.

Hey all,

I'd always sit outside and read this sub while smoking, and many times I'd consider just deleting it and not looking anymore. Thankfully, I didn't. Because reading all your stories really helped me get to this point, which is trying to quit smoking. 

I know I'm going to have some future problems when it comes to quiting, hopefully hearing some of your past experience may help. 

I have horrible anxiety, depression. Smoking has been my crutch for a long time. I have a very specific routine and jumping out of that routine causes panic attacks constantly. Trying to push smoking out is going to be a big deal (but I hope I can push through it). I don't drink alcohol or smoke weed or take any sort of pills. I hate the feeling of not being in control or not being myself. This is the biggest thing that has kept me running back to smoking. If I have the smallest feeling of being "drunk" or somewhat not all there I freak out and grab right for the smokes. Has anyone had to deal with things like this? What has been one big thing when it comes to anxiety/depression and quiting smoking? I should mention I've tried quitting smoking aids, but I cave almost every time and I believe cold turkey is going to be the only way I kick this habit. 

Thanks in advanced.

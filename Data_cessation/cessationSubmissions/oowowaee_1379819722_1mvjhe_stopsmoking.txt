Start of day four

So, I feel like a bit of an idiot.


I have felt like I have been breathing more easily for the last 24hours.  Maybe I'm having some kind of placebo effect, but I normally get super congested at night and start to snore.


I had a really emotional day complete with tears, and my husband and I got into a fight on the phone...his last words to me were "can you just promise me you won't smoke?".  At the time I told him "fuck you" and hung up on him.  I felt awful...but I was really happy - despite all the drama and emotions, I hadn't even thought of smoking.  I didn't even feel like I *wanted* to smoke - that was pretty amazing to me.

After feeling like I was going insane, I've only had 5 or 6 serious cravings today.  I just spent the evening with my brother, and I realized I didn't think about smoking for 2 hours straight.


My biggest fear initially was that this was going to be my life; feeling insane, constantly trying to dodge cravings...I didn't see how it could get any better.


I'm starting to see that it really might.

Help my girlfriend stop socially smoking

My girlfriend, when drinking with her friends, likes to smoke. She'll only smoke if they are smoking though and will roll up when they start to roll. She won't light up if no one else is smoking at that moment in time, even if they have been that night. She likes to do it the exact same time they do.
I'd like her to stop, and she would too, but it is difficult for her as it has been a habit for such a long time now. She'll never crave a cigarette if no one is having one, and can go for a few weeks without smoking if she doesn't go on a night out or her friends aren't smoking. What ways are there that she can help lower the amount she smokes?
I am contemplating getting her an e-cigarette as I think that having something in her hand to use whilst her friends are smoking would help.
Has anyone else been in a similar situation to this and have any advice?
Thanks

On my 11th day, 4th day without patches - crazy withdrawals

Maybe I just picked up a flu or something at the same time as I stopped using the patches but I don't think so. I'm getting night sweats, fever dreams and a dry cough when I wake up. It took me until my alarm went off to get into some solid sleep. I snoozed for an hour so I don't crash on the way to work.The irritability has been bad but it's dying off.

I just saw a doctor before I stopped the patches and I'm fit as a fiddle. Anyone else get wicked withdrawals like this?

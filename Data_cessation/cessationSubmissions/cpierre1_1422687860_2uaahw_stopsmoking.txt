Harder than I thought

I just dont know how to quit on the weekends? I don't even drink but still crave the cigs. I even have an e-cig. Last two weeks have not smoked during the week though. I've only been a legit everyday smoker for about 2 years between the ages of 22- and 28. I cant remember how i did it before

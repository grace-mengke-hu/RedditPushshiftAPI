Today is my 2nd week cold turkey off of opiates.Tomorrow morning I will be quitting smoking.

2 weeks ago I decided it was time to give up my addiction to Oxycontin, Norco, and other opiates. I am already feeling better regardless of the physical and psychological effects. During that time, I noticed that the pleasure of smoking has not only gone down but has also been a very anxious and unsatisfying task. Smoking in conjunction with the opiate withdrawals has been affecting my emotional response and my energy in an unpleasant way. Conversely, I decided to quit caffeine a few days ago and took immediate notice of how much of a positive difference physical health plays during withdrawals to pain meds. I am now confident that I found my missing "Want" and "Why" to quit smoking: speeding up my recovery by having better physical health and wanting to stop feeding the negative feeling of my current withdrawals. I feel fortunate for having such supportive family and friends for helping me get through the first two weeks off of opiates. I also feel pumped to overcome another challenging obstacle that does not scare me anymore. Wish me luck!

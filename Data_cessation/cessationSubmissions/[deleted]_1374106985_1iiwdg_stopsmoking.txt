Tips?

A little background first.  I'm 17, nearly 18 and have been smoking since about a week before a turned 16 (I know, not very long).  

After almost two years of smoking about a half pack a day, I want to quit.  I have wanted to quit in the past but never really given it much thought, but now I am serious.  My biggest issues are that I live at home, and my father smokes.  My parents also do not know I smoke.  I am definitely addicted, I have stopped before and only made it about 4 days before I really craved and said fuck it.

I feel that without any sort of support from my parents or family this will be a daunting task.  Does anyone have anymore tips about how I could go about quitting discreetly, because it will be apparent something is up if I stop and my behavior or attitudes change slightly.  

Thanks in advance, this sub is really awesome, and what first gave me the idea of quitting before the addiction becomes worse.

What's your experience with quitting cigarettes and alcohol at the same time?

Does anyone have any experience with quitting smoking AND alcohol at the sane time? How did it turn out? I'm a moderate drinker, 3-6 drinks per week. The main issue is that my friends and family like to drink, so I drink when I'm with them. Alcohol is my biggest trigger and I've noticed that once I have a couple cigs while drinking, I'll smoke for a week or two afterwards, with or without alcohol. Im feeling stuck. I've been smoking for 15 years so any advice would be appreciated.

100 Day Check In

Quit and fallen back so many times, and this isn't my longest quit by any means, but it feels good and I'm really trying to make it stick for good.

Physical cravings are gone, but the mental cravings have never really completely disappeared. I've had chances to smoke, but didn't let myself, and for that I'm proud.

I was up to about 2 packs a day until I quit. I'd sit and watch videos on my phone while I chain-smoked a pack at a time sometimes. It made me feel so bad, and I don't know why I would do it.

Just want to encourage anyone else in the sub. If you've quit, stay quit. If you're thinking about it, make a plan and do it. Good luck, everyone. Love this sub and the stories I see posted. Keeps me grounded and encouraged.

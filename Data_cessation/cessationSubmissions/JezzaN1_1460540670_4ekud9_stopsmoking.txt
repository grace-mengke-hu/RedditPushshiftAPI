Girlfriend is quitting smoking - what can I do to best support her?

Hey guys,

Not sure if this post really belongs here or not, but my girlfriend has had another crack at quitting smoking again, and is currently a few days in. I want to know how I can best support her and understand just how difficult it is, as I have never been addicted to any substances before it is something that is outside my realm of expertise. Obviously I understand there is going to be increased moodiness, frustration etc on her part and I am completely fine with that, I just want to know how to encourage her without coming across as being too harsh or pushy, and what I can do when she is in the 'fuck it, maybe i should just have a smoke' type stages. For what it's worth, in the past when she has tried to quit she has used nicotine patches which gave her some pretty heavy irritation (I suspect due to the adhesive).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thankyou!

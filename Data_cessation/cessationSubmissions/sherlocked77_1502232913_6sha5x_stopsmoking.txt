[24F] Help, need to hear your experiences

I've been smoking on and off for 5-6 years. I must admit that I actually like it, but I have to quit because a couple years ago I started to have something close to asthma and smoking even a few has its toll on my lungs and I **have to** stop.

I've never been a regular one pack a day smoker except for stressful occasions. Actually for a while I've been only smoking a few every week (which, as I mentioned, is enough to give me shortness of breath but still not awful), but I lose control on these couple occasions:

**Drinking**: I can't not start smoking the moment my drink arrives at the table. I guess these two are so strongly tied up in my brain that I can't do one without the other and I lose control, sometimes ending up smoking close to a pack on a night out.

**Friends**: I guess I have no non-smoker friends, which makes it so hard to quit because I'm so used to smoking with them. 

Did you have these obstacles on your way to quitting? How did you overcome them?

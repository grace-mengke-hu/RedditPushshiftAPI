There is no cigarette after a meal if the meal never ends

I am going a little crazy with the eating here, but the cravings are hitting me increasingly hard and I am doing everything I can to not smoke. I am eating ALL THE CARBS.

Most importantly, I am not smoking.

Seriously, fuck you, cigarettes, and fuck the control you have had over me for all of my preteen, teenage, and adult life. Fuck you for tainting my childhood. Fuck you too, alcohol. And a big fuck you to you, too, drugs.

I felt childish at work today for the first time in many years. And I hadn't had any carbs for almost 2 days, so it wasn't sugar childishness. It was some sort of... freedom.

I wanted a cigarette, I decided to post here instead

I've been wanting to stop for a long time now, but I always found excuses to do it later. I was reading this sub waiting for my pause to go smoke outside. And I realised now was as good as any other moment to start quitting. So here I am :)

Now I need to figure out what I wil do to replace my next cigarette ...

Update from the guy who wanted help not smoking at a party.

I posted recently seeking some help on how to avoid lighting one up when I've been drinking at a party scenario. Well, one redditor suggested that I try tying a string to my finger as a reminder for all of the reasons I quit; simple I know. I just had to try it. I'm posting now because the results were magnificent. The tiny piece of string not only kept me mentally tough when cravings hit, but it also sparked conversation with a B-E-A-utiful girl I'm now taking out to a movie.  Couldn't have picked a better time to quit. 
 ***TLDR***; I putz string on my finger and might get laid, thanks a bunch reddit =]

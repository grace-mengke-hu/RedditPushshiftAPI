Over the smoking, now with the drinking! Going to finally grow up at almost 27

I'm turning 27 in a couple of days and though I feel confident in my ability to not have a cigarette, I am sure I would smoke a cigarette if I'm drinking. Combine that with the hangover I have right now...I have a new goal! Now that I've quit smoking, I'm going to quit drinking too! That little badge is kind of helpful. I think /stopdrinking badge may also be motivating! 

Anyway, I'm on a college campus that frowns a lot on smoking, so that was helpful for quitting, but the drinking might be different. Everyone except really Christian people and some Asian drink and I am neither Christian nor Asian. I am going to get therapy or something like that, I think. 

The reason I think this post is relevant is because these two behaviors are both very destructive and while smoking is definitely stigmatized, drinking is not usually stigmatized as much(unless you are an alcoholic). Smoking and drinking also contributes to the the life span gap between males and females, especially in countries where it is seen as more socially acceptable for males to drink than females. I am actually a female, so this doesn't apply to me. 

However, I am going to use it as an excuse to feel more ladylike!

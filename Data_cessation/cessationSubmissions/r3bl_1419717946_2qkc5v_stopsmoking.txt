On a NYE it's going to be my first smoke-free month and I'm kind of scared

So, here's my background story since this is the first post of mine in this subreddit. On November the 24th of this year, I said to myself that I _will_ quit smoking before December the 8th. So I gradually lowered the amount of cigarettes I smoke each day and I actually managed to get the job done _7 days earlier_. So, practically, I stopped smoking on December the 1st, with one exception that happened on December the 7th somewhere close to midnight (just to symbolically say to myself that that is going to be the last cigarette in my life).

Now, it's almost a month since I stopped smoking. I don't consider myself weak and I've been able to control myself so far. I stopped thinking about cigarettes, but I always have a pack of cigarettes in my pocket, just in case someone needs one (I know how awful it can be to be in that nicotine crisis).

Now, what I am really scared of is the NYE. To quit smoking, I also gave up on getting drunk over the weekend, but I doubt that I will be able to celebrate NYE without a few drinks, and I'm not sure will I be able to control myself after that.

What is your experience with drinking after you decided to quit smoking?

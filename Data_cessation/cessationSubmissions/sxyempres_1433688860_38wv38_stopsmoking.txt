Today is day 7

For the past year and a half I've been working on quitting. The past several months I'll go a few days without and then have a smoke or two. Unfortunately, I realized that I was having at least one a day recently, which isn't quitting. Soooo... I randomly decided to not have any starting last Monday. So far so good! Today is day 7, which isn't easy considering my fianc√© smokes, most of my friends smoke, and several of my co-workers smoke. This time I'm not really advertising it, which somehow makes it easier.

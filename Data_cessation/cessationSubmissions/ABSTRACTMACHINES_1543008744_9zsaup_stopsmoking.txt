I got really sick and quit smoking on accident.

So I got the WORST lung infection I think I've ever had in my life, and was bedridden for the better part of a week. I've always been asthmatic and could never really smoke when I got sick, but it was typically only for a day or two. I haven't been able to smoke a cigarette for a week at this point, but I'm feeling much better today and I'm kind of worried, because I don't want to start again. I'm a singer and smoking has always been something that has hindered my performance ability... Also worth noting is that I'm a recovering alcoholic and that coincidentally the only way I could quit drinking and doing drugs was to be in jail (for a really long time). But I feel like after this separation out of necessity with nicotine I have a good shot. Anyone else have a similar experience of not being able to smoke for a while and finding they're just better off without it?

Is compassion a perk of becoming a non-smoker ?

So here's me quit cold turkey 333 days ago, and I've been thinking about something. What I now perceive of smoking is dosing myself & numbing it from i'm not sure what. What I realized from this thought is that becoming a non-smoker has evoked this untamed compassion in me towards others. I won't lie to you I still have hateful thoughts sometimes towards other people but it's just different. 

Have you felt something related to this ? if so please contribute.

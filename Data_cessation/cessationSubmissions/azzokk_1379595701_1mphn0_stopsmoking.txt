13 Days! and now things taste funny....

Hey everyone!  Welp another milestone for me officially 13 days without a smoke!  One thing in all this that I have noticed is that my taste buds have changed and things I use to enjoy now suck!  

Most recently I was upset to find that the amazing donuts I use to get from the local gas station, and yeah I know why would you buy donuts at a gas station?!?!  Really do suck...

Anyone else have some things they discovered after they stopped smoking?  Another thing is coffee... ugh...I love coffee...

Today

I stopped at my local shop to buy soda water
I’ve found soda with fresh lime or lemon and heaps of ice helpful with cravings 
That little addict emoji in my head said buy a packet you don’t have to smoke them just have them to show how strong you are
I ignored it and left
Then I went back and bought one
That was 6 hours ago and haven’t opened it
Not going to - as someone posted why do you want to poison n yourself
I’m 15 days of last 22 smoke free and that’s been couple day when relapsed 
Want every day to be smoke free
I don’t want to go back to the beginning
I don’t want to go through that again

Making a cheesecake instead

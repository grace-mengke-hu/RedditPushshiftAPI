Trying to quit after losing my dad is so much harder than I thought it would be.

I'm 21 years old and last week I lost my dad to cancer. My dad was a heavy smoker and two weeks after being diagnosed with lung cancer, he died. I'm now trying to quit, but it's horrible. In addition to be angry about my dad being gone, I'm irritable from trying to quit. I want to quit. I want to be healthy and not rely on anything to keep me stable. But I don't know how to move forward when I'm already miserable because I'm grieving. Has anyone else tried to quit while simultaneously enduring grief? Is it better that I do it this way or should I take these obstacles one at a time despite what my family members tell me? I don't want to hurt them but I think they're underestimating how rough the side effects of quitting can be even when you didn't just lose a parent.

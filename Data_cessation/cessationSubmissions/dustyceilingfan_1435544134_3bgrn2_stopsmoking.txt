Smoker for 15 years trying to quit again. Do incentives work?

It's 10pm on a rainy Sunday night and I just smoke what will hopefully be my last cigarette. I have tried to quit 5 or 6 times before already and failed. I have always loved smoking and I know that I will miss it. My wife quit smoking after having the kids but I have never wanted to kick the habit. 

This time I am going to try to use an incentive to help me quit. I am a musician that can't really affoard the gear I need. I will be putting away $30 a week towards purchasing a $600 electric piano. I hope that this incentive will really give me something to focus on when it gets tough. 

What does everyone think about this method? Is it an efficacious quitting strategy?

Wish me luck.

was tempted today but didn't give in!

So my flair is a lie. I've only not smoked in 18 days and today I started a new job where I watch adults with disabilities. The person I was working with today smokes like a chimney and we have to stay by their side for the whole shift. Well about an hour into my shift she wanted to go and smoke so I had to follow her. I was so close to asking to bum one off of her but I didn't! We went outside two more times after that during my shift and didn't give in!

TL;DR read the title

5 days down

I have been lurking for awhile now and finally decided it was time. I am a 41yo male,  20+ year smoker. Restarted Chantix 5 days ago and started the C25K program as well. I was a pretty active smoker walking on my lunch bresks and i hardly ever smoked at work. First day of quitting combined with the C25K program zapped me. But Wednesday my 2nd day felt great. And today was even better. And to top it off I am an asthmatic from birth and have hardly used inhaler since quitting.

About 8 days in. Why does this seem so easy?

I'm around 8 day's in and this seems too easy. I do feel like shit and i want to smoke but i just dont do it. I have smoked for around 8 to 9 years straight. Does attitude really play such a big part or is there a catch, like the worst feeling is coming?

7.5 months!?!?!

Hey there guys!!! Yes it's true. I thought id die of lung cancer with my legs amputated i loved smoking that much, and i must have tried and failed around once a month for the las t25 years (I'm a singer so it's kinda my job NOT to fuck my throat) but finally i made it this far. I can't tell you my sugar consumption - u would faint - but i prefer it to the endless groundhog day which was my incredibly limited life revolving around those cancer sticks. Now I've rediscovered my spontaneity! I have no fear of going somewhere without my fix, and that ticky timebomb which ruled my life has finally been dismantled.
Yay for us!!!!!!

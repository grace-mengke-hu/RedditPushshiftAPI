Juul fiend

A few months ago one of my close friends bought a juul. She  ended up using very heavily and tried to quit unsuccessful a couple times. Eventually she gave me her juul to keep safe and to help her quit. Luckily I have been on vacation with the juul safe at home, so I have had a good excuse when she's texting me asking for it back. She now is convinced shes over her addiction and will be able to use the Juul with self control and not allow it to control her life. Is she right? Or is her habit going to get back to where it was before she quit if she starts again? What should I tell her?

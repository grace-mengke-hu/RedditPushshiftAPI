After a strong week, I gave in. But I'm straight back on the horse, and more hopeful than ever.

Blah blah blah hard day, and I went out for a drink and a smoke with a friend. The first one tasted and felt awful. And the next, and the next. Throat started feeling utterly horrible and teeth chalky, got through 5 before I just couldn't do any more. Came to realise I prefered my e-cig by the end of the night, and now I know forever.

This week was the warmup run, this time's the marathon. Stay strong guys.

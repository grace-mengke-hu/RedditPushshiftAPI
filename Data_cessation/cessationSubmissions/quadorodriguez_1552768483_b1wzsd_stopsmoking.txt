I cant stop.

I have been smoking for about ten years now. I smoke a pack every 3-4 days. I am trying to do the patches starting out at the middle  patches and they didnt seem to work. Now im trying the 21 mil patches and i still get cravings. Ive tried the gum before and it didnt work. 
Recently i got a caugh that i believe is the smokers caugh.  It wont go away. Its not bad. My phlegm is still normal colored and i dont have shortness of breath unless i breath through my nose. (Its always plugged.) But i want to quit.  So badly. But nothing seems to work. Any advice would be helpful.

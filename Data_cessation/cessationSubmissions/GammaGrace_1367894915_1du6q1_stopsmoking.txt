I'm sorry, but I just have to say it...

Day 4 and this is insanely easy. I don't know why I kept giving in last week, when I was trying to quit. Once you get past the first couple bad cravings, all the other cravings feel pathetic. If you're struggling, it gets so much better. I know I'm not done with the cravings, and my addiction, but I can feel that I'm close to the climax. I just wish I knew it was this easy 10 years ago. What a waste of money, time and energy. My house is already so much cleaner because I'm not preoccupied with smoking and actually notice the mess. I also feel my energy returning and am seriously considering working out. I didn't even do that before I smoked. So, stay strong everyone, and thanks for being here every day!

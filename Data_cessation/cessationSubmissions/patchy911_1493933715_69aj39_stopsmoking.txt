I've smoked a pack+ a day for 17 years. Today is day one going cold turkey...

Fuck I hate this part.  Last time I made it 7 months before (insert stupid excuse) and I started back up.  For 3 years I told myself I'd quit "soon".  Well soon finally got here, so here's hoping I make it 70 years this time around.

My first day of smoking and I want it to be my last.

Hello. 
This is my first time posting something on Reddit so please bear with me.
Today, I fought with my dad (again) over something that I find stupid. I wanted to skip school so I could work on my unfinished assignments, but he didn't allow it because he has trust issues. I don't blame him tbh, as I have lied multiple times, but this time I honestly wanted to work on the assignments. After promising to him again and again, it still was no use. In the end, I told him that I'm not going anywhere. Apparently, this made him extremely angry, he yelled at me and took all the electronics that I constantly use every day to his workplace, which according to him I will not see them again until May. Of course, this was not the first time he has done this sort of thing, yet I still managed to stay away from "bad habits" in order to forget. 
However, today was different. Over a year of constant fighting, and today I had enough. I wanted to forget everything. I wanted to calm myself down. And I thought the easiest way to do that was to smoke despite its bad effects. 
Now, after smoking 11 cigarettes, I didn't forget anything nor did I ever calm down. I felt instant regret and fear. Like am I addicted now? If I stop now what will happen to me? 
I really do not want to continue smoking and I honestly don't know what to do next. I need some advice.
Thanks

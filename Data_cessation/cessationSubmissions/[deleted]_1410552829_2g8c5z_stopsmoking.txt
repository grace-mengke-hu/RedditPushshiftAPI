How do I stop obsessing?

I'm proud that I haven't smoked for a month. I think a brag is fine every once in a while, but I went out to the bar yesterday and couldn't shut up about how I wanted to smoke or how hard quitting is. Most of my friends smoke, so that served as an hourly reminder, but most of the time I would bring it up. My friends say they aren't bother by it, but I can tell it's going to get real annoying, real quick. Does anyone else have this problem?

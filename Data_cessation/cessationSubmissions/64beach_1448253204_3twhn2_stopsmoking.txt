Today was better

Today is my 4th day cold turkey. Yesterday was a tough day. I felt like my adrenaline was pumping, I was so fidgety. So I just got out of the house and walked and walked. Then came home and jumped on the mini trampoline. So I slept well last night. And today was much better, I didn't feel like I was gonna fly off into a million pieces. Guess that nicotine is gone! Good riddance! So proud after 33 years of nicotine addiction and other attempts to stop.

I quit smoking recently and am coughing up black stuff.

(18 years of age) Quit smoking 2 weeks ago and am doing regular nebulizer treatments for bronchodilation. Recently started coughing up this black shit, is this a sign of healing or do I have obstructed breathing pathway disease like emphysema?

I've been smoke free for 1 month, 1 day, 11 hours and 8 minutes

After ending a long term relationship, I've started smoking. Also, during university, I had pretty rough time with my exams (med school), and I could not stop this bad habit.
A month ago, I've decided that enough is enough. I know, it's only a month, but I feel free and happy :) 

Good luck, everybody!

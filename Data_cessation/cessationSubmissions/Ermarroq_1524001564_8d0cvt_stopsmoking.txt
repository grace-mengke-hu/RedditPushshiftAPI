Experienced quiters needed

I have quited many times but it doesnt last more than a few days, I would like to know how does it feels to quit for good, can any of you guys describe how you felt through the whole process and how do you feel now? Do you still have cravigs? any mayor health improve? What about sports? 

This has the only intention to motivate me and other smokers that are struggling to quit.

Smoking is Beyond Stupid. -A drunk smoker.

I've had enough to drink to be typing poorly so please excuse any typos.  I've been completely in my right mind for the past week.  Smoking.  Hahaha.  Acting like it's this big hilarious thing.  Yep.  Smoking again.  Hahahaha.  Jessica is a helpless addict.  Amusing.  Guess what?  Everything that was wrong with me when I smoked has come back.  Mentally and physically. Everything.  My life is so much the worse for it.  I'm so anxious.  I'm missing time with my kids, being sneaky.  I feel like so much shit.  Know how many times I had a headache when I wasn't smoking?  Almost no times.  Know how many times I've had a headache since I started smoking again?  Every single day.  My throat hurts.  My mouth feels raw.  All I taste is ashtray.  Gross.  Burning ashtray.  It's fucking stupid. So tonight, while drunk, I have washed my newly purchased pack in the sink.  Soaked them.  Ruined them and threw them in the trash, where they deserve to be.  Eff the $7.65 or whatever outrageous amount I spent on them.  Eff that.  This isn't funny.  There is no hahahahahahaha...this is my life.  This is my health.  This is my kid's lives.  I don't know why I'm taking this lightly.  I will not.  I can not. Do this.  I won't.  I just know I finally have this quitting thing licked.  

(And, maybe, just maybe, if I read this tomorrow, maybe, I'll remember the rage and conviction I'm feeling right now....)

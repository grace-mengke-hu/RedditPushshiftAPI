In 100 years, people will be appalled that we use our modern tobacco products

Of course, since it is a highly addictive substance, nicotine itself will probably still be used, but the way we use it today will seem absolutely crazy to future people.

I guess e-cigs and the subsequent "analog" smoker bashing culture are pointing to that direction already, but as alternatives to cigarettes and chewing tobacco become more safe and widely used, it will be completely out of fashion and barbaric to ingest nicotine as we do today.

The smoking of tobacco first became popular in the 16th century as a way for the rich socialites to display their ability for conquest in the new world. For many years, tobacco use was held in esteem of the  members of high society until the 19th century when the industrial revolution made it easy for the less well off to get their hands on the play things of the rich. We have been living in the shadow of this trend until it has recently become more of a disgusting habit of the lowest tier of society. 

Eventually, widespread tobacco use will become a thing of the past due to the complete disdain of people to use it or because of regulation preventing the manufacture, sale, and purchase of tobacco products.

Either way, we should be glad that we quit while we did!

Nicotine gum with Chantix?

I’ve been taking Chantix for 9 days and my cravings are really dying down. They’re not as frequent, and when I do have them they’re not as strong. I’m leaving the country for 5 weeks and I’m leaving my vape behind. I don’t want to even be around it on my trip. However, if my cravings do get bad during that time my doctor recommended nicotine gum as an alternative and he said it worked well. Has anyone here tried this method?

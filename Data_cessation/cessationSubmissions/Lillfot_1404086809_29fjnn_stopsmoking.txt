I have no idea how, but I hit two weeks!

I recently decided I wanted to get a Beach 2015 body, giving me a year to get my fucking shit in order.  
  
Step the first: Quit that lung-fucking cardio-killer.  
  
Background: Between 1 and 6 cigarettes per day (controlled intake) **or** "one every two hours" (unchecked intake) **or** party smoking a pack (completely unhinged).  
  
* It started one night when I had smoked the last offender in my pack, I then asked myself if I could quit. The answer was a panicked "NO!", so I quickly walked to the all-night gas station and purchased a new pack.  
* The day after, I just didn't smoke for the entire day, so when I smoked one of the bastards I realized that I could quit if I could wait the entire day for just one.  
* And then I just stuck the 18 (of 19) pack in my backpack and went on with doing summer things. Meeting friends, going to the beach, walking, jogging, drinking...  
  
I have no idea how, but I have now made it to two weeks.  
  
I think just having the pack in my backpack as a [safety blanket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_object) helps a lot!  
  
Some personal achievements of things I did these last two weeks without resorting to my safety blanket, in no particular order:  
  
Sunbathed, got stressed, waited for stuff, drank a little, drank a lot, hung out with chain-smokers, refused **three** offered cigarettes (while drunk off my ass), got shocked, got angry, got blue-balled, handled the pack, took a six-hour drive, took a five-hour drive.

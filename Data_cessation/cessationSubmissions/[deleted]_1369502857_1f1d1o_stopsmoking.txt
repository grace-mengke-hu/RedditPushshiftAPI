Quit yesterday...

Did this a million times before.  Tried everything.  Nicotine anonymous.  Cold turkey.  Gum.  Patches.  Stupid sayings.  Mentors.  Exercise.  Sleep.  Writing.  Accountability groups.  Everything.  

The only thing that keeps me from quitting is the fact that I *can* manage this in my life.  I hate it though.  It killed my dad.  I'm trying this subreddit and the badge thing.  

Anyway, hoping that I can hang my head high soon forever once and for all.

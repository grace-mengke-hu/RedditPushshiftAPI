Going strong, but what about food?

I haven't had a single smoke those last few days, and have been doing everything that was supposed to trigger it, including go out and drink etc. My cravings are during the night, before bedtime, where if it gets too strong I just use a snus (swedish oral tobacco, not the chewable type), and I'm done with it. Max one per day, and planning to get it reduced.

My biggest issue is food, it's like I'm eating a ton of stuff, probably like 1.5x of what I was eating before. Has this happened to anyone else, and if so how did you deal with it?

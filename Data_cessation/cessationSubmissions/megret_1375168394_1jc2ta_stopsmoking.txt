303 days ago I was a 3 packs a day smoker.

I quit Sept 30. People keep asking me how, and I guess the best answer I've come up with is this: Shitty days deserve a better reward than a cigarette.

That little voice that tells you, "Oh shit, what a horrible day. I picked the wrong day to quit! Time to pick up a pack," is a jerk. Yes, you're having a shitty day. Yes, you deserve some kind of reward at the end of the day. But you deserve something *better than a cigarette.*

I had to reprogram my brain to go from "I want a cigarette" to "I want a...something," and figuring out what that something was. A book, candy, a (legal) music download, a game or app, new clothes, a fancy dinner, whatever the fuck. I deserved something, dammit, but I deserved a shit load better than a cigarette. 

Figuring out a new reward for myself was a huge step in quitting. Also, I ate a pound or two a day of baby carrots. Just carried them around in my pocket and glared sullenly at anyone daring to give me a stink eye about it. 

A side note: two weeks into quitting, I was having a rotten day at 5 in the morning, going to work, angry at life. I was crossing the Wabash bridge here in Chicago and asked some guys for a smoke. I explained I was quitting, offered to pay, they just handed it over. I took it to a bench nearby, found a forgotten lighter in the bottom of my bag, and lit up. Holy shit, did that cigarette piss me off. It wasn't relaxing, it wasn't wonderful, it wasn't a step back to a happier time. It just pissed me off. It was my brand and everything, but I only took two drags before stomping it out on the ground. I knew I was done, and that really pissed me off too. But I got over it, and now here I am all these months later, a certified quitter.

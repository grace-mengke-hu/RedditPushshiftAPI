Anxiety from quitting after 14 years

I recently quit smoking,chewing, and the nicotine gum cold turkey two weeks ago. I didn't do them all at the same time but I bounced back and forth. I had a trip to the ER with a panic attack that I thought was a heart attack scare me straight. Ever since that day the anxiety and random panic attacks are still here. I am currently on xanex and it does stop the attacks flat but they still happen most days. I am having my heart checked out the next two days since I went to the ER saying I was having chest pains. Anyone ever have this after quitting nictoine as a long time user? I thought it was suppose to be good after you quit not cause more problems.

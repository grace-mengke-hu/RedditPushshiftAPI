I'm powerless, weak, exhausted after quitting smoking

long story short: i quit 7 months ago and feel very exhausted since then. I sleep 12 hours every night and i need 2-3 hours sleep afternoon. Just to test i started smoking again for a few days and i felt great i sleep 8 hours and have energy all day! I threw the cigarettes away and now im like shit again... really i feel like shit... my grandparents are more active than me! Please give me some advice what to do? How to regain my energy again? is there someone else with similar problems?

EDIT: Dont look at me as someone who try to convince himself to start smoking again! NO! Im done with smoking! I just want to know if there are other people with similar problems.

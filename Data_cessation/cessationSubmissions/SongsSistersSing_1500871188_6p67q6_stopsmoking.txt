Day 1 Without Cigarettes

So I'm about 4 hours into not smoking.  Smoked for about 12 years and ballpark it around 10-15 cigarettes a day.  Lately, I've just been really overwhelmed imagining what I've done to my body.  My lungs, putting it simply, have had quite a life (lots of episodes of bronchitis, pneumonia, chest colds, etc;) and tonight as I lay here with my chest tight--hopefully, just from anxiety--I just keep wanting to kick myself for being such a jackass with my health and making my body feel like a walking time bomb for emphysema, COPD, or cancers.  I'm just experiencing a lot of regret, which is unusual since I've never felt this toward the habit I used to love so much.  I feel like an idiot and it really sucks.

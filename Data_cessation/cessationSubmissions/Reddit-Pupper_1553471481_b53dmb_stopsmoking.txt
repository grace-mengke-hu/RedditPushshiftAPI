Preparing for a good week

After a heavy weekend on an alcohol/drug fueled 48hour bender while battling crippling depression I have received a breath of fresh air and realize how badly I donâ€™t need those things anymore.
I felt so low.
But.. with the help of reddit and reading other inspirational pieces I got off my laptop , walked into my sitting room and opened the stove and threw the cigarettes right into the middle of the fire.
Tommorow I start a clean state, regular exercise,regular mindfulness etc. I want this more than anybody. 
I. Can.do.this.

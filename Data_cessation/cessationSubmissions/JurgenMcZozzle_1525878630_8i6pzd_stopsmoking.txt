the habit of smoking when drinking

I've been told to switch environment whenever I feel like smoking, worked pretty well up until I drink.

I have an habit of smoking when im drinking, I dont drink that much but it ruins my whole experience because I just keep on fighting my drunk self into not smoking, which is very hard considering that well, im drunk. I either suffer the entire night or I break and buy a box, and then im stuck with it and all my hard work is in the trash.My usual tactics of switching the environment dont work because no matter where ill be ill still be drunk.Anyone can share an advice? inb4 "just dont drink", I do it at best once in 2 weeks and in moderation with people, im fine in that regard.

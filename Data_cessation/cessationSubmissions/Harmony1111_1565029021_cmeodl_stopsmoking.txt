First Birthday since 1996 without a cigarette!

I quit cold turkey- 7 months, 5 days ago. I used to smoke at least a pack a day. I had some friends over to celebrate my recent birthday (smokers and non-smokers) and we were talking about how I quit. I never thought I would- but here I am- nicotine free 😎 I could not have done it without this subreddit! Thank you all for sharing your successes and struggles! Sending positive vibes to everyone on this journey with me! ☮️💟

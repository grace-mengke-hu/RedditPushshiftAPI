Had a rough day

So some unfortunate situations, which pretty much stressed me out, have occurred today. I wanted to smoke so badly to help me "cope"  with this but instead I decided to go for a run, at 12 AM with freezing temperatures outsides. Craving totally subsided without lighting a smoke. Feeling proud of myself :) Keep on quitting!

What is the best way to get the smell out of my pickup truck? It's starting to really bother me.

Hey Everyone!  

I'm on day 26 smoke free after a pack a day for 40 years.  

I used to smoke in the house, then the Pretty One moved in with me and I moved my smoking into the back yard.  Since then, we have gotten married, and bought a brand new home, which I've never smoked in.

My truck, however, is another story.  I'd smoke in it every day, on the way to work, and on the way home.  Weekends, we'd take her car everywhere, and I never smoked in it, but sometimes she'd have to wait for me after dinner or if we'd been away from home for a while.

Now that I'm no longer a smoker, I can smell things a little more accurately.  My truck freaking STINKS.  What methods, products, tools, VooDoo did you use to make your car/truck smell normal again?  All help is much appreciated.

BTW, I will be smoking this weekend, but it'll be a Brisket for the Super-bowl party, and NOT a cig.

My badge should have been 336 days. Back to the start!

336 days ago I decided to quit. 186 days ago I thought I was done smoking.

Looking back now I realize I was giving in to a huge craving. I convinced myself that I was done, but I knew that I was going to smoke again that night. I needed to prove that I could smoke and not enjoy it. I was tricking myself into starting again. It worked, not in a good way.

Well this time I'm not making that same mistake!

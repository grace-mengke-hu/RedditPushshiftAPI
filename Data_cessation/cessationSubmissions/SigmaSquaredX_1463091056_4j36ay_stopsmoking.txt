How i quit: Good old operant conditioning.

The throat infection was horrible, i could hardly swallow for 4 days. In a peak of agony, slightly delirious from the fever, i decided to quit.

I cheated the detox. I already had head aches and cold sweats due to the fever and I didn't *want* to smoke because it would hurt my inflamed throat even more. Whenever I thought of smoking, I swallowed and endured a shot of pain. Did i really want to further irritate my throat?

Now i'm at 51 days. I know i'm not safe yet, but i do feel a certainty I have never felt before when trying to quit. It's been really easy these past weeks. Whenever i have a craving, which isn't all too often, i just convince myself that if i smoke, my throat will hurt. Up until now it's really worked for me. 

Perhaps, if you ever get ill again and still smoke, use the aversion of the illness for your own purpose of cutting a nasty habit!

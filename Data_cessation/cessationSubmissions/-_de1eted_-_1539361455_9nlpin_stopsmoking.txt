Need advice: found a new struggle after 322 days without nicotine.

Hello. I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom, and the first part will be a backstory. 

As the title says I have been without nicotine for almost a year. Prior to quitting, I had used smokeless tobacco mostly and cigarettes occasionally about 10 years at a pack or can per day.

It took four times, but I am proud and have notice many physical health benefits. 

This year has been a particularly rough and stressful year for me, and have recently been diagnosed with depression at what should be a happy point in my life. I have all the support and stability that anyone would be grateful for, but it still seems that life is hard to deal with. I've seen both a therapist and psychologist,  and both have more or less asked me what method I use to keep my resiliency. 

I had never noticed, but nicotine had been my primary coping method for all those years. Sure, I had regularly exercised, had a decent social life, and venting network, but when life or any situation got rough, I would instinctively take a dip or smoke to be able to instantly feel at ease.  After quitting I noticed that I was easily irritable at other people, but I chalked it up to the new job and new city I work in and not the nicotine. And for the first time in these 322 days I had even considered buying a can of dip to "fix" myself. However I quickly shot that down. 

Even still, my frustration in not being able to efficiently deal with even the mundane has depressed me and robs joy in day to day life. Therapy has helped me learned ways to lessen overall stress, but nothing like the instant satisfaction of putting a dip in when the going got tough.

TL;DR quit tobacco, diagnosed with depression, used to use nicotine to immediately cope with life, looking for advice on people who may similarly struggle.

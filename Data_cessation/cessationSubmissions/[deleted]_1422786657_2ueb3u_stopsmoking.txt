Last night I rejected all cigarettes on a night out, however I did have a cigar with friends.

I haven't smoked in a week now. And on a night out last night I rejected all cigarettes from my friends and I didn't feel a craving or the need to smoke. But my friends were having a cigar and gave it to me. I don't really want to be smoking anything at all but I had a few puffs of it just to satisfy my friends. I feel quite guilty about it, however it isn't really the same as tobacco is it? And I didn't really enjoy it either. I just want to know do you think I need to reset my badge?  Thanks!

I want to quit and I'm scared it's too late

That even if I do quit I've done some kind of horrible irreversible damage and that's just it and I've already killed myself anyway. It's not really an excuse for not quitting as much as it is a constant fear in the back of my mind. I'm adopted but I know people in my biological family have died from smoking related diseases. I don't know what to do about the fear, so I guess that's why I'm posting it here, to just get it out there. I've never actually told anyone this, including people in my life who know I want to quit. Thanks for reading. I wish I never started (or started again after successfully quitting for 5 years).

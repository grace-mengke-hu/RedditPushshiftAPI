I caved in after 2 months

Just a few days ago i found two packs in a jacket I havent worn since winter, one unopened and one only missing a few, and tossed them without a second thought. Tonight I had a gin and tonic and a beer and then bought a pack, smoked one, tasted how absolutely disgusting it was, then threw the rest of the pack out. I'm kind of worried about tomorrow, but I'm going to stay strong and be more cautious with alcohol from hereon out. I'm here to ask you all for good vibes when I wake up and check reddit tomorrow. Thanks everyone, and best of luck with your own struggles, we can all do it!

after 16 years, one week and counting

started smoking in 1997 and quit for the very first time in 2013 (jun 2, 2013). my wife thinks i quit 8 years ago, but i've been smoking behind her back. got up last sunday, had one cigarette, coughed (as usual), brushed my teeth, and decided it was the last. and it has been the last. very, very few cravings, have been around the company of smokers, partying and drinking as usual. 

when the craving gets really unbearable, i have a few puffs from an ecigg (about 6 to 9 puffs a day). 

here are some notes that might help others:
* it's never too late
* it's not too difficult
* if you don't get right on the first time, there's always a second
* your life does become better
* you have a lot more time on your hands
* it's more of a lifestyle change than anything -- coffee and no smoke, beer and no smoke, get up and no smoke, waiting and no smoke, and so on. 
* nicotine is really not that addictive (tests and studies will prove me wrong)
* it's the habitual act that's really addictive
* it's not impossible
* it's not worth it

quit now!

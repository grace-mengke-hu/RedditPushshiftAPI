I had hypnotherapy, i know its cheating but...

it actually saved me as i didnt have the willpower to quit. I would suggest it to anyone, though it costs alot (Â£300 or so) i saved most of that back within a month.... 
Just do a google search or i went with David Kilmurray, hes been in the news loads recently and stopped me smoking cigs and also a hell lotta weed.
Hope you all find a way like me guys!

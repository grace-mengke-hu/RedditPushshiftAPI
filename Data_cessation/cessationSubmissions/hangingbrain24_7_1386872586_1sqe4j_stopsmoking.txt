On the verge of quitting.

So, I joined a gym about a month ago and my trainer has been kicking my ass. I constantly have to stop and catch my breath and suck some air. I decided last monday, the 9th, that I was done. It's actually hasn't been so bad, with the help of nicorette. I have only had one a day since then, and the only time I really crave one is when someone is right in front of me smoking. How did you guys deal with these cravings? My goal is by the end of the week to cut them out completely, and stick with the gum.

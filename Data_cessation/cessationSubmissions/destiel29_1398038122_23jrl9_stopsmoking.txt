I don't want the same fate

My Granddad has just recently died of lung cancer from smoking. I have quit for 3 weeks now with only one hiccup, I decided to stop smoking when before my Granddad passed he said to me "Please stop smoking, do you want this? Please you're only 16 and you're killing yourself" there was tears in his eyes and I have never seen him cry. Then I had to watch him deteriorate and for what? The pleasure of inhaling something that will kill you, I am determined not to let down my family when I have promised to stop. I am determined not to let down my Granddad, RIP.

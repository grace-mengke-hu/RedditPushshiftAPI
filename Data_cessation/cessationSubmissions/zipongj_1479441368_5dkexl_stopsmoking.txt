It's been 25 hours since I quit. My blood pressure has decreased by 30 points.

When I was a smoker my BP would always float around 133/87 up to 139/89. I quit 25 hours ago, last night when I measured my BP it was 130/84, I just checked it again and it's now 109/69. I was not expecting such a quick decrease, if anything I thought it would be higher because of the withdrawal symptoms. 

That made this process a lot easier. I've already achieved something. After years of prehypertension I am now below the normal range!!!

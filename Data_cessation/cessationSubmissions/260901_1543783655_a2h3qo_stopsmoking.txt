Can't get rid of the yellow teeth problem

I'm 17. I started smoking about 6 months ago, with an average of 1 maybe 2 cigarettes a day, and never realy had this problem. Now I am trying to quit, realising what a stupid thing it is. I haven't smoked for 6 days now, but since i stopped smoking, my teeth got worse every day, and now are so bad, I'm afraid to smile. I think I'm having a good hygiene, washing them 2 times a day, but it' s only getting worse and I'm getting pretty disperate. 
Any tips or tricks to get rid of this?

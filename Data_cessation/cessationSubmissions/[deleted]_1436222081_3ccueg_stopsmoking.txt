Why do I get the big cravings NOW? After 5 months. Why now?

And why do cravings make logic dissapear from your brain. The whole 5 months I was telling people on this sub that I was a happy non smoker - I'm not that happy anymore about non smoking and I know this is stupid - but ?! what is inside of me that makes me think like this ?

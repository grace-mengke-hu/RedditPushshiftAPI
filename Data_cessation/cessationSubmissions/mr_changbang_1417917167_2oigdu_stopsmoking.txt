What was the weirdest way you tried quitting, successfully or unsuccessfully?

Mine was ages ago, when I emptied a packet of cigarettes into a hob, boiled the tobacco until it was one stinking sludge and let it sit for the next few days while I waited out the cravings. Needless to say it smelt absolutely disgusting and did not work.

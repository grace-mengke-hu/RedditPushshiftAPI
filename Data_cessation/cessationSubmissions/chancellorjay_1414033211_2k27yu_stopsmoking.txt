Insomnia while quitting, any cures?

I've been a 1.5 pack/day smoker for 5 years, started at 16, I've quit 2 times, this being my third. I think what bothers me the most is how restless I get at night. I'll lay in bed for what feels like forever, kept awake by the tingling in the back of my throat and the restlessness of my muscles. Does anyone know how to combat this?

As a college kid, everyone jokingly tells me to just drink till I'm asleep, but I'm trying to be serious here.

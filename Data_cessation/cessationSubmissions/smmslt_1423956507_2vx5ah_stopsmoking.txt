Recording Album, no cigs

Working on the new album today. Its the first time recording without the cigs. I use to have a smoke between and during takes, thought they calmed my nerves and made me concentrate. Ha! Such a lie! Cravings are strong though and those little poisonous sticks are racking my mind. Please send me your good thoughts and any suggestions to stave off these immediate thoughts.

Yesterday was tough

So, yesterday was the first day I went without a cigarette altogether. It was one of the most difficult days ever to do this. 

I am a District Manager of a company that has a lost of jobs going out every single day and we have to have appropriate staffing in each of those stores to ensure that we finish in a timely manner. Well, yesterday, my teams failed to produce the right staffing in a majority of those stores. I was driving all day long and had no sleep the night before and I kept wanting to reach for a cigarette to calm my nerves. I was getting emails from my boss asking for information as to what was going on. I was getting phone calls from managers and emails from field managers telling me what was happening. Also, my district covers the entire state of Alabama. Well, it started snowing in Alabama yesterday and people do not do well with snow in Alabama, so on top of everything else, and being on the road, I had to also reschedule stores and move start times to avoid icy road conditions. Then, it is the close of payroll and I had to deal with that. 

It's my sister's wedding and I had it set up to be a successful day, but the weather caused a lot of issues all over my district and I was very stressed out. I was so stressed out that when I finally did arrive everyone asked me what was wrong and why I seemed like I was so deflated when I should be happy. 

But, TL:DR - I made it through an extremely stressful day without a cigarette and I feel better about that, it was a huge step, but it was extremely difficult.

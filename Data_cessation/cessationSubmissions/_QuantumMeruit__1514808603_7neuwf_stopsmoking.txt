Can someone give me a timeline for how I'm going to feel while quitting? I've smoked 10 years, basically a pack a day.

What I want to know is, how long will each stage of the withdraws last? How long will I be irritable and quick to anger? How long will I have semi constant cravings? How long will I have the occasional craving (like after a fight or some stressful event)? How long will my mind feel slightly disorientated? Do things really get easier the second day? What about second week? Or second month? 

I just want to know what I'm in for. I'll be quitting cold turkey with the gum to help when I simply can't control the craving.

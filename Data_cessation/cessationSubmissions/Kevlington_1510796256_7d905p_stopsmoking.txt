One month today - been lurking but joined to thank you all!

So it's a month to the day that I finally decided to give up smoking after trying for more than a year half heartedly to stop. I've not posted on here but the first thing I've done every morning and the last thing I have done at night is read the posts on stopsmoking! I couldn't have done it without this community. It's been hard, frustrating, but also the best thing I've done. To all you people lurking and not posting who may have just started their quit the cravings don't last for ever. I hardly think about smoking at all now and I live with my gf who is a smoker and drink with smokers. Just take it one day at a time one hour at a time! If I can do it so can you!

Chest pain after quitting

Hello all, I 'soft quit' about 3 months ago. I used to smoke about 10 a day, or up to 30 at its worst, and got it down to maybe 3 a month. I had 2 cigarettes last night and started having really bad pain in the right part of my chest. Has anyone else had this after not smoking for a while?

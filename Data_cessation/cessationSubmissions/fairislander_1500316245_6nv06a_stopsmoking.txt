May need therapy?

Hello all. So, i tried quitting several times. Sometimes it 'took' better than others and my longest streak without smoking was 2 years (relapsed due to overconfidence). 
This past month, a couple over friends from work and i agreed we would quit together staring today the 17th, taking advantage most of the other smokers we work with are on vacation. 
We make plans and helping tools like a reward system, saved money jars etc etc. Comes the day, and something is happening to me that never happened before; i had violent episodes. I threw a jar into the floor next to my daughter's high chair cause she whined a bit. I dragged my dog outside the elevator by the scruff of the neck cause she was (understandably) freaked out by me and wouldn't heed my call. It's like the addiction is sabotaging this attempt by removing my tolerance of frustration. I'm not prone to these outbursts. I keep my cool, i'm level headed. This crap is scaring me. Not even 24 hours. The episode with the dog was in front of my neighbour, i just lost it, completely. I don't know if i should keep at it.  i guess I'll give it at least until tomorrow and see if i experience any more outbursts. If i do, i thnk i have to take some form of therapy before i try again. It was scary enough to make me consider this

Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks for making this a safe place to vent

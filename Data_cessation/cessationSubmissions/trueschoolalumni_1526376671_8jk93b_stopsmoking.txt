Vacation Cigarettes - Dangerous

Hey /r/StopSmoking. I've been a non\-smoker for 3.5 months, doing well so far. I'm on a vacation in Thailand at the moment, and having real cravings at the thought of buying a packet and smoking while here. The talk\-track is "of course I'll stop when I head home." It's attractive because a packet here is around $4 when normally they cost $30\+. Feeling really worried \- please give me some inspiration to make sure I don't smoke at all.

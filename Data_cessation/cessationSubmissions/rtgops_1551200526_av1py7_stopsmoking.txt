Nicotine dreams. What the hell, brain!

Just starting this journey of quitting smoking. Seriously this time. At least a pack a day for about 34 years. Enough is enough. And the cost!! 
So I invest in the patch and haven't slept in two nights, but the dreams... Was totally unprepared for the dreams. Clear as a bell to remember and well, just crazy.
 Will this continue for long? It's only been two nights but not sure how much I can stand.

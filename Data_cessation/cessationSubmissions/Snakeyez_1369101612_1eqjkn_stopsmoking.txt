Day 18

Have managed 18 days without a cigarette. Lately, I sense that my guard is down a bit, as I am experiencing sudden cravings, and urges to reach for my chest pocket. I feel a lot better as far as coughing in the morning and generally how my throat and lungs feel. Thanks to all the people who help each other out with this! I lurked here for a long time, a lot of recommendations and advice were very useful and helped me succeed so far.

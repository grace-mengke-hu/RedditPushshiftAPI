I never want to say "I'm quitting again" ever again.

I just got out of a really toxic relationship, so I though what better time to get rid of all the toxic things in my life. This year has been really rough, a lot of shit piled on top of more shit. There's been a lot of drinking and a lot of smoking going on. Some days I don't even recognise myself in the mirror. However, this past week that has led up to this decision I'm making to quit, I'm started to recognise myself again. I notice the damage that not taking care of myself has contributed the skewed image I have in the mirror, but above all I notice the harm that smoking has caused. There's this lack of colour in my face, the brightness isn't really there anymore, and exhaustion I'm always looking exhausted. The past couple days I have cut down the smoking, I even went a full day without smoking at all, and I can feel the difference. I noticed in the last month as well that smoking is actually the cause and not the solution to the anxiety I feel. Overall, I am done. I see all the negative aspects that have always been there, and am consciously taking a stand for myself.

88 days smoke free

Used Champix for ten weeks out of the 12 week course.Stopped taking it as they made me feel sick.Now the tablets are out of my system im craving a proper cigarette 5 weeks after stopping using them.
Gone back to using my e-cig is this wrong just a few puffs no nicotine in the liquid just water melon

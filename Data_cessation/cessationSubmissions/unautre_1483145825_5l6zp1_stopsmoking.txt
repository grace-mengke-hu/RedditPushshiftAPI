A new (to me) downside to smoking, NSFW.

I'm more or less quit on the cigarettes, and my use has stabilized at one every once in a while.  Some months I don't smoke any, some months I may smoke five or ten just because I'm hanging out with a lot of smokers.  

This level of use results in a lot of people thinking I don't smoke at all--people like this woman I've been seeing.  

Well, the other night I was out with some friends and I smoked a cigarette.  I went home, took a shower, made a phone call, and later in the night my semen ends up in this woman's mouth.  She immediately said that my cum tasted really gross and that it had never tasted like that before.  Due to the shower and teeth brushing and all that, she never knew I was smoking (I'm pretty sure she would mention that if she suspected). 

So...I experimented.  Lots of blowjobs when I haven't been smoking (which is most of the time), but I've been occasionally smoking cigarettes and not telling her, and every damn time she complains about the taste of my cum.  The taste of the cigarette gets into my balls within hours.  How nasty is that?

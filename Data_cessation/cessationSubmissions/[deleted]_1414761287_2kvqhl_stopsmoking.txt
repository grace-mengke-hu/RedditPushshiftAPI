Day 10! I can't believe I made it 10 days!

I've been smoking since I was 14, 8 years ago. 10 days ago I finally decided I'm sick of wasting money, ruining my health and constantly smelling like cigarettes. The first three days were hell and I honestly didn't think I could make it, but now I don't even think about smoking during the day. Everything is more tasty, and I've saved a ton of money. Just in 10 days. Not smoking is awesome!

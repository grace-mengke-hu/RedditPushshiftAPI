Day 2: hiding in bed

It's about 1:30 pm and I'm still in bed. I guess if I don't get up and do anything, I won't miss smoking as much? But then I realized that putting off regular life will just make it harder when I finally do have to go out and do something. So, I will walk to the grocery store. And I won't smoke today.

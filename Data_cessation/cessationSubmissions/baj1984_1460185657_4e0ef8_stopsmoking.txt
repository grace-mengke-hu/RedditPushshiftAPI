3 years no smoking, now back smoking when I go out

I stopped smoking for 3 years, but when I broke up with my girlfriend a year ago I started smoking again when I was drinking.

Now it's every time I go out drinking or there is an opportunity to bum a smoke. I don't feel physically addicted (I don't really get withdrawals) but I am still mentally and find it difficult to not smoke when i'm out drinking.

I think because i'm not physically addicted I feel safer in smoking on weekends, but if I honest with myself I know i'm playing with fire.  

Has anyone else has the same problem? What did you manage to do to stop 'casual smoking'?

Thanks!

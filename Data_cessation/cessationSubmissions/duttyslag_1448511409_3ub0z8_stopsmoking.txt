I made it!

I can't believe I've gone a year without smoking!

I want to feel as though it is unnecessary for me to be posting here at this point, but one thing I've learned over the course of my quit is that I will never be a non-smoker, but rather an ex-smoker. While it has gotten exponentially easier along the way, I must stay vigilant everyday about staying smoke-free. 

I don't look at this as being a burden as much as I do a constant reminder that I am greater than my nicotine addiction. I am the one in control. Quitting is my new addiction!

Quitting smoking is by and far the best thing I have done. At the start, the thought of never ever smoking another cigarette was scary, but at the end I don't look at it as never GETTING to smoke another cigarette, but never HAVING to smoke another cigarette.

When does my anxiety go away?

First off, I just want to thank this subreddit which has been a huge help in quitting for me.
I have been smoke-free for little over a month now (I know my ticker is missing, I just couldn't get it to work) and my main reason for quitting was recurring anxiety attacks.
Now, little over a month in, I still get anxiety attacks and I can't identify the triggers, I also get really lightheaded and dizzy often. Have any of you experienced this and when does it go away?

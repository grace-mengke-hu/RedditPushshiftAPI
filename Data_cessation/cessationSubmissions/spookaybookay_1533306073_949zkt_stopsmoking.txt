12 hours in, first try really

I've thought about quitting.
I've talked about quitting.
I've researched quitting.
I've even talked to my doctor about quitting.
But I've never *really* tried.

This time feels different. 12 hours ago I finished the last smoke of a pack, it felt different. I hated it, I hated myself for letting it go on for so long (10 years or so).

I have a full pack sitting on my desk in front of me, my boss smokes, coworkers smoke. I just. Don't. Want. Any.

Wish me luck, if I can make it to 24 it will be the longest I've gone since I started.

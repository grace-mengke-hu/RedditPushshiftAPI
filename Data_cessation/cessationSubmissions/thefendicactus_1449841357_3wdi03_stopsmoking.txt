Today is the day!

Today is the day I am beginning my smoke-free life. I have quit cold turkey before and was done for about a year and a half, but that did not last. I have been smoking about a pack a day for about 9 years now (minus that 1 1/2 yr. hiatus).
I intend to make this day and the rest of my life smoke free!

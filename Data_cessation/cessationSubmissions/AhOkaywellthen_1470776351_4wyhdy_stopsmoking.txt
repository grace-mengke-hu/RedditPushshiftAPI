First time i intentionally didn't smoke

I used to stop sometimes and keep it up until the first craving or excuse. I didn't smoke for a while now, but today i had a blowback because of something else. And there are cigarettes next to me. Usually I would tell myself it is a special situation and okay. It was a tricky situation until I just turned around and realized to myself that I don't really need a cigarette, it wouldn't help in any way.

Guess what, even despite the blowback i feel pretty good now.

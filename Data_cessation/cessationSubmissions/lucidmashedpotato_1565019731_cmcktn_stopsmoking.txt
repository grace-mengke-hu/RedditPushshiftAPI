3rd day

Hey guys, I've made it to the 3rd day. I mean, I've tried quitting lots of times before, but I really hope that this'll be the last time that I'll be quiting.

3rd day has been good to me. I just had 1 craving today. And my antidepressant is doing its thing for me. 

Maybe 3 days doesn't mean a lot to you but it is for me. 

I haven't told my friends or relatives about it. Well, I told my son about this once and that's about it.

I'm really looking forward to a month or a year of no smoking.

I can feel that this is really my time to quit smoking for good.

Thank you for listening to me and have a good day everyone.

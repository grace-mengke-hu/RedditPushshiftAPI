Finally feeling strong

I'm at about a month and a half since my quit date. It felt so hard at first. It's still hard now, but I'm so much better at resisting the urges. My cravings haven't gotten any weaker, but my will has gotten stronger. 
No, quitting is not easy, but you can do it. With everyday that you don't smoke, you get stronger. If the you of yesterday could resist cravings, then the you of today definitely can.

Day 3 was easy with Allen Carr

Hi everyone,  long time quitter here.  Been relapsing on and off for 7 years, smoking for 14 total.  I finally read Allen Carr's the easy way after being fed up with my pattern of returning to smoking as a 'stress relief'.  Smoking, as expected, just made everything worse each time. 

I can't preach (and it is preaching with Carr) how easy his system is and how resolute it made quitting in my mind.  Day 3 is pretty notorious for being completely awful.  And while the cravings were persistent today, it was so easy to just say, Yippie, and know that withdraws were just a symptom of recovery. 

For everyone quitting, stick with it.  we got this!

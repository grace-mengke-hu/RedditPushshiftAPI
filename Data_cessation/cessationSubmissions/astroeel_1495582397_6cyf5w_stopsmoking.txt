Anxiety attacks

Long time reddit lurker, first time poster. I'm a weekend smoker (but used to smoke more heavily when I was younger) and I have been noticing that after a Saturday night of heavy smoking my anxiety levels rise for the next few days. It's always been mild, but this week it got much worse. I slept horribly Sunday night and Monday night I didn't sleep at all. I had a panic attack in the middle of the work day on Tuesday from the lack of sleep and had to go home at noon. I can't help but think it's smoking related and that this means it's time to stop for good. But I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this while quitting? I feel like an absolute crazy person..

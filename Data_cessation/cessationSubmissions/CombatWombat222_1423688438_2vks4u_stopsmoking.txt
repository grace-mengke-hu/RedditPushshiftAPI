Help, I think...

Recently, my mental health hasn't been in the list of my best managed parts of my life. I quit 7 months ago, and I wish I could tell you I would never go back. 

I've become depressed, nearly suicidal, which I'm seeking help for, but in my thoughts, I have found myself wondering if smoking... Slowly killing myself would calm my nerves. It sounds so morbid, writing this down. I want to smoke, and each day brings more reasons to my plate. Where it's started as a coping mechanism, I find myself remembering fondly the reasons I enjoyed it in the first place. The social aspect, the taste, the smell, the short break from whatever I was doing. I don't know if I want help with stopping these thoughts.

 The only reason right now that I haven't bought any is my girlfriend. She's been very invested in my quit with me. She's even more invested that I remain in good spirits. I don't want to undermine her, however I don't know how much longer that will keep my willpower in check. 

I guess I'm looking for advice, and I realize at the end of this that I'll likely receive one sided advice from you wonderful people.

Thank you in advance for your words.

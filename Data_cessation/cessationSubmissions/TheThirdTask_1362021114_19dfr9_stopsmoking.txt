That's how quitting works, right? For all the newbies to here, keep it up. After a while, you don't even remember smoking.

Edit: Sorry if that sounded rude, or pretentious. I simply meant to say that I don't struggle anymore. I used to smoke a pack a day and now nothing. I forget that I used to smoke. It gets better. You can move past the cravings. Meant no disrespect. This place was the best when I quit. Still is.

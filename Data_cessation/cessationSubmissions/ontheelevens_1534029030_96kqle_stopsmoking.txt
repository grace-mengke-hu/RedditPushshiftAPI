Day 4 Is Tough

I have been doing an amazing job (to toot my own horn), using NRT (the lozenges), and even had some wine on a first date on Thursday and didn’t cave! But today, today has been tough. I’ve been irritable, exhausted, and just plain grumpy. 

I know that smoking one is the short term response to what I’m feeling and that I will just feel guilty afterward, but shit’s hard. Just had to vent it out.

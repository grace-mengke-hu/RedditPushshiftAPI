Tomorrow I've got triple digits.

The temptation stopped after the first couple months, and now smoking just seems so weird and foreign.  Was I really *sucking smoke into my lungs from a burning roll of leaves* all day for years?  Why did I think that would be a good idea?  I can't imagine it now.

Keep it up, y'all can make it.

3 Months Today!

I just found this subreddit. I quit in january and here we are. 3 Months. I came here cause I had urges today but I know better. I drink 2 times a week and dont need the patch or anything but I still crave nicotine sometimes. I know 5 minutes pass and im ok and try to keep my mind occupied. I quit drugs also and am approacing 3 years in august so that helped me quit smoking as well.

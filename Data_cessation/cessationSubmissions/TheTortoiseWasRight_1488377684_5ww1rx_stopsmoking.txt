One year! You can do it too!

I'd like to say I didn't even think about it but the date stuck with me (28th February). It's been hard sometimes (first 2 or 3 months) but it's totally worth it and now I'm proud that I did this. I knew I had to, and I'm so glad it's all behind me now.

Much support to all of you currently quitting, and all the others considering. Just start today, there's no perfect day ! And before you realize, you'll be a non-smoker with more confidence, better taste, more money, you will smell better and be healthier, and a lot a other benefits you will soon discover.

Enjoy your life :)

Day 5 - strategies?

After a visit to my doctor, I'm on a combination of Zyban/buproban and the patch.  I've also been meditating daily as a means of getting a handle on my day-to-day stress and impulse control.  I'm easing back in to exercising, but trying not to push myself too hard in that regard so I don't get frustrated.  Basically I figure I need a host of strategies to keep myself off cigarettes for good.  Is there anything in particular that works for you?

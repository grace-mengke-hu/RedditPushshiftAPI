how do we quit?

I want to say something that can make it all easy for you, but I don't know how to say it. I quit, successfully so, and I know a lot now that I wish I knew earlier. I want to talk to you guys about quitting.

First, a little background: think and thing are only one letter off from being identical. There is a reason for this, it dates back to the latin language but to spare you the history lesson - think and thing mean the same thing, when we're thinking we're "thinging" - what do I mean by this? 

When you think about quitting, you've made a "thing" of quitting. You have all these implicit beliefs about what this "quitting-thing" is going to be like. When you consider quitting, what you're really considering is quite different from the reality. We've all experienced this phenomenon before - we've quit, relapsed, and thought to ourselves "Why did I do that? It wasn't worth it at all, *it wasn't how I thought it would be*". It's never how you thought it was going to be. You've made a "thing" of it. You've made a "think" of it.

Our mutual problem is this: there is our reality and our minds' interpretation of it. The reality is we don't want to smoke, we know intimately what smoking is - but our minds' interpretation of the "smoking" as a "thing" (a mental abstraction) is heavily biased based on past experiences. We recall our first smoke, you've heard the term "chasing that first high" right?

Quitting is only as hard as you make it. The thing you're trying to quit is a mental construction, an illusion, an imitation, an estimate. Do you want to quit successfully? Don't say you're quitting. Don't commit yourself, don't swear any oaths, that's all "warning the devil ahead of time of your intentions". You're making a "thing" of it. If you want to quit, *all you have to do is not smoke*. Say no in the moment and **let it go**, don't ruminate on whether this is the right or wrong time to do it, you **have to let it go**. You're making a "think" of it, stop thinking and start living

**tl;dr** just say no

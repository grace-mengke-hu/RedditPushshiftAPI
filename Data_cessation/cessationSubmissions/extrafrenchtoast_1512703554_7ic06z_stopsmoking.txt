been smoke free for 24 hours. that hasn’t happened in 2 years.

So I’m posting this for accountability reasons. This already feels like I’m doomed. Every 15 or 20 mins I think I should hurry and put on some pants and run outside to go get a pack, but then I just remind myself that I break all the promises I make to myself and that I don’t need yet another one. Also, I didn’t realize how idle and weird my hands feel when I’m having a conversation on the phone without smoking.

How to deal with clubbing/bars/alcohol?

Most of the time, staying away from cigarettes is easy enough for me. The occasional craving goes by pretty quickly - I've found the Smoke Free app with it's smoking-related health stats quite helpful for this.

However, I can't seem to stay smoke free whenever I go clubbing or into a bar.. Or generally whenever alcohol is involved.

Now, thankfully I have no problem with alcohol. I drink at most two to three times a month, but usually less than once a month. I don't crave alcohol whatsoever. Still, I don't want to stop drinking at clubs and bars. It's part of the fun to me.

Smoking tends to seem like a good idea after a couple drinks, and while I did sucessfully cut down to 1-2 cigarettes during a partying evening, I'd much prefer to eliminate it entirely. Every time I do smoke, I regret it the next day.

Vaping doesn't work as a substitute, it just makes me crave the real thing even more - Then again my addiction is mostly psychological as I've learned.

Any tips to surviving alcohol smoke-free?

 Had a cigarette after 60 days, now a regular smoker again within 3 days.

Forgot to wear my patch and just got a huge craving that lasted for a couple of hours. Was confident I could just have the one. Obviously, I couldn't and can't. Could use some encouragement.. Can I salvage any of the momentum I had or am I back to square one?

EDIT: This is all really helpful. I especially like the idea of NOPE and getting rid of the idea of just one cigarette. Was sorely tempted this morning but have made it a few hours. When I make it through the day I feel like I'll be back on track. Also, I downloaded the book and will read today. 

Thanks everyone for the ideas and support.

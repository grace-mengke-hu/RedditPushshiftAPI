No sleep. Mo work. No vape.

Doesnt sound like a lot. But im working 24 hrs in three days over this weekend with little (&lt;5 hrs) sleep each night between shifts. This is just after a full time week at uni so im pretty burnt out.

My coil burned out on friday morning and I screwed it on too tight so I just decided to quit cold turkey. I know myself i vape every hour just to escape and now without nicotine for roughly 36 hrs i am in literal hell.

Sounds like the worst time to quit vaping right? Well... correct but all this compounded pain feels like a delayed punishment for my past behaviour. If I can quit through this zombie existence... it might be one of the only times in recent memory I will feel proud of myself.

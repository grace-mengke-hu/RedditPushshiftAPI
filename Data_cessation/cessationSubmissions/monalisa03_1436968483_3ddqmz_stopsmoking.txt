Why to cravings last after nicotine is out of your system?

I have been reading a lot about what to expect when quitting, and I  just can't seem to understand why nicotine cravings/withdrawal symptoms last 2-3 weeks (or longer!) If all of the drug is out of our bodies in just a few days, why do the cravings continue? Aren't cravings due to nicotine in our system? If not, why do only smokers crave nicotine- wouldn't everyone crave it if the absence of nicotine led to cravings? I just don't get it!!!!

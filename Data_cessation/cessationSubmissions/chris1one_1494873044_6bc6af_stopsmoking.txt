Came back from a long run this very moment and need to tell you something

Iam three month in now. I can tell you: Three month is the magical line. I mean you think of smoking one every day but it got so easy to just say. No. That's it. No hard feelings. No cravings. Nothing. Just like a bad memory from a forgotten time that hits you now and than. Stay strong everyone.

Quit for 2-3 weeks, became a bad person. Help!

It's been 2-3 weeks (haven't been really counting the days). I smoked for almost 10 years. Hated it almost every time I smoked, but couldn't really quit. Moved to the UK, cigarettes cost 10 pounds per pack which is a good reason to quit, and finally quit. So far tons of benefits, most importantly on the health side of things such as no stomach acids, no throat irritations, no blocked nose, no coughing, no need to spit all the time, no runny nose, and no shortened breath etc. 
However, the problem is that even though I don't have noticeable cravings, I just became an angry person with lots of mood swings for no apparent reasons. I don't even understand myself, I know that I am being unreasonable and stupid, but for some reason I just can't control it. This is now actually affecting those around me. What should I do? Please help Reddit!
TL;DR: Quit smoking 2-3 weeks, feeling great physically, but became very angry and stressed. Help!

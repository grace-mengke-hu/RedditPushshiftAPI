Quit after a few years!

Quit smoking today after almost a pack a day habit for the past year. I've quit smoking in the past, but old triggers led me back to my pack a day habit. I quit on 6/20, cold turkey. It's been a rough few weeks (especially after relapsing on nicotine via an blu e-cig), but I'm already feeling happier about taking better care of myself. 

Just curious, but how do folks here deal with insane mood swings? Mine have been terrible and I'm open to any good coping strategies!

100 days! I still crave one every now and then, but it's nothing like it was! I smoked for 10 years. I am now confident that I am done for good!

100 days. 

The first 30 were shitty. The second 30 were meh. The last 40 days have been surprisingly better!

I rarely have a craving, and when I do they are very short lived and very easy to forget. 

If I can do it, you can do it!

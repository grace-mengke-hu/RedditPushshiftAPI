To the non-smokers: Will I ever get that "alert" feeling back?

You know the feeling, your friend is coming over to hang out and you're genuinely excited. Better hope no one else is in the room or you'll be talking your ear off while you wait. You're sitting in class and intently listening to what the speaker has to say. You blend in pretty well, not overly frumpy looking. You go to the gym and bust out your normal routine and then some, all you can think about is trying to best your PR. You see your buddy at the gym and your face lights up. You haven't seen him in forever, you wonder what he's been up to! You proceed to talk about craft beers for 5 minutes.

Does this ever come back? Ever since I've been a smoker I've just been so down. And Even quitting, I just feel like garbage? Friend is coming over? Eh, whatever. See an old friend? I hope he doesn't notice me. Going to the gym? Just another place to think existentially for the next 2 hours. 

Did anyone get that alert and engaged feeling back? Or am I doomed to life of disengaged existentialism?

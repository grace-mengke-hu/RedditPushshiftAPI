161 days and im still catching my self considering smoking.

Last night i was having a lil panic attack weather [aka rain] too smoke or not.  I though what harm could one cigarette do?  Why do they have to be so addictive.  Why cant i do one of those ppl who can smoke and not let it consum me and want it all the time. Smoking was like a mind away break from my self.  im on the fence about saiding fuck it and starting up again.  Which is really stooip.  Some days are bad and other are easy.  I feel like smoking.

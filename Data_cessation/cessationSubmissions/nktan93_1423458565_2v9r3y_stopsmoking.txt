fell of the wagon

after 232 days smoke free (on and off, but without ever buying a pack); caved and bought a back at the gas station on the way to see buddies this weekend. Told myself, "it's just for the weekend". smoked the whole pack in a little more than a day. as soon as i bought it i felt the guilt set in...smoke free today and mind is hazy. so sick of this on again off again crap...gotta never smoke another puff and leave it at that

So I had a smoking dream just now...

I've heard a lot about people having smoking dreams, and never realised how bad they can be until I just had my first one.

I dreamt I was out on a date with a girl I've been seeing off and on that smokes. She offered me a cigarette and I took it, and smoked it. It was so vivid and real in the dream when I woke up I thought I'd actually smoked.

But I tell you, I felt so damn crushed and disappointed with myself when I woke up until I realised it was a dream, that I think I've kicked the habit. All I was thinking was "dammit, what a waste of all that hard work." 

Thought I'd just share that. Thanks for your motivation guys :)

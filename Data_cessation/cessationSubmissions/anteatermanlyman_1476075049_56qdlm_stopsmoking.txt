Day 2 with no cigarettes but patches, sorry about the double post

Hello, yes I'm still trying. I'm feeling good, my boyfriend let me go ahead and buy an energy drink to fight the nicotine fits, even though it's late. He is trying to quit too, but I think he's giving it a rest right now. The nic fits are there, I know they'll go away. My friend is taking us out to hang out and go places tomorrow, so I hope that'll do it for day 3.

Wish me luck as always :)

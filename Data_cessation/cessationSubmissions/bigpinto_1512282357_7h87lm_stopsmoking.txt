everything that happens in vegas stays in vegas

After smoking for 25 years, I have been off cigs for 45 days now (quit after second major wheezing attack) - not a single puff.

Wondering if i can smoke two while I am driving to vegas next month? I will only smoke one or two whenever I go on a road trip which is like once every six months or so.

The joy of quitting

Someone posted a remark yesterday about not feeling the joy of quitting and that remark hit so close to home yesterday. Almost a month now and still the sadness overwhelmed me last night. That sadness does not hit every day anymore, nor does it linger all day if it does hit, so I can say, with all honesty, it WILL get better. 

I don't miss that first cigarette in the morning that much actually. It seems I got over the habit of lighting up first thing in the morning without any difficulties. I get to work whole mornings now just to realize I hadn't even thought about a smoke. And every time that realization hits, it is a quiet celebration. 

But the before bed cigarette is still hard on me. I use YouTube sleep relaxation videos and they work like a charm. But still it hit me hard last night. I felt really, really sad and was bitching and growling at my hubby. And I realized it's the emptiness.... I don't have a substitution, besides eating chocolate (which is all gone right now, by the way).

I used to read a lot. I mean, two, three books a week. I haven't finished a book since I quit. I really have to start enjoying reading again, this time without the smoking. That said: it is only last night that I was feeling this sad.
I had a wonderful day yesterday, with my non smoking kids. We had lunch, shopped, enjoyed the late Autumn sun, all without a smoke.  I just enjoyed the time with my kids, without even thinking about a smoke. 

And it was fun. 
And I didn't have to worry about smelling because of the smoking. 
And I didn't miss a minute of our time together because I wanted to smoke. 
And so..... here it is......Although I totally get the remark, (because I too have felt that sadness of not enjoying the quitting) it seems it is just a moment, and it passes. It really passes! And there are so many moments I DO enjoy the quitting. Because I can enjoy the moments that matter without the distraction of the addiction.

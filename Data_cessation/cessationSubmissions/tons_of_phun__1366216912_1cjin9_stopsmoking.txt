I'm a Tobacco salesman and this is my third day nicotine free.

I've worked for a manufacturer for over 5 years now. I have two major reasons for quitting. One being my health and the other being that I now hate the, once great, company I work for. 

It's certainly a challenge talking about cigarettes all day and not smoking one. However, I don't want to financially support the brand anymore which makes this process a bit easier. 

I have lurked this sub for quite some time now. You folks are inspirational to say the least. My S.O. Has never smoked so she really doesn't get the anguish involved with quitting. It feels good to be part of a positive statistic with you all.

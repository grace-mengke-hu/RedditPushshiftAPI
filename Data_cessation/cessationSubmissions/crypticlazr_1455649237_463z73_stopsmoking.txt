I quit cigarettes, but not cannabis. Do I need to quit both in order to fully heal?

It has been 5 days since I last had a cig. But I am smoking a bit of weed, maybe 2 grams a day si ce I quit. I have also been exercising by skateboarding to the top of my street (about .7 miles - 1.4 miles round trip) every day at least once since I quit. I'm already feeling better but want to get the full benefits and let my body completely recover and I think smoking herb has to stop. Any insights?

Cold turkey or nicotine replacement patches/gums

I just quit cold turkey on Sunday....still feeling like I am withdrawing from nicotine.  It sucks which is what I expected. I am hoping some of the cravings will stop after the nicotine is gone.   Just curious to know if those who have used the patches and gums experienced cravings for a long time.

Been two weeks, and I still have daily cravings.

I quit cold turkey after smoking for 14 years (regardless of what my badge says, I really wanted to get it done this time). I was a pack/pack and a half a day smoker for that entire duration, and now I cant seem to kick the monkey on my back feeling. 

Suggestions?

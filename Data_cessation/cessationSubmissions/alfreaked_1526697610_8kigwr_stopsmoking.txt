I fell... but I learned a lesson

I stopped for good three months ago, but today... So much stress at work... so many things I couldnt help it, I bought some cigs... I lit one and before I got to the half of it it hit me... Oh dear God, the taste, the feeling... It was AWFUL, I threw it away, how could I do this to myself for 14 years?!?! I felt dizzy, nauseous, the smell was horrible.
I feel like I lost one battle but I'm slowly wining this war, when I found about this sub, I knew I have brothers in arms, even if I don't know you even if I'm from another country even if I speak a different language (forgive my English), for everyone out there, I learned that it gets easier to quit with time, sounds redundant but quitting is the best way to quit

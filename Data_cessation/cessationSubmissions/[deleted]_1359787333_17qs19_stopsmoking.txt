Well.. fuck

I am just about to go an buy a pack. I have been so motivated to quit and have been trying to convince everyone to do so on this sub but here I am, I'm ready to buy a pack. I don't think anything is going to stop me at this point, I've heard some horrible news and at this point I could not give a fuck less about my health or money. I just wanted to say something here because I feel like maybe this sub will one day help me get back on track again.

Anyone reading this, please don't lose hope. I am a weak weak weak person right now and I am giving in to something that NOONE should ever give in to. Do not do it, there is no good out of this.

I wish there was someone here to physically stop me, sorry guys.

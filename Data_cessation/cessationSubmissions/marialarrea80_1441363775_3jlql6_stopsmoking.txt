does anybody feel that you mind is playing tricks on you?

Day 4, went for my everyday run in the morning, didn' t have lots of cravings today but suddenly mi mind decided that today I will smoke. So I ran back home took some money and ran to the supermarket to buy cigarettes and 2 pains au chocolat. I was in the queue and my husband texted to say that he was v proud of my determination, called him back and told him what I was doing. He just told me, after the last 3 hell of days you have lived pls don't do it, buy the pain au chocolats, come home and have a shower and breakfast and use your spray. You will feel much better. I just bought the pain au chocolats, left the supermarket and didn't feel any better at all! No proud of myself or anything, have a pain in my chest and feel terrible! haven't smoked though...

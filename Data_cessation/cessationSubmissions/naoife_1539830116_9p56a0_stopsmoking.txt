Problems with ZYBAN?

Hi all, I'm having a bit of trouble at the moment and thought maybe this community could help. On mobile etc. 
  I was a smoker for 23 years (2/3 of my life, 12 to 35) and decided to give up when I became a parent. I tried a few ways and thought I had no hope until I heard about champix. Off I went to the doctor only to be told I wasn't suitable because of previous depression issues but I could use Zyban. 
   Before I say another word I want to say it's a miracle drug. I stopped smoking on the day I decided and haven't smoked since. I haven't smoked in 42 days. That is fucking amazing for me and I now consider myself a non smoker and am sure I never will again.
  Now the bad part.
  When I started on Zyban I got night sweats and a few other bits of uncomfortableness but I have to stress nothing near as bad as withdrawal. As time went on, however, that has changed. I have lowered my dose back to half 4 months early because my depression which has been in check for 4 years is slowly creeping back, my anxiety has gone through the roof and, the nightmares I've been having are the scariest and most realistic things I've ever had to deal with. I can stress how petrifying they are.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
   I guess this post is a reach out because I'm so thankful for zyban but afraid of it at the same time and I'm curious about other people's experience with it.
Thanks for reading the wall of text and good luck with your change to being a non smoker.

What a difference already!

5 days nicotine free! I had to go cold turkey due to an upcoming spinal fusion. I quit once before for 45 days, but with the patch. Even though cold turkey is hard, each day gets a little easier. With the patch, I always felt like I was in a perpetual state of withdrawal. I don’t know if that makes sense. 

It’s amazing the difference I’m already feeling. My blood pressure has come down to almost normal. My breathing is so much better. I have bad asthma and when I laid on my back, I felt like I was drowning. The morning coughing is pretty much gone. The craziest thing is my heart rate. My heartbeat was between 100-120 beats per minute. It’s already down to an average of 72 beats per minute. 

It’s crazy that I had to be threatened with potential paralysis to finally quit! I should have quit a long time ago!

It hasn’t been easy but I know it will be worth it! It’s hard as hell and sometimes (a lot) the cravings are sooo intense, but totally worth it!!! By the way, the Smoke Free app is a huge help! 

Good luck to all of you!!!

Starting today.

Hey guys, I've been subscribed here for a little while as a smoker slowly instilling the idea that I need to quit. Today is the day. Me and a few other friends have all decided to stop smoking. I've smoked for about 1.5 years and I'm currently 22 years old and I know this is the decision that I will have to make at some point. I might as well make it now. I'll be reading all of your posts, wish me luck!

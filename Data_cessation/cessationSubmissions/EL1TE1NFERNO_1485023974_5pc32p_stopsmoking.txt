8 days and going strong :)

Hi all, I recently discovered this sub and I have to say that I'm glad that I did.
I quit smoking 8 days ago after 3 years of smoking 25-30 a day. I was thinking about it for about the last 6 months but my last few attempts never really amounted to more than a few days. I tried pretty much every stop smoking aid going but never seemed to last more than a week.

This time, I decided to bite the bullet and went cold turkey. it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I'm a bit more irritable than normal, but that is to be expected.

I was just wondering if anyone has any tips on occupying my hands. I haven't had any overly strong cravings but when I do, I usually get fidgety.

Thanks, and have a good day :)

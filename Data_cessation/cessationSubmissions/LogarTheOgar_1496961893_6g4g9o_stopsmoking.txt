Day 39; I cant stop eating

My impulse control is way out the window right now. For tomorrow and the weekend, I'm going to choose not to worry about it, but come Sunday night into Monday I want to get a handle on myself.

I guess I'm holding on to this idea that if I put stuff IN my body, it will make me feel better; it will hit some chemicals or whatever. I've mentioned to a few people now that "I seem to have a problem with donuts."

Beyond that, I have little impulse control everywhere else as well. I was buying things left and right, but the easiest one would be takeout. I'm up to almost 3 nights a week ordering 3 meals worth of Chinese or Pizza, just for me. And sometimes that turns out to only be a meal and a half XD.

So Im asking for some general guidance on if I should start to really curb my impulses or not. Whenever I see cigarettes I dont really WANT them, but I feel that pull. And I think I turn that pull into donuts.

I don't want to smoke but I also don't want to gain too much weight. The whole point of quitting smoking was to be healthier; im not sure how much healthier it is to switch vices like that.

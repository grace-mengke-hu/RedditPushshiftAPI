Quitters of 1+ years, how many times did you fail before you made it?

Are you still having cravings/triggers? And what methods? I'm really curious! Because I feel like I will fail, I have already failed once after 5 weeks. I've been off it now for like two-three weeks now but I'm sure I'll fall back when I begin school. I have a feeling I will just try and fail and try and fail for the rest of my life.

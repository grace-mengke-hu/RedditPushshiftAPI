4 days without touching a cigarette...is the worst over?

So I did it, longest I've ever done without smoking since I started 10 years ago.

Is the worst part over? what can I expect now? First 2 days were hell, last 2  days the craving was less... But as a lot of people give up after more then a week I was wondering, what to expect?

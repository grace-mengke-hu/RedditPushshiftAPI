Has anyone had any luck with Allen Carr's other books?

I'm still blown away that a book made me never want a cigarette again. I've "quit" in the past but never for this long and I was always longing for one. I've been free for 154 days and haven't been happier. 

I bought his book "stop drinking now" and listened to the whole thing. He uses the same logic towards smoking..but this one unfortunately didn't work like magic. Although I agree with everything he said in the book and haven't seen alcohol the same since, it didn't magically fix my brain like the smoking one did. I'm not blaming him or the book..there is probably still have some feelings towards alcohol that gives me the illusion that it feels good and are too scared to give it up :/ 

Something I do want to give up that I'm addicted to is sugar/shitty food. Maybe the alcohol one didn't work so well because I associate socializing with alcohol, but with sugar I'll do by myself even though I don't want to then feel shitty about it right after or even before I shove something in my mouth. The worst part is I am gluten sensitive and still crave the garbage even knowing how it makes me feel. He's got a couple books on weight that made it hard to choose because they didn't have too many reviews. I want to apply the same principles from the smoking one to sugar, and so far he'e helped me see more about sugar addiction..but I'm not too confident in myself.. I've been listening to it and still have been craving ice cream at night and shit. I'm almost done and I just want it to work because like cigarettes I don't want to be a slave to junk food anymore. 

So yeah, anyone else have experiences with any of his other books they would like to share? Did it work for you like the smoking one? How does it compare?

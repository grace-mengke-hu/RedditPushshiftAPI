Tomorrow's the day!

Quite nervous about tomorrow - will be my second attempt at quitting. I managed 5 months last year but started again once I moved onto step 3 of the NRT (1  cigarette turned into a pack a day within a week). I want to make sure that doesn't happen again this time.

I was thinking about doing 1 month on the strongest patches, and then coming off the nicotine completely. Does that sound like a good plan? I know I couldn't go cold turkey so think this might be the best way...any advice would be much appreciated.

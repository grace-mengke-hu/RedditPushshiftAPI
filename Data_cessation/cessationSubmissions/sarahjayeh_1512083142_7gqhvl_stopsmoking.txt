8 Days

I️ quit smoking 8 days ago, using the patch. So far so good, the cravings have actually been really manageable for the most part. The hardest it’s been is after eating or late in the evening when I’m bored. The patch has helped significantly but bc I’m not wearing it while I️ sleep (craaazy dreams) I’m getting some withdrawal symptoms. Mild headaches, irritation (worse some days than others) and MAJOR tension and jaw clenching. Also I️ feel very dehydrated but I’m not sure if that’s related. 

Overall I️ feel so much better. Mostly I’m confident that I️ can do this...I️ quit right before Thanksgiving and had to deal with the stress of family without a cigarette and I️ managed just fine. But when I️ see that people months or years in still think about it sometimes I get nervous. I’m scared the patch is a crutch and when I’m done with it I’ll cave in.

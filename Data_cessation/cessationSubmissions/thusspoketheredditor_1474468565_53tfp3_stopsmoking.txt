I'm 15 years old and I need help.

First of all, I want you to introduce myself. I'm a 15 year old teenager living in Turkey. I started smoking out of curiosity and when I took a puff first time I felt amazing. I was really happy and relaxed. I smoked 2-3 cigarettes a day for two weeks, but then I realised that I wasn't enjoying cigarettes as much as the first time anymore. Then my parents caught me smoking. I felt really sad and ashamed and I promised myself I'll never smoke again. It was fine for the first 3 days but suddenly I desperately wanted to smoke and I bought a pack with my last pocket money. After I smoked one, I disgusted myself. I felt like I was the worst person alive and I promised myself again but today I went back on my promise again. I only smoke one cigarette a day but I can feel that I'm addicted to cigarettes after three short weeks. I don't want to feel that way and disappoint my parents again. What should I do? Please help me.

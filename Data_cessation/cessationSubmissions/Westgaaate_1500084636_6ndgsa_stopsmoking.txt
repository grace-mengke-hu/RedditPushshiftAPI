Keep at it, even if it's hard as hell!

I never thought I could do it! I'm only 5 days in and I already feel the benefits! 
It's reallt tough though! Some days I cried.... some days I yelled....
It's terrible to see how much smoking controls our lives! When I find it really tough, I think of the filter on my oven fan that's puke yellow from all the toxins in smokes and I feel better that I'm no longer putting my lungs through this! We can all do it!

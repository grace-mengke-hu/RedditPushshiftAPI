Just passed the two month mark. Sometimes I miss it, but then I think of all the things I don’t miss.

Spending extra time to get ready just to remove the smell.

Cleaning out ashtrays and having a nasty bottle full of butts in my car.

Accidentally washing a pack in the laundry and dealing with the mess and wasted money.

Hangovers. I smoked heavy when I would get drunk. Never realized how much of the hangover came from the 10 extra smokes I had in the span of a couple hours. 

Stopping what I’m doing to go buy more when I get low just because the anxiety of not having any just made me want to smoke more.

Judgement of people when they learn you smoke. 

having to suddenly poop during a morning cigarette. It’s like playing Russian roulette. 

The Loogies! I forgot it’s not something that people need to do all the time just to breath. Now I cherish them because it doesn’t happen very much anymore. 

What are some things you guys do not miss?

Celebrating my year today

It's been hard as fuck, and I still get cravings on a daily basis but I'm  99.9% sure I won't ever smoke again. I live with 3 heavy smokers and I didn't break, I've been drunk in a place full of smokers and I didn't break, so I'm quite proud. I've joked that I gave up my unhealthy cigarette addiction to a gum and sunflower seed addiction but at least they are healthier and cheaper.

To those struggling, I was a heavy, heavy smoker for 12 years. I was at 2 and half packs a day when I gave up, and now I'm 100% free, cold turkey. It is possible, it isn't easy but nothing in life worth doing is easy. Give it up now.

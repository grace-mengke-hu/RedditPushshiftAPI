Discovered travelling is my trigger

It's my first time travelling since I quit smoking and I notice thinking about smoking a lot. I haven't really had any cravings during the past 6 weeks but now I really feel like having a cigarette. 

I guess it's the calculating when to smoke the last one before jumping on a train or boarding the plane, and old habits die hard. Also, I used to get to know people at hostels while smoking outside, having a beer and smoking while discussing our lives. I've never viewed smoking as appealing or associated any nostalgia with it, but apparently I link smoking with travelling.

Time to cut that cord and move on to non-smoking travels!

Two Weeks!

This sub has actually been surprisingly motivating!

I've been a smoker for three years and by the end I was smoking 20 roll ups a day. The longest I ever managed was a week or two without a cigarette but surprisingly enough after having a bit of a paradigm shift in my life and quitting almost all intoxicants (apart from alcohol) I added nicotine to the list.

Despite all the drugs I used to do, quitting nicotine still felt the  hardest to give up and greatest to be rid of.

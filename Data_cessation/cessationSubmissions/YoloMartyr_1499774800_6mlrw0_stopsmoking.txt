I've decided to stop smoking

Today is my first day of cutting back. 

I've been causally smoking maybe a couple times a day with friends since sophomore year in high school. I've never really had a problem with it until about six months ago. 

In college I start smoking weed pretty heavily every day until I got busted by campus police and charged with possession. Ever since then I've been forced to stop smoking weed under the threat of random drug tests. The absence of weed in my daily life left quite a void that I tried to fill with cigarettes. I told myself and my friends I'd only smoke cigs until my probation was up and I could smoke weed freely again, but recently I've started to fear that I might have gone too deep and won't be able to quit once my probation ends so I've decided to do something about it right now. 

In exception to today I've been smoking around one and a half packs a day of Newport red 100s. I figured stopping cold turkey would end up in failure so I've decided to start slow. Basically this is my plan for the next few weeks:
Days 1-4: 10 100s
Days 5-8: 10 shorts
Days 9-12: 5 100s
Days 13-16: 5 shorts
Days 17-20: 3 shorts
Days 21-24: 2 shorts

Today is day one and it's started off alright. I've had two so far today (I've got a 75 minutes commute which makes it very tempting to smoke--I would've usually smoked 5 or 6 by now).  I'm welcome to any criticism on my plan or any other helpful advice anyone's willing to give me. Thanks a lot and wish me luck!

Edit: Forgot Day 25: Smoke free! :)

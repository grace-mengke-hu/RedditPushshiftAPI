5 days in and I have chest pain

Im 23 smoked for 8 years.  I was a pack a day smoker pack and a half weekender yesterday I started feeling pain in my chest. Deep breaths hurt its in the middle on the right side it radiates all the way through. From inside to outside. It hurts even when moving.  Its about a low 4 on the pain level.  Anyone else get this when they were quitting?

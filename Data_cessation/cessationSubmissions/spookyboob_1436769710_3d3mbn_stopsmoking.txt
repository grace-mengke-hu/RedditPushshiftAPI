About to quit cold turkey, for the second time. Any tips?

Hello! I've lurked for awhile and saw how supportive this community is and decided to reach out. I started smoking almost four years ago, and quit for the first time (cold turkey) last October. It was very difficult as all of my friends and family are smokers, but I did it. Unfortunately, due to stress and anxiety, I started to smoke again. Only heavier, and I now go through a pack a day.  Now I'm really ready to make this change again, but I've heard it can be even harder the second time around. I'm very nervous and am worried about putting on weight (i put on about 15 pounds the first time) does anyone have any advice or tips that can help calm me down and get me through this upcoming battle?

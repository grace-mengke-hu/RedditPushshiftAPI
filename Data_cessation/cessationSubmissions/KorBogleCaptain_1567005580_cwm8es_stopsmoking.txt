1 month and 11 days

I quit smoking 2 years ago, but I used those fucking nicotine lozenges for 2 years. Sometimes I think those were worse than smoking since I could just do it whenever.

Finally 1 month and 11 days ago I quit. Wouldn't you know it my blood pressure is now normal. I feel great. I'm not exhausted all the time. Its fantastic. I sprinted up 15 flights of stairs yesterday. I was huffing and puffing, but I could breathe, and I didn't feel like I was going to die like I always used to after physical exercise.

I'm still angry with myself that I used nicotine for 20 years. But I'm far more grateful that its behind me than I am resentful. I'm so glad that my kids will not know me as a smoker and I can be a good role model for them.

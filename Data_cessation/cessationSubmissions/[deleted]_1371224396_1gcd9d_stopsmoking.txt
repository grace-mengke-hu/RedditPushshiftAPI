today's the day!

i'm quitting (again) today. i was 3 months smoke-free, got unceremoniously dumped, and picked up the habit again. 

it does nothing for me and makes me feel tired and gross. it also cancels out all the positive things i've started doing for myself health-wise. 

i am so glad this subreddit exists. does anyone have any free quitting app suggestions?

thanks!

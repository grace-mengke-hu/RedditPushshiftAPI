Having a really rough time bad!

Money problems still there, still taking care of my mother, my husband is being a champ and hanging in there with me but I feel like I want to runaway!

I now have almost uncontrollable anger thank to the MEDICATED bipolar disorder! It's not physical not by any means just verbal and I'm even yelling at my 74 year old mom! I won't let it get physical though and I've even told my psychiatrist about it. 

I just don't think I can stay quit much longer, it's like I'm constantly angry now it doesn't come in waves IT'S JUST THERE!  People say oh just deep breathe.......sorry deep breathing don't work with bipolar anger/rage! I woke up like this like I did yesterday like I did the day before etc.  It's draining me but even draining me is angry!

Apart of me wants to just break down and cry but I can't do that because we also have another issue..........now I want to constantly go go go, my head is like an ADHD on steroids, it won't stop! It won't stop worrying, stop going, stop saying we got to do this and that and this and that.  It won't let me cry! I gotta clean or type or phone or something! The only way it stops is sleep, I've even been exercising.

I have no idea what to do I really don't and if this is all anxiety.....really.....I'm on medication lamactil while is used for the mania/rage/anger of bipolar disorder and yeah also epilepsy but I'm not epileptic. They can only go up to 100mg's and I'm on 50.

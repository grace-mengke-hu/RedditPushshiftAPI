Pardon my language, but fuck this shit.

here I am having a few beers, it's Friday night, I'm not going out, it's been SIXTEEN, not fifteen days (punk ass badge). Anyways, thinkin to myself about a documentary I saw a few years ago.

The subject of this documentary lived in a part of town people call Skid Row, or as the PC ppl call it, the Downtown Eastside. Crack, heroin, rubbing alcohol, sleeping in back alleys, poor diet, over twenty years!! And he goes to detox, gets clean, he's fine. 

Ok, great, he did the worst things imaginable to his body for over two decades, but he turned out ok. Here's a vid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzo7JJ-2aV0. Now, although he died later on due to a relapse is besides the point. He did terrible things, but smoking is somehow worse than all this? Fuck Me sideways.

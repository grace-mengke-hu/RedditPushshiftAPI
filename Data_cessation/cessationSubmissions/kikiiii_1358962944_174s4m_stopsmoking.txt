"Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up."  
"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."  
"If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves."  
"The three great essentials to achieve anything worth while are: Hard work, Stick-to-itiveness, and Common sense."

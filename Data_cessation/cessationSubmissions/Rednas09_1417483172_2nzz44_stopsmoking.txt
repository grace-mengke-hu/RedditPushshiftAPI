2 years!

It has been 2 years since I quit smoking. For me, I realized that I needed to stop smoking to help overcome my wanting to smoke. I only smoked for 5 years but noticed changes in my breathing, coughs, etc. I still love the smell of cigarettes and still have dreams where I do smoke. I wake up smelling my hands to make sure I didn't and thankfully I haven't. Anyway, just wanted to post on here to celebrate since most people on social media didn't know I smoked (started underage). Good luck to anyone thinking about quitting or that has!

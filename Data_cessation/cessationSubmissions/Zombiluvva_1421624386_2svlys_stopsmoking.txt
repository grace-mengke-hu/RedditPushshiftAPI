No longer want to claw my eyes out. Things are looking up.

One hour and it'll be 14 days since I quit. For those of you just starting out I promise you it'll get better. I've turned a corner in the past 2 days and everything is seeming a little easier. I didn't seem to have the momentary cravings others talk about. The ones where you drink a pint of water or suck a sweet and they abate. I had seemingly endless evenings that became yawning chasms of restless unease and general discontent. Like restless leg syndrome all over my body. No more my friends. I now have only momentary cravings such as others describe. And these are easier dealt with.  
Not smoking isn't the first thing in my head in the morning either, I'm grateful for that. I haven't managed to make it out of the bedroom yet before thinking of it but I'm sure it's coming. I look forward to the time I no longer think of it at all during a day although I don't expect it in the next year or so. 
Two weeks - I wouldn't chose to repeat them and for that reason, along with so many others, I will not smoke today. Join me.

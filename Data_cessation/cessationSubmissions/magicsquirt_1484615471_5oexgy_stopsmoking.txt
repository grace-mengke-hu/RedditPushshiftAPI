My breathing is back to normal

I woke up, and it felt like I was breathing for the first time. It feels so different and good, I'm really excited by this change. Didn't expect to see changes in such a short period of time (5 days).

I also don't worry about ''not smoking'' as much as I used to during the first couple of days. It really gets easier! I focus on other things that are more important to me! Yay!

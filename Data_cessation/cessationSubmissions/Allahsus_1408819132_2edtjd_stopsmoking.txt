So my second attempt starts tomorrow. Any last minute words of advise?

I stopped smoking for 17 days, but having many friends and family smokers, plus ending a relationship kinda got me back into smoking. Typing this out, I can see how those are really bad excuses, but they *were* the main struggles I had.

* I think the main issue that I will be changing this time, was the fact that to begin with, I actually didn't feel any urges to smoke (I just was in horrible mood), so I didn't use any nicotine patches ect. I'll be doing that this time around.

* Secondly, I was thinking about cigarettes ALL the time. Even when I sometimes thought how nice it was not to smoke, I was thinking about cigarettes. What can I do to help with that?

* Thirdly, I put on 8 pounds just like that. I seriously had the sweetest tooth, I've ever experienced. What do you guys do to help with that?

Thanks in advance!

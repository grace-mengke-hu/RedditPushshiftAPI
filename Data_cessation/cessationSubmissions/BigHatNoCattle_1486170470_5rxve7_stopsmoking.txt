Last post was week 4. Today is day 194.

Just want to keep the success stories going. It amazes me I get cravings when I do something I haven't done since I stopped smoking.  Obviously, they are further apart now, but crazy. 

For example, I hadn't talked to my mother in law since I quit. When I spoke to her on the phone a couple weeks ago, as soon as I hung up I wanted a smoke. I hadn't had a craving for months.  That also helped me realize my craving fighting skills need to stay sharp. Not another puff.

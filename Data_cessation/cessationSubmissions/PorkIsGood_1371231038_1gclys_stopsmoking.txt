I finally hit the one year mark.

It wasn't easy but I did it. One year ago today I looked down at that pack of cheap cigarettes and I decided that I wouldn't let the control my life anymore. I stopped cold turkey. I did keep the pack around and every time I would want to smoke I would walk up to them and flip the cigarettes the bird while yelling "FUUUUUUCK YOUUUUUU". As a reward for making it this far I'm going for a 3 mile run then I'm going swimming with a very nice curvy corn fed southern woman.

TL;DR Fuck smoking, running, and swimming with curvy women.

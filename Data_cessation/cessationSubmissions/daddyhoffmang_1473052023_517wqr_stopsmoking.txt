Lozenges?

I smoked a pack a day for about 6 years. I set August, 1, 2016 as a quit date. On August 1, 2016, I switched from smokes to 4mg lozenges. I finished those lozenges and did a round of 2mg lozenges. I'm at exactly 5 weeks no smoking and I gave up nicotine lozenges 48 hours ago as well

I smoked a lot so I'm worried about smoking another cigarette but I probably won't because it's gross?

How did I afford to smoke?!

Just got an alert that I’ve saved about $450 from not smoking for 50 days (I was a pack/day person) and I am shocked! How did I afford this addiction for 5 whole years?! Especially as a student for the majority of the time. It’s crazy to see the numbers add up like that

Day 2 and oscillating between calm and frantic, need to stop over thinking this.

So this might end up being very long and disjointed, but I think it'll help just spelling out what's on my mind and getting me to calm down. 

**Previous Reasons to Quit**

So I woke up yesterday morning hungover, poor, feeling the waves of regret/shame, pretty low and with that stifling, struggling pain in the lungs and throat that is indicative of having chain smoked 2 packs in the 8 hours preceding sleep. This feeling is always asociated with not really feeling like smoking for the next 12-24 hours anyway - the cravings just don't hit then, the thought of a cigarette would make me feel ill. Just as well, my pack was empty so I go about my business for the day. Buying some stuff at the convenience store later in the afternoon and think about buying a pack of smokes - then consciously decide not to, and deliberately stand in line for the register that doesn't sell tobacco. Just like that, I'm attempting to quit again. Now, I've tried to quit a few times in the past before - never have I lasted more than a week. My usual reasons for quitting are usually an amalgamation of the following:
 
a. I'm poor. Just recently finished up on my Bachelor's degree, work is sporadic, partner is busy working on her PhD with no funding left, rent is high, cigarettes are $17-18 a (25) pack here in Sydney. 

b. The shame/regret of the hangover coupled with the lung pain. This has lulled me into a false sense of quitting before that has never lasted more than a couple of days as I tend to just convince myself that it was just hangover regret and not something I actually want to/need to do. 

c. Encouragement and Admiration from others - Being completely honest here - but I've had previous quitting "attempts" fuelled entirely by wanting to feel good about myself in terms and craving positive affirmation, encouragement and admiration from those I know/respect/admire ("Oh, you're doing so well!" "You smell nice!" or whatever). I use the quotation marks as these attempts are never real - they may last a few days but I'm not with any actual desire to quit for myself. Once the cravings get bad enough, I break down and smoke and then accrue the outpouring of sympathy and understanding whilst I falsely bang on about how hard it is and how low I feel - in reality, I always know that I was never going to be successful - I fail because I never really have the resolve to begin with.  

**Health**

This time is different, though. It's a lot more to do about health - partner's had a recent health scare to do with a benign tumor in her ovaries along with several other ongoing health problems. None of them have to do with smoking (and she's never smoked in her life), but it sorta has been hitting home how insipid I am being. I think being in your mid-20s as I am comes with a sense of invincibility in that you don't really think about your health or future complications. Or at least, I don't. There's a sense of "Pfft, I'll be fine, I'm only 24, got my whole life ahead of me!". But then when some stuff happens to someone so close and important to you who's only a couple years older and in similar shape (overall body should be healthier as she doesn't smoke or drink anywhere near as much as I do and exercises a bit more.), it kinda rattles that invincibility. I saw my hands in the convenience store yesterday when looking for the groceries I needed, it wasn't just that my fingernails were stained yellow - they were nearly brown - but also, my actual fingers were very very noticabilty tinted the dirty tobacco yellow when compared to non-cigarette holding digits. And I can't even run more than a couple minutes before running out of breath. I used to play friendly but competitive and hard hitting tennis for hours at a stretch. And I'm still 24! 

**The Other Stuff**


That said, I'd be lying if I said that it was nothing to do with the usual reasons - of course there are elements of that. For instance, I am still poor. Yet, I could probably make it just work monetarily, espeially if I swapped to the cheapy packs like the Bond Streets or whatever that are more around $12-13 a pack. Also, we're moving out of Sydney soon into a smaller town a reasonable while away which will cut our rent by about $120-140per week. My share of that savings could be my cigarette budget, especially if I learn to roll or move to the cheap ones. But in truth, we're planning our wedding and honeymoon and really need to save up some dosh for that - making ends meet paycheck to paycheck isn't justifiable anymore. What better way than stop smoking and BAM, $100 a week in the pocket. In terms of post hangover shame, I'm trying to do what I can to help motivate myself and ensure that I don't convince myself to just let it go as I usually do, and part of that is posting here to make it "real". 

**Trying not to make a big deal**

To ensure that I'm not doing it for the encouragement, I'm choosing not to make a big deal out of it and am not going to tell people I'm quitting. Not to say that I'll lie if I am asked, I just am not going to trumpet on about it. My fiance is aware, she worked it out when I stood in the non-tobacco line at the convenience store, heh. I'm trying not to make a big deal about it, though. I don't want to end up where I just let myself go around her and give myself the freedom to snap and be annoyed at the drop of a hat, "just because I'm quitting". That isn't fair to her to put up with. Yes, it might happen once or twice (or more, who knows) and of course she will understand, I just don't want it to be all the time, just because I can get away with it. Secondly, I also don't want her to have to think too much about what she says, walking on eggshells - it'll just remind me of my annoyance and just remind me of the fact that I'm not smoking, which only brings back the cravings. Does this make sense? 

**Over Thinking Too Much**

I'm also overthinking this far too much in terms of timing - I always freak myself out in trying to find the perfect timing to try and quit. "After exams" "After I get a job" "After fiance's surgery" etc etc. Now I'm at a cross roads of what to do for a couple of reasons. These are my arguments. 

Argument A: It's a real stressful time right now getting stable work, moving cities, etc - quitting will just add to the pressure for me / take away my method of dealing with the stress. Quit after you're sorted 

Argument B: What better time to quit and start afresh than when you're starting afresh with life? Getting a head start means that you won't be quite as crabby when you move and won't associate your first impressions of the new town with general irritation. 

Argument C: Why associate your last month in a city you have such good memories in with so many friends being irritated and struggling? Besides, most of your closest friends are smokers who you will be around quite often before you move and you'll be at the pub and generally drinking/committing general acts of debauchery and fun quite often - these are your weakest moments by far and you have no chance of making it, so just shelve it and try when you move instead of doing it now, failing and subsequently losing the momentum and motivation for the next few months. 

Argument D: Ah, but your final month in sydney is punctuated by a 10 day cheap+romantic trip to Thailand with the fianc√©! Just think how nice it would be to not have to smoke along the hiking trails and on the beach, no more side glances and dirty looks from others enjoying the beauty, no matter how conscious you are with ashing and butting into your little travel container! Plus, it'll help break up the constant out drinking with friends which you are so afraid will break you. it'll be easier if its just a couple times! 

Argument E: Are you kidding me? Of course you'll be drinking in Thailand and with other smokers or not, that alone gives you strong cravings due to association. Do you want your romantic trip away, your first one in ages that you've saved forever for to be ruined by crabbiness and grumpiness? Just smoke now, quit afterwards. Plus, cigarettes are cheap in Thailand! You will be tempted. 

Argument F: Well there's no such thing as a good time ever, is there? I mean, you're going to want to drink and socialise when you get to the new town anyway so you meet people, so its not going to get any easier. A Perfect time won't come, just suck it up and quit now. 

Argument G: Yeah, true, but now is especially bad - too much stress, and don't fuck up Thailand with being bitter. Just wait a month, tops two till you've settled into new town a bit and then get into it. 

Argument H: God damnit, this isn't some carefully orchestrated experiment that can only work if the conditions are *just* right - its going to be hard whenever and there's always going to be something that will be compromised as a result. Thailand won't be ruined, you'll have a great time hiking and snorkelling and yes you will have some major cravings but they aren't going to ruin your first holiday in a long while! Now fucking man up and deal! 

I want to just stop over thinking it and just continue doing it - but its hard, as analysing a situation and every hypothetical is sort of what I do with everything in my life. And continuing to think about it and analyse it is driving me crazy and making me just want to admit defeat before I've even really tried and just get a pack. It's way worse than the physical cravings. I want to step out to my balcony and pick through my ashtray for whatever butts I can find that still have a reasonable amount of tobacco in them and smoke them, but I know that's a terrible idea and will only frustrate me more until I go get myself a pack and smoke one or two whole ones to calm my mind. Typing out the arguments was one part cathartic and one part has made me feel a bit more hopeless again. I'm sort of stuck between this calm, assured, "Yes, I want to do this and I *can* do it. Nothing can stop me if I have personal resolve, which I have - remember your hands and how yellow they still are." and "Fuck, this is stupid, I'm going to lose my mind, fuck it, I'll try in a couple months when life is just a bit calmer and more assured but for now, give me a god damn cigarette" - and both are equally convincing arguments. 

**Desires from Quitting**

I know this is a flipping HUGE wall of text and I'd be surprised if too many people have read through, but thank you for taking the time to listen. At the very least, even if no one read through, it was cathartic and helped me to organise the crapload of thoughts in my head into a single file and helped me to understand my conscious and sub conscious reasoning, fear and desires out of this. I want to not smell like stale cigarettes. I want to be fitter again and to be able to swim/run. I'm moving beach side to one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, I want to take advantage of that! I want to not have health complications. I want to have more money to help afford the wedding and honeymoon we want. I think it would be a bit ludicrous (if we move into the cheapest of the houses that we applied for in the new town) that my average weekly cigarette budget would be 80-90% of my half of the weekly cost of our rent. Smoking for a week would be nearly equivalent of the cost of a roof, having a kitchen, shelter, electrical appliances, my own personal space, safety, etc. Sure, I can whinge about taxes and government but in reality, they're not getting any cheaper so I have to decide what is more valuable to me - defiance that will harm myself, or acceptance that might harm my ego. I want to be able to not rely on smoking as a social crutch to get to know people better. I don't want to be dependant on a substance for calmness and sanity. I think the biggest thing is its not like I was an annoyed shit before I picked up smoking - I was able to effectively deal with stress and pressure before smoking and I will be able to again, just as the cravings fade. The cravings are nothing more than physical dependency, not my body requiring them for stress management - it just thinks it does. I'm just scared to do something about it. Still, I'm oscillating between the calm, collected assurance of wanting to quit and the cravings-addled frantic desperation of worrying too much about when, how, why coupled with the nagging fear of "I can't do it". 

PS: Don't even get me started on methods of quitting - I'm going cold turkey from an average of just short of a pack a day (roughly) but staring at my pack of nicotine gum from my last attempt, thinking about patches, e-cigarettes, trying to cut back a step at a time, etc. Ugh.

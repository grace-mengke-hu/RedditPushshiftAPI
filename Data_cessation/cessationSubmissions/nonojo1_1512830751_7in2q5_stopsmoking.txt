Wow, weekend mornings are tough!

I normally would wake up, make my tea, grab my phone and smokes and take the dogs outside. I would sit on the back deck, light up and go through the news and social media on my phone while sipping my tea. It was my time to be peaceful and unbothered before I started the day. I would usually smoke 3-4 cigarettes before going back inside. I loved that first morning smoke(s). Yesterday was easy with minimal cravings that were weak. This morning, not so much. If there were any cigs around right now, it would be very very tough not to give in. I think the best move will be to get in some workout clothes and push myself and sweat until I no longer want one. Does anybody else find weekends difficult? 10 1/2 days and still struggling at points, not as bad as it was in the beginning though.

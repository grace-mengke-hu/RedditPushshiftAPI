3 weeks in - it gets easier every day

To motivate myself to quit I've been going to the gym every day. I have some good friends who rock climb and it's been so much easier to climb with them - when I was smoking I would have to call it quits about an hour into the day, I feel so much better now that I can keep up with them.

Good luck to everyone else on your journey!

36 hours!

I wanted to post about my quit day yesterday but got scared and wanted to be sure I could actually make it a full 24 hours. I did it!

A day and a half later I'm still going strong and feeling great! This is the longest I've gone without a cigarette in over 7 years and I couldn't be happier about it. 

Thank you for all the support and tips!

You know you have really quit when...

You have a dream (nightmare) of wanting a cigarette and it being handed to you, you pick it up and put it up to your lips. And when you are about to light it, you’re like fuck no I can’t reset my counter I’m too far in!!! 

Day 145 for me. 7 year pack a day smoker. Starting to feel 1 million times better. Been using caffeine as a crutch though. To boost my mood and have something to do while driving/ something to look forward to. ( a drug)

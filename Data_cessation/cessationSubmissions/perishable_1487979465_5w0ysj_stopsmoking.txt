3 days no smoking and smoking friend is going through a rough time

We are going to meet up in a few days and I'm sure he's expecting us to chain smoke and chat as we've always done in these situations. I'm afraid I will give in and have "just one." On the other hand, I feel I can persevere and stay quitted because I'm done and happy to be a nonsmoker now.  He is my friend and not in a good place so the last thing I want to do is shame him, like, um, I quit smoking and cannot be around you.

But... is it too soon to hang out with another smoker?

I don't want cigarettes to be precious in my mind anymore and not hanging out with someone because of them seems to defeat that.

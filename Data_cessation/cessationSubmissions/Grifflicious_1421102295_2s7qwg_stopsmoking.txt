I'm finally ready.

Hey guys.  

I've been a smoker for almost 10 years.  I promised my wife over two years ago I would quit and now we are expecting the birth of our first child in May.  I can't express how important it is to make sure she comes into the world having a healthy and smoke-free father.  This has been the hardest thing I've ever tried to do in my life.  

The problem I've always faced is how much I genuinely enjoy the act of smoking. Whether its taking a break from work, grabbing some drinks, or just hanging out with friends, smoking has always been there.  

I found this subreddit today and decided enough was enough.  That I can't keep going on lying to my wife or myself anymore.  I can't keep hiding what I'm doing because I miss kissing my wife as soon as I get home from work, but don't because I'm afraid she'll smell the smoke on me.  

No one likes doing things alone and I know I can quit, I've just never had a real reason to.  I hope getting involved with this sub and its members, I can finally begin a better path in my life that gives me back the person I should be and the Husband/Father I need to be. 

Thank you and I can't wait to start my journey. 
Chris

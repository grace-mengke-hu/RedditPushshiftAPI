Withdrawal

It's been 3 weeks since I've quit smoking and 1 week since I stop chewing nicotine gum
But I don't know why suddenly I got a very huge craving to smoke today, my cravings have been usually declining but since the past 2-3 days they're coming back

Is it something to do with the nicotine gum 
Can somebody please help

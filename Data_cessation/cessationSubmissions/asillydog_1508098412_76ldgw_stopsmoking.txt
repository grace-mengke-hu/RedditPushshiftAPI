Cognitive sharpness?

Hi fellow quitters!

Can anyone tell me if they've managed to quit and still maintain the ability to focus deeply?

I started smoking at uni. I loved, loved, loved the feeling of having a cup of coffee and a hit of nicotine and just zeroing on my reading. The rest of the world disappeared and whatever I was reading came to life.

Of course, once I left the library and walked up some stairs, I'd hate myself for what I was doing to my body. 

I want to quit. I haven't smoked in months, just been using patches. But the patches are killing my sleep (5 hours on a good night) and I just want to be free of this drug.

But then again - I don't want to lose that feeling of near perfect focus. Do any of you know what I'm taking about? Has anyone made it over to the nicotine-free life and found they were still able to really focus deeply on, say reading, after withdrawals were over. 

Thanks all. Much love.

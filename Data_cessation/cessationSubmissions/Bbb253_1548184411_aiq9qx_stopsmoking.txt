My e-cigarette was discontinued

(Venting post) 
And I'm done. I'm done with this fucking substance. I'm done spending a shit ton of money on Mark10 cartridges. I have to quit. 

I have never been more addicted to nicotine as I am right now. I use 1.5-2 cartridges a day, which equates to 3.5-4 packs of regular cigarettes. When I smoked American Spirits, I didn't even come close to 4 packs a day (I was at about a half pack a day depending)... 

So here I sit... I just found out that Mark10 is going out of business and is only available while supplies last. I'm super addicted to Nicotine... and now I have to try my hardest to not bum cigs, because they make me feel fucking disgusting. 

Wish me luck. ðŸ˜­

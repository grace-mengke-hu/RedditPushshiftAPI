Almost three weeks in. When does this "quitters flu" stop?

I am so happy that I quit smoking. However I am over this cough and phlegm phase!!!!! I thought quitting was supposed to make you feel better!!! I am pretty happy though that I havent been replacing smoking with food. I've actually lost weight. So just toothpicks for me. I am still getting cravings though. Especially with all my friends because they smoke. But yeah, thats my story and I cant wait to breath normally!!!

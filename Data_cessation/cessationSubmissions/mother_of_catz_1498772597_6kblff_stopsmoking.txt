Sensory overload when quitting?

I have 24 days under my belt and I know that the senses of taste and smell are heightened after you quit, but I am tasting and smelling things that nobody else does.  Eating the same lunch as others and tasting cilantro (which I dislike but one of the other people eating it loves) and nobody tastes it, smelling gasoline where nobody else smells it, and having waves of very specific cravings where I can think of the food and basically smell it.  And no, I'm not pregnant.  My mom's side of the family, myself included, are a touch clairvoyant (not psychic by any means but it is kind of a characteristic in our family) so I'm entertaining the thought of possibly being more susceptible to this realm.  The other possibility is that I have a few screws loose or maybe am experiencing some sort of placebo effect.  Also my dreams have been insane.  Curious what anyone can add to this!

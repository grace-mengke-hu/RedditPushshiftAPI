3 hours, No cigarette

I’ve been trying to stop smoking for two years now and it has been the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do. I recently just decided to pull into a vape shop and see what they have. I bought a Suorin Air, Apple flavored and I am in love. This is the only realistic way I feel like I can stop. I am not even craving a cigarette right now and I am amazed. I’m so mad that I didn’t do this sooner!

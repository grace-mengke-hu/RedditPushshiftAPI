Need help switching to an E cig, no idea where to begin.

Hey, thanks for reading. 

Basically I have to quit smoking, but due to issues I haven't (depression and anxiety) really made it a priority but today I want to change. I started looking into Ecigs and I don't know where to begin if anyone can help me out. 

Should I get a cig or vape pen or a vape box? What's the difference in it all? I'd love on that's refillable so I can buy the liquid rather than having to buy new loads every time and switch them out. 

If anyone is able to teach or recommend a model and give the pros/cons  I'd be very appreciative. I'm a heavy smoker so I'll prob try to find the high nicotine liquids at first to refill the thing with, then prob drop down to a lower grade over time.

I'm quitting for good now

13 hours ago was the last cigarette I smoked (ignore the flair). After that I threw my pouch away even though it still had some tobacco left in it. It was very emotional. I cried like I was letting go of old lover (which is ridicilous), but I also cried because it felt so good to finally make the decision. It felt good to know that I wouldn't be destroying my body anymore. It felt good to know that I would get my voice back (I'm a singer). And with a history of trauma and depression, it felt good to do something good for myself.

It's been easy so far. I've already resisted most of my major triggers (after waking up, after coffee and after sex), so I'm feeling good about this. Boredom will be the biggest challenge though. And the upcoming week. Wish me luck!

17 days not 'smoking'

First I want to thank this subreddit. I have to be honest, I am mostly a lurker on here, even while smoking, but this communities constant posts make it inspiring and inspiring enough for me to quit. 

I didn't want to get my flair from this subreddit until I was certain my mind has been made up that I am done with cigarettes. Although I have quit smoking cigarettes I am still puffing an ecig. I have to say that I do enjoy it, but do it far less than smoking cigarettes. Today I sat down and watched all of the Allen Carr documentary so many of you attribute to encouraging you to quit smoking. 

In the past I have struggled and have been able to quit using different ecigs but never wanted to invest in an expensive one, because I am quitting and want to wean off nicotine. So a few weeks ago, after losing my cheap ecig, I bought another cheap one. So far, so good. Now I am looking in the next couple weeks to start weaning myself off nicotine completely. I have not yet decided to quit ecigs completely or just use the nicotine free ones for a while, just to trick my brain.

Either way, there were a few videos that did help me to quit that I wanted to share:

* Everyone knows that Allen Carr documentary, but if they don't here it is [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP1ykPUTk_Q)

* Ellen has always been someone that I found cool and when she talked about using Allen Carrs method I found that inspiring [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9S4ojJRP2I)

* Allen Carr, himself, talking about quitting smoking [Video](http://www.wimp.com/quitadvice/)

* I have never been one for fear to make me quit, but this video just SCARED the shit out of me [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbvOHUiIP2M)

I want to be apart of the generation that is nonsmoking generation. I know it is a stretch being as young as I am, but I am going to be apart of the side that is not smoking.

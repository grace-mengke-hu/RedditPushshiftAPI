Question. 3 weeks in!

Hey Hey, I am 3 weeks in. I am feeling OK, but have had a few health issues after quitting. Last week had a terrible/weird tooth ache out of the blue. Hurt like hell all weekend and then stopped. I am also having allergies worse than any time in my life. Any way these could be as a result of quitting? Like my body is doing things it should have while I was smoking, but cigs were blocking it.? On a positive note I can taste things. I can breathe better! I doubled my swimming workout the other day because I felt so good when I normally would have been finished. Woot! Thanks for existing so I can ask questions. Also I bought and arcade cocktail Arkanoid machine with the near 100 bucks I have saved so far. This isn't mine, but it is exactly like this. http://edmonton.canadianlisted.com/art-antiques/arkanoid-cocktail-arcade-machine-for-275_1159845.html

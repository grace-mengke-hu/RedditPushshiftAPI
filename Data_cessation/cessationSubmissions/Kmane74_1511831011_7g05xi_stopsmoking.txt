127 Tobacco/Nicotine Free

I know I posted when I hit 4 months but each day is another victory. Would've never thought I'd give up smoking smoked from age 11-18 basically. Something clicked and now I'm here! Very thankful to have supportive people on Reddit and the quit smoking commercials on the TV's and they have them on the buses in my town. Anyways as they say **IF I CAN DO IT ANYBODY CAN DO IT**

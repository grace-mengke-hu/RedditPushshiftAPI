Almost 150 days since my quit day, and still struggling.

Hello fellow quitters, I thought I'd drop by here to get some support or tips. Quick back-story: smoked for 4 years, then quit for 6, then smoked for 2 more before my current quit. It was much more difficult this 2nd time quitting, in terms of cravings and thinking about smoking.  I am 31.

Judging by my first quit, I would have thought by now that smoking would just be something that I would occasionally think about, especially around times of triggers i.e. drinking, after meals etc., but it is something I think about ALL THE TIME. I know there is nothing good that can come of smoking, but I can't help but think many activities would be more pleasurable by smoking, like driving, downtime at work or at home, drinking coffee/beer etc. I prevent myself from going out as much, as drinking and going out is not as pleasurable to me anymore. It is as if I just quit. 

The "honeymoon" of quitting has passed, so to speak.

I keep thinking that I should just go on a binge to get it out of my system and to convince myself its not going to be as pleasurable as my mind is making it out to be.

Sorry if I'm rambling, but I just wanted to see if somebody has some insight.

Thanks.

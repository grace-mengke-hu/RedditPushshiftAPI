Can't physically smoke anymore...time for my final day 1 ever.

Quitting smoking has been on my mind every single day for the past 2.5 years.  I've quit for 6 months 3 times, but each of those times I continued to smoke joints everyday that had tobacco in them, so although I wasn't smoking cigs, I was getting nicotine.  

This weekend I had a exceptionally heavy drinking / smoking weekend.  My throat was killing me last night, and today I feel like hell.  Lungs are just full of gunk.  Black, nasty, deathly gunk.  It hurts to breath, swallow, cough, etc.  I feel like this is my rock bottom physically.  I'm sure I'll send myself to an early grave if this continues.  

I'm also physically sick.  I feel like I have the flu or a bad cold.  Work sucks!  I can't stop coughing and I just feel worthless today.

It's 7pm where I live and I haven't had anything to smoke all day.  Time to recover.  Wish me luck!

I'm not really looking for advice or help or anything.  I'm just writing this down to remind myself what I felt at this point in time.  I want to be healthy again.

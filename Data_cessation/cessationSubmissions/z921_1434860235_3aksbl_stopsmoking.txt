Smoking two packs a day for 14 years. Trying to quit for the nth time and hopefully final time.

I began smoking in college. I have tried to quit before but I've never managed to last more than a few days.  It's been 14 years of smoking. 

If I don't smoke I'm like a caged animal. If I do smoke I feel like shit because I feel I'm not strong enough to combat the urges AND keep jolly and happy. (I'm not happy after a smoke also, as it basically means "defeat" ) 

I've been very cranky and angry at family and friends and I've hurt people by shouting at them for little reason, probably because I was in withdrawal. 

I honestly don't know how I'll stop smoking this time, but I'm going to try again, starting today and hopefully I'll quit the habit. 

Hopefully am an ex-smoker from today.

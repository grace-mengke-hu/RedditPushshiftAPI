This is the last time I quit.

Hey everyone.

I'm new to this subreddit but it just seems like a nice community and people are so helpful!

I am 19 years old and have smoked for 4 years. I have attempted to quit countless times but never succeeded more than 1 day. I decided to stop calling myself a loser who can't quit and I'm going to be a winner who can quit. I downloaded the LiveStrong app and it's great. I al currently on day 1. But hey! 1 day is better than 0 and we all have to start somewhere.

My motivation is family. The thought of me having to say goodbye to my family because of smoking tears me up and I see that there is a solution.

I just wanted to let you know so that I can get tips and also tell you if I fail.

Thank you for reading!

Update: Still going strong! 5days and 23hours!

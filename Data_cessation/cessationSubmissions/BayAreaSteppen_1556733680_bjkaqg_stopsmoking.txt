Anyone use Chantix to quit vaping?

I switched from cigs to vaping 3 years ago, worked great to get me off cigs but now I'm addicted to vaping! I just got my chantix in the mail from my doctor, and am going to start today. Anyone go through this?

Also, I have tried stepping down the nicotine doses in my vape, and it just leads me to vape more and more to get the same amount of nicotine.

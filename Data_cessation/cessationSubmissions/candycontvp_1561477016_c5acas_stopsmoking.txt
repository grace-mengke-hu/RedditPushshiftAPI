17 days and I failed!!! Smoked a whole pack in 5 hours

Extremely bad news and super stressful situations have always made me cave. Just that inner frustration and anger that is uncontrolable. I bought a pack of cigs and smoked the whole thing. 
After the last one I felt so disgusted. 
I'm pack on the patch and the 11 hours clean. This situation that I'm dealing with it wont be over anytime soon, I dont know how to deal with it and with the final verdict that will be in a few months. I feel hopeless

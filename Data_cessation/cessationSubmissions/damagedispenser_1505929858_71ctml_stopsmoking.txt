Day 1, hour 1.

I decided to quit smoking last night. I smoked my last cigarette, went to bed, and just woke up a bit ago. I'm finding that its all i can think about. I even walked outside to my truck looking for one i may have dropped. I reminded myself of a meth head looking for a rock in the carpet. 

I can feel my will breaking, but at least im self aware enough to realize it. Off to work in a few hours where literally everybody smokes. It's going to difficult. Honestly, I'm hopeful but not confident that i will succeed.

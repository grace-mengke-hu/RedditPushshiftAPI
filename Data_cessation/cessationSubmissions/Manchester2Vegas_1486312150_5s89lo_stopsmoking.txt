2 weeks clear

So I just turned 30 in Nov and my wife has been asking me for a long time. I was smoking a minimum of 5 a day for 10 years. Never managed to smoke a pack a day but I really wanted 2017 to be a good year for us. 

So anyway it started when I got the flu in early January lol. Couldn't really smoke but like a dick I was still smoking and y'know coughing and up the bad stuff was always a real eye opener for me. So I saw my window. 

So after a few days going cold turkey.. My Doc hooked me up with Chantax, you've probably seen the commercial. 

Man does that stuff work.. I don't even think about smoking anymore it just takes away the craving totally. The major side effect tho is the dreams you have. They are so fucked up I don't even know where to start. I'm talking like you'll wake up after dreaming about people breaking into your house and kidnapping  your kids. It's seriously messed up. I've been trying to write down the dream dreams but it's hard  to remember all of the logistics. 

Anyways just thought and felt like sharing my experience. 2 week down 36363 to go lol

Good luck everyone. I still remember how good that morning cig feels and that after dinner one and man it feels amazing and after 2 beers it's the best lol but seriously i know it's fucking proper difficult to quit and I don't even know how many times I've tried to quit but 10 years is enough for me. I hope I never buy a pack again. It's really hard but it's possible. Best of luck to you all and although the fucked up dreams... chantax is worth a shot.

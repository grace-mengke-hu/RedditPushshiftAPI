I slipped up today, but it was a good thing.

I was with a friend who smokes today and I slipped up and had one. Honestly it was the best thing for me. I’ve been struggling and craving them but when I had this one it just made me feel sick and tasted bad. I’m no longer wanting one at all! I only gave up a week ago, but I know I can do this and I’m going to be able to give up for good.

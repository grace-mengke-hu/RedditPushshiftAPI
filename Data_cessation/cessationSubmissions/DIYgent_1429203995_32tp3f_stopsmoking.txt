Car smoking was my greatest foe. Here's a tip to cut it out.

I will always see the deodorizing of my car as the catalyst for my finally quitting. If you are trying to quit and enjoy smoking in the car, this could help you. It worked for me: 

Giving up the in-car smokes on the way to and from work was hardest for me - I enjoyed them the most, with coffee and the radio news. 

Removing the smell of stale cigarette smoke from the car was crucial to my success plan. As long as the car smelled like stale smoke, I could rationalize just one more cigarette. I'd think, 'the car already reeks, I'll quit when I get to work... get home... get to work' and so on. 

Once the smell was gone I took a bit of pride in my vehicle and wasn't embarrassed about letting others inside it. The car smelled entirely different, and I liked that. It smelled like someone 'used to' smoke in there - but hadn't in a long while.

Here's the tip: find and rent a small ozone generator. Google it. Ozone treatments are very effective on smoke odours. Shock treat your car with an ozone machine for a few hours, after you've scrubbed the interior down as best you can. The result is amazing. I was shocked - and I'm a skeptic and a cynic - still, I use that word. I was shocked at the improvement. Further shock treatments remove even more odour. It'll never be good as new, but it's a dramatic improvement that very acutely removed the stimulus to light up as soon as I got in the car.

You can PM me for information about this if you are interested, but the short advice is to do that. Deodorize your car. Once that smell is gone, you never want it back.

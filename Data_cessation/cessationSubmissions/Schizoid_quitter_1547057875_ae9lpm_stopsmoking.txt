Cold turkey after 30 years

Hi everyone. I've never posted on an online forum, but I have been following the posts on here and have found it very supportive and informative. Thank you to everyone who so actively supports and motivates. I'm on day 12 after 30 years of smoking up to 40 cigarettes per day. Today, I looked in the mirror and I no longer see a grey, oxygen deprived face staring back at me. I am extremely grateful for the changes I already experience and I look forward to a healthier, happier future.

4 Days and 12 Hours

Hey I am Fabe from Germany. I Start to quit after 4 days, because I am a social worker for psychotic humans. Many oft them are heavy smokers and some of them are still in the Hospital couse of smoking legs vor cancer. It is very hard to See this and i am still thinking about my health. The first days were a little hard, but i still keep going. 
I hope that this is the last time to stop. Just eat healthy and doin some sports.
Cheers and stay tuned

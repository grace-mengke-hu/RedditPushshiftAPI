When did the brainfog lift for you?

Hey guys,

I became addicted to nicotine due to my weed habit, about 2 years ago. There were always phases during which I didn't smoke that much or at all, and after stopping weed at all at NYE, I also just smoked 1 cigarrette per day (to fall asleep easier).

6 days ago I smoked my last cigarrette, and cravings are almost absent, as I really implented the thought of being a non-smoker in my mind. I just feel kind of depressed, slept a lot during the last days, feel tired and have slight problems to concentrate (experiencing brain fog).

I know, most of you smoked far more than I did, but when did your brainfog lift? I want to be on top of my mental game as soon as possible, as there a some upcoming challenges I need my brain capacity for!

Thank you for your responses! :)

Some advice from another quitter

I have been a smoker for ca 17 years and this is my second attempt at quitting. First one was a couple of years ago and lasted 6 months. 
I figured I'd share some advice I think might help some of you at quitting. 


* You have to have the right mind set for quitting. My last attempt was because at a visit to the doctor, my poor health was pointed out to me and so I quit. After six months I went for another check up. Vitals were a lot better and one step out of the docs office I thought I can have a cigarette to celebrate. You probably know where this was going. 
Don't quit for anyone else, quit for your benefit, for your prolonged life.


* Quit cold turkey. Patches, gum and other replacement stuff is just keeping you hooked to nicotine. If you are really focused on quitting, you'll power through the first two-three days of the heavy bit. 


* What I found especially hard was to break the routine at work. Usually every hour or so, I'd take 5 and walk outside for a cigarette. Now instead of going for a cigarette, I stretch my legs a bit and read Allen Carr's book. You can open it pretty much anywhere and find a good reason or two not to smoke.
So the time I previously used to damage my health, I use to reassure myself that I'm on the right path. After 5 minutes with Allen Carr's book I feel a lot better than after a cigarette. 


* I do get cravings from time to time and for that I have an app in my phone called Smoke Free (it is the only one I tried, so I'm not sure if its the best one). This app tracks my progress, savings, health status and so on. There is also the possibility to register your cravings and keep a diary. This I find very helpful - the app gives me the possibility to concentrate on something else for a few minutes until the craving passes. 


* Don't just sit and wait for the worst to pass - enjoy being a non smoker. At about day 3 or 4 your breathing will feel easier already so do something physical. As soon as I could take a full breath without coughing, I sat on an indoor rower for 45 minutes and did it with a big smile on my face - no shortness of breath, feeling the blood rushing through my veins, my fingers and tows feeling warm for the first time in years. 
If you don't have a rower or don't feel like joining a gym just yet, go for a long walk. You'll feel the difference. 

There will always be the possibility that you'll fail. But this just means your mindset wasn't right. If you fail, adjust and start again. 
In no way I think I am an expert on the subject, just sharing some thoughts on the matter.

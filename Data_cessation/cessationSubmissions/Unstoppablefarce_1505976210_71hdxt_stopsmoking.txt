Here we go again.

I started smoking cigarettes in culinary school. Fast forward 10 years and now I'm burned out in the restaurant industry and at nearly a pack a day. Ive quit smoking for a few months here and there, but have fallen back to old habits again and again. I can be better, I know I can be better, I need to be better. 

Let's do this.

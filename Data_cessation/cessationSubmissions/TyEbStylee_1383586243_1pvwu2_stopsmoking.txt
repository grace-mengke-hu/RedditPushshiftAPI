Day two was the worst....

But luckilly it's not day two anymore :)  It's day 3 and I'm rocking out and having a good time while I get some work done; as opposed to fixating on my cravings for every single waking moment of the day.

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls.
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world.
except for Lola.
La-la-la-la Lola.

Cold turkey was (for lack of a better phrasing) really gay on day one,
incredibly disheartening and miserable on day two (at least for me)
and day 3 seems to be pretty alright with intermittent periods of absolute anguish.

But they tell me after the three day hump it's all in your mind.  Just gotta lay off the sauce for a while to give myself a fighting shit.  Hit the gym a lot.  Figure it's a good thing to be doing anyways.  It's starting to get cold.  They tell me skinny people die first out there in the Ohio winter.  Guess that's what coats are for.

So i'll just do it to feel awesome all the time and get all big and sexified.

Wish you all nothing but success.  Fuck cigarettes. No more nicotine slaves on this subreddit.  We got this!

Well I'm not the worlds most physical guy 
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine 
Oh my Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola 
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand 
Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man 
Oh my Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola...

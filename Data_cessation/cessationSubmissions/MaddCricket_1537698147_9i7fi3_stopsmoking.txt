How I spend my cravings.

Into Day 8!  Can’t believe I already made it past a week (that was the longest yet fastest week of my life).  I still get pretty intense cravings, though not as many as I did before.  When they do hit I chow down on frozen grapes and go to YouTube or Google and watch all the [Terrie Hall](https://youtu.be/7neRG6dGRVY) videos I can find.

She’s become a true coach through my hard cravings and a voice of reason.  Wish I could have had a chance to meet her.  

On the up side, I am thoroughly enjoying how clean I smell anymore! I’ve done laundry twice this week already and I also take showers a few times a day to get me through cravings too, and not smelling stale smoke or just something off is wonderful! I’ve also noticed my teeth aren’t as brown/yellow as they were before, and my digestion seems to be getting back on track! 

Good luck to everyone! Up and onwards!

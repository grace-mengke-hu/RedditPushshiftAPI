Having a cigarette will not make you feel better

A mate of mine has given up for good same time as me, we've been training together, jogging etc.. We're both pretty shit since we've both been heavy smokers for ~10 years. But we're definitely getting there. Other night I got nearly 2km before collapsing haha. (The thought of running 2m used to scare me).

My mate who I mentioned, about a week and a half ago dinged his brand new Prius on a pole. He was so mad at himself, he was only about 10 days into quitting himself, work/stress, long commutes, people breathing down his neck all day just got to him and the bingle on his car just tipped him over the edge.

So he went and bought a pack of cigs, punched like 3-4 or something that afternoon... Next morning he filled the pack with water and binned em.

The other day when we were going for a jog, he told me he'd kick himself if he could. Yeah, the stress, nerves wound up tight from nicotine withdrawals, the car crash and everything was all bad. But having those couple of cigarettes didn't make him feel any better, it didn't uncrash his car and it didn't make anything else any better at all. All it did was cost him 20 bucks (on top of the car repairs).

All I'm saying is, even if bad shit happens in those first few days after quitting, having a cigarette will not make you feel better, and ultimately it will make you feel worse.

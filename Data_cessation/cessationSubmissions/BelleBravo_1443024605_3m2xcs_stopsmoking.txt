My clean clothes smell like clean clothes

I opened up one of my drawers to get an under shirt and I noticed that my clean clothes still smelled like detergent. Before I wouldn't really smell anything Im assuming it had to do with smoking but it was nice to open up the drawer and get clean clothes smell versus either nothing/cigarette smell.

I appreciate these small victories from quitting smoking.

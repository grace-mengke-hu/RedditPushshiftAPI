Does this subreddit support vapes?

Hi :)
I wanted to quit smoking for a long time, but in the last 3 months I’ve been quitting another addiction and I’m almost done with that (I’m close to the 3months abstinence mark). I previously decided not to quit smoking until I was done with the other thing, but yesterday I walked into a vape shop and bought one, and haven’t had a craving for a cigarette since. I know that there’s still nicotine in the product I use, so I’m not really quitting, and in fact this is meant as a temporary solution. I want to gradually decrease nicotine levels (currently 9MG) and become a full non-smoker. But in the meanwhile, I am happy to give up most negative effects of smoking.
Do you support my choice? Or should I avoid posting here until I decide to quit vapes as well? I don’t want to be a trigger for other people, that’s why I’m asking.
Also, is “gradually decreasing nicotine levels” a real thing? Does it make sense?

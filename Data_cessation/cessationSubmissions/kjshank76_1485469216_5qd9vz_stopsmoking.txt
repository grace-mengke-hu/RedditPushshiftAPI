10 years!!!

Just came across this subreddit and I wanted to share my story with you all. Never thought I would quit smoking but I did it back in April 2007 with some help from Chantix. I took chantix only intermittently for a few months. Haven't had a single craving for a cigarette then and I will proudly be celebrating 10 years come April this year. It's worth it, every little bit!! If i can do it, you all can too!! Cheers!!!

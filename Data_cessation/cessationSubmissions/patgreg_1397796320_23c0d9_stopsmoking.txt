This is like the 5th time I'm going to try to quit

Like the title says, this is about my 5th time trying but now I have this new subreddit that I hope will be able to help. I've been smoking for just about 1 year now and I feel like it's time to start. As I'm typing this it's killing me knowing I'm going to try this again and I just want another one. Right now, I go through ~4 a day but recently it's gone up to almost half a pack. I'm just a freshman and I know there are some resources on campus to help me stop and I'll take advantage of those next year (this one is about to end). Does anyone have any tips? Any resources or stories you guys have to share? Thanks, and I hope this time it will be more permanent!

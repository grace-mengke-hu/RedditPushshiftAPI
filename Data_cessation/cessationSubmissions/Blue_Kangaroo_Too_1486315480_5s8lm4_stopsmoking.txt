Day 2 today. Allen is helping.

So I'm now into Day 2 after reading Allen Carr's EasyWay. I am generally feeling a lot more positive than I have with previous quits. In the past I've woken up with crippling depression on the 1st morning of a quit, that feeling of loss that smokers so often feel when they are deprived. But, thanks to Allen I'm not feeling a loss. I feel excited about getting healthier and having more energy. I did feel a bit low this afternoon but I cleaned my car (hoping to get rid of the smokey smell) and it feels good to have achieved something (however small) that will make my non-smoking life better. 


I hope everyone is having a good non-smoking day today. Wishing you all the best.

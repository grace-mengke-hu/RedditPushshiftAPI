Day 12 and still zero cravings.

I decided that I was going to post here a lot during my quit because I think this place is awesome and supportive. I was going to post everyday but honestly, there is really nothing dramatic or unexpected this time.

I just quit. I haven't looked back. I've had zero cravings since day four. I've been through this so many times now and I think I've really figured it out. The book and video that Allen Carr created really works.

The times I tried quitting before it were unmotivated and uneducated torture. The book changed everything. Even though I still had failed attempts, it changed the way I was thinking about nicotine. I kept trying and I kept failing. After a while though, you understand the 'timeline of quitting.'

You know what the withdrawal pangs feel like. You know when they occur and how long they last. How long it takes for them to stop. You start wrapping your brain around the addiction.

I know a craving could pop up any day now and I'm totally ready to embrace it. I decided that I hate nicotine, its a poison, and I will do anything to ensure I don't consume it. Just like how I wouldn't drink gasoline.

Don't quit quitting.

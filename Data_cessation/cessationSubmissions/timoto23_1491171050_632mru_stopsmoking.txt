I'm suffering physically but hoping it will end soon

I'm 25 and was a smoker for about 7 years and I officially went cold turkey two weeks ago. Since then I've had pretty heavy withdrawals.

- My chest felt tight for around a week
- I felt depressed for a while
- I still get aches and pains in my chest 
- I'm eating a lot of food.
- I had mouth Ulcers last week
- Today I've had a banging headache and flu like symptoms 
- My stomach has been upset.

Checking the symptoms online they all seem to match up and be common. The amount of pain this is putting me through is never making me want a cigarette again. I've never withdrawn this bad the previous times I've tried quit.

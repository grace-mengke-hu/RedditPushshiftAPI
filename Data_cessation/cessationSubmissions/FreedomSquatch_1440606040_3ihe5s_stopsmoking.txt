Day 3 of not smoking

Well after countless false starts the SO and I are now on day 3 of not smoking. Small victory but I have not gone this long without a cigarette in 10 years. The patch is sooo helpful. I won't consider myself as having quit until at least a month, but it really is easier every day. I have already noticed I can smell & taste better, and am less congested! Not sure why I posted except to inspire myself to continue and also anyone looking to quit. Go for it! The slog continues....

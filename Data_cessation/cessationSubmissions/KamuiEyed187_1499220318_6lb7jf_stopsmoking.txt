Starting at 6 AM.

Hey, I am actually 17 years old (turning 18) and have been smoking for around 2 years now, maybe around a pack per day.

Today I've made the decision to stop, since it's better to stop now, while my lungs and breath are still fine than in a couple years where I damaged my body more.

Maybe I can motivate people of my age to stop early aswell, or encourage them to not even start.

I'll probably update this post tomorrow and tell you how my first day without smoking went.

Lost count of attempts, but it doesn't matter because this will be my last.

Hello. I have tried quitting in the past and planned to again before having my second child, but lo and behold, I discovered I'm pregnant about 6 months earlier than I had planned. Hooray and uggh, I know I have to quit now.  It's taken me a week to come to terms, I was holding onto those last few months like they were gold...the lies my head tells me that keep me from quitting for good. I'm ready and my quit day is tomorrow. I have managed to only go back to 1-3 cigarettes a day the last 2 years, but I have failed in the past when I get angry (usually after arguing with my husband). Any tips on managing the craving while pissed the fuck off? I'm a lone smoker, always using smoking as an excuse for sneaking away or having a secret. If you're like me, how have you stopped feeding off that weird desire to hide? Thanks for listening y'all.

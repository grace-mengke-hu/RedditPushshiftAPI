Day something. Found I have to put my cat to sleep. Not going to smoke.

I've used NRT. still do sometimes. But what's worked for me.

The gum to get by
E cig for real cravings
Benadryl for restless nights

But now I don't want a real cig. My 13 month old has fip and there is no hope. In the past I would've used this as an excuse to have a cig but not today. 

Thanks everyone

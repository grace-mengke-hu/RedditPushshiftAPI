Did your hair grow back/become thicker when you quit?

Been smoking for the past two years after giving up for three.

In this time I've noticed my hair has begun to fall out and become very thin, which is weird since I'm only 27.

Did any of you have a similar experience? Did quitting bring your hair back?

Thanks.

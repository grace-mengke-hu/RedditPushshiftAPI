I'm Quitting for Good (Again) The 2017 Edition

Hello my fellow redditors,

I've been smoking since I'm 15 and am now 30. Over the last years I've decreased my consumption from one pack a day to 1/2 a pack per week. It's been difficult but motivation, exercise and reducing my drinking has done wonders for me. I've tried to quit for good at least 3 times in the past 2 years and I just couldn't cut the cord and was back to it after a month or two. It's clear that my greatest moments of weaknesses is when I'm drunk and when I'm high on life and very happy (that second one might be strange but it's definitely the case.) 2017 is around the corner and decided it was a good day to try again! I'm ready and I want to be done with it. Here are some of the things I will do to support myself:

- Don't drink more than a couple beers for the next 2-3 weeks

- Download a library of disgusting smoking pictures and create an album on my iphone so I can look through it when I'm having a craving.

- Sign up for tobacco free Florida and get some nicorette gum when I have bad cravings. 

- Mentally remind myself/medidate on it every single day. Create a list of quotes or reasons for why I should not be smoking and why I'm above the addiction and read it every single day with complete focus when I wake up. Just 1 minute or two of my time. 

- Keep up with the running/exercising

This is what I've got so far. If you have any other tips, apps or methods that have worked for you, please share!

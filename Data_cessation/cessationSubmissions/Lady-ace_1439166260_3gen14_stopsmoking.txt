18 days cig free! I've been lurking for a lil bit and finally joined+

Reading all your posts have really helped me these past two weeks.
   Pack a day on and off for 20 yrs! I quit 10 yrs ago for 2 yrs then picked it back up. I read Alan Carr 4 yrs ago and quit again. Started smoking again a year ago, this time around it got worse w the coughing and hacking, being tired all the time, dry eyes and dull skin.  None of that happened in my 20s. It got me quick this time around.
   I read the book again, got an app on my phone, and now I'm here w all of you! Cravings were really strong today but they didn't win. I'm so happy to find this place!

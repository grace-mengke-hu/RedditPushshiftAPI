Hey Guys, just starting out.

So yeah, for the last 5 years I smoked everyday. Had phases where I smoked a pack day but for the last months I leveled at about 12-15 cigs a day. I turned 20 last month and thought to myself 'Ok, time to grow up now. You wasted enough time of your life by doing stupid shit.' 

I'm actually changing a few things at the moment. I finally started lifting again, got a bit into psychedelics and microdosing, and am currently on Day 12 of Nofap.

I haven't been noticing extreme and/or obvious benefits from Nofap but just really like this feeling of 'oh, I went x days without doing y. Let's see how far I can push this.'.

This ultimately motivated me to smoke my last cigarette yesterday. I'm now 20 hours smoke-free and am freaking hyped to accomplish my first day not-smoking in years.

Thanks for all the shared experiences in this reddit and much support to all of you :)

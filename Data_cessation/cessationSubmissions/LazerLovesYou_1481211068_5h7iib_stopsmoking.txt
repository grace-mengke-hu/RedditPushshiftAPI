Ran out of cigs last night, figure I'll give it a go

Smoked the last of my pack last night and wasn't able to get more because of where I'm at. Been thinking about quitting or at least cutting down for a while now so I figured this is as good a time as any. I stopped for two years before using a vape (reduced nicotine levels gradually and quit the vape too), but then stuff happened, started smoking again blah blah blah.

Anyways, not sure how good I will be at this or how long I'll last but I guess this is day 1.

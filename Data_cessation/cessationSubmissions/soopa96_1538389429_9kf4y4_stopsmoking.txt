Has anyone had to cut ties with smoker friends?

I've been wanting to quit for a while, but being around my constantly smoking friends has made it incredibly hard to resist a smoke (especially when we are drinking). I'm starting to believe that to quit I'm gonna have to take a step away from them. Has anyone else gone through this?

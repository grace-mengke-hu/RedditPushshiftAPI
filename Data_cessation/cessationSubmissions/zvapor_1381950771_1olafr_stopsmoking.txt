Quit Since August 8th

I have been smoke free for two months and eight days now. It's been surprisingly easy, honestly. Which is odd because every other time I've quit it's been an uphill battle. Still, I haven't looked back at all. I'm breathing better, I feel better, my workouts are no longer affected by shortness of breath. I'm doing great!

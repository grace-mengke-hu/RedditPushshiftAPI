Third time lucky

This is the third time I've tried to quit - the first time I managed a month, last time only a few days!

But I feel more determined this time - I'm so bored of smoking.

My biggest problem is two fold - either if I suddenly feel very anxious (makes me NEED a fag!) or when I'm sitting outside a pub drinking pints (one of my favourite things to do). Any pointers much appreciated.

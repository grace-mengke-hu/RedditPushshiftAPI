1 week since my last cigarette after 18 years of 1 pack a day

Came here to share my experience. So far I replaced my cigarette with Vaping a week ago, and the cravings and headaches are nonstop. But I'm staying strong.
18 years of smoking cigarettes and I always thought it must be impossible to quit, but I was wrong.
I would recommend trying out vaping for anyone who is struggling to quit, it is super helpful in replacing the habit of puffing smoke and its related cravings.

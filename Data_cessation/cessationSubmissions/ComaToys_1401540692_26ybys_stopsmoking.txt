Day 4

I'm the guy who [blew off his fiancee for a cigarette](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/26nhgy/blew_off_my_fiancee_for_a_smoke_this_needs_to_stop/) a few days ago.  After that, I decided it was time to stop saying 'just one more' and finally quit for good.

Today will be my fourth day without a smoke, and I think the hardest so far.  I had no urge to smoke at all the last 3 days, but then she was with me the whole time.  Today I'll be at work and alone.  Just need some support to keep me from giving in.

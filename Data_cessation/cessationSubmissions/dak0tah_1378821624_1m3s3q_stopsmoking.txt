Quitting Today

I think I'm dropping the weed, too. I just have so many things on my mind that I want to accomplish and I think I speand way too much time just getting stoned and watching Netflix or browsing Reddit. I do yoga and manage to keep my body in check enough that I don't notice any health defects from smoking, but I'm sure they're there, under the surface, growing stronger with my each drag of death.

I am the master of my universal reality and I'd like to remove cigarettes from myself. Although those around me smoke, and will likely offer up to me, I plan to stay strong and true. I also advocate for better health (am vegan, work at farmer's markets, write a blog), so smoking just seems hypocritical.

    Oh but I love smoking, goddammit.    
    The thrills within just satiate    
    Still, time and again I've claimed I quit    
    Better than never is just a little late    
    My air shall again be mine    
    & welcome those pure to stick around    
    Everything should be just fine    
    No reason to get down

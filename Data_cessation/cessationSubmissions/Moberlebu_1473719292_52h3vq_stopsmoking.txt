OMG HEEEEEELLLPPPP

Fellow Quitters, please break this down for me: 

Prologue: I have been smoking a pack a day for 25 years with four breaks, the longest lasted a year, quit three times using nicotine chewing gum and one time cold turkey (reading Allan Carr).
I am 42 years old, mother of two sons, 10 and 14, for whom I want to grow old: I HAD to quit. I wanted to quit, and still do.)

I quit cold turkey august 25. Went through hell the first 3 days - as expected. From then on it got easier, I could easily cope with the cravings (I came up with a super anti craving strategy (will share it in another post)), I felt much better waking up in the morning, I was happy about my decision and proud that I was pulling through, totally convinced that the worst was behind me. Until yesterday! 

I HAVE NEVER CRAVED A CIGARETTE MORE THAN I DID YESTERDAY!! 

I am trying to figure out what happened, but I just don't get it. The craving came after we'd had a late breakfast, it was quite strong, but I was sure I could just sit it out for the usual five minutes. But it didn't go away! It stayed the whole day, and it was SO STRONG, it felt like a magnetic force, almost impossible to resist (but I did). I was SO restless and MAD at anyone for just talking to me. I made it through yesterday, but the craving was still there when I woke up this morning, I couldn't believe it! AND when I woke up I had just dreamed that I took a BIG PUFF of someone elses cigarette and inhaled it and it felt AWESOME!! The craving (from hell) lasted until noon today.

That is 24 hours. 24 hours of waiting for insanity to pass. Really! I was so relieved when it passed, because I don't know how much longer I could have resisted the urge, and I really really do not want to smoke anymore!  

Have anyone experienced anything like this? Will it return? What to do? 

Any advice highly appreciated!

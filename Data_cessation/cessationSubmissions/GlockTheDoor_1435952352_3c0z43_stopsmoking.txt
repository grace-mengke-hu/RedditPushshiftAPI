Just watched "the video."

I just watched [The Only Way To Quit Smoking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDJo1vfEqlo) and I must say..wow! That really broke it down for what a stupid addiction cigarettes are. Thank you, [/u/cenosillicaphobiac](https://www.reddit.com/user/cenosillicaphobiac), for telling me to watch this. For those who haven't watched it, I highly suggest you do! I've been using my vape for the past week or so, but I'm putting it away and [hopefully] never using it again! No substitutes. I hope everyone has an awesome, SMOKE FREE 4th of July (and weekend for those who aren't in the states)! And also, thanks to everyone else who posts on this sub. So much motivation, this is truly a great community.

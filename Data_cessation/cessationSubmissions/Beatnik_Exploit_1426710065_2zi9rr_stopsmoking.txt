Tomorrow is my 30 days, and I know I can do it!!!

This was not my first attempt at quitting, I have tried before and failed, my longest attempt has been 6 months and I already know I will beat it. 

It was just too easy to start smoking again before and now there are so many added obstructions to keep me away from falling back into the trap. 

I went cold turkey and am glad I did, this is just 30 days tomorrow and I am so happy. I really can't wait for my 1 year mark. 

Good luck to everyone else who is on the way to the first 30 days, Congratulations to everyone on day 1 and everyone who has quit longer then me, I will be at your number soon!

To everyone who is still wondering how or when to quit, just do it right now... what on earth is smoking doing that is positive for you? You are a slave to a chemical bond and you have the power to break it. .. Set your self free and soon you will be at your first 30 days as well. Tomorrow I will have mine.

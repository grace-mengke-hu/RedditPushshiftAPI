I've been using cinnamon sticks to help control my cravings. Are there adverse health risks associated with this? 

I'm using nicotine gum to try to stop smoking, but instead of chomping through whole sleeves a day, I've started chewing on cinnamon sticks much like someone would suck on a cigar. I've always been a fan of big red, and now I'm going through about .5-1/day. I've read, though, that too much cinnamon can lead to liver damage, gingivitis and has been linked to some cancers. I really don't want my replacement method to kill me as much as I don't want cigs to. Does anyone know how much is too much?

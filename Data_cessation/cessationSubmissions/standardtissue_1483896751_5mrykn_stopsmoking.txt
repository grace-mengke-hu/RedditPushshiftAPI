Why does cardio make me nic out like a fiend ?

Wondering if I"m doing something wrong or if this is common, but good cardio makes me crave like an sob, even if I'm wearing a patch at the time.  Is it because I'm metabolizing the nicotine at a faster rate or something ?  It's a problem cause I'll quit for a bit, start feeling awesome and then go exercise and what do you know at the end I'm feeling great and looking up but craving worse then ever before and relapse then go through the whole cycle again.

Questions for those who have dealt with weight gain after quitting smoking

Ok, I admit, I love to eat. Now that food tastes better I am finding the weight creeping up. Joining a gym right now is not an option, plus when I have done so in the past I always wasted money and felt like I was in a contract with the devil which I couldn't get out of.  Anyway my knees are not the best so that's just another thing to deal with. Back to food. At the point I am in my thinking, since I quit smoking, food tastes better and I am enjoying it more. My goal overall is to be more healthy, and losing weight is my next goal. The issue I am noticing is a kind of thinking that I am feeling sorry for myself because- ok you quit smoking, now you want to lose weight and get healthy, why cut out everything that makes you happy- life will be miserable.  So go ahead and eat and get fatter and more miserable. So I  am seeing this round as a set of stinking thinking- and I wonder if anyone else has had to deal with this and what did you do to get through it?

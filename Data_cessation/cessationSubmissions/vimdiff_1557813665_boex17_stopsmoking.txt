It's been 100 days since I last smoked (quit cold turkey). I don't really crave cigarettes anymore, but I can't get over the feeling that I'm missing something.

Whenever I feel that way, I just get something to eat (usually a lot sweets). 

I gained a lot of weight (I didn't really mind at first because I was really skinny).
I also come from a family with a long history of diabetes, and you can see why my replacement was a bad idea.

I'm planning to quit all kinds of foods that contain sugar soon, and that really scares me.

Anyway, this sub really helps a lot. Thank you &lt;3

My Complicated Relationship

On Saturday night I decided I had had enough. I finished a pack of cigarettes, and don't really have an intention of buying another. 

In college, i picked up smoking from friends, but it was mostly when I was drinking/on the weekends. however, as I got a bit older and my stress became an issue, i started smoking a pack every three or four days or so. Recently, I have become somewhat depressed and relied on cigarettes to take my mind off of other things. 

I haven't had a cigarette in about 36 hours. Today I am starting a new journey and hoping to stop smoking, continue eating healthier, and actually use my gym membership.

Just wanted to post here for some encouragement. I also know that the hardest part for me will be not smoking after I've had a drink or to (or when out at a bar). Any thoughts on this matter? thanks!

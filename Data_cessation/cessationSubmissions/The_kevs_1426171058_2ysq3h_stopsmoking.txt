Out of the blue

I have been smoke free for over a month and it has not been terrible after the first week. Today cravings hit hard, just as hard as week 1. She sneaks up on you and I almost caved hard and bought a pack, but I did not and I wont smoke today. Taking these cravings one by one and trying to enjoy being a non smoker. Please join me in now smoking today.

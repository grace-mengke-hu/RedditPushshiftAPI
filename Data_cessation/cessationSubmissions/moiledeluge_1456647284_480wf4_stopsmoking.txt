Quit 1 day 8 hours ago. I'm on a roller coaster of emotions.

So I just quit smoking a little more than a day ago. I used to smoke a pack a day on a regular day for the past 10 years. Yesterday was easier - I was super hungover. Today's cravings are horrible and it's a workday (Sundays are workdays where I work). I feel so tired but at the same time restless. I feel so angry but at the same time happy it is because I quit smoking. I cannot concentrate on anything but I'm dedicated to seeing these craving through. 

What do you recommend I do to reduce those cravings? Hit the gym? Sauna? I need to get out of work first before I get fired.

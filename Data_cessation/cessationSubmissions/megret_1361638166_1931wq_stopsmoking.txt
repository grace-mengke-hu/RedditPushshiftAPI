For some reason I can only handle thinking about quitting in days, not months or weeks

It's been almost five months since I quit smoking up to three packs a day, and when I say "five months" it kind of freaks me out and the old not-had-a-smoke-all-day nerves start revving up. 

But when I say this is day 145 or whatever, it's fine. That sounds completely okay. People ask, "Still not smoking?" and I'll tell them what day I'm on (thanks to the widget that's in front of my face nearly every time I use my phone), and they almost always say, "Wow, still counting the days? Boy, you must really be on edge."

But I'm not on edge unless I say something like "Four months, three weeks," or any other non-day length of time.

Does this happen to anyone else?

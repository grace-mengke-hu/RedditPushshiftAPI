Test post.. still not smoking :D

Subbed here just as I quit with my wife, havent really been back since... sorry.  Used Chantix to subdue the cravings & many cinnamon sticks to take the place of the oral fixation (still do...)  

Just wanted to say (as far as i know, the wife is out of town the last week or so) we are both still smoke free :D  She uses vapes at 0mg for her "fix" along with chantix, I just gnaw on the cinnamon.  

Good luck to all the rest!  

For those struggling times (I do this myself) Remember This:  Quitting something (anything) is not a "One and Done" thing.  Quitting happens every time you are faced with the choice, and choose not too.  You are never DONE Quitting.  In the phrase "I Quit." Quit is a VERB.

Keep fighting the good fight!

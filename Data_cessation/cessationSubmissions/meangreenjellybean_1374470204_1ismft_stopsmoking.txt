Smoke free for 20 days

It's really starting to get easier now. I still have some triggers, but I just breath through them or play one of the games on my cessation nation app (which is fantastic). I have saved $80 and I've NOT smoked 236 cigarettes. It's crazy at this point to see that number keep going up and I'm starting to learn how to live without smoking.

 I'm still on the chantix, although I've forgotten to take the 2nd dose twice now. It's making me less nauseous now, so I guess my body is getting used to it. I find myself snacking a ton, but I'm offsetting that by exercising, which I hadn't done in years.

All in all, I feel great. I just thought I'd share.

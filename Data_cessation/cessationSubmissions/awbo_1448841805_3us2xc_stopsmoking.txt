Have I been smoking on credit?

So as many here have recommended, I got the Smoke Free app, and it's very helpful. I also realized the amount of money I am spending a year, and after some quick math, I realized that if I had saved the amount of money I've spent on cigarettes in the past 9 years, I could pay off all of my debt right now. 

Then I also thought some more - why did I accrue this debt? Although it wasn't intentionally to buy a ton of cigarettes, indirectly it could be attributed to this filthy habit (i.e., taking away from other, more legit expenses). So in a way, I was smoking on credit...

Bottom line is, if I didn't smoke I could have been debt free. Hell, I would even have an emergency fund by now! This makes me sad...

TL;DR: amount spent on smokes exceeds current debt; could've been debt-free this whole time.

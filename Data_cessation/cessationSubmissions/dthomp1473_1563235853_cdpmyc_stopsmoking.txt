Today sucked

I have been smoke free for 67 days. All day all I could think about was smoking. Couldn’t figure out why but now I understand when people have been smoke free and desire a cigarette so bad. I was totally breezing thru the first 66 days. Did I smoke “FUCK NO” but boy did I want one. Lol

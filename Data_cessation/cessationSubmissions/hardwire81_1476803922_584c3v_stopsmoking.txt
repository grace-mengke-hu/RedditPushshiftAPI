My first year of freedom

You could argue that none of us are the same person today as we were a year ago. For most people though, unless you've gone through massive life changes, the changes are small. As someone who can now compare the me of today as a non-smoker with the version of me of the past as a smoker, the changes seem massive. 


My main reason and motivation to quit smoking was to regain control over my life, which meant removing the thing that had a lot of control over me: nicotine.


So, what are the biggest changes I've seen in the last year?

* I'm relaxed. Overall I'm much more relaxed, and it takes a lot more for me to feel stressed. When I do feel stressed it isn't even half of what it used to be. Perhaps for the first time in my entire life I can also experience complete relaxation. Like those moments when I sit down with a cup of tea and a book after a long day at work, knowing that I'm going to sit there until I feel sleepy enough to go to bed. Just sit there, immersed in a book, without a voice in my head saying "You need to feed me more nicotine now, I need a boost", or "After you've finished this chapter you need to go have a cigarette, it's the perfect time for a break". Which brings me to...

* I can focus again. Not for 10 minutes at a time, but for an entire hour (and sometimes more). Those who claim smoking helps them concentrate are complete victims of brainwashing. This newfound ability to achieve full focus and deep concentration has done wonders in my job, and finally landed me the promotion I've been working towards for the last 2-3 years. It might have happened anyway, but I think quitting smoking helped me achieve it faster. 

* I sleep better. I love sleeping, but I love feeling rested even more. On weekends I can wake up feeling rested with just 7-8 hours of sleep, as opposed to 10-12 as a smoker. I get much more out of my entire week that way. The best part about being a better sleeper is how much quicker I fall asleep. As a smoker I could get through 1-2 podcasts (and since I was awake listening to them, I would also get up for a smoke occasionally) before finally feeling sleepy enough. Nowadays I'm frustrated by the fact that no one has invented a podcast app that somehow figures out when you fall asleep, and pauses the podcast for you. Or if someone has, please tell me what it's called. First world problems and all that jazz.

* The self-respect I've always considered myself to have, is finally genuine. I've never allowed anyone to trample all over me, but now I actually feel like I have a good reason to stand up for myself, if that makes sense. There are no cracks anywhere that I'm trying to hide or make up for. I feel like I'm at ease with who I am and what I stand for. This might seem more significant for me because I was a secret smoker towards the end of my "career" as a smoker.

* I have more energy, which isn't surprising since I'm getting enough oxygen and my circulation has improved a great deal in the last year. To add to it I'm exercising more often because I have this newfound energy, which in turn generates more energy. Win, win, win.

* My mood is more stable, and it's usually good. Not only do I see that, but the people around me have commented on it on several occasions. The lows are not as low, and the highs are pretty much the same but more frequent.

* I'm not as anxious anymore. Certain situations would make me extremely anxious, such as certain social events, a big presentation at work, etc. Back then I would "solve it" by having a cigarette, which in turn made me even more anxious. Nowadays the anxiety I feel is so mild it hardly registers, and I instead go into these situations with a calmness I didn't realize I was capable of having. 

* I have more money to spend. Whether or not I spend it all wisely is a different topic, but at least I'm not buying things that is designed to kill me. I've already spent most of this year's savings on a new computer. Usually I would feel a certain amount of guilt buying one of the most expensive models, but not anymore. Money wasn't really much of a motivation for me, but in hindsight it really is quite a number you end up saving, and it helps me sleep at night that I'm not wasting it anymore. 

Then there are some things that haven't changed;

* My weight. Or wait.. I might actually be a couple pounds lighter than this time last year. I'm more active, but my calorie intake is pretty much the same.  

* The world. Bad things still happen, unforeseen circumstances occur, and some people are a pain in my ass, but at least it's easier to deal with them when you can cut to the chase without needing to have a cigarette first.


The leftovers from smoking that stuck with me the longest was this need/wish to have something to look forward to when doing a tedious task or feeling trapped in an unbearable situation. That's a purpose that cigarettes used to have in my life, so I've had to find thoughts of other things to get me through. There was a lot of "I'll just make it through the next 30 minutes, then I can have a cigarette" when I was a smoker. As a non-smoker it wasn't that I craved a cigarette, it was that I craved something to look forward to. Looking for that has actually allowed me to take a long hard look at what sort of activities I enjoy, but also find way to enjoy the activities I find tedious. I've started reading books again, drinking tea, writing in my journal every day, doing other types of writing, and listening to more music. All things I now have to look forward to, things that are healthy and actually helps me in the long run.  


In the end though, it's having control of my life again that is the most amazing thing of all. I've realized that my life as a smoker was very much about killing time between cigarettes, instead of actually doing anything of value. Not to mention spending time planning when and where to get the next one. Nowadays I feel much more involved in my work, my own life, and the life of the people around me. It's like I've been released from prison, and re-entered the world. If you're still stuck on the inside, I highly recommend trying to get out.

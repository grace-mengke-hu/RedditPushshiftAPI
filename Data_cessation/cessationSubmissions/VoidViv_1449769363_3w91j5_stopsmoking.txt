Anyone had to deal with depression after quitting?

I started taking bupropion about a week and a half before stopping. It worked wonders.

I have always struggled with anxiety and depression and some compulsive eating problem (smoking was a way to deal with that as well). So taking bupropion was like the holy grail for me (besides being an antidepressive, it helps with nicotine addiction and eating disorders).

**I have never been so functional in my entire life.** Really, I didn't even know I was capable of the stuff I was doing without thinking.

But then about 4 or 5 days ago it's like it all went away. Even the cravings got stronger, I had no energy and in fact for two days I was in the grips of the most intense depression I have had in many many years. I managed to get through that, but it feels like I'm back to where I was before the medication.

Is this withdrawal? Please tell me this is withdrawal and that I will go back to being as functional as I was being in the beginning once this passes.

Note: I'm not asking for any medical advice. I just want to know if it's possible that this is just withdrawal, if anyone has experienced somewhat strong depression episodes and a general emotional instability and a continuous state of mild depression after quitting. If anyone did, when did it go away, if it ever did?

I really hope this is just withdrawal, but I'm not sure I should be having this strong a withdrawal at this point. If it was withdrawal, shouldn't it have happened right at the beginning?

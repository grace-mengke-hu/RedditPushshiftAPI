Question: is it normal to feel my heart and body itch when I don't smoke? Help. More details inside.

So I just went on a 3-day trip without smoking because I was out of town with family. When I got back to my hometown, I couldn't sleep even though I was exhausted because my HEART felt weird. The best way I can describe it is that it felt like it was "itchy" and that I felt lack of bloodflow throughout my body, as if it wasn't pumping. Also, my bones and body just itched. I kept twitching to get over the itch. I ended up staying in bed for 3 hours before I fell asleep. 

Is this normal? Or should I get checked? :/

Herbal Cigarettes?

Hey all. So I smoked for about 8-9 years, just quit about six months ago, thanks in no small part to Allen Carr's Easy Way. Over the past half a year, I've stolen a few drags off of a friend's cigarette while out drinking. Only occasionally do I really feel any desire to smoke, and it is usually only when alcohol or marijuana are present.

Now my question is, has anyone who has quit smoking used herbal cigarettes as a substitute when they're feeling particularly weak, or as a way to still be a "social smoker" without the nicotine addiction.

I know herbal cigarettes aren't any healthier, but smoking one or two every two weeks ain't gonna kill me either.  But I'm wondering if I'm just on a slippery slope towards smoking tobacco again if I go down this road. The last thing I want to do is open up the door to the possibility of smoking again, but I also do kind of miss being able to step outside at a bar and just get away from all the commotion and relax with a smoke.

I've been toying with this idea for a month now, but haven't pulled the trigger because I'm just worried it'll make buying a regular pack easier, or that it will become another bad habit that is just as expensive and unhealthy as smoking.

Any experienced quitters out there with any advice or insight? I'd appreciate it.

Hang in there!! YOU CAN DO THIS!

I know a lot of you are starting on the quit smoking journey today and I just wanted to post and tell you guys to stay strong, get through the rough patches and triumph in the end!! It has been almost two whole years for me so far. I used to not be able to make it a full hour with out a cigarette. I didn't know how to socialize with out a cigarette or a cigarette break. I spent most of my time coordinating and managing my addiction. Smoking was a deeply engrained thing for me and I really thought I may never have the power to stop. But one day I woke up and decided that was it, I was going to try to see how long I could make it, and here I am! To many people's surprise!!

For a while after I quit I felt like a bad this weird hole in my life and in my thoughts. But I learned to fill that hole with better, more fulfilling things and today I feel like I can barely remember how cigarettes had a place there in the first place. I no longer feel the slightest desire to light up. 

I've even been having a very dark and depressing time lately, and before I used to think of cigarettes as a kind of acceptable slow suicide, but even in my darkest days now, the thought of smoking just isn't appealing or interesting in any way.

My point is to just hang in there. Push yourself through the beginning stages and before you know it cigarettes will feel so far in the past behind you. 

Being free is an amazing feeling.

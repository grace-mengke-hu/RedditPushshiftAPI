Another Attempt at Quitting, First time Posting

I'm making another attempt at quitting smoking. Haven't smoked in about 24 hours, and all I really want to do is go buy a pack and have a smoke. Anyone have any suggestions for curving cravings? Being at work in a bad mood the entire time is killer as well.

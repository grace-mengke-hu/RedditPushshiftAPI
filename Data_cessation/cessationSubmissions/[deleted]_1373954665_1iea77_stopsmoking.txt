I feel horrible. Short of breath. Tired all the time. I can't stand it anymore. Smoking for me ends today. How can I get my boyfriend to join me?

My grandmother died of lung cancer in April. Her brother died of it years before her. I had myself genetically tested and I have a 4% higher risk than the general population of developing it myself. My grandfather has COPD and Emphysema. On the other side of my family,  my cousin was diagnosed with beginning stage emphysema when he was 30. I've been getting short of breath lately and feeling tired and getting headaches. I had a chest xray which was unremarkable but I'm scared. And ready to cut this disgusting habit once and for all. It ends today. I'm going to take charge of my health.

My only issue is my boyfriend will not quit. He has been smoking since he was 12 and is now 31. I have told him it would be so much easier for me if he'd stop. He doesn't smoke in the house but today the stink when he came back in was awful. He got mad at me when I told him he reeked. Can I convince him to join me in taking back our health?

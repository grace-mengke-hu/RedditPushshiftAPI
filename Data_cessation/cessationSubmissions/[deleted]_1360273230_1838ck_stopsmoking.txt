I had you guys in mind.

Eight Days. 192 Hours of saying no to cigarettes. In the three years that I have smoked this is the longest I've gone without one. Today is really the first time that I've been tempted to give in and smoke.  Luckily I had you guys in mind and stayed strong. I want to thank those who peruse these threads and give strangers encouragement in making their lives better. As much as I have coughed the past eight days I couldn't be happier. The world smells so beautiful (weird right?). To anyone who happens to see this thread and is considering quitting I URGE you to follow through. I can't recommend Allen Carr "Easy Way". You guys are the best!

So, I'm dreaming of cigarettes...

I've started dreaming frequently. I know what you might be thinking, "everyone dreams". I haven't remembered my dreams in years, long enough to feel like I just don't dream and when I did remember them it was usually something way bizarre. And it's happening again. I dreamt of having a conversation and buying beer from a friend who lives in another province as though it had to hindrance. I dreamt I was smoking inside my house with my friends mom and just shooting the shit like it was totally the normal thing to do. I vividly recall going to my room to get another pack for us to share.

That is all. Thanks /r/stopsmoking.

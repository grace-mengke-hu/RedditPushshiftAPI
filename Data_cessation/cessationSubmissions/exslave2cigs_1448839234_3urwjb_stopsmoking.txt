Day 8!! Feeling great but need a kick in the butt

I used to be a big smoker. I "loved" it, but also, like most people hated it and was very ashamed of the nasty habit. I smoked a pack a day normally, WITHOUT drinking. Maybe 25-30 if I drank, as I chain smoked. Off an on for maybe 14 years? I had my first cig when 12 and there were family problems and loved it that very second. Since then, I've smoked to numb every unpleasant or stressful feeling. I just need to know that it gets better! I'm chewing gum, working out, keeping busy and all in all I feel much better, healthier, more stable, stronger etc... But there are times when the withdrawals are crazy and overpowering...and I just cry and yell etc....I'm fighting here! When will it start to get better? xx

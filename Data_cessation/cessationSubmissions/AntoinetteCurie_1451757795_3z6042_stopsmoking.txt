Scared I have oral cancer

I'm a sophomore in college, and being the impressionable idiot that I am, began smoking with my friends after classes and in the evenings. It became a habit, and I eventually began smoking around 1-3 cigarettes a day. I wasn't addicted, but really enjoyed the buzz it gave me, which helped me push through my coursework. I quit before Christmas because of a sore throat, and haven't had any cravings since.

Anyway, the reason for writing is that I've noticed that towards the back of my mouth, I have two white splotches as well as some black spots, and my tongue is constantly sore. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I jumped to conclusions and assumed I had oral cancer. Is it possible to develop cancer so quickly? I plan on going to the dentist soon, but I'm still freaking out.

3 weeks and I feel like a new person

Today marks 3 weeks. It felt impossible, but with this sub, my quitting app, and the encouragement of my girlfriend, I was able to quit 6 long years of addiction. If I can give any advice, it would be to change your outlook on the situation and never give up. Cold turkey works, it's up to you to quit.

Day 4, got insanely itchy rash/hives, anyone?

Ok so in all of the research I've done about quitting smoking and throughout my previous attempts at quitting I've never had or heard of anyone getting a crazy fucking rash as a result of quitting smoking. Am I the first, or is this seemingly out-of-nowhere crazy rash unrelated and just happens to have terrible timing?

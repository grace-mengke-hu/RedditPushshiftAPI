Â£1,300 a year on cigarettes!

I hate how much money I am spending on cigarettes, it's not like I can actually afford to lose that kind of money, being a student.

I've attempted to quit before and didn't make it far, mainly because I love social smoking with my friends, who all smoke. I don't want to stop seeing them if I quit.

I've also tried cutting down first and then quitting but I never manage to cut down that much before it goes back up to normal.
Basically any advice will be appreciated because I'm sure there are thousands of people who have these exacts same problems. I want to quit.

Struggling

I am not craving a cigarette and I have genuinely no desire to smoke but can anyone tell me when I will start to feel ok again. 
I feel sick and dizzy and tired and bloated 70% of the time. Yesterday was the first day I felt kind of ok and I have woken up this morning back to feeling terrible. 
I am eating healthy, exercising almost everyday. What more can I do it's driving me crazy. Thank you

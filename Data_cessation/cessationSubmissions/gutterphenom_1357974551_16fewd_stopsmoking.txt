I've let myself down at the week mark.

I had my first cigarette after being off for just over a week. 2 hours into the week mark actually. I've been a smoker for 10 years now, smoking around 20-30 smokes a day. I thought I was coping pretty well with it all, and my girlfriend asked me to come to a club with her tonight. Being the designated driver, and being the only sober one in a group of around 8-10 people 'caused me to hit breaking point. I asked my buddy for a smoke and went to the smokers area. I lit up the cigarette and instantly regretted it. The taste nearly made me vomit, and the smell. My god it was vile. I some how got half way through it before tossing it, and I've never felt such anger and disappoint at myself before. I feel like I'm back to square one, and now all I can think about is how much I want a cig this instant.

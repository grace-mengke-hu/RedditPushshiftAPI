There's a 'hunger' beneath all addictive cravings, but's it not for nicotine, not for food, not really.

Usually it's stress or some kind of personal pain. For me it's job stress and goal stress. In a weird way, smoking works because it's a non-achievement thing to do. It's anti-achievement. And of course, it's stupid. 

The smoking cravings are not so great when I find other non-achievement things to do. I don't drink anymore. But I eat, sometimes junk food. I watch tv at night. I sit and listen to music, doing nothing else. Best of all, I sleep without regret. Gawd, I love sleeping these days. It's my ultimate downtime. 

This post started as a comment on another post (http://redd.it/2ie1me). I suggested that it is worth reflecting on what it is for you, and see if there's some other way to help relieve it. And I wished the OPer a really excellent day. I wish the same for you.

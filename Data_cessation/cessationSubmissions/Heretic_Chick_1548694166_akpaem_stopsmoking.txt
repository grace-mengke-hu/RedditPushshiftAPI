Why am I so ridiculously thirsty?

I’ve noticed with every quit attempt that I do better when I always have some water to drink. 

Whats weird is when I smoked, I *hated* drinking water and only wanted sodas but after about the first 8-12 hours quit I only want water and little else. 

But it’s *so much water* all day long! Why is this? I feel like I need a drink every 10-15 minutes or I’ll wither away. Does anybody know why this happens?

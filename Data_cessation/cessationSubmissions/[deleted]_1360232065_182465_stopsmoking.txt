So I had a chest x-ray...

I am just over 30 years old.  It's been like 9 months; I stopped counting to be honest.

My doctor's office called me this afternoon.  The person on the line said that there was some abnormalities.  When I asked for more information, the person calling said they would call back in a few minutes.

About 2 years ago a friend and coworker who had quit smoking over 20 years ago became ill.  About 1 year after that I attended his funeral.  He was a really awesome guy and someone I really enjoyed working with.  He was healthy enough to be invited to my wedding, but he had passed before he could attend.  Lung cancer had snuck the fuck up and stole his life.

Ever since then I have had this thought in the back of my head that I was going to go out like that.  I thought that I was going to quit and assume that I could correct whatever damage I had done, but really I would end up falling victim no matter what I did.  Part of my brain keeps telling myself that even though I have quit, I have still killed myself.

TWO.  FUCKING.  HOURS.

For two hours I sat there on endless conference calls at work thinking to myself that I should be out having fun... that my teenage stupidity about smoking had fucking ended my life.. that I was spending what was left of my life being overworked and under-appreciated.  I spent two hours thinking that I had the big C.

Turns out it was some stupid shit about being shorter that I was before.

It's still in my mind.  It was there before and it won't go away.  I poisoned myself and I will pay for it for the rest of my (hopefully long) life.

Lucid dreaming anyone?

Hello,

For those who don't know, lucid dreaming is the ability to know you're dreaming while still in the dream. Allowing you to control it and remembering it so vividly when you wake up as if it is closer to an actual event rather than a dream.

Lucid dreaming while is an innate ability for some, can be trained an cultivated by anyone, it's a fun little hobby requiring very little additional time of the day and giving you hours of otherwise unused time at night. It is fun and addictive, and could actually be used to further train certain skills that you already know how to do such as piano for example as training carries to waking life.

Lucid dreaming is a relatively hard thing to train usually, except for the lucky few who have an advantage. **You** guys, people trying to quit an addiction.

I've been lucid dreaming since I was 14 years old and I'd like to believe I know the ins and outs of lucid dreaming. And trust me when I say that the hardest thing in your journey to become a lucid dreamer is to ingrain the habit of doing [reality checks](http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/reality-checks.html). And what easier way to create this habit than to do a reality check each time you get a craving. I won't be exaggerating if I say you'll get your first lucid dream within 3 or so days when usually it takes people weeks and months.

I won't be explaining the ins and outs of lucid dreaming here not to go off topic but it's a very easy thing to research. There are dedicated forums and you can also visit /r/luciddreaming or any of the tens of the lucid dreaming subreddits.

But in short you only need to start writing your dreams when you wake up which will also distract you from the morning cigarette and you need to start doing reality checks whenever you get a craving.

Happy dreams everyone.

IFL that this reddit exists.

I'm at the end of week 2 smoke-free.  I turned 40 a couple months ago and decided I don't want to be a 40-year-old smoker.  

It was hard to quit, but then I got sick and couldn't smoke, and I realized all I had to do was not start up again.

My last smoke was kind of like the breakup kiss - like a reminder of how I liked it but am not gonna miss it.  And it felt really good to step on it at the end, and then I tore up the rest of my pack into the garbage at the bus stop under the 2 AM street light across from the gas station where I bought most of my smokes for the past 3 years.

Now it feels like my lungs are falling out of my body.  I can't stop coughing.  I hope that goes away soon.

It was helpful to read through the thread and realize lots of people go through this every day.  Thanksguyz

What is wrong with me?

Hi, new here. I have smoked for about ten pack years, about seven years continuously. I quit smoking the first time about four years ago, made it two months, got terribly depressed and started again. Well in November of last year, I quit again. I made it again a little over two months. But this week, I have had four cigarettes. Three in the last twenty four hours. I have no idea what I am doing, it literally feels like I can't stop. I thought the cravings would end but the depression really sets in and I feel like I can't stop myself. I have tried chewing gum and it helps a little but NOTHING seems to get my mind off smoking. 

Is this normal after so long of not smoking? I feel like I am a smoker again and I am so disappointed with myself.

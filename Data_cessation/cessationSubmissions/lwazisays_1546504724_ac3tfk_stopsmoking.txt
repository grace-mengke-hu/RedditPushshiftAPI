How is everyone doing?

It's been a while I came here. I am still going strong with no smoking thing. Here is my journey so far. 

I did not quit cold turkey after all. But I made rules for smoking too. As a person who follows rules all the time, it really helped. There are 2-3 routes from my home to office. I made sure I changed them daily. This removed the behavior where I would stop at the store. Next, no lighter rule. I am generally not happy asking for light so that helped too. After few days, kept on reducing the count till I reached 2 a day.

Then, took a break from work and went for vacation where I would not smoke. That gave me 10 day start which was great.

After that it was just matter of fighting those urges. I would go and have water, call someone or do anything to distract me. Worked for me. 

Next, I bought a vape. This was for situations where cravings were just too much. However, I would resist using that too! I am still having it with me with same months old liquid that came when I bought it.

Now, I hate the smell of cigs. I really don't want to smoke. I tried it once but threw it away after one half hearted puff. Now I know I cannot even force me into it. 

Apart from usuals, I also felt anxiety for initial couple of weeks. I could sense increase in heart rate and was sweating in cold too. But it all went away. Now, I am happy. I don't even think of it. I have found music as replacement (not coffee or something else). 

One more thing I made sure was that I do use any of those apps. The more I look at it, more I would want to smoke. So no tracking crap for me. 

Lastly, I never stopped drinking or going out. Everything remains same except that I don't smoke anymore. 

Now, I don't understand how I used to go to smoking areas. Walked past one at airport and instantly felt like throwing up. 

For all of you trying, like me, just hang in there. I does get better.

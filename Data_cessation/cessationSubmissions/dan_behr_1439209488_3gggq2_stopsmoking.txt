1 week down, many many more to go

I've been nicotine free for a full week now.  I'm trying to quit cold turkey after smoking anywhere from 1 or 2, to a full pack per day.  It varied on what I was doing, who I was with, etc.  Now that it's been a week, I feel considerably more active and healthy.  My only concern is that school is starting up again soon, which means sylly week, which entails alcohol, and it's much easier to have a lapse in willpower while under the influence.  I haven't been in that type of setting since I cut off nicotene.  Do any of you experienced quitters have any tips or advice for me?  Thank you.

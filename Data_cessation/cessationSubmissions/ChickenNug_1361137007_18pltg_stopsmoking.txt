How have you dealt with the irritability that comes with quitting? Does Nicorette help?

I have been trying to quit for the past week and the thing that is really getting in my way is the stress and irritability that hits me when I have a bad craving.  Having a cigarette relieves that tension.  How have others dealt with the irritability that comes from quitting?

Also, have others found Nicorette gum to be a helpful quitting aid?  I'd like to hear some positive things before I go out and spend the money.

Thanks :)

100+ days done and dusted!

Ohhhhh wanted to post when I reached exactly 100 days - forgot about it, 102 today already. Guess smoking does not play an important part of my life anymore. #happydays 
Can't believe that I pulled this cold turkey thru, but it seems very easy now looking back. Come on guys, u can all do it if I was able to doing it!

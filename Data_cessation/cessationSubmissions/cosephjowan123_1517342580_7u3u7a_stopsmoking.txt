Started smoking @ 15/16, I’m 20 now, is the damage that irreversible?

Now I know that after 10 years or so the risk of dying etc. Is similar to a non smoker. Considering I’ve only smoked 1) for a short while 2) while young, will it really take my body 10 years to recover from the damage??? I have quit many times over the past couple of years but never managed more than a month. I stopped on Sunday so been about 48 hours. I’ve never been a heavy smoker so that’s not major (I’m used to not smoking mid week) wish me luck!!

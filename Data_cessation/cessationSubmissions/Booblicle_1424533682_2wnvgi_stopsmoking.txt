Nooooo!

It's been 490 days. And I'm feeling good even though I live with smokers. But that doesn't stop me from bickering about their smoking in the house. This week I was lucky to have the house to myself, as they went on a trip to a different state. And wasn't missing them one damn bit. The house was actually smelling ok ( except for specific rooms )

 [But then they came back . Nooooo!](http://imgur.com/RA1AOcU.gif\))

This morning I had dreams about cigarettes, though don't recall what exactly what they were other than being about cigarettes. This is because all I could smell was cigarettes, and I felt quite nauseous so I took my dog for a walk.  

When I came back I put on my 'deal with it' sunglasses and went upstairs where the smells were originating and felt like a bug being exterminated. It was seriously that frigging gross. It just never occurred to me before how bad it really is because I was used to it. 

So there's my little rant. I really don't know if it has any use to you guys or not but I found it interesting enough to post about it anyway.

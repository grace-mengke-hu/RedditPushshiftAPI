was in a smokers bar on weekend

it was disgusting! i smoked 2 for getting along with that sickening smell(could still smell it). i will not reset my badge, i was and still am a non smoker. i will probably never again go to a smoker bar.

just wanted to share my "experience". what were your last encounter with heavy smoker locations like?

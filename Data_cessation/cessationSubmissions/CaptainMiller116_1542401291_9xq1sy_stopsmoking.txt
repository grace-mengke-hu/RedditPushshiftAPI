Oops, I stumbled

Yesterday was day 15 and I was going great.  Went out for a big drinking night and had a smoke.  I blame that one on the booze.  The two I had this morning I could blame on the hangover, but let's be real, it's on me.

I'm trying not to be too hard on myself, but also realize that I was quite literally playing with fire.  No more.  Back on the quit train.  Not one more puff, no matter what!

Lozenges

Hi All,

Coming up to end of day two.

I've been using lozenges when I get a craving and they're working well. I don't particularly like them first thing in the morning but I've found with breathing excersises and meditation I can get over the first smoke of the day then just focus on my work once I'm in the office.

Question - any downsides with lozenges ? I imagine once the cravings are less I'll be looking to reduce the daily dose down to zero. Does anyone have any experience with this and anything to look out for ?

Thanks for your help

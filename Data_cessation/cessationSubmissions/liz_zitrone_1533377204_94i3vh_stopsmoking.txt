Did you "publicize" your quit?

Hey everyone,

New subscriber to the community, planning to quit very soon. I've set a date that is in the very near future, but when I was about to share it with some friends noticed that I felt kind of reluctant due to previous failed attempts. Then I started wondering whether this isn't a sign that I don't actually fully *believe* I can do it. 

Any thoughts on: a) whether it is a good idea to publicize one's quit attempt or just start doing it, and let people notice on their own; and b) how important it is to "believe" in yourself?  I am sort of concerned that there's a part of me that's not convinced I can do it, but I also don't want to sabotage myself and put off quitting until a moment in time that may never come when I am 100% I can pull it off. I am now thinking that I will prove to myself I can do it by actually doing it - every day, but I've never successfully quit (yet) so was wondering about your thoughts.

Thanks!

Heeey, I just missed my 50 days by one day!

So yeah, I forgot yesterday was 50! The first two weeks of not smoking I checked this sub pretty much every hour. I still definitely check it once a week, at the very least, usually every day, but it's a far cry from the craving every fifteen minutes must check /r/stopsmoking of the first two weeks. Woohoohoo!

It's hard to believe it has been 51 days, that is very exciting to me. I've been looking forward to 50 because in double the time it will be 100!! I'm taking it one day at a time, of course, but the excitement about the milestones is sometimes the kick in the pants my cravings need to shut up.

For everyone just starting, it gets a hell of a lot easier, but it also still requires a maxed-out amount of inner strength. Just keep swimming! (Not smoking).

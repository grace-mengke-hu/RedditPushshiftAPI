Closing in on 48 hours, smoke free. Cold turkey

This is a personal record for myself. I've gone cold turkey several times this month, only to fall off the wagon. I have conciously swept away all thoughts of it and so far, so good.
It's not as if I CAN'T see the thoughts coming. You can't fool yourself. I want to go to a bar to smoke, not to drink. But the drinking comes right along with it.
So, don't delude yourselves! Thinking about it should come with a reflex that says, 'I don't do that anymore.' or 'Shut the fuck up.'. LOL

Been two weeks now, BUT..

Okay, so I haven't had a cigarette in about two weeks. But I also haven't taken my adderall either.  Which I need to.   Since I've started, I noticed that my cravings are only when I drink or take my medicine.  Without the meds, not smoking is a walk in the park.  Why is it like this and how can I stop it?

I messed up.

Had some friends over this weekend, who are social smokers, and fell off the wagon. I had a few puffs and this morning smoked a whole cigarette.  I'm really disappointed in myself, and I felt the need to come clean, because accountability.

I'm not going to reset my badge, though, because this was just one mistake. As of right now, I'm back on the wagon. This bump in the road just made it a little harder for myself. Plus, smoking wasn't as fun as a non-smoker as I thought it would be. It tasted and felt gross and I don't want to do it again, especially not for the rest of my life.

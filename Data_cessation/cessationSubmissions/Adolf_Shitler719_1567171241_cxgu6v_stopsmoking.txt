On Day 4 of no cigarettes

I need some positive vibes and some kind words please. It's constantly on my mind. Day and night. I smoked a pack a day for 13 years. I bought a Juul to smoke when I couldn't control the urge and although I feel guilty and like I'm cheating a little, I'd rather hit that than the cigarette.

Well, I messed up. Need motivation and tips on how to start another, hopefully successful quit.

Started smoking again back in May, forgot how to reset my badge and haven't been on here in since about April or so. I think it's a problem of motivation. I'm kind of a stress smoker, and I got stressed back then and haven't really been able to get myself to quit again since then. Any helpful tips?

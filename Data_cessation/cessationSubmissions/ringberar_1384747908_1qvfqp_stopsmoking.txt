Quit over a year ago...lungs and nose thank me every day...

It's funny...it was so hard to quit. but i never really used this page too much. it was there, and people's stories and motivation helped. I quit cold turkey Halloween night 2012. and I'm still smokeless since then. So just over a year. Just thought I'd let you guy's know there's one less guy out there smoking. Anyway, the best part of quitting is getting the sense of smell back. And now i can actually run and walk up hills without dying and needing a breather. Good luck with you're journey guys. It's really difficult, I know..BUT it's worth it!

My client today was a chainsmoking nightmare vision from Hell

He came out of his house already smoking and had about seven or eight dark yellow teeth in his head which was wrapped in skin that was basically leather with wrinkles you could measure with a ruler. We went around the yard talking about the work; he threw away his cigarette when he finished it then literally immediately lit another one. He told me about how he couldn't mow the grass anymore because he has *peripheral vascular disease* which smoking causes. The entire ends of his fingers were dark yellow. Goes without saying that he absolutely stank

That was scary enough, but the thing that really got me was later on, when I was working around the edges of the house, I kept catching whiffs of ashtray smell... then realized that ***I could smell the inside of his house from outside.*** If you leaned in towards one of the windows, which were all closed (*and* recently replaced, he had told me), you could fucking smell the stench just emanating out of them. Their cat was looking out at me. Poor kitty :(

Needless to say this reinforced my decision. I do NOT want to end up like that. 

#Nicotine is a hard drug that isn't even fun. Avoid it at all costs!

One Thousand Days

I did it. I've been a non-smoker for 1,000 days. Early on I used Allen Carr's book, but after that I didn't have much trouble. I smoked about half a pack a day for five years—Turkish Royals with the occasional pack of Marlboro Reds as a palette cleanser.


Most folks tend to labor over the decision for days, weeks, or even months before making the decision to quit. I followed a different path. One Saturday night 1,001 days ago, I was sitting in my friend's living room, watching Adaptation with Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. As I watched the movie, I began thinking about what it would be like to not be a cigarette smoker. This was spurred by the scenes with Chris Cooper smoking in the car and Meryl Streep's reactions to said smoking. She didn't say anything that I recall, but you could see subtle shades of displeasure in her face as he filled the cabin of his busted old truck with smoke.


When the movie ended, we went outside and had a cigarette. I went home and didn't think about it until I woke up the next morning. I abruptly decided to quit smoking. I took the cigarettes I had and put them in the trunk of my car, and then I didn't smoke all day. I wanted one so badly. I held out until 10:15 p.m. that night, at which point I went outside and had a cigarette. That was 1,000 days ago.


The following day—a Monday—I told my coworker about my decision. She was supportive. I gathered the cigarettes from the trunk of my car, and I broke all but one apart with my fingers. I wrote the date of my quit on that cigarette and tacked it to a bulletin board in my cubicle. 


That cigarette remained in place as seasons gave way and I grew older, all without cigarettes. The urge lessened over time until some point late last year when I stopped wanting them at all. The smell is repulsive now, even after a night of heavy drinking. I don't know how I ever let myself become a smoker, but I'm glad I moved past that ugly business. 


You can do it, too.

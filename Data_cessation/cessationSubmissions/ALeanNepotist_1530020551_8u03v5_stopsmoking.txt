To anyone planning to stop smoking, it isn't as bad as you think it will be.

It isn't fun and it isn't a walk in the park, but it's not the end of the world you might think it will be. I thought I'd not be able to sleep, I would start eating tonnes of food and gain weight, argue with everyone and feel in pain - none of that happened. It is different for everyone, but it really is worth it past that first day just to see how you feel. 

Don't listen to your friends horror stories about how they gained 10lb or didn't sleep for a week etc. People do have bad side effects but it isn't a torrent of horrible symptoms and pain. 

You can do it!

Just smoked my last cig. I want to quit, what should I expect?

I was halfway through a cig, still about 19 in the pack, and I heard myself wheeze. It was a real wake up call. I only smoke about a pack a week, but even that is more than I want to. I've tried before but I never get very far. I'm reaching out this time, looking for support. 

I'm 21 and I've smoked for the past ~1.5 years. I want to get off the wagon early before I do any irreparable damage.

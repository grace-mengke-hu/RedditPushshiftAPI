Public declaration of intent to quit!

Although I've quit smoking before, this is the first time i am reaching out for help- I keep finding excuses to smoke again!

I'm just getting over the flu and it was agony to smoke .. so I just haven't in 36 hours, and have realised i don't miss it. I also seem to smoke rather than eat, which is not good!

 Smoking REALLY worsens my anxiety, which is difficult at the best of times. I quit for a few months, find myself having a sneaky few drunk and end up a full time smoker again... and about a month or so into smoking, panic creeps back into my life :(

I'm sick of this cycle and asking you lovely people for support. Wish me luck!

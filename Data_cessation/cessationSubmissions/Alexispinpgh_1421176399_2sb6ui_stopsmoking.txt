Advice for Married Couple Quitting Together?

My husband and I are both trying to quit right now. I made it my New Years resolution and he decided to do it with me. He's 33, been smoking about ten years, I'm 24, been smoking for 6. I've been having an easer time than him--I have gone most days over the past three weeks without smoking (though I really fucked up yesterday, but I'm back to cold turkey starting today). He's trying cutting down and he's not doing as well with it. Does anyone have any advice for how we can support each other through this? We really can't afford to keep smoking a pack a day each and I worry about our health. So any tips for us to be successful without killing each other?

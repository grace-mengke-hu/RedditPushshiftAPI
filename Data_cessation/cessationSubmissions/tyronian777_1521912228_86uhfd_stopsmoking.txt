Day 6 no smoking and no drinking!! Cold turkey! Its so hard but so worth it!

I have been smoking on and off for over 20 years. I have wanted to quit for so long now but the older I get the harder it seems to quit. Well, I found out I was preggo 1 week ago so I had no choice but to quit as I did with my first 2 kiddos. Today is day 6 cold turkey no drinking or smoking... the urges and cravings have been horrendous this week but bearable!! Good luck everyone :)

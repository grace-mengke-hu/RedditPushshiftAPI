cigarettes and I

Im 18 going onto 19 june 19th and ive been smoking for i think about 4 years now i was in boarding school and had to stop but found my way around it and when things got hot or they just wouldnt take it anymore i switched to dipping and ive been between dipping and smoking for the past 2-3 years ive stopped because of school multiple time without thw whole headache thing and as soon as i get out i go right back into smoking i never really had bad feelings toward smoking also ive been using drugs for about the same amount of time and last year thankfully i was tripping and things went south i found god as they say and ever since ive been trying to quit everything i stopped doing hard drugs and it took me a while to stop pot but ive been on and off about pot but hard drugs thankfully have been easier tk get away from this past year i was 3 months clean off everything except for dip and cigs then i went back to smoking pot and now at the end of the year i finally stopped not sure bow long this one is gonna last but hopefully forever ive been meaning to atop smoking cigs to now but its been weird i dont k ow if difficult is the right word beacause i wake up and say im done about three hours into my day i start wanting that first cig of the day buzz and slowly push my self to buying a pack i smoke the first one and i barley enjoy the buzz then i feel like shit i feel like have no word i have commitment im weak then throw the pack out then sometimes by the end of the day i buy another one this has been going on for about a month now i buy atleast 2 pacs a day and barley smoke 5 out of each but its come to a poimt now wherw i dont throw away the pack i keep it because i say fuck it i fucked up today might aswell smoke and i dont smoke like a normal person i go out and drive around smoking cig after cig just chain smoking untill i get a fat headache and get depressed and angry at my self then make a commitment that this wont happen again when i think about it i feel like the first cig of the days buzz is the closes thing to getting high without actually getting high if that makes sense im not sure about what i want from posting this but im just tiered of this bullshit and I apologize for the very long post and how unorganized my thoughts are. any and all kinds of feedback are welcomed thanks for listening hahah

30 days smoke free...does it get easier?

I made it to 30 days smoke free as of yesterday. A little about my story: 

I've been smoking for 16 years, the last 10 years have been a pack a day. In Canada, smokes are not cheap so I was spending almost $400 a month on cigs, sometimes more depending on my activities. I'm an outdoor enthusiast, I hike, climb and backpack almost every weekend. I have quit one other time in my life and that lasted about 6 months when I got super sick about 8 years ago, summer came and I collapsed and started smoking again. 

I really enjoyed smoking, I didn't actually want to quit however I had to have a tooth extracted and the fear of getting a dry socket forced me to quit for a few days, I lasted 3 days and decided what the hell, lets see how far we can go and I've made it 30 days. I quit completely cold turkey and haven't used any nicotine replacement products in the 30 days. 

The cravings I've had for the last 7-10 days have been more intense then the first 2 weeks and I can't figure out why. I don't believe its the nicotine I miss, it's the act of smoking, of having something in your lungs. I have a ton of e-juice and ecig things for years but never really used them. I've thought about going and buying 0mg ejuice just so I can smoke something and relive that feeling but I feel like I would be disappointing myself and almost...cheating or not fufilling the quitting path I'm on? It's hard to describe. 

I'm not sure what I'm look for from posting this, I guess just a place to document what I'm feeling and can maybe look back on in a few months and see I've gotten stronger. Who knows. Thanks for reading.

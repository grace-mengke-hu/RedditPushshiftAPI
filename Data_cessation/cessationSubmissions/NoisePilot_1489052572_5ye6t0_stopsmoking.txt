So, I forgot about making my 100 Day post.

I can't believe I did it and I felt so good and so sure about it that I totally forgot to post about it. It's been 111 days. Haven't relapsed or anything. I don't miss it. What I do have is this funny feeling whenever I smell them from other people smoking, not sure if it's a craving or that I'm not used to them anymore, but I'm done with this, finally. Thank you all for the help, for recommending reading Easyway and for having this sub for people like me.

For all you guys that are on the road of quitting, start now! It's totally doable and really, really worth it. Stay strong.

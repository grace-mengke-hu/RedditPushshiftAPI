One year and one month...

I decided to quit smoking on my 29th bday last year. I did it cold turkey and have not touched a cigarette since then. I feel amazing. AMAZING. I totally feel my lung capacity expand each day, I don't cough that much anymore and have more money... However, I did gain 12 pounds boo-hoo. 

Anyway, going through some rough times now and I was scared that the first thing I was going to do when hanging out with my friends (all smokers) was to give in and light one. But nope. I feel disgusted at the thought of the taste of smoke in my mouth. Hope I continue like this until things get better again. 

Anyway, sorta needed to get this out of my chest.

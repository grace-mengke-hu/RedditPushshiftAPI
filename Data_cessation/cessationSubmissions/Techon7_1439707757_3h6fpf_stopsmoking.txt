Motivation to continue?

I quit smoking and was 11 days in and decided to have a cigarette. I plan to get back up tomorrow and work at it again but was wondering what you guys use to keep you motivated? I've tried all the usual tricks but every time my mind seems to make an excuse to have another. I really feel like I lack the willpower to continue when this happens so any advice would be appreciated.

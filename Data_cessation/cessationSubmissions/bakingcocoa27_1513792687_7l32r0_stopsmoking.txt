24 days: smell, and de-smelling your car

At first I was bummed I didn’t have any major rebirth in the senses of smell and taste—

Until the past couple of days, every time I get in my car it smells more and MORE like an ash tray.  It’s so frustrating because you think that smell should go away, not intensify. 

Anyway, it smells like death took a shit in my car.  Anyone have luck getting rid of that?

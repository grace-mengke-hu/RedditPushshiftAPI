Ten days in..

After smoking for 10 years I decided it was time to quit because of money. I simply couldn't afford to smoke anymore. 10 days in it's the extra space in my lungs, the glow on my skin, the fact that I feel like superwoman with all this extra energy at the gym, waking up and being able to breath normally instantly, the feeling of pride and achievement, the smell of shampoo on my hair, perfume on my body and fabric softener on my clothes, the encouragement from friends and colleagues, the improved mood and the feeling that I'm capable of absolutely anything that keeps me going.

No way a cigarette could beat all that.

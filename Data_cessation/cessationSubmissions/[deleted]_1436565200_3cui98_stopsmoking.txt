One smoke, three days

I'm very sorry if this is inappropriate. I do smoke atm. but I'm very convinced about quitting, have tried it many times and very soon I'll have the LAST SMOKE. But for now, I would like to know (for the science): The times I've relapsed for one smoke, I've thougt "Oh boy, here we go again, 3 days to get the nicotine of my system.." But is it really so? If one has cleansed his system from nicotine, does one nicotine dose in a smoke affect 3 days (in a medical/physiological point of view)?

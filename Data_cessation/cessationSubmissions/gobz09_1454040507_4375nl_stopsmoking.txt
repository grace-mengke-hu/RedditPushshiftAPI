That feeling when you walk by someone smoking and...

for the first time, it smells like shit! I must say, this was such a happy moment today. I even looked at people as I walked around campus and the two people I saw smoking looked miserable and just so anxious. Maybe it was me projecting, but what I do know is finally, the smell was gross to me and I thought "wow, I can't believe I justified smelling like that for 3 years!" 

If you're still early on in your quitting journey, just wait till this moment happens. It's so amazing!

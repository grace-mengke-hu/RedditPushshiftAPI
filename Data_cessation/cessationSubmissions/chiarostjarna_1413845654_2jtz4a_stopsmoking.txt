Day one, again.

I've been lurking around these parts for some time now and have found it very, very helpful. Thanks everyone for that.

I smoked for ten years and mostly after work and when I drank. I've tried a number of times, mostly half-heartedly because something in the back of my head told me, "You can have one every once in a while". Well that isn't true, I need to just stop. I read and listened to Allen Carr's Stop Smoking book numerous times, but it still hasn't really clicked fully. But, I am hoping that writing about it will solidify my intentions to quit for good.

I stopped smoking nine days ago but broke that streak last night. It was just one. I'm still kicking myself about it because I was doing so well but, but I drank too much and caved. It was gross, but I smoked it anyway. I definitely don't want to smoke today though.

I realized that my drinking was getting in the way of my quitting smoking. I also realized that my drinking was getting in the way of lots of other things, but that is a different story on a different forum. 

So, today I begin again.

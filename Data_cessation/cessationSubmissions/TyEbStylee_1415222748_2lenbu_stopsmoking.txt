Here we go for the 100th time

I've Smoked for 12 years.  I'm 26.   I'm here.  Again.  Maybe it's the 18th or so time i've tried to quit.  I'm always fine.  Until I drink.  Then I go back down the rabbit hole.

Not gonna drink 'till Christmas.  Give myself a fighting shot.  Raged the gym this morning.  Gonna keep that going.  Lots of gym.  Lots of calories.  Lots of bulking.

It's day 4.  Days 1 and 2 were spent sleeping mostly.   Days 3 and 4 have been extremely unproductive at work.  It's bad.  I'm paid on commission.  I need to do things.  But rather my last 2 days have been very little work as I've been unable to concentrate.  And very, very, sleepy as well.

I tried to have some coffee today but after the second cup I knew any more was a BAD idea.  The cravings were real.

I guess all I'm saying... is that I have 3 and a half more hours and all I really want is to curl up in my bed and close my eyes.   Also, thanks in advance for letting me scream at you on your posts and act like a jackass.  Try not to take it too personally.

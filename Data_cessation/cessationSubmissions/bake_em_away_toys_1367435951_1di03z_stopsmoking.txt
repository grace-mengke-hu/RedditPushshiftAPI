I just need a few words of support and advice.

Sorry for the plea but I quit two weeks ago and everything has been great so far until this afternoon.

I apprentice at a shop helping fix computers.  I had a call from a customer today whose laptop I fixed yesterday yelling at me about how I forgot to transfer some data over to her newly reformatted laptop.  She fucking tore into me and I genuinely felt bad because I had double checked several times that the transfer was complete.  She then calls me back 5 mins later saying that she found it (in the place that I tried explaining to her) but still tore into me about how the experience was "crazy" and how she still wanted her money back because I didn't update Internet Explorer for her.  

I feel guilty, incompetent, emotional and angry.  I already lost out on two promotions at my other job in the last few weeks and I really want to say "fuck it" and smoke until my lungs jump out of my mouth, pleading for oxygen.

Is there anything you guys recommend?  Words of wisdom and sweet nothings will be accepted with the utmost appreciation.

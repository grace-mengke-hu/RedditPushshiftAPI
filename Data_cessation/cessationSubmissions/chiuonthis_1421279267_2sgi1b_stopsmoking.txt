>2 months nico-demon free-- problems

a friend recommended i use this subreddit to help me get through this

2 months and 13 days ago while fighting a bout of tonsillitis, i decided to throw away a ~13 year, ~half a pack a day habit for good. holding onto my vaporizer for dear life in the first 3 days of my quit (didn't touch it after the third day), i found the first week or so amazingly enjoyable without cigarettes. the increase in energy, the ability to taste food. i was simply flabbergasted why i didn't quit sooner if it was going to be this easy..

i spoke too soon. i started coughing up a lung, brown phlegm in the morning. i became super congested with a general feeling of malaise. i thought i was coming down with another illness so i put it off. it was during my EurAsia trip a couple of weeks later when it hit me: the cough, after subsiding a bit, came back with a vengeance. slight blood, slight fever. needless to say, i was frightened and had resigned to think that at the age of 27, i had cancer. i cut my trip short, flew back, and admitted myself to the ER. an xray, ct scan, and a blood test later, i walked out of the ER with a bruised ego. everything came out clean, free of any of maladies that i had thought i had. 

fast forward to today; i'm constantly clearing my throat of phantom phlegm and i cant seem to shake the feeling of impending doom. i dont have any of the standard cravings (ie: with drinks, with coffee, on the toilet first thing in the morning). however, during my anxiety attacks (i can't seem to accept the fact that nothing is wrong with me healthwise), i often wonder whether a cigarette would alleviate my worries as it once did. ridiculous, i know. 

i just hope im not alone with these anxiety problems after quitting or the physical symptoms either.

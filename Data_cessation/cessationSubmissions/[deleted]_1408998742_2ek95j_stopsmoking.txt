Extremely real feeling smoke dreams

The past two nights I have had some super lucid dreams about smoking. I hit day 7 cold turkey at half 10 this morning. Does anyone have any ideas how to stop these. I'm very prone to intense dreams, sleep walking and talking anyways, but these dreams I feel like I can feel the smoke going down my throat and feel real disappointed on waking. Proper freaky.

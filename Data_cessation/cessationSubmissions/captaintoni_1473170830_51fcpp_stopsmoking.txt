Genuinely nervous this time around (first day quit).

Just ignore my flair. It's from my last failed attempt at quitting.

I've been smoking since I was a kid and now I'm 28 years old and feeling every bit of it. All of my smoker friends have quit - even my boyfriend is vaping now. I'm the last one and I hate saying this..but I love smoking.

I'm going to miss it. It's my way to pass time in the car, my means of being outside and enjoying the sun. It's depressing to think that I feel the need to smoke just standing around. But that's how it has been for over ten years of smoking a pack a day.

My father has been having serious heart problems, which led to me seeking other family history. Evidently everyone on my father's side has heart problems, which has put the fear in me. I'm overweight to boot, so I'm like a walking death sentence at this point.

Sorry to be so emo, I'm just a bit frustrated as I chew a piece of nicotine gum. I'm going to try my best this time, because now I'm afraid for my health. I'm not a kid anymore and I have to accept that it's a real danger now. 

Thanks for listening to me ramble.

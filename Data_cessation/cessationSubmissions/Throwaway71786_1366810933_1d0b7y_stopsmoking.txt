Should I start over? (question for patch users)

So, I've been smoke free for about 45 days now, thanks to the patch.  I'm technically on step 2, but last night after a couple of drinks and a little weed, I ended up having a couple of cigarettes.

I'm back on the patch this morning.  I'm not too happy about smoking last night, but I don't think I'll be itching to have one today, especially if I avoid drinking or smoking weed.

My question is, should I start over back to step 1 or just keep going on with my program?  Technically I'm almost done with step 2 and am supposed to move on to step 3 after this box is finished.

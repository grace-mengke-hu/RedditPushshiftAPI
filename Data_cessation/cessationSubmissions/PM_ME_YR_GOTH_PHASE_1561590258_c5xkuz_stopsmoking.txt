I quit painlessly with NRT

I have been a smoker on and off for about 11 years, and last week I had my last cigarette. I used nicotine replacement therapy (patches and lozenges) and talked to a counselor once a week about quitting. After a couple weeks I simply lost the urge to smoke!

Initially I had cravings and the lozenges helped. Then I realized cravings only last a short time if I can just tough it out for a few minutes. It became easier once I noticed how much healthier I feel when I don’t smoke.

No more daily coughing, allergies, anxiety from cravings, or feeling “inexplicably” crappy. If I knew it would be this easy I would have chosen this method a long time ago. I hope some of you will try it, too.

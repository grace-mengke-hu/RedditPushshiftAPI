Day 11, Stop Smoking entry

I feel irritated, restless, pissed off. 
I don't feel myself. 
I'm day 11 into quitting.
When I feel those things I try to remind myself it's because I'm withdrawing but then I think maybe it's not, maybe it's something more.
I don't know what to feel. 
I woke up, started playing music and turn it off after a while. 
I thought let me go for a run. So I went outside and didn't even run I just walked and walked and walked and walked. The park I was walking in has calisthenics equipment. I found and old skipping rope just lying there. I started skipping. 
All of a sudden I just started crying. Just crying for no reason. I layed down on the grass and stayed there for 10 minutes. I got up and walked back home and took a pull of my nicotine replacement inhaler. I'm about to have a bath. I still feel restless but I feel better.

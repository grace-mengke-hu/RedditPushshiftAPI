Day 8

It's been eight days since my last cigarette, in what is probably my tenth attempt to quit smoking. I've been smoking for about 3 years.

So far, I haven't had to deal with any cravings. I hope it stays that way. Hell, so long as I stay clear of my triggers, I should be fine.

I've come to realize my dependence was of a purely psychological nature. Oftentimes I smoked not because I felt like it, but because people around me were doing it. It was a way to bond and feel connected. What a terrible way to bond, sacrificing my own health for it.

Sometimes I'd smoke out of boredom, to kill time. Other times to look busy in a situation that made me feel nervous. Hiding behind a cigarette became a mask that I would wear any opportunity I got.

This is over. Recently, I've been working on my confidence and trying to improve myself all across the board. I can no longer afford to wear that mask. It won't decrease my insecurities. It will temporarily hide them, sure. It will also confirm them, the more I feel like I can only be confident while inhaling a slowly approaching early grave.

I haven't been this determined to quit in my previous attempts. To an outsider, this might sound delusional, but I'm certain that "this time will be different."

Why shouldn't it be different? Why discredit the possibility of success?  
(Thanks for your time, strawmen!)


Anyway, I'm rambling at this point. Here's to never smoking again.

I've been a smoker for 16 years and I quit 9 days ago!

Man its alot harder than I thought. Even using the patch helps but I crave all the time. I think I'm doing good though haven't cheated at all. Everyone says their proud of me and I'm proud of me too.  I'm actually doing this and I never thought I could!  The app I'm using told me to come to this place and utilize it.  So I'm a newbie here and just wanted to say hey!

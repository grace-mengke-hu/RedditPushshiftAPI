5 Days done and feeling better than I thought I would

Like many people, I gave up on 1st October, not because I wanted Rhod gilbert appearing on my computer monitor to tell me a funny story every day but was tired of trying to catch my breath after walking up a flight of stairs. Anyhow, I'm on day 5, and not smoked close to 120 fags in that time. Although I'm doing 20 cough candy twist a day easy!!!

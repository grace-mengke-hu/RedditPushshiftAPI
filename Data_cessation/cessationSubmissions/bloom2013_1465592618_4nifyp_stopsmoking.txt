I smoked

I relapsed on the day I turned four weeks smoke free. It's insane how shitty it makes you feel. The sense of defeat is mind blowing. I'm on my third pack now, grossing myself out, not enjoying it in the slightest.

I couldn't even bring myself to post here. I'll reset my badge and get back on the horse tomorrow morning. How difficult it is to muster the strength to get back on it... It's exhausting to even think about it.

Please please if you're doing well, congratulations and take something from me: the small frustration you'll experience when you next have to reject smoking is NOTHING compared to the overwhelming sense of frustration and failure you'll feel immediately after giving in to that one puff. Just don't.

How could I forget

I'm almost up two weeks and I was in such a rush this morning I forgot to put on my patch. I've been wearing it ever since I quit. The urges aren't hittingbhard though surprisingly. I have some gum which is helping and I'm in school right now so it's not like I can go home and pick up my patch either. Ok now Im just trying to get my mind off it before my next class starts. How is everyone's progress so far? How's the weather like? Are there any other patch users? How's it been so far?

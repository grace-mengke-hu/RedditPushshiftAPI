Day 6

I just have to vent. It’s my birthday so go me! I still m not breathing correctly and it’s honestly freaking me out. I can’t tell if it’s from the original stuff before quitting or if it’s the quitting now and the prednisone is cause of so many side effects. But I’m doing this. I’ve come 6 days so why the hell give in now? Cravings haven’t even been bad just some minor panic and feeling hot for a second then I pop a cough drop and I’m fine.

Also- all food tastes like utter garbage. And I’m sad. I guess it’ll help with the weight gain!

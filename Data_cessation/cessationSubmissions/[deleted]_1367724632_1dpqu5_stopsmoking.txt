Are there any oral issues associated w/ Beef Jerky Chew? (Quit for 3rd and final time tonight)

Per the title, I WILL be successful and stop for over 3 months (longest period off chewing). I am going cold turkey this time (e-cigs and nicotine gum both led to relapses)

I am wondering if Beef Jerky Chew will have any adverse effects on my gums that I am trying to heal? I am praying everyday that these 3 years of snus/chew do not give me cancer and want nothing to do with something that will irritate my gums more

First holiday as a happy non-smoker

I always played this game with myself where I allowed myself to smoke...but only when overseas on holiday. Here I am in Bangkok, city of sin and not an urge in sight. Bangkok folks - If I can make it there I can make it anywhere! Looks like this is the real deal. Fist bump, Mr Carr.

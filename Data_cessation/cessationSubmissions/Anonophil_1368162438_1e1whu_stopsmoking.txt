10.5 months - reprogramming complete?

20 years of smoking a few a day created some crazy programming in my limbic brain.  10.5 months of reliving every single cigarette association and erasing each one, one at a time, and I think I'm finally smoke free.  It's been at least a month since I've had a serious craving.   I expect the occasional craving might still might sneak up on me from time to time when I'm least expecting it, but even so I think I can fairly confidently self identify now as a non-smoker.   

Thanks Allen Carr for teaching me about addiction, and then sending me down the path of truly becoming a non-smoker.  I'm not sure I agreed with everything you had to say but most of it was pretty good, and it put me in the right mind frame for success.   

I'll still be checking in to this subreddit, especially if I have one of those sneaky cravings creep up on me after today's bold statement.  All I can confidently say for now is that quitting smoking (like, really quitting - not just "stopping" or using your willpower to deny yourself your special treat) is a bitch but it can be done.  Good luck everyone in your journeys.   

Edit: Thanks for supporting me!  That smoking addiction is a bitch.

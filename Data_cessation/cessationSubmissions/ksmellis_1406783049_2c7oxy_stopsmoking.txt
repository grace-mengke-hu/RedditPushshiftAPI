Call me grouchy pants

Got into my first reddit fight today, and have been generally snippy, snappy, and just plain grumpy. I'm sorry if any of you guys were offended by the argument (was about snus, not worth going into it). I really appreciate how kind everyone is here, and I don't want to dampen those good vibes.

Will the sporadic raging-bitch episodes stop within a week or two? Or am I looking at a year with a short fuse? Also, advice on being less grouchy?

*I'm generally a calm person. Perhaps sometimes a bitch, but not of the raging variety

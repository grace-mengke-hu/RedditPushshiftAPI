Almost 12 hours in. Not as bad as expected. How long do the difficult urges last, in general?

So I expected it to be much worse, because once I tried to quit and didn't even manage half an hour, but this time I took it a bit more seriously and I've almost finished my first day.

I've felt a couple of proper urges though, tough ones, but I've studied them mindfully and non-judgementally and they tend not to last more than 10 minutes.

How long, in your experience, do those urges last until they start to twindle? I heard the chemical urges last for 2 days and then it's all psychological. I figure, I'm getting over a breakup anyway, might as well combine it with breaking up with cigarettes too.

I've thrown out my tobacco and I don't have any money left so I don't suppose there'll be too much risk in relapse, but I would like some realistic expectations of what the urges will be like, just to take the sting away.

Cheers!

I'm done being an addict

Well I'm embarrassed to say it's taken me so long, and now I'm facing the health problems we all feared would one day catch up to us. My body is falling apart and I feel like a 60 year old with all these doctor appointments and tests...the only thing all these doctors can tell me to do to help myself is, you got it, QUIT smoking.   


So here I go, for my health, because I don't want to destroy my body anymore. I don't want to pay exorbitant fees to kill myself with poison. I don't want to continue to sacrifice my time enslaved to a nicotine addiction, standing out in the cold rain late at night when I should be tucked in bed. I no longer intend to have to lie to avoid social situations at the risk of my friends learning I am a smoker. I do not want to be this person I've become as a result of smoking. 

I'm done.  This is it.  I refuse to let smoking control my life.

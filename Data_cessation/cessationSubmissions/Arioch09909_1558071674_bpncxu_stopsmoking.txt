Day 0.1 to day 1

Hello there! I've been smoking for a little more than 10 years now, tried to stop 1 time only, without help, and it didn't work at all.
Recently i've been making choices to be healthier and it's time to adress the elephant in the room.

I smoke around 20 cigarettes a day and have to stop the compulsive behavior before i stop completely, my goal is to spend the second half of May smoking less than 5 cigarettes a day, and to stop on june 1st. So i bought tabs of nicotin gums, and yesterday it allowed me to go to sleep without smoking after dinner (small wins...), now it's 8am and i smoked my coffee one, but that means only 4 to go. 

I made this post as a proof of my motivation, because my relatives don't believe me when i make this kind of promises anymore, so basically i'm just looking for approval from strangers... But hey anything helps!

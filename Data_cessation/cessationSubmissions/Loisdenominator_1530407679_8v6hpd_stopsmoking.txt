I missed my ***5*** year anniversary !

A week ago today marked my 5 year anniversary of having my very last cigarette. It was a Saturday, just like today. I had my last one Saturday morning, half-knowing it would be my last one ever. 

I wasn't sure I could do it, but I knew I had to give it my best shot, because I was sick and tired of smoking. I hated it but my body needed it. I hated myself for needing it and being a slave to the nicotine.

Same old story, I won't bore you with additional details. I remember reading a post that really resonated with me here and as I read and read, the more convinced I got that this was it.

I knew that after 20+ years, it was either me quitting or me ruining my quality of life. So I quit. Needless to say, it was the best decision I ever made.

All this to say, that I wish you all the best on your journeys. It is not easy, but it's easier once you stop lying to yourself about being addicted (physically and emotionally). If you decide you no longer want to be addicted, this is one of the quickest withdrawals ever. I'm not saying the easiest, but it's totally doable and farrrrrr easier than I ever imagined it would be.

That's all folks. I am happy. 5 years. WOW!

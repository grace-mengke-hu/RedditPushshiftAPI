Quit Today/last night - EASYWAY

Just wanted to drop in an say that ive been lurking around here for quite a while.  Had a good vacation recently and planned to quit afterwards.  Well, yesterday was the day - last nihgt rather.

Once I finished Allen Carr's EASYWAY, I put out that final filthy cancerous burden, steamed up my bathroom and took a nice bath with some pepermint and eucalyptus oil and breathed deeply.  I imagined each breath cleansing me of the poisons I had ingested.  Helping my body jump start the healing process.  It was a WONDERFUL feeling.  Prior to that I had washed my sheets and just about all of my clothes... so from that moment on, my bed would remain free of the heinous tar and smoke odor.

Anyway, thanks for being here... Happy to be a Non-Smoker!

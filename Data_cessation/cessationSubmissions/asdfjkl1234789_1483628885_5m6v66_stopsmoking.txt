Today will be my last day with nicotine.

Since I was a child I've had an oral fixation, I had this constant need to put my hand to my mouth and feel something. It started with food, gum, pencils, anything to satisfy the urge. Then I started smoking at 14, 9 years ago. My plan was to quit cold-turkey on January 1st. I had been vaping consistently and smoking every once in a while. I thought it wouldn't be too bad, I just had to destroy my fixation, but that mental hold turned out to be a major drawback. On the 3rd I gave in and bought a pack, thinking to myself that I could just have one when I feel particularly bad and try to drown it out the majority of the time. Two days later and I now have 3 cigarettes left. Honestly, I don't know what to do with myself when it feels like the only thing I can focus on is how badly I want to smoke. I'm going to be getting 0 nic juice and work on nipping my nicotine addiction in the bud first, then once that is mostly taken care of I'll work on vaping. My lungs feel heavy and I can't wait for the day that the negative impact smoking has had on my health and life is turned around.

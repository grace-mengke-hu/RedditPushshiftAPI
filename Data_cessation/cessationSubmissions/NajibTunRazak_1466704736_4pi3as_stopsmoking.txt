Off and on smoker. Out of breath feeling, uneasy lungs

I've been smoking since I was 13 till I was 15 ( took a long break), started again at 17 until 18 (break again for a few months) and just recently stopped at the age of 19. I smoked around 5 cigarettes a day. I've stopped for over 2 weeks.

I stopped because I felt heavy to breath after smoking. As if no air is sufficient for me to breath. I've never felt this way until recently. I got worried. Anyone knows what's up? Just need some input based on experience instead of the common Google advice

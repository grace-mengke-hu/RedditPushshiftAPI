Having a Cold as a NonSmoker

I have a cold and my voice is horribly raspy and my throat hurts and I've been coughing up all sorts of crud.  I feel like doodoo.  

Last night in my dreams I was chain smoking like CRAZY!!  My brain must associate feeling like this with smoking and, to be honest, I kind of do feel like I have a nasty smoking hangover.  I remember I used to think I was "getting sick" all the time but really I was just dealing with the consequences of heavy smoking.  I'd feel like this for a day or two and consider quitting but instead I would just cut down and then I would feel better so I would go back to smoking ALL THE CIGARETTES again and then I would feel like this again so I would cut down and then feel better and so on and so forth.

Now I KNOW I'm sick and I'm not just feeling crappy because I smoked too much.  A weird reason but one more reason to rejoice about being free!!!!

(oh and another benefit...when this cold goes away, it will go away.  I won't cough for the entire rest of the winter because of it.  I've been sick a lot this year but when it's over it's actually over.  So YIPPEE again!)

Need help quiting but nothing really works, what else is thwre to try?

I'm a 26m military veteran and I've been smoking since I was around 14 (grew up on a tobacco farm). I usually go through a pack every two days but it used to be a pack a day when I was active bout 4 years ago. I've tried the gum and it didn't stay in my mouth long, the patches always fell off or weren't strong enough, and now I'm trying vaping to try and quit but even with a 8-nic I'm still craving a cigarette at work and at home. I guess I crave cigarettes when I get stressed out which happens alot and I just want to quit both for health and also it's a really expensive habit. Any recommendations would help

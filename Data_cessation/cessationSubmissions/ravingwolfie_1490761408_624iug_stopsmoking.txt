Lonely

I don't know if this is the right place to post...I just want to talk to someone. I picked up smoking around spring break (3 weeks ago now) and had about half a pack in a row last Thursday. Felt incredibly ill and didn't crave anything over the weekend. Yesterday I gave in and bought another pack. 

I'm so socially isolated I feel deprived. I want to feel something besides the crushing weight of loneliness. Reached out to several people about getting weed but besides how expensive it is (broke college student here) no one has got back to me. My two best friends recently moved into a house together and I never see them anymore. Anytime I suggest dinner they're busy. I'm very particular about skincare so I try to stay out of the sun as much as possible. The fact that cigs will fuck up my skin scares me. Just before break I started getting into running and felt really good. Even went and bought expensive running shoes on my limited budget. Haven't set foot in the gym since I started smoking. 

I feel myself getting closer to addiction every day. I'm aware of how obvious and incredibly stupid this is but I just want some notifications. Needed to get this off my chest.

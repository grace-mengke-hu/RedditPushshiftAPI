Help! I'm a raging nicotine withdrawal b*tch!

I  thought I was past the worst of it...days 2-5 were terrible in terms of my mood swings and irritability. 6-9 were pretty good and I was starting to feel sane again until last night (start of day 11). 



I don't know what happens, it's like it's not even me anymore. I just nag and nag and nit pick and accuse and follow around my boyfriend just harping on and on and just making up things to be mad about.



I don't know why i'm doing it!! A few hours later I feel terrible about myself and guilty but when I apologize it's too late and my boyfriend is already mad at me. 



How long will this keep on? I read our brains are re-wiring themselves, can I expect relief soon? I don't like the person that takes over randomly, any tips on how to stop the behavior?

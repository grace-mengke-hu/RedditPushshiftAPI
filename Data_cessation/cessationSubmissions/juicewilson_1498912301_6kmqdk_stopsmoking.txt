GET THE FUCK IN!!!! People have been conceived and born since I last had a cigarette! I am delighted with myself and I want to thank everyone on this sub for everything. I can't stand the smell of tobacco, I can't stand in a smoking area or be near people smoking because it literally chokes me and I feel sick! Here is looking towards a year clean and then for the rest of my life! Keep up the good work everyone!

A little help for the weekend

I'm going to Prague on a University trip this weekend and the itinerary includes a bar crawl. I have not had an alcoholic drink since quitting (only 5 days ago) and having a beer is normally a time I smoke a lot. Does anyone have any advice on fighting cravings after a few beers?

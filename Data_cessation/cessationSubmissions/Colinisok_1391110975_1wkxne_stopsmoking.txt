[not looking for upvotes] Just wanted to say it's awesome this exists and I have one question.

I know reddit has everything (and I mean everything) in subreddit form but I didn't realize this existed. 

I think it's awesome that this exists, everyone in my life (roomates, family, most friends) smoke. Only one friend of mine is a non smoker and hes my gym buddy and soon to be roommate. So to have this support when I decide to quit is really encouraging.

I am a current smoker and want to quit when my tax refund shows up. I currently have 2 packs left and don't want to throw them out, plus I am broke currently and would like to treat my self to non smoking things I love (tea, homemade burger, garlic naan.) when I do quit so having some fun money would be nice.

My Current job requires me to be patient and friendly which I can do almost all the time. I haven't tried to quit ever and have been smoking for 2 years now.

Will my nic fits be too much during my job (working with people and computers; old people and homeless.)? How badly does quitting effect your professional mood?

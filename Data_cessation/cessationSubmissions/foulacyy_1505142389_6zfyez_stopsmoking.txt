Almost 500 days without a smoke.

I wanted to quit pretty badly over different periods but never could make it past three or four days. I read the Easy Way to stop smoking book on a whim, in one sitting, over an 6 hour period, until 2am, and through out the book I recited to myself how much a crock of shit this book was, yet I was a non-smoker as soon as I opened that book. I have no idea what kind of pseudo-cognitive restructuring happened but I am glad it did. I am 27 years old and have my whole life ahead of me still and I'll never smoke another one of these disgusting ass things again.

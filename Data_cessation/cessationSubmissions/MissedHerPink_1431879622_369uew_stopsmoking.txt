Anyone know of any nicotine-free blunt wraps?

I'm not gonna touch phillys or swishers and most blunts actually cause I know they're tobacco leaves and contain nicotine, but it'd be wicked if there were some nicotine-free wraps. 

I figure if there's any place that would know it'd be here. 

Can anyone help me out? If not, that's cool, I can do without blunts. But I'd love you for a hot minute if you could hook me up with some brand that makes these.

Dealing with horrible symptoms, please tell me it's going to pass

Tomorrow morning will be exactly 3 weeks without cigarettes. I am a single mom who has been battling some horrible anxiety as of late and panic attacks. I also have had* acid reflux for years. Ever since I quit.. frankly have felt like complete shit- physically, emotionally and mentally. I'm having panic attacks in my house and leaving the house, I don't feel safe anywhere because I can't get my anxiety under control. If I am lucky I'll get a few hours of sleep.. Feels like I've been fighting off a horrible sinus infection, and dealing with some really bad indigestion even before while I was smoking. The chest pain and especially nausea is killing me. I'm just a hot mess right now.

Please tell me it's going to get better.

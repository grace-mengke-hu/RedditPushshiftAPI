I relapsed...

So, I smoked for several years and as my lovely tag shows i quite almost two weeks ago... But today I relapsed. I was tired from working on my thesis and work and not been able to have dinner and then I got some bad news and I bummed one from my roommate. Basically I relapsed. I decided that that was the only one and I am quite disappointed in myself. But I was wondering if you guys had any tips for when you're just done with everything and just want to smoke and relax.

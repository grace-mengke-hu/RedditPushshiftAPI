Need help finding a certain stop smoking aid... please if you can offer substitutes let me know where

I quit smoking this year, but actually this isn't about me. I'm managing just fine.

My grandmother has cancer, and she's probably going to die so soon she shouldn't bother quitting smoking. Which I guess might be why I stopped. Anyway, she's quite fond of "Lite'n Up 90 Reusable Cigarette Filter," but after an hour of searching it seems like the world has run out of them. She's used them for years, but never with the intention of actually quitting I don't think. But she loves them, and if you know where I could buy a pack for her, I'd be super grateful to be pointed in the right direction.

If not, does anyone have enough experience with these types of cessation aids to know of a comparable product I could get to help make her comfortable?

People who "only smoke occasionally."

Nearly everyone I know who thought they can smoke a cigarette every once in a while and not get addicted got hooked on cigarettes. Smoking on a regular basis will eventually lead to addiction. I've seen it time and time again. That's why I tell people it's not worth starting in the first place.

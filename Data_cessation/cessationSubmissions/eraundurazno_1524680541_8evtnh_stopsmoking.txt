Second time quitting

First time on reddit. First time posting. Over 15 years as a one-pack-a-day or more smoker. Second time quitting. 
I have been smoke free for 4 days (and counting). This is the longest I have ever been without smoking (including two hospital visits). 
First time I was trying to quit using the Allen Carr's method. Every single statement sounded absolutely right and logic and couldn't be argued with. Followed the instructions, and after finishing the audiobook, I was very confident I wanted to quit and threw away my cigarettes. Less than 30 mins later I was panicking. Went out and smoked 3 in a row and then continued. 
Second time. Using NRT on patches, 21mg plus 2mg gum in the morning and after lunch. First day was a breeze. I even managed to go to a party and resist the cravings. Second day was a nightmare. Cold sweat, nausea, vomiting, in short, the worst hangover ever (didn't even drink that much)... it was an anxiety attack. Third day I felt ok, hard to control cravings at night when I usually watched series and smoked one after the other. Fourth day I had to put a patch because I was about to light up. Now I am on 28mg patches. I am feeling much better. 
Personally, having the cigarettes in my bag is helping. I don't know why, maybe if it is a feeling of a very rewarding self-control: "I'm not smoking because I DON'T WANT TO (but I could if I wanted to)" instead of "I don't have any cigarettes and I can't smoke". Not really sure why is that but it has worked so far. 
I joined to help (in what I can) and be helped by reading the experiences of others. I really don't want to smoke anymore.

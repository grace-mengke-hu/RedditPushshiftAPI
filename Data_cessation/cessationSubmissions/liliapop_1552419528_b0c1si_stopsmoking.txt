5 days - The crying mess update

First I really want to thank everyone here who reassured me and helped me so much go through my first days cigarette-free. I'm not sure I'd have been able to continue without this support, so thank you so much.   


And you were all right, turns out I'm not going to cry my eyes out for the rest of my life, who would have thought ?   


I actually stopped crying on day 3, and I felt stupid but happy that I cried so much but didn't feel the need to anymore. I was really expecting to be frustrated and angry that it was unnerving to feel anxious and sad like this. But knowing it happened to others helped me power through it.

 I am done with the 5 days I set myself, and I can confidently say that now I'm aiming for a month. The forever and ever idea is still overwhelming for me. But after those awful days, no way I ever want to go through it again, so I might as well continue on my nicotine-free journey!  


Once again, thanks for this sub and for the amazing advice I received !

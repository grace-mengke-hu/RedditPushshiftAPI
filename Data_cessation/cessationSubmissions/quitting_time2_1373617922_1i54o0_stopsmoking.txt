A pack a day for over 10 years.... 7 DAYS SMOKE FREE!

Feels both empowering and extremely depressing at the same time.

No I didn't use allan carrs book or any other quitting aids. Cold turkey all the way.

I just wanted to post to say YAY. This is a real achievement for me right now. I even had a dream last night that I broke my streak and had a cigarette. I woke up feeling very very guilty and almost went to buy some. I resisted though.... go me!

To all those who are considering quitting, or who have begun the smoke free life. I just want to say... The power is entirely in your hands. Do not give the power to those little sticks of smelly dried leaves. You are a non smoker.. You were born that way.. Inhaling the nicotine brings absolutely nothing positive to your life. Every day you go without smoking you will realize this more and more. I honestly cant imagine myself giving in to this wretched habit again.

The cravings still come periodically but every time I feel it. I just quietly chant " I am a non smoker " and the monkey moves away for a while.

My resting heart rate is down to 60-65 on average. It was closer to 80 a week ago.

I can walk to work everyday now. Run up stairs (how ever dangerous). Lift/carry heavy objects with no shortness of breath. I get home in the evenings and don't feel the need to lay down for an hour anymore.

My mind is even a clearer now that I'm not thinking about that nicotine fix every 30minutes.

Nothing but positives to outweigh those irregular anxious cravings that come and go.

YOU ARE ALL NON SMOKERS~!

Day 1 of ditching the cigs.

Decided to make an account after seeing this subreddit.

Threw out all my cigs late last night, its only 18:23 and I'm already finding this difficult. Any tips on staying away from smokes reddit? This is my first time trying to quit since starting (started maybe 5 years ago). So far i've found myself walking outside every hour or so as is my usual routine when smoking, and having to force myself back inside. its made me realise how much of my time was consumed by fag breaks though, which is quite a substantial amount to be honest. 

sorry if this doesn't make total sense - english is not my strong point.

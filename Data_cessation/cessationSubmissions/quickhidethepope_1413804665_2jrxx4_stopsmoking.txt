48 Days and still not smoking but I'm fat and weepy

I am so happy to have managed to not smoke for 48 days but I have been eating and crying in equally egregious meaures.  I gave up cold tukey, I'm cycling and I tried running but got a bad cold for a couple of weeks... it goes on... 
I was wondering if any of the regular stopsmoking crew were also on the loseit threads?

I may well have to waddle over there... will I lose my stopsmoking star if I get a loseit badge?

Thanks for all the support here and the accountability, it really does help.  I read it while I gorge / weep :)

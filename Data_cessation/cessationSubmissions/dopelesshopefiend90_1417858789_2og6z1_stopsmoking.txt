Gradual decline or cold turkey?

What is best? What has worked for you? I'm 24 and have been smoking consistently for 5 years. It gives me such anxiety even thinking about quitting, but I need to. I want to want to quit, you know? I am nearly 3 years clean and sober and cut caffeine this past summer. Smoking is my last thing to quit but it's all I have left.

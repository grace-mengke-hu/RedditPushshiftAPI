Looking for Christmas Present for my Father (40year smoker, stopped 17 days ago)

So, as the title sais, I'm looking for a christmas present for my father. He was smoking for 40 years and stopped 17 days ago (2 packs a day).

I was thinking about an inhalter/e-cigarette, because he is saying how much he is craving to smoke. Do you have any suggestions on that front? I would like to get him some kind of water vapor inhaler. no nikotin...nothing in it. So he just has something to occupy himself with.

Is that a good idea, or is that counter-productive?

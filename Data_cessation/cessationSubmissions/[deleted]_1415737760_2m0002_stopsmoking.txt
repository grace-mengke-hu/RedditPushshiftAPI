When I wake up tomorrow, I no longer am a smoker. Oh The joy!

Good evening stop-smoking community! 

I started smoking when I was 16/17, because back then it was already no longer cool. Me being the uncool me that I am decided for some rebellious reason to start smoking while clubbing! WHAT AN INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN I WAS/AM! 

Right now I am 26, smoke a pack a day (them red luckies) and have been doing so for the better part of half a decade. My previous attempts where futile because I did it for my ex-gf instead of my self. Right now my main reason to give it up is... I don't really eat well when I smoke allot, and over the last 2/3 years I started fitnessing more intesely/often and while I can press and pull respectable numbers, I went running with my slow as hell mom yesterday and... and.. she.. a 56 year old woman. (stopped smoking 5 years ago and took up running) Out endured me, ME, a marvel of a man, a great man, a powerfull man!

Ok, I went a little overboard, I had trouble keeping up without sprinting and walking, repeat. Also, I'm a decent man, not all that great or powerfull. 

But after I stop smoking I will be.. as these cigs are interfering with mah gainz!

Anyway, thanks for whomever may read this, have a great day!

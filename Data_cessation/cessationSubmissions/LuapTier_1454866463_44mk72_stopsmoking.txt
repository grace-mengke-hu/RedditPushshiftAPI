It's been 6 days, I feel great!

Yesterday, and everyday before I came close to giving into the cravings. But once day 6 hit, it was like I never quit in the first place - not smoking feels normal. It's like a miracle.

One of the biggest factors in me not giving in is your support /r/stopsmoking. The first post I made got 18 comments, they all motivated me to carry on being a non-smoker! Also just looking at my 6 day badge motivates me, I've made so much progress I don't want to have to reset it to 0.

I rode my bike for the first time in months yesterday. To my surprise I did not get out of breath, although my legs were sore as hell! I remember I used to cycle to work, but once I took up smoking I had to stop. Now I'll be able to cycle again and save money from buying train tickets everyday.

This video here has changed my view on smoking altogether since I watched it, I no longer feel like a cigarette at all, they disgust me now. Please watch the whole video, i guarantee It will change your view on smoking if not keep you quit forever. Please watch it all! (1hr6min) http://youtu.be/1zeZhHq0WtY

Smokers envy non smokers. Keep that in mind.
Thanks again /r/StopSmoking

Quitting tomorrow

19 years old.  Smoked since I was 15.  Just over a month out of Navy bootcamp. I didn't have a choice to quit during those two months and the first two weeks were absolute hell with all the stress added of being in bootcamp. I got out and where I currently am the cigarettes are a lot cheaper than where I'm from. I told myself I wouldn't go back but to get into or leave my barracks I have to walk right by the smoke deck and it got me on about day 3 of being here. I went from one or two a day to a pack a day starting last week. My lungs are currently on fire. I can't keep smoking but I've tired twice since I've been up here to quit but I go back the next day. I just need some advice on how to kick it for good. I'm struggling with even the thought of quitting and everything here stresses me out. Please. Any advice is good advice at this point. 
Thank you in advance.

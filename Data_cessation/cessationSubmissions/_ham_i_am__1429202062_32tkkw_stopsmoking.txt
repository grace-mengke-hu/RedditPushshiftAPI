so i quit. . .

. . .I feel great. I'm dealing with the few and (thankfully now) far between cravings. With that said, i feel like a complete fatass! I knew (just from reading and hearing other's experiences) that it was common to gain weight, but holy hell. I feel like now that I'm not smoking, I should have more energy and be even more capable of exercise, but that's just not the case. I'm gaining weight rapidly. I used an app to help initially with quitting, so last night while stuffing my face with leftover easter candy, i dl'ed My Fitness Pal. Hopefully, it will help me lose some weight and get me motivated to exercise. Just saying...i'm feeling depressed about quitting because i'm gaining weight! WTF is wrong with me (that's rhetorical-btw)?

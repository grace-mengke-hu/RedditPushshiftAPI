Weird rash after quitting?

I stopped smoking some 10 days ago after two and a half years of smoking between a pack or two per day, and some 3 or 4 days later I developed a strange looking rash mainly on my thighs and later a bit on the rest of my legs and my back, it looked like a typical milder rash and itched less than allergies used to, and now, a week later, it's slowly going away and doesn't itch anymore (I haven't smoked this entire time and I'm not using chewing gum or patches, anything, I just quit). I googled it and it seems like other people have noticed something similar after quitting as well. Does anyone know if these things are connected? Has it happened to anyone else?

patches yes or no

I was prescribed Varenicline by my Doctor, I needed something strong been smoking at least 10 a day for 30 years. After 10 days taking Varenicline I started having severe stomach pains. My doctor advised that i stopped taking them, instead he gave me nicotine replacement patches. I smoked my last cigarette Sunday morning. I have not used the patches, as the nicotine should be almost out of my system, am i taking a backward step if i feel the need to slap one on. would i have to go through withdrawal again at a later date ???

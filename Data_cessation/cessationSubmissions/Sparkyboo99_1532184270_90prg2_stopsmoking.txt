Triggered by sitting in car w smoker

I went to dinner with my mom the other night and she smoked a cig in the car both on the way there and on the way back. She lit her cigarette first before rolling down the window.  I had just put on a sweater that was freshly washed, I’m airing it out but I’ll probably have to wash again.  It reeked so bad! Ugh! I am so glad to be a nonsmoker today.

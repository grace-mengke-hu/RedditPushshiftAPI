one day at  a time

ok sportsfans.  i think i am there.  i unsuccessfully tried to quit through 2012: nicorette, chantix, ecigs, etc.  i would always bum them from my friends, buy a pack when i was feeling stressed or good, then i would be back smoking a pack a day within a day.
I always treated it like a joke....ha ha i'll get to it tomorrow, it's only one, etc.
i realized i am not talking about it or asking for help.  Maybe that is what i am missing.
So, please /stopsmoking ... help me do this.  i admit my unmanageability.  i can't have just one.  i really want to do this.

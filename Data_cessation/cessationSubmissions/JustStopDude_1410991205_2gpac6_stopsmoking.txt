Need someone to distract me....

Fucking shit day at work...goddamn nightmare. Now I'm in the bar I live above, getting torn up and the urge to cross the street to the gas station for some camels is getting fucking fierce. 

I mean I would eat a chunk of dry wall for a smoke.

oh and warning...language....

Four days in, feeling great!

Hi guys, I know my badge says three days, but I'm in New Zealand so I think I'm a day ahead of you stateside folk.

Just thought I'd share my story. I'm twenty-two. Me and my girlfriend of nearly five years broke up, messy breakup. I started smoking during the first year of our relationship, and she pretty much encouraged me to smoke. I was smoking around 15 - 20 cigarettes a day, and 20-packs cost $16 each in New Zealand. So when we broke up, I said to myself, "That was my old life. Time to move on." 

Four days in, and I feel great. I can smell and taste things again. Coffee tastes good, I can pick up subtle hints and flavours in it that were not there a month ago. I can tell if my cologne is still on. I can smell other smokers when they've had a smoke, and I never thought I'd say it, but they smell terrible. My food tastes amazing, its like my sense have been reborn.

I've taken up running again. A month ago I was running three km a day. I would get home and my lungs would be burning. I'd take at least half an hour to get my breath back to normal and my face would stay red for a long time after (poor circulation?)

I did a massive 8.6km hill climb run on Tuesday. It was hard, but I have never run like that in my life. Running every day since, with a huge dopey grin on my face the whole way, because I never thought I'd feel this good. I feel like I can actually become an athlete now, something I thought I could never do before.

Sorry about the rant guys, I just needed to tell someone how good it is to have my life back. Im commited to being a non-smoker. That cigarette smoking, excuse making, unfit person just isn't me anymore, and you know what? I love it.

I'm recovering from my second major long operation in as many weeks.

Without going in to too many details, smoking, alongwith drugs and drinking have damaged my Lungs. I've had 3 operations that have still not been able to reverse the damage I've done to myself. No matter how many I have, I've damaged a perfectly good set of lungs.

I quit smoking 2 years ago, my lung problems began 6 months ago. You don't know when you're going to pay, but it could be any day 

Please just stop. Don't make excuses, trust me, when you're lying in a hospital bed for over a week with tubes sticking out of you and in acute pain every breath, you regret every cigarette. Stop now, you don't need patches, you don't need gum you simply need to decide to stop.

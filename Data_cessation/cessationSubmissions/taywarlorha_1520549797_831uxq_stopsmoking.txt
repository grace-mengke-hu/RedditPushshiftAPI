tell me your least favorite thing about smoking!

Hello all! 

It's day ten, and I'm having a rough day. I was hoping that you might be able to help deliver a swift kick to my little addicted brain, and perhaps comment and tell me some of your LEAST favorite things about your time spent smoking. Be as original or basic as you like. 


Here's one (among many) of mine: almost every time I held a lit cigarette, I just hated myself for smoking it. I was smoking 4-5 american spirits a day, and those last about ten mins... so approx an hour of unnecessary negative thoughts and self-hatred every single day. WHAT A WASTE OF THOUGHTS AND ENERGY. 


Even though I feel firmly planted on the struggle bus, at least I have not had to hate myself over smoking today. WOOT!

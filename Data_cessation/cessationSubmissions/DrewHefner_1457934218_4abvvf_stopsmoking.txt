Well here I am again.

Just reset my badge. I was able to stop for about a month at the end of last year and then caved on new years eve when i got drunk. I havn't made an effort since then but I'm ready to stop drinking until I can finally kick this habit because that always seems to be my achilles heel. I'd really like to finally kick it because unfortunately after so many attempts part of me feels like giving up and just admitting to being a smoker for life, but theres still part of me that has hope. wish me luck.

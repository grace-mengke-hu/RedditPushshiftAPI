Day one and I've already had a (very minor) screw up. D'oh!

I decided to quit using Nicoderm patches, and I bought a gigantic bag of Dumdums (tiny lollipops) to use when I'm wanting a smoke.

Since it says in the instructions to wear the patch at night if you have the urge to smoke first thing in the morning, I popped one on before bed, laid down... and two hours later, I'm awake again due to inability to sleep x'''D I feel a bit hyper almost. On lollipop number one of the day.

Still, I used the time to get rid of the ashtray I had by the computer, put away my safety net of half a pack and ashtray, and... will now attempt to play some Civilization V. Brave New World just came out, so I'm going to distract myself with that.

Anybody else use the patches to attempt to quit and have advice? Any general advice from anybody? Any e-hugs while I deal with a sleepless day, since I don't want to remove the patch now and waste one? x'''D

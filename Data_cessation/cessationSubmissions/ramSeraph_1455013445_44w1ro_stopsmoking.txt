Day 7 - the cravings are driving me nuts, Nicotine Free E-cigs opinion?

Started smoking at 23/24 ( was never good with dates :( ). I am 30 now. I was at 1.5 pack a day when I decided to quit cold turkey. There was no particular plan. Actually there was one particular trigger though, I tried running a month back, I gave up at 800m and lit a cigarette, the fact that I was betting against myself in carrying a cigarette while running caused me to re-evaluate my smoking habit. I am planning on starting running again soon. So I decided to quit a week back. Since then it has been a no nicotine regime. 
  
I have gotten through hanging out with people where alcohol was involved. Its just that when I am alone the cravings are driving me insane and I am not able to concentrate on anything.   

I work from home. The work I have at the moment is not interesting enough to lose myself in. But, I need to work( have been pushing deadlines ). I am considering a nicotine free e-cig. Any reason I shouldn't do this? Will this lead to a relapse?

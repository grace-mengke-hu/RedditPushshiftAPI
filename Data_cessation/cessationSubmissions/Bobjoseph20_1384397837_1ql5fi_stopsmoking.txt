Any smoker noticing skin problems such as dry skin throughout the body, palish color, and/or thinning hair?

I've been smoking for almost six years and my skin has been out of control for the last year or so. I have dry skin all over - especially face and scalp - and have tried many things to fight it but to no avail. It has to be the smoking I've now realized. Have any ex-smokers had similar symptoms? If so, how long into quitting did you notice your skin becoming better? And will the hair ever recover? This is probably the last straw and I will be quitting after this weekend! Thanks in advance!

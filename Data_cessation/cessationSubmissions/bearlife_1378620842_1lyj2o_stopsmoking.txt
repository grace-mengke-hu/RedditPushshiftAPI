My Mouth is So Moist

Man, it's been only 6 days, but right now my mouth is so moist, I usually drink a lot of water but after having quit smoking my mouth is just gushing with water. My throat hurts from swallowing so much, it's fantastic. It's a refreshing moistness too, it's not overbearing, pretty much when you find that right water fountain and it taste delicious, that's my mouth. Thanks guys for helping me stay accountable and it's the little things like this that keep me going! Hope to encourage you guys and gals!

Other people smoking makes me want to smoke

I don't know what to do about this. I'm trying to quit, I think I'm doing alright resisting the urge so far though I have caved twice and had to start all over again. But every time I see someone light up a smoke it makes me want one so bad, this is usually ok because I can usually just walk away or if I'm at work I can just not take my breaks at the same time as all the other employees so I won't be around them while they're smoking, but my biggest problem is my wife and she doesn't want to quit and I'm not gonna try to like force her to quit or anything, but I live with her so it's kinda hard to avoid it like I can with other people I'm around during the day. Any advice?

I've got a star :D

I smoked for 5 years up to a pack a day.

I've read Allen Carr- Awesome points; lasted 2 days

I've used Patches - Crazy dreams but also crazy Nightmares; cut down to 5 smokes a day for a week

I've used Nicotine gum - Violently ill; lasted 1 smoke

I've used Nicotine lozengers - made me constantly mildly sick; lasted a day and a half 

I went cold turkey (7ish times)- GODDAMN WANTED TO BREAK EVERYTHING :) lasted from 2 hours to 1 week 

I used Champix - first time lasted 3 weeks, willpower/ desire to quit ran out

Annnddd here I am for what feels like the millionth try but for the first time I've hit 1 month and I couldn't be prouder of myself :D 

Just wanted to share :)

Something that needs to stop on this Subreddit.

So I've noticed something quite disturbing about this Sub, which is the strange amount of down votes on peoples posts. This is a Sub to show and receive support with others, we are all here to help each other stop and be inspired by those who have stopped. I saw a post earlier from what seemed to be an extremely genuine person trying to stop smoking and asking for support, so why are they being littered with down votes? That really isn't going to help their confidence and it is NOT supportive in the slightest. I'm not sure why people are doing this? Maybe because they simply cannot give up and are doing it out of spite?

Anyway, not sure why this is happening but I just think we should be showing as much support as possible to these people, just as we would like to receive the same level of support from others.

EDIT:

- All I am trying to say, is when people post something (like this) and they are genuinely trying to quit, please stop downvoting them. I have 8 downvotes on this and I am trying to help everyone here.

- So this post has caused some controversy and I am seeing the same old E-cig Vs Cold Turkey posts. I used to be the one knocking E-cigs, but if you are stopping all of those chemicals, then more power to you from now on. We all need to be supportive so that's what I'm going to do.

Thanks!

TIRED AND DEPRESSED! FFS ANYONE!? (5th day)

Hello peeps!

I feel the need to write a few lines even though I know what I'm feeling is normal.. but it feels better to hear from others as well.

Feeling tired and depressed, well not depressed, maybe sad and feeling hopeless is more like it.
I'm on my 5th day by the way and this is my 10th attempt quitting or something.

I have an underlying depression/anxiety disorder of sorts which will be magnified of course in the early stages of quitting. But I'm hoping for a better mood once I'm out on the other side!


Cheers people!

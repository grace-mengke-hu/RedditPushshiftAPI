Have you found smoking to be disgusting, yet did so anyway?

I think we have all been there. Maybe after partying too much the night before, or finding ashes in a food plate ... something that makes you think 'this is so nasty' , but just for a short while, until it's time to light one up.  I don't know if this will help anyone else but what worked for me was to keep that thought in my mind, **always**, so much that even the thought of lighting one up would cause to literally start coughing.  Like a post-hypnotic suggestion if you will.  But I used it like a mantra.  *Thinking of lighting one up?* ... instant wave of disgust and physical coughing, forced myself to do that.  But it actually made quitting for me pretty easy that way.  The first 20 days or so were *kind of* challenging, but after that it was home free.  But to this day, almost 900 days later, if I smell even the faintest stench of cigarette smoke I'm repulsed by it.

I hope this long post might help someone somehow.  Life without cigarettes, and nicotine, is **so** much better.

First week tonight

I have probably only successfully quit smoking a week two times since I was 16 years old. If I ever did before, it was probably because I was out of money or just couldn't handle it. My longest streak is around a month and I remember (it was when I was 21) smoking some of a friends cigarettes drunk at a party and instantly fell into the hole.

Speaking of drinking, I quit drinking for 60 days so that I could quit smoking. My plan was, 30 days into no alcohol, I would pull the trigger on no smoking. I don't drink often, but when I do, one or two beers is the bane of my "quit". I talked to my mom about this and apparently it's very common. I know 30 days isn't long enough, so when my 60 days alcohol quit is "finished" I'll probably continue to stay away from that until I feel comfortable smoking, but I'm wondering if there's a consensus on that.

Anyways, it feels good to be here. I hope to come back a year later smoke free with more advice than questions.

Can't seem to kick it completely.

I've been a smoker for about two years now.  I started on a trip to Costa Rica and figured the habit would be easy to kick once I got back and home and the price of cigs tripled.  Needless to say that wasn't enough and the habit continued.  I gave quitting a try several times over the last 2 years but rarely made it more than a week.  On average I was smoking about a half pack a day.

Fast forward to July of this year.  My job was being moved from an outbuilding where I worked with 2 other people to a central location where I would be working with many more people including some of the higher-ups and I decided to quit once and for all.  I had some solid success in August, having only 8 cigs and a stretch of 20 days without smoking.  

However, somewhere toward the beginning of September I started smoking Black and Mild Cigars in the evening.  It's usually just that, 1 B&M in the evening, occasionally more on weekends. Try as I might I haven't been able to kick this last vestige of my smoking habit.  Any tips with getting over this last hump?

Thanks and best wishes to all of you on this journey.

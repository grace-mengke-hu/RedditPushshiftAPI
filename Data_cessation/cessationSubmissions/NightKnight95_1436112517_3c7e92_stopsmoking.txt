"Resetting my badge" post *sigh*

I had a cigarette last night at a house party. See previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3c6gu1/despite_being_resilient_and_f_at_all_pubs_bars/).

Your usual resetting post.

Still don't like smoking. Haven't wanted one today fortunately. But I did have one, therefore I must reset my badge. That will teach me for next time!

Things have definitely improved for me!

I rarely feel cigarette cravings, and when I do, they are very minor.  My brother smokes an ecig copiously, and I have yet to feel the need to ask him for a hit.  I have high hopes that it will be smooth sailing for (hopefully) the rest of my life.  At this point, there are no excuses for going back to the yellow side.

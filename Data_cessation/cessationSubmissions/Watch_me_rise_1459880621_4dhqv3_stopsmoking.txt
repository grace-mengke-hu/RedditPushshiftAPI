Time for a change.

I'm done. I need a new path. I tried vapes, smokeless tobacco, sunflower seeds, and none of them work. I'm committed to the anger of nicotine enough to push myself through it, but I need advice. How to diminish the cravings? I don't want to smoke, but the addiction has nothing to do with "wants" at this point. Also working on quitting drinking and marijuana altogether. I will not be a slave to a substance any longer.

Dead but NO SMOKE

I am fucked up right now and about 2 hours ago , I was very tempted to smoke and even had a pack of someone else lying just around the corner. I contemplated but I told myself FUCK IT if you want to smoke , buy a pack and have a smoke while your sober.

I am not sober right now but I know that I am not going to smoke tomorrow. 

This is sort of a tip I want to share . Guys if you are with friends and drinking and you are craving wait it out .. decide if you really want to smoke the next day ! This kind of thinking has literally saved me about 10 relapses over the past 4 months !

Love you guys ! peace <3

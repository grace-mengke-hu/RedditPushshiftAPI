Struggling with a few things...

Hey /r/stopsmoking, 

I'm a 24 year old recent graduate who has been planning to quit smoking after graduation for some time now. I've been a pack a day smoker since November of 2010, but have recently been hovering around 3/4 of a pack. I'm applying for big boy jobs at the moment, and the one I have my eye on, Huntington Bank, is a strict no smoking company, which makes is necessary that I quit. 

I've been smoking only half of each cigarette since December, effectively halving my intake of nicotine, and I'm comfortable and encouraged with that at this point. I have only recently started trying to cut my quantity. My main method is trying to stretch the time between each out further, going from whenever I wanted one, to two hours. I can do this the whole day with some effort, but once I get home from work in the evening, I start playing some video games and all of a sudden, I've consumed almost the entire rest of the pack. It's like the motivation I have to keep it at 2 hour marks goes away and I'm fine with basically chain smoking for a couple hours before I go to bed. I'm thinking I'm forgetting to just forget about smoking them and almost want to keep checking my watching to see how much longer I have until 2 hours is up. Is there anything that can help me here? I know 90% of it is willpower, but goddamn, these things are a curse to get rid of.

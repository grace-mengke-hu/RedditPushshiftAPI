Chantix 1 week mark - Ohhhh, my head.

I'm 25 now, been smoking since I was almost 19. It started as a way to get outside from a very stressful job that hated if you left your desk for anything, but if you were just having a quick smoke it was fine. Thankfully I no longer work there.

As of today I have started the second week of Chantix which means an increased dosage. I went all day without a smoke until about 20 minutes ago when I broke down and had one because I've been in a fog all day and just can't seem to keep my thoughts together.

Other than the cigarette tasting like ass and making me grumble, I didn't get anything out of it. I still want a cigarette just as bad as I did before, and I didn't even get that small rush that you're used to after prolonged time without.

I'm going to keep taking the Chantix, but god is it hard the first day. Hopefully the second day and beyond gets better.

Now I need a new reason to stretch my legs... lol.

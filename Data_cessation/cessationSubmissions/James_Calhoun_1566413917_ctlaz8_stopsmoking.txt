Relapsed after two years

I am without words. I am angry and disappointed. I made a few posts over the last two years how this was my final quit, how I finally understood how to quit and that I am done for ever. During lots of stress I somehow caved. Somehow I justified one cigarette and we all know where that leads. Resetting my badge.

No Choice But To Quit

I must be the dumbest person on the planet... I STARTED smoking when I was 40 years old.   Who the F does that?    

Last Friday I went in for a simple blood test and they did a blood pressure test - clocked in at 231/128...  The nurse was scared and sent me right to urgent care.  Spent 5 hours there and got things under control w/ an appt today for primary.

After 10 years this weekend was my wake up call - quit cold turkey.  Today is tough, back in the office and really craving.  I had no idea how much of a routine I was in.  Smoking was tied to everything - conference call in 15 mins, better grab one before the call.  Conference call ended - go smoke...   The craving is real but I'm going to try really hard.   

  
Thanks!

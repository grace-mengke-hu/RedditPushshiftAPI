I'm quitting -.-

I'm just so tired of smoking! 

I quit out of the blue 2 years ago and was able to maintain it for more than a year. I did actually stop considering my self a smoker back then. I was able to separate the "smoking person" from my identity. 

And then I tried one, for the old good nostalgic times. And everything went out of my control and now I smoke almost even more than 2 years ago. 

I've been "wanting to quit" since I started, 10 months ago. Even actually "trying" but trying never was real for more than a few hours.

But today I'm just sick of this, so I'm gonna quit, like, right now. 
And I don't know, I feel like making it public can help me to stick to it. 

I just need to be able to not smoke today. If I make it, tomorrow will be a new day. 


Have a nice day everyone haha

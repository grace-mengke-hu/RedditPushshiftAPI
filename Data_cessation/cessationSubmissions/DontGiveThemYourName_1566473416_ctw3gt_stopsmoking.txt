Want to have my last cigarette very soon - looking for advice

So I'm 19 years old, and I smoke about 20 roll-up cigarettes a day and I'm beginning to realize just how bad it's affecting my health. My smoker's cough is only getting worse, I can feel my heartbeat in my forehead after walking 30mins home from work, and I get cold sweats and shivers after 3 hours without a cig. I was considering getting an e-cig with pure nicotine so I can have the satisfaction of puffing on something and fighting off withdrawal without giving my lungs the equivalent of 10 rounds with Mike Tyson. The ultimate goal is to abandon nicotine completely, however I feel in my current state of body and mind this may be too big of a hurdle for me. My line of reasoning is that if I switch from smoking to vaping for a few days/weeks, I'll be able to get more exercise and generally feel well enough to overcome withdrawal entirely, and finally start on the path to better health. Is vaping as a substitute a slippery slope in terms of trying to compromise with myself, or would it be beneficial to my efforts?

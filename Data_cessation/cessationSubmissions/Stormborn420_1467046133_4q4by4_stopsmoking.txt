105 Days, I never thought i would get here!!

i posted here on day one and i just wanted to come back and check in on day 105 to say YOU CAN DO IT GUYS!! its not easy, but it is so worth it! 

Remember to be kind to yourself when you're quitting. Every single cigarette you dont smoke is a victory so be proud of your accomplishments and dont be too hard on yourself!

i was lucky and i was sponsored to quit which kick-started my motivation, but it takes real will power not to cave in. The biggest thing that have stopped me smoking are the thought of having to go back to 'day 1' after so long without one, even after having a drink with my friends (which is the hardest time to resist for me) i am militant with myself and determined not to go back to the beginning. 

Good luck gang!!

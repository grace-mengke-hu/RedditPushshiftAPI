I have an urge to smoke

Backstory: I lived in nz my whole life and am now in my home country for uni. Cigarettes were easily over $20 and were too expensive to smoke. 
However in Korea, Marboro golds and originals are equivalent to $4 a carton. Korea is a heavy smoking country, every corner you turn has a group of smokers. 
I know smoking is bad and it can cause to shorten your life but how do i resist the urge to not look at the ciggarette stand everytime i go to a convinient store?

Well, I caved...

I bought cigarettes yesterday after 3+ weeks smoke free. I had a major emotional meltdown. My stepdad who is apparently a fucking child got mad because I forgot to turn the closed caption off the tv, so he put a chain and bike lock on the elliptical so I couldn't use it. Real mature, right? Not an overreaction at all. /s

As an adult currently (temporarily) living with my mom, I hate my situation, but do my best to deal with it. My asshole stepdad has been treating me like garbage the past few weeks, and obviously I reached a breaking point. So I broke down and cried my eyes out. Without access to my current coping mechanism (exercise!), I went and got cigarettes. I smoked one and a half last night and half of one today. The good news is that I didn't really enjoy it. When I'm feeling low, I tend to engage in self-destructive behaviors (usually not eating), and I think that's why I chose to smoke. I still have most of the pack. I probably won't finish it, but I'm not sure that I'm done with it just yet. We'll see. 

I'm only mad at myself for letting that asshole get to me. Fuck him.

502 Smoke free days OR 12,550 Cigarettes not smoked and $7,100 richer (CDN Prices)!

502 Days -- I can't believe it.  If it wasn't for the flair, I'd never would have known how long it's been as I stopped placing importance on how long it's been.  It's been quite the road traveled with this success.  The first three months I blew up like a balloon in weight gaining over 13 kilos.  I'm after loosing all that weight and then some.  I feel wonderful.  I smell wonderful.  I breathe wonderful.  I can't even imagine going back to smoking after feeling this great.  I wish you all success and happiness with beating this addiction.  If I can do it, anybody can.

Cool site that compares health/body differences for smokers vs. non-smokers

Well, according to SmokeFree app, I'm 55h30m without cigarettes. I'm using the patch (no hate please) and have found the past almost 3 days surprisingly painless.  I've had plenty of small, situational cravings (I commute, so 2.5 hrs a day in the car has had me subconsciously reaching for my cigarettes), but I'm learning ways to counter the 'addiction monster.'
Mostly, I think about all the reasons why quitting is the best gift I could give myself. Today I found this site, and am using it to help remind myself that I'll not only feel better, I'll look better too!

Hope this helps at least one person decide to make the final push and quit!

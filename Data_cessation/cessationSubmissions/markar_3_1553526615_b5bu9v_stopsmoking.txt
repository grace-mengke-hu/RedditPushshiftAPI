What happens after nicotine gums?

Hello quitters, I hope you still stay away from smoking. 
So I ve been smoke free for almost 3 weeks and since day 1 I ve been having nicotine replacements which made it very easy for me. However, I dont see my self doing this for ever so I am worried that even though I quit the habit I havent been nicotine free yet. Should the next step be normal chewing gums or should I try to reduce the amound of gums radically?

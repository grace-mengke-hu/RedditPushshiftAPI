10 days in and I'm still miserable!

Hello everyone. 

I quit smoking 10 days ago. However, I'm still depressed without it! I mean, I still can't enjoy life. With every cup of coffee I see a cigarette. When at work, I'm always thinking about having a smoke. The list goes on and on with everything that I used to do with a smoke.

How is life after smoking? Do you enjoy it?

Thanks.

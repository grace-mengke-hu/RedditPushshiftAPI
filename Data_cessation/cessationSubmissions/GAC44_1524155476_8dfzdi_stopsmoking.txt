Don't feel like I can quit at the moment...

I'm currently going through a vestibular disorder that's been going on for over a year. Everyday my head feels like complete crap, tension headaches, ringing ears, anxiety at times. The problem is if I quit smoking right now I don't think that I can go through the brutal withdrawals and the VD at the same time. I currently don't work and can't drive because of it, so I'm basically in my house all day. I don't know how I can quit with this disorder since I really can't go for walks or be busy, the best I can do is sit in my backyard but without a cigarette it seems pointless.

My main reason for wanting to quit is so I can have money to pay my bills until I can go back to work as I'm falling a bit behind on them. 

I'm not sure what to do...

I fucked up.

Whatever my flair says is a lie.

I don't know why I've gone down this path again. I've recommended Allen Carr's book to so many people. I've had a couple successful quits, this one lasting for a couple years. My girlfriend doesn't know. I'm not allowed to smoke at my job. I feel like shit when my neighbor opens their balcony door and I can hear their kids in there while I'm standing outside poisoning their air. I want to enjoy life. I want to be free from it again. I want to use my body for good. Working out. Eating right. I thought I could get away with smoking blunts, but that turned into adding a little bit of tobacco, then a little more, then saying "Fuck it, get the good tobacco." None of it is good. It makes me hate myself. It makes me closed off to the world. I can taste the rotting of my mouth. My muscles going away. The anxiety and evil thoughts and the self-loathing. I know I can beat it but I need strength and the will to continue with a life that feels like it's going nowhere and just stacking more and more burden onto myself.

I've started reading Allen Carr's book again and I just want to be done so bad. I don't want to smoke, and I've seen the benefits (so, so many...) of quitting. So why do I do this to myself?

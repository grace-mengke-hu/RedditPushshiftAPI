Day One

I finished Allen Carr yesterday and put out my last cigarette of life today at 12:20pm. I know that I will never smoke again and as of 12:21pm I became a non-smoker. I am prepared to get past the physical withdrawals and get to the business of enjoying my life without worrying about the money I was throwing down the toilet, disease, smelling like shit, littering, and being judged by non smokers. This is happening folks. I feel really really good about it. Just wanted to share this and to say I love all the positive support on this sub.

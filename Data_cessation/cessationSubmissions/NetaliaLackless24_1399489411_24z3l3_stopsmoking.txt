Day 1 is today!

Well, my last cigarette was at 1AM last night. I took two drags and it just grossed me the hell out and I put it out. Woke up this morning and knew it was my time.


I'm about 20 pages from finishing Allen Carr's "The Easy Way." The tools he gave me have really made this day not terrible and filled with withdrawal, but like I'm defeating a terrible enemy. Every time I get a pang/urge to smoke, I just think "Hah! That's another punch to the little monster in my brain that's craving nicotine! Take that!" and get a little smile. 


Smoking does nothing for me and I now realize that. I'm looking forward to all the benefits I'll be getting from not smoking!

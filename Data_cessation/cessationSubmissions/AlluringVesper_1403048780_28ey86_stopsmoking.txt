Trying to quit...again

This is the first time I've posted here so a little explanation on why I say "again." 

I've been smoking for about 5 years now. I actually quit for about 6 months around 2 years ago, but I started smoking again thinking "I'm celebrating tonight, it won't happen again." Wrong. Been smoking regularly ever since.

I stopped smoking this past Sunday night. Similar to the last time I tried to quit, I'm handling the headaches and urges well. The urge to smoke is strongest when I'm bored/driving. and want something to do with my hands. 

I'm here for support and motivation to get through the initial stages of quitting cold turkey, but I'm also here more for the support and community around me to give me a reason to not smoke again. After I successfully(or so i thought at the time) quit 2 years ago, I lost sight of my reason for quitting in the first place and when I had the thought to smoke again, I didn't have the support or reason to not start again. 

I know this is kinda rambly and I'm sorry if my post is hard to follow.

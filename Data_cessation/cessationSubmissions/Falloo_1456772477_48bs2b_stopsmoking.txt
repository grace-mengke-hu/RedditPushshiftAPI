Shitty mother who can't parent her kids without nicotine apparently...

Husband away this week. I should be able to do this, they're MY kids for gods sake, both under the age of 7. Seriously, why is this so HARD?!?! I've tried to give them a rough idea of what's going on, wanted to make myself accountable to them so is be less likely to cave. My eldest has been home from school for 3.5 hours and already I'm gagging to get outside and escape for a smoke. I don't even really want the smoke but I'm considering it just for the escape. I used to come back in and feel refreshed from it, ready to start again. I've tried going out for a breath of fresh air and it's not working. I'm just getting more and more angry and I don't want to take it out on the kids. 
Feeling pretty useless and crappy right now. Want to smoke, don't want to smoke... AAAAAAGH!!!!!

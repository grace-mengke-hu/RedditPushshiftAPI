Just had my last smoke

Just had my last smoke. Starting the count again. 
Previously Iâ€™ve had to use the nicotine gum to help get over cravings when they get bad. 

My triggers are: 
-Driving.. I always smoke while driving. 
-Having a stressful shift and finally getting a break or finally getting off shift and having that first smoke 
-Being up on my nights off and getting bored.( I work night shift and stay on same sleep schedule days off) 

Any suggestions to get over these? 

Thanks all :)

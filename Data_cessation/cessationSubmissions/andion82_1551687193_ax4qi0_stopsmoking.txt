Celebrating my 4th year :)

As every year I want to say thank you to this community.

This year I am more convinced than ever that I am a non smoker for good. My mother and mother-in-law quit smoking too, and they told me I was a big inspiration. That was \*super\* encouraging for me. Unfortunately my mother fell after 9 months, but I know she can make it again, and will be there for her. My in-law is struggling too, I hope she can make it past a year.

For all of you that are fighting keep strong, every day you don't smoke makes you stronger, trust me!

If you read until this point, and you are still a smoker... what are you waiting for! I know you can do it!

If you read all this and you also quitted: I AM FUCKING PROUD OF YOU.

I need to help my parents stop but I don't know how.

My parents have both turned 50 this year, they have been smokers for over 32 years. Since the day I learned about the dangers of cigarettes I have been trying to get them to quit. They constantly say that they want to quit smoking but neither one of them made any effort to stop. When my little sister started smoking hookah my parents made a deal with her, if they quit smoking cigarettes she would quit smoking hookah. To accomplish this task my parents both got those vapor cigs so that they could slowly ween themselves off the nicotine. My dad had a really good start, for the first week he only had two cigarettes a day and used the vapor the rest of the time, however he recently fell off the horse and now he only uses the vapor if I am standing over his shoulder. My mother on the other hand I have only seen her use the vapor twice and when ever I try to talk to her about it she dodges me, and if I push her she just ignores me. I have come to you all to ask, what have your family members done that have helped you to quit, and is there anything you can think of that I can do to help them as much as possible.

tidbits of clarity

some days ill be completely motivated and exited about the notion that im in the process of quitting, and other moments ill have a near breakdown because i REALLY need a cig. its nightmarish, when the lose-your-mind thing happens; nothing i can say to myself will make the craving go away, just waiting it out and drinking some almond milk pretending its whisky or something. would just like to share. two weeks clean, cravings still strong.

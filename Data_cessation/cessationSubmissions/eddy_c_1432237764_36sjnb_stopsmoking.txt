First time I got this far Day 4 w/ the help of vape pen.

So I've posted before and tried to quit at least 3 different times. I've used the e-cig in the past, but it didn't help. It was the type I was using (a cheap starter model) I upgraded over the weekend and gave it another go. I've never gotten this far and am so happy that my cravings are very minimal. 

I know some people on the subreddit don't agree with the approach of using e-cigs / vaporizers, but I say whatever works. I wanted to post in case anyone was trying this approach and failed. It is important to spend a little more and get a better model vape pen. You get more of the sensation of smoking. It's still not easy, but it helps.

Does the urge to smoke ever go away?

Just failed to quit fpr the 4th time. Lasted my longest which is 2 days lol. I have my vape thats been kind of helping, but after reading alot of peoples comments, i get the feeling that the urge might not ever go away.

Is this true? I really hope its not. I stopped having the urge to drink when i beat alcoholism but i never seem to hear about the urge to smoke going away. Its my biggest determining factor to stopping smoking because i dont think il be able to ever properly quit as my willpower is seriously lacking.

Any advice would be nice. I really want to beat this beast.

Need advice to start my no smoking Day 1

Hello everyone :) i came across this thread a few days back. Since then I am absolutely glued to it and love what you all share. 
A short intro about me: I have been smoking since I was 19. Now I am 24 amd it has escalated to 1.5 packs a day. I did quit ( or tried quitting) a few times. The maximum I did reach was a month. For the past few days I have been wanting to quit but I dont think I will be able to deal with the withdrawal. I get supremely depressed, cannot get out of my bed, start fidgeting etc. (I have a history of mental health issues for which I am visiting a therapist). Its like a voice inside my head telling me to take that one more smoke and everything would be alright ( which never is). I feel chained to this nasty habit amd powerless to bring about any change. I would really appreciate any insight or advice regarding how I would go about the first few days of non smoking (planning to quit asap- now or never)

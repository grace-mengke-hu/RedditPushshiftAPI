I can't wait till cigarettes smells bad to me.

Basically everyone I work with smokes so they all smell great when they come in from break(no homo). Was teaching an associate today who smokes. Dude was about a foot away from me and all I could smell was special blends and I loved it. So far that's been the hardest part. The smell of it. I can find things to occupy myself but when I smell it, it drives me mad!

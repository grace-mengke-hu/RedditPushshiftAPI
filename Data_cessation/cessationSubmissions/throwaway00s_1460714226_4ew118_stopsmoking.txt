Head piercing headaches after 12hrs

It's been 12 hours. I went for a 40 min jog last night and wanted to do the same this morning but I am physically unable to do so. Not only is this headache the worst pain I've felt in my life, this post is the only thing I've accomplished today apart from trying and failing to keep down some toast for breakfast.
Look- I've broken bones before and that was much more pleasant than the pain I'm in right now. I thought water and ibuprofen would help. No such luck.

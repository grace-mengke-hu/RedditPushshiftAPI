How can I help my boyfriend quit smoking?

Hi there, this is my first time posting here, and I'm not this is entirely the right place, but I need help to help my boyfriend quit smoking. He's tried a couple times in the past, cold turkey every time, and it hasn't worked. This past weekend we found my aunt has stage IV lung cancer. It really freaked me out, because even though he's been smoking for less than a year, he's developed a dependence. After she told us, I kind of took him aside and told him that we were both going to quit that day. I haven't had one since, and it's been four days. However, my boyfriend struggles with depression and anxiety and I know he smokes to help him feel better, especially when he's stressed. Yesterday, when he started up again, he felt so awful for "disappointing" (his words, not mine; I wasn't all that disappointed) me that he broke down a little. I didn't scold him for it, I just told him that falling off the wagon is sometimes a part of quitting, and he needs to get right back on. But I'm not sure if being that gentle with him is the right thing to do. I guess my question is: What kind of emotional support do I give my boyfriend to quit smoking if smoking is one of the few things that helps his anxiety?

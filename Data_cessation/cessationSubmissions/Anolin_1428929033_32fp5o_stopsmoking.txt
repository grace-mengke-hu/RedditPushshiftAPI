Starting over

As of 10:30PM EST last night I had my last cigarette AGAIN.  I picked back up after having 72 hours down due to a very stressful situation, but I've decided that no matter what I'm going through in life, it's just not worth it.  If I don't have my health, then what do I have?

I'm also an alcoholic whose last drink was just 11 days ago, so quitting both smoking and drinking cold turkey, all while trying to deal with life on life's terms, has been difficult for me and it was very easy for me to just pick up a cigarette and start smoking again.  Thankfully quitting isn't **too** bad for me as I have been an on and off smoker for only about 2 years now, and it was mainly alcohol that got me started in the first place.

Anyways, thanks to this sub and to the /r/stopdrinking sub, and to AA and other recovery programs I can learn new and healthy coping skills to deal with life, instead of having to have some kind of drug(s).

I love you all!

Dreamt of you

I had a relapse dream last night. I remember lighting that first cigarette and thinking one would be fine. And then lighting the second one, thinking one more won't kill me. By the time I had the third one, I knew I was in trouble. I put it out before I finished it. Funny thing is that I thought, "I should have reached out to the stopsmoking reddit for help." I dreamt that I'd have to reset my badge, and I was sad about that.

My takeaway from this dream:
* Even my inner addict has come to KNOW that there's no such thing as "Just One."
* This community is an incredible source of support and accountability.
* I'm so damn glad I didn't actually smoke! ðŸš­

Anyway, just wanted to share. Thanks for everything. Stay strong. Reach out if you need support. Don't be afraid to succeed.

5th day... WoW

I'm on my 5th day after 18 years of smoking .. Hope 2 make it ... Really it's hard with all those cravings.. Headache .. Nervousness.. Irritability .. Hunger. Sleeping problems.. What else??!
I used to smoke 30 blue L&M cigs per day . & this is my first quitting trial.. Will I make it fellows ?

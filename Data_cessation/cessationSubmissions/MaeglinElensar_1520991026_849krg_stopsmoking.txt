Just crossing the two week threshold

...which is the longest I've got since my 3 week stint during my period of unemployment in 2015. I even made it through the weekend (which was filled with drinking and socializing on account of my birthday).

This attempt feels like the real one. Cravings still pop up, but I haven't felt strongly enough about it to give in.

Stay in it, everyone.

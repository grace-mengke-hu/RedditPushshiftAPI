Had the smoking dream again.

So I had the dream where I'm sitting around with my friends and I decide to light up a smoke.  I remember I immediately threw it away and noticed my teeth hurt.  This was the first time I've stopped myself from smoking in dreamland.  I don't know if this is a sign of improvement or if I am dissatisfied with myself somehow.  I do know that when I woke up, I felt a huge relief that it was just a dream and not awake life.  I wonder if I'll dream of smoking in the years to come?

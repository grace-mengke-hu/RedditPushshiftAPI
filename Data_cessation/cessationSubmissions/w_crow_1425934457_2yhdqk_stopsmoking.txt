Back, because I goofed up. Quit date: The Ides of March.

Hey all.

Stressed out, pissed off and smelling like tobacco.  Sick of being in this perpetual state.  I made it seven months last year, picked up a vape pen after some cigarettes on boy's night out.  Right back to it.

Broke the pen, it's venomous.  So many new locations I could smoke and get that monkey off my back.  I switched back to analog smokes last week because they mess with my body way worse. Hence more reasons to quit. 

I get hives smoking, dry/cracked skin on my hands, I weeze, my digestion is all messed up and I have a hard time sleeping without "one more", which keeps me up dovetailed into videogames until way late. (Two months TF2 free). 

I'm rereading Alan Carr.  I'm a nonsmoker who has meditation and healthy diet dialed in for more than a year now and I know I'm stronger than this chickenshit addiction. 

Thanks for the support and keeping the subreddit alive. See you the 15th. I have my last pack in my desk at home right now, posting from work and I'll check back in with you guys when I finish the book.

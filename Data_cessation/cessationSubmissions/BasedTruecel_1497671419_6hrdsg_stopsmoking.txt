Can I make a recommendation?

I'm not a shill or anything, I am promoting what I am promoting because it is the only thing that worked for me and others. But have you guys tried reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking? It's one of those things that seems too good to be true, but once you read the book and follow the instructions 100% correctly, you'll see it really is true. 

Seriously, give it a try! It helped me. I went 4 months without any nicotine in any form. The only reason I started back up is because I was stupid and fell for the "I'm not addicted anymore, I can have just one to prove it" trap. Yeah, this book is incredibly effective, but you still have to avoid traps like that.

Quitting nicotine patches?

Hello fellow smoke free redditors! I have a friend who is trying to quit and has done an amazing job breaking the habit after smoking for many years. They did so with some help from nicotine patches and it appears the smoking addiction itself is broken (nearly a month without any smoke), though they continue to use nicotine patches daily.

I thought I'd ask for input from those of you who utilized them to see if you might have tips for weaning off of them. Their plan has been to gradually decrease the dosage over time, and that has them down to the 7mg or 14mg patches currently but it appears going from those to nothing at all is a stumbling block and they've plateaued.

I never used patches myself when I quit so I'm looking for input from those of you who have experience with this. I'll share this thread with them in hopes that some of you may be able to help.

Thank you!

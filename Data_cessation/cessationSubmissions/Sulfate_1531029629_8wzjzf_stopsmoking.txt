My one year smokeaversary.

July 1st marked one year without tobacco.

I can't believe that I just wrote that.

I've somewhat fantasized about what that one year would be like, you know?  The concept was absurd!  One year without my little cancerous prick friends?  I couldn't imagine anything more horrifying or more utterly beyond my grasp, but that's what the challenge I'd made to myself was.

So...  After all my agony, after all my work...  I forgot about the smokeaversary.  I'd intended to make a post and buy something nice for myself (premium cigarettes are $15-ish a pack here in Canada, so I'm staring down at $6300 in savings) but I completely forgot.  

**That makes it so much better.**

I'm not trying to brag.  It's been an agonizing journey, and all I'm trying to get across is that if I can do it, you can do it, okay.  Because I'm a gigantic pussy.  And I was a little bitch about it the entire time.  But it's doable, right?

This subreddit helped me get to this point, and I thank all of you.

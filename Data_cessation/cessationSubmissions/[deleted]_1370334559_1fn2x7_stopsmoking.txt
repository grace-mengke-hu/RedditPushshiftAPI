Hormone changes after quitting

How long does it take for hormones to return to normal once you've quit? Interested in hearing about both personal experiences and scientific research on this, if there is any. I'm a female and wondering when/if to expect a change in hormones after having smoked 2-5 cigarettes a day for ~3 years.

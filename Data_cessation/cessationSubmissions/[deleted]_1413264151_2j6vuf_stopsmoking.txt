My friend's method for quitting (to prospective quitters).

My friend smoked up to two packs a day, every day. Our entire group of friends were fiends, everyone joking about how none of us will make it to 50. It stopped being funny when none of us could ride bikes, or run -- I mean we are 20 years old, God dammit. We're supposed to be at the peak of our health. He had enough of it and came up with this method. None of it is an exact science, but the proof is in the pudding, and he has been smoke free for 2 months.

He went from smoking Marlboro Lights to American Spirits, with the belief that the "all natural" tobacco would be less addictive than the chemical ridden Philip Morris variety. Regardless if that is true, the fact that they burn so slow definitely helped.

Now, what he did was take a full pack, 20 cigarettes, and mentally make them 40. He then set a goal, to smoke fifteen "cigarettes" a day, which was 7 1/2 full cigarettes. He slowly cut down the amount he smoked -- not a conscious, incremented amount, but kept stretching his craving a little bit further. Also, he broke all rituals, such as smoking after eating, after work, etc. 

Obviously it isn't  fun, and this method takes discipline, but he said that it was relatively easy, and the cravings were nowhere near as bad as the last several failed attempts.

I'm currently trying it, and have gone from 20-25 a day to smoking just 5 today, and that's after only 2 days.

tl/dr: switch to Spirits, smoke halves at a time, break rituals, and live healthy and happy!

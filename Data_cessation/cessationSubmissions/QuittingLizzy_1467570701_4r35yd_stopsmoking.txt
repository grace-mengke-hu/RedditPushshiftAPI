Day 4 - Hardest day yet, but getting through it!

Firstly I would like to thank everybody on this subreddit. I'm not exaggerating when I say I could not have got this far without the advice/encouragement that I've received, and seen others receive on here. Give yourselves a pat on the back :)


This has been one of the hardest things I've ever done. Going from smoking a pack and a half a day for the last 17 years to not touching a cigarette, and not having any nicotine for the last 4 days is something I didn't think I could do! 


I'm far from beating smoking altogether, I know that, even this morning I was contemplating having "just one" but I managed to see it off - I took my daughter swimming instead! 


Generally I feel quite under the weather, and I'm coughing a lot more now that when I was smoking for some reason, but it will all be worth it!

Least painful way to quit smoking

Hello,

I am asking this question for a loved one. He is above 80 years old. 

This person has been a chain smoker for all of his life. But for the past 4-5 years, his health is going down fast. I just want to know the least painful way to quit smoking. Even if it means it costs money. I can easily spend $1000-1200/month for the treatment. 

Please advice. 

edit: I am willing to pay money for the treatment/therapy of the said person, only. I am in no form or shape promising anyone with any kind of financial gain for their kind advise(s).

Update: 24 hours in to quitting nicotine/vaping

I think I will post some regular updates on here as to how my journey is going. 
 
I used to smoke previously, and went on to vaping. I used my vape way more than I used to smoke, and it’s just come to the time when I want to kick the addiction to nicotine all together.

I’m current still using my vape, but on 0mg juice. 
I’ve seen people state that they used their vape a lot more when going down to 0, but I’m having it the opposite way round. Because I know there’s no nicotine in it, I’m not reaching for it as often as I don’t get that buzz. 

I feel a little on edge but generally ok, the cravings keep coming but go a short while after. 
I’m trying to stop the craving by drinking water, so every time I feel the strong urge of needing nicotine, I’m drinking some water, which is making me need to pee a lot, but it works. 

What I am noticing, is I seem to be clenching my jaw a lot. Not too sure what that’s about. 

Anyway, I’ll have to see how I get on tonight. It is very hard and I am struggling a lot, but I feel that distracting myself is my best option.

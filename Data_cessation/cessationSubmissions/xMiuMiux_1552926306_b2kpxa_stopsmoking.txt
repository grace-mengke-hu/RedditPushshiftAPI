Should be around 2 weeks...

If I’m correct, it should be around 2 weeks since I’ve stopped having nicotine. I have to apply for jobs and try to hold myself together. 
I already have underlying depression and anxiety I’m treated for... it’s like my meds don’t even help now that I’ve quit nicotine.
I wake up with horrible brain fog, always feel hungover, not on top of things, nothing is stimulating at all, and most days I just want to die. I just nitpick everything wrong with me and have no attention span for anything.
I can’t see as well as I did with nicotine. Always out of focus.
I nearly put a hole through my door yesterday and then started hysterically crying.
I just got my period and although that’s bad enough for me, I feel like I have no control over myself and like quitting this time has been the worst I’ve ever had. I just can’t enjoy life or doing anything and I have no “feel good” emotions. 
I know I just posted here recently...
But my god. I don’t know how to actually handle living like this. On top of the hormones? I don’t... I don’t know. I can’t even engage in normal interactions with people. It’s easier for me to say, “I really can’t think of anything except how miserable I feel and like my brain is just completely mush now”. 

Just typing this out was hard. Words seem to kind of blur together and my eyes just constantly lose focus. 

I really wish I never started using nicotine... ever.

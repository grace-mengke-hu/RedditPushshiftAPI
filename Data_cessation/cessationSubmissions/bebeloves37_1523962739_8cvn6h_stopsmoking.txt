How do you manage anger?

I have found that my greatest trigger to smoke is when I get angry. It's so stupid but smoking is like a big f&amp;$! you to the world for me. It doesn't help that my husband doesn't want me to smoke and he is a big trigger for me as he can be kind of controlling. So how do you do anger management? I really haven't found much that helps me process this emotion. Any ideas would be much appreciated.

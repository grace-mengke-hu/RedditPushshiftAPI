Don't you love advice from someone that's never smoked a day in their lives?

I haven't quite got to my quit date and i lurk here often for motivation... I started a new job. We get a 15 min break every 2 hours. I take three 5 min breaks to go outside. 

One of my co-workers asks me why i keep going outside. I tell him to smoke. He immediately tells me how unhealthy it is and how he's never done it. Then proceeded to lecture me on how if i wanted to quit i could but i don't want too and its all in my head. I told him addiction is a mental battle yes but its also addiction to nicotine. He replies its all hog wash and im lazy.

Ugh. Its so annoying. Thanks bud. I already fight myself daily on this. Now I'm lazy too..

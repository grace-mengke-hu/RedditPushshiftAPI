48 hours in

... and my brain is playing those little "just have one" games. It's okay to just buy a pack and have one now and then... you can control your smoking now. You've gone 3 weeks and now again two days and you can smoke for pleasure and not need.

Ugh... I know better. I will not cave. I am a non smoker. I just had to come here and vent it out and hear some positive reinforcement.

Thank you!

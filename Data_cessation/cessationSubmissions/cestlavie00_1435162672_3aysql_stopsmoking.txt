7 days and it's hell

So, I finally managed to quit again after I had relapsed about 3 months ago. I was 2 months off the smokes, and it was great. I think I've never felt better in my whole life. So one night I got drunk as fuck and smoked a couple of cigarettes thinking that I won't smoke anymore. Yeah.. I started smoking the next day. Every day for the past three months I've been thinking about stopping again. And I finally did. 


So the first three days were.. kinda easy. First day I had some serious cravings but I endured. 2nd and 3rd day were mostly okay. I felt good and didn't have much cravings. Then on the 4th or 5th day I started thinking about smoking and I've been thinking about that for 3 days straight. First thought in the morning and the last thought in the evening are cigarettes. It's so hard thinking about it all of the time but no matter what I do I can't seem to stop.


So today, on the 7th day of my quit, I broke down  and went to grab a pack with a couple of cigarettes in it that my mom hid in the drawer which I accidentally stumbled upon some days ago. She'd already smoked them. There were no cigarettes... So I frantically searched the house. Not a single cigarette found. That was like an hour ago. I'm so relieved I had no cigarettes nearby, I'm so happy I didn't blow up my quit. But I'm scared and ashamed because I  CONSCIOUSLY decided to smoke in that moment of craving and weakness.. 


Anyways, I guess this was just a rant and I had to tell it to you guys since I've been lurking here for the past 3 months. I feel obligated to let you know I almost fucked up. I'll appreciate any and all words of advice and encouragement. I hope I won't come this close to relapsing again..

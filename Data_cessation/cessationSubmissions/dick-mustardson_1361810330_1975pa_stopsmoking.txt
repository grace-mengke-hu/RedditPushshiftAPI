100 Days! Some thoughts. 

It seems like so long ago that I quit. I'd look at people with triple digits on this sub and say "man, I wish I was there." Well, now I am. If you are like I was and really wanting to put these nasty things behind you, you can. I was a confirmed smoker and even though I had only smoked for about five years, I smoked about a pack and a half a day. I had resigned myself to the fact that I would probably die from some smoking related illness. I just thought I loved smoking so much. 

But I didn't really love it - and neither do you. That's your addiction speaking. I mean I have pretty awful willpower in general, but I was able to do this and it has brought out such a confidence and strength in me. If feels wonderful to be free, and to know that you have bought your own freedom is even better. When you quit, you begin to see what you are capable of doing, what else you are capable of improving in your life. You'll begin to take on goals that you had previously put off with smoking as a justification. "Once I quit cigs, I'll do x." 

So if you are thinking about stopping, do it now. Like I said, if I can do it you can. I used to be a nervous wreck on hour and a half long flights and during movies. Now I can just relax - which is something a smoker can never really do. 

So thank you to everyone who posts to this sub. You guys have been an inspiration.

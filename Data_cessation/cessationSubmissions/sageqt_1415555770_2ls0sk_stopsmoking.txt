Beware of the 1 week mark

I caved after a week. Just a warning to those trying to quit not to let your guard down and still expect tough times early on. I couldn't get it off my mind on day 6 and 7.

I feel like I would be better off quitting in a month or two, I have a pending court case right now that sorta stresses me out.

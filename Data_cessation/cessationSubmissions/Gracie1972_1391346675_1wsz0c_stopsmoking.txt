161 days free!!! Easier than I thought.

I quit 5 months ago.  I quit cold turkey after being hospitalized for pneumonia.  Which worked out good because I was so sick I didn't even crave a cig.  After I started feeling better my cravings came back but there was never a time that I seriously thought about smoking again.  I would just deal with that random craving and think...I can get this random craving or I can smoke and crave one every hour of every day.  So that was pretty much my mantra for never buying any cigarettes.  Even having a bad craving thinking maybe just one will be okay?  Nope.  Just starts the whole cycle.


I had also read Allen Carrs Easy way to quit.  I didn't quit immediately after reading it.  But I know I retained a lot of things I learned from it that have helped with my success.  Then I spent every day coming here to this subreddit for the first few weeks.  Without the support and motivation it would have been a lot tougher.  I don't come on as much as I used to.  Maybe once a week or so.  But when I do I come to this subreddit and check in with how everyone is doing.  Everyone needs support to kick this habit for good.  Good luck all of you quitting and thinking of quitting!!!!!   Life is pretty good as a non-smoker.

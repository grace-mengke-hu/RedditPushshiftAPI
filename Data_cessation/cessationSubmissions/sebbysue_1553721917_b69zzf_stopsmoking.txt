223 days and this one has been difficult!

I’ve had a hard day. I got upset with some friends. It was really no big deal but it became big for me. I don’t think I acted completely rational. I think I managed to hold it in enough that they didn’t think I was upset with them. Although I really was a little irritated. BUT I know it was not them it was the fact that I was craving a cigarette!! I’ve done so well and I’ve kept my emotions intact. But not today. But NOT ONE PUFF EVER!!! I will not do it. This too will PASS!

Pain/pressure heart area.

So i smoked for about 3/4 years. For the last 6 months or so i sometimes have this specially when i take a bigger breath but on occasions when i lay down to.
I stopped smoking a couple days ago and it feels a bit stronger. Anyone has experienced this?Is it normal for a smoker? I should go to the doctor but want to check out what you guys think anyway.

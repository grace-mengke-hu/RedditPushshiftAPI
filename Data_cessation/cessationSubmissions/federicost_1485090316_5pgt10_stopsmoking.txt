21yo, Erectile Dysfunction caused by smoke?

Hi, I'm 21yo and I smoke since I was 15yo, at that time few cigs but from then increased. In past I've had a lot of problems with women beacuse I couldn't have erections (and no, I was not anxious). I also checked my hormones but my doc said that those are fine. Is smoke the source of my problem also if I'm so young? 

Note: I go to gym 3 times a week

I'm sorry for any typo or mistke but English is not my first language. Thx for your help/opinion/time :)

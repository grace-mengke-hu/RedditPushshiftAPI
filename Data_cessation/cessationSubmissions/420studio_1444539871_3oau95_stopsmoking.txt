Just went to a party and didnt crave a cig. Extremely happy.

After 6 years of smoking almost a pack a day this is the second time I've quit and I feel like this may be the final time and I am off the cancer sticks for good. I went to a halloween party tonight and got pretty drunk to the point I had to take a cab home. what I am most proud of is I didn't really crave a cig while I was drinking. Others were smoking all around me but I just brought a water bottle with me and sipped on that whenever I was with them. I am ecstatic. I havnt told any of my friends that I quit or anyone really because I feel it's kind of stupid this early on but I feel like this time is the time I'm done.

After being depressed for the first week this has been the best night I've had in such a long time even when I was smoking. I have been reading everyone's posts here and they really help a lot so I hope mine can help someone else as well. and if not then so be it I am just so happy I went a night drinking and didn't cave in!

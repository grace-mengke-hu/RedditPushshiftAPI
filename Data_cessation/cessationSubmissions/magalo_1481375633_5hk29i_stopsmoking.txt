Been smoking for 1.5 years, constant phelgm?

Hi guys. 23F here.

Moved to Montreal, started smoking. I used to smoke clove cigarettes before they went illegal in august, now I just smoke regular cigs, I went from smoking 10 cigarettes a day and now I smoke about 20.

Not only it seem like I'm always sick, I get every cold that get by, and I cough pretty much all the time, but I've also been having CONSTANT phlegm build up in my throat. It's like it's always coated in mucus. Freaking drives me crazy. How normal is this? Is this something all smokers experiment or am I very unlucky??

Also wondering, for people that also had lot of phlegm, how quick did it clear up when you stopped smoking? Does smoking less helps?

Thank you

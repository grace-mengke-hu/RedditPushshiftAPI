another benefit ive noticed

been more or less smoke free for 5 weeks now, by more or less i mean i have smoked on the odd weekend, kept the demons at bay with niquitin minis, :) anyway i used to suffer terrible headaches and hangovers the day after as little as 4 beers but now i can drink as much as 8 beers and i wake up as fresh as a daisy, my body works so much better without the toxins from cigarettes in my blood, im loving this new found health :)

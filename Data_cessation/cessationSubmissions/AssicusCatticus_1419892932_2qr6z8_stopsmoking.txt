Hang in There!

For all of you who are struggling through your first few days/weeks/months of giving up this terrible habit, it gets better!  I've got nearly 220 days now, and I haven't craved a cigarette in a while.  I had forgotten all about counting the days until I came into this sub and saw my flair!

It gets better, just hang on!

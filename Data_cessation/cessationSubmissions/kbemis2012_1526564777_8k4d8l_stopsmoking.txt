I screwed up and need advice

I am 24 years old and have been a smoker for 4 years... 3/4 pack a day. I decided that I need to quit for a plethora of reasons (Why shouldn't one quit). Anyway, I quit on Saturday so I had been sober from cigarettes for 4 full days. Last night, I was in a really frustrating spot with my ex boyfriend and feeling really stressed and I caved an bought a pack. I have since then smoked 2 cigarettes - which I will say were both completely disgusting. Tasted gross, made me wonder what I am doing. I had a headache after both cigarettes. 

I am just wondering if anybody has any advice about how to move forward. I can accept that I have caved and smoked 2 cigs, that it's not the end of the world. But I would really like to prevent myself from sliding backwards and becoming a regular smoker again. 

Thanks in advance!!!

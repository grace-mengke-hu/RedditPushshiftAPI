Just dropping by

Just remembered about this sub reddit so figured come back and report on Im on day 176, and rarely even have urge to smoke. Lungs are still trying to adjust to the new physical activity level but seeing improvement.

For all those who are just starting to quit I promise it does get easier, you will feel better and just keep moving forward.

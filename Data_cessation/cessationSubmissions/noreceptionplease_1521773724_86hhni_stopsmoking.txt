Day 1 and this time I’m a little more aware of what’s to come. [Question]

Hi. 

Last year I went three months without smoking - it was amazing. But as it was my first time I was just kinda going with it and not expecting anything. This time I’m aware of all the weird social quirks I picked up - won’t answer phone (big smoking trigger), avoid friends, social engagements, coffee.... it also effected my work and how I approached it - I write. Has anyone experience they can share about breaking these weird habits or at I better just letting myself be weird for a while?

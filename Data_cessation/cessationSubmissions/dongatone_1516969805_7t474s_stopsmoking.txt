Determined

It has been 23 days today without smoking and is my first time writing here something. I have just found a  forgotten packet of cigarettes in a coat from the christmas eve. The first 15 days were the most craving days. If it was then I would definately think to smoke those cigarettes. Now i just throw them away. The only thing that bothers me is the 3-4 kg that i gained but with little exercise in will come back to normal. Not a single puff again, determined and strong!

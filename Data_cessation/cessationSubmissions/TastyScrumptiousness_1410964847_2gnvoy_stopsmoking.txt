Almost-fail...

Had a couple of glasses of champagne last night to celebrate other stuff going on in my life - of course, drinking is my absolute worst trigger, although I had kinda forgotten about that until I had the first sip and then immediately thought about how much I wanted a cigarette. I was with non-smokers so didn't mention it, but I wasn't able to stop thinking about smoking the whole evening - and when I got to the train station on my way home I'm ashamed to admit I walked straight into the shop to buy a pack, I wanted one so badly I just didn't care anymore. Luckily, there was a queue, which would have meant missing my train, so I walked back out again.

I'm glad today that I didn't smoke, but I still kinda feel like my willpower failed, because I know for sure that if there had been no queue in that shop I would have bought the pack and a lighter and sucked one down within like 2 minutes. Still a bit crave-y today but nothing as powerful as last night so I have persevered. So yeah, feeling kinda mixed today - happy I've hit 3 days but still kinda feeling like a failure that only pure chance stopped me smoking last night, rather my own strength of will. Anyone else have moments like that?

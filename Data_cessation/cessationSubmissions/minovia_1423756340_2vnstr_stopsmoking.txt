Would ya look at THAT!

I would never have thought I would be 43 days clean. Holy shit it blows my mind.

Going from pathetic, guilt filled weeks and weeks of quit and relapse I finally found my way. Shout out to fellow NYE quitters, you know who you are, let's stay strong. 

Please lend me words of encouragement friends.
It has been a tough ride, and I would be lying if I said I have not been craving like a motherfucker.
I can't help but crave the good feelings I associated with smoking, but I quickly dismiss them as bullshit :)

Like many others have said, thank you for this amazing community. You are all my non smoking family, let's come together and not smoke today.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

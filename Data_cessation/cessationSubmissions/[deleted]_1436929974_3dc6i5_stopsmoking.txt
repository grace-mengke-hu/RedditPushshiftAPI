I'm trying to gain weight, need testimonials

Hey everybody. I'm a 20yo male, i weigh around 136lb and i'm about 5'11. 

I've been smoking since i hit puberty and i've been unable to gain weight.

I'm aware that my metabolism should slow down in a few years but will ditching the darts help too? 

I'm really looking for replies from lanky dudes like myself as i know weight gain is common for quitters but i'm not sure if it'd affect someone of my body type. 

Thanks in advance and best wishes to all you taking the big step :)

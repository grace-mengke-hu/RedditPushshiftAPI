Caught myself thinking, "I used to have a cig now."

I realized that I'm at that point where I no longer identify myself as a smoker, and that was huge. Instead of the craving making me feel like *Oh god, I NEED A CIG NOW*, I regarded it as a thing of the past. I don't need a cig. I used to want them, but now I don't. 

I took some adderall today due to a stupid amount of work to finish this semester. I used to chain smoke like a mother fucker if I took adderall, but today when a big craving hit (possibly adderall amplified), I was still able to be straight-headed enough to remember that smoking was just something I used to do. Also, being on adderall without smoking is way more enjoyable, I don't feel like a big ole bag of dicks.

Anyway, just ranting. Feels good to be at this point. Stay strong friends! And stay gold, ponyboy.

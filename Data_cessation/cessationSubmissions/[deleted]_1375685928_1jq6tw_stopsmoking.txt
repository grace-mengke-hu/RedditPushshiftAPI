I turn to chain-smoking when I get angry or high levels of stress. Anger is normal for everyone...but stress-wise, I'm a police dispatcher. Help

I'm sure everyone can consider their job stressful... mine I'm afraid to make any worse because I don't want to let anyone down, officer or caller, and it's really discouraging me from quitting right now.

Every time I toy with the idea, or try to for a day, I circle back. An officer gets stabbed in the neck. One of our calls ends badly, or could've. And upon break time or end of shift I fly out the door to have my nicotine fix. 

I know, I know. Horrible excuse. But I don't really want to be more stressed out at my job and have it possibly effect my performance.

//endrant, anyone got any suggestions from a similar background...?

Just had a relapse

Quit cold turkey for about 80 days after smoking for 3 years. Thing were going good. Physically I felt better, but mentally, it was rough. Over the halloween weekend I had a couple cigarettes while drinking, I eventually caved yesterday, I couldn't fight the distracting urges, and I bought a pack.  I am a college student, and with the semester winding down now, I am overwhelmed with work. I am extremely disappointed with myself and don't know what to do. I am trying to stop again after this pack, but I know its easier said than done, and the withdrawals will be horrible, and even more distracting than before.  Guess I just wanted to post this to vent. As hard as it may be to fight the urges, don't be weak like me and cave. You WILL regret it.

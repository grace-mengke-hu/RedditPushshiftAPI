How do I start to quit?

So, I have been smoking for about 10 years, about a pack a day, sometimes more.  There are parts I really enjoy about smoking, but, I want to quit.  I subscribed here a while ago, but have not really read too much.  I was planting a seed I guess.
   If anyone could help motivate me, that would be awesome.  I am a swim coach, so no one really knows at work that I smoke, plus I can't really ask for support from them.  My two friends smoke, my Girlfriend smokes, so I'm reaching out to what seems like a group of people who can maybe give me some direction.
   Where do I start?  Get quit smoking app?  Is there a good book to read? (I am in school, so not much time to read a novel.)  How should I look at smoking differently to help me quit?

Thank you for your time if you read this!  Wish me the best!

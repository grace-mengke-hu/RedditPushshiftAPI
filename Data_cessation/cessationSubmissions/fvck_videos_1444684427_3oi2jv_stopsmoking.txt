good or bad idea?

I am on hour 33 of quiting. Yesterday I felt like a junkie with the chills, dizziness, and cravings. So anyway, my question is do you think it would be ok to take a hit off an ecig like blue when the cravings get really bad? I have never attempted to quit in 12 years, so this all is very new to me.

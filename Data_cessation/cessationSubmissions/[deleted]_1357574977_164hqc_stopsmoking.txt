Feeling good.

Fellow 2013 quitters, I hope you are all doing well! As each morning comes and each night ends, I feel better and better without smoking. You will too, if not today, tomorrow, or the next day, or next week, but I PROMISE you will feel better without smoking. It's like a new life. A nice, new, clean, HEALTHY life. Congrats to all of you who have made it this far! Today is day 7 for me and I feel damn good about it and you should too!

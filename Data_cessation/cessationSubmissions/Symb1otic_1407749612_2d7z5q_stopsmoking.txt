at which point do the positive things kick in?

I know I'm only at day 6 and maybe I'm just asking for the impossible right now but i read all of your stories every time i get the urge to smoke and all the stuff about having more energy, feeling better etc. etc. etc. doesn't really apply to me at the moment. 
i feel horrible most of the times, can't concentrate on my work, make mistakes that are simply stupid and such things. 
theres this little bastard inside of me saying that i have no reason to quit or that its easier/better to start smoking again and to be perfectly honest everyday that goes by without smoking i feel al little more that this little shit is right. 
any advice on how to approach this?

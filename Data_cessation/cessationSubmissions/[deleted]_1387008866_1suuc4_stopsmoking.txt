Smoking is another form of self abuse

I was doing really well, three days without a single cigarette. Have smoked for 15 years, quit for a few when I had my daughter. Feeling rejected after a shitty night of drinking, so I just went to the store and bought a pack to punish myself. Now feeling terribly guilty and like I ruined the passed few days of progress, over stupid feelings of inadequacy. I deserve better. Quitting is fucking hard.

Never underestimate this sub

I'm 38 days in and I've been craving crazy for the past couple of days. 

I'm not making a big deal out of it, I can survive. But every time I revisit this sub, the cravings are increasingly more manageable.

Load up this sub whenever you crave a smoke... See the relapse posts and feet grateful. See the success posts and motivate yourself. I promise, it works!

I need to fucking quit.

I've been a smoker for a little over 2 years. It started off as a every now and then thing, but it has grown into a pack a day addiction. 

I'm tired of always feeling like shit and barely being able to ride my bike for longer than 20 minutes. I'm also sick of lying to my girlfriend about how i'm quitting, and hiding the fact that i still smoke about a pack a day from her. She is at the point where she's about ready to leave if i don't quit. I'm not going to lose my girlfriend over a stupid fucking addiction that is going to kill me eventually. I'm ready to actually do this. 

I know this isn't going to be easy but I'm going to give it all I got. I'm going to need some support to get me through this, so i will be hanging around here for a while.

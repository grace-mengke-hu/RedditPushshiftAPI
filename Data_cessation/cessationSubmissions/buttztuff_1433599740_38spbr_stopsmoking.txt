Is it best to mentally prepare yourself/set a date when quitting?

I've wanted to quit for a long time, have tried cold turkey (spontaneously) and always end up relapsing after a week or two. I recently read that it's easier to quit if you plan it and set a date (as in, "two days from now I'll stop smoking/will be the last day I have a cigarette") in order to mentally prepare.

As anyone here done this? Or have most of you just decided 'today's the day'? If you have, is it *more* effective/easier, or does it not really even matter?

Thanks!

Quit drinking 40 days ago. Quit smoking 25 minutes ago.

I'm 27 and have been smoking for 12 years. For the first time in my life, I have decided to quit.

Quitting drinking has been easy with a great support system and an antidepressant.

Not smoking is going to be tough. All of my friends and most of my family smoke. I'm rewatching Mad Men. 

I'm armed with gum, patches, and inhalers, and my goal is total abstinence from cigarettes.

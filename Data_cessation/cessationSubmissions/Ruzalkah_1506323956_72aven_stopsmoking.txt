Trying to quit but my husband isn't ready to quit

My husband and I are on/off smokers but this time around he's been smoking for about a year. I picked up the habit again big time at BLC (Army leader's course for NCOs) in August and haven't been able to totally shake it. I'm down to about two cigarettes a day, and I feel anxious and guilty afterward every time. If my husband didn't smoke, I would have no trouble quitting Bc they wouldn't be in the house and I don't go buy them myself. We don't have the kind of marriage where we dictate rules and ultimatums to each other and we have both expressed to one another that I need to quit and I want him to quit but I get that he's not ready yet. I suppose it's just going to take more discipline and mental focus on my part.

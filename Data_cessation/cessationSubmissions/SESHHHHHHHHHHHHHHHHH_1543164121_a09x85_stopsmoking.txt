Five cigarettes left, gonna make my best effort when they're gone

I've smoked every single day since one of my buddies got me my first pack back on my 16th birthday. I'm 21 years old now and I can already tell how much it's affecting my health. I have heart disease on both sides of my family, my Dad had one heart attack and my Mom has survived three. 

Not only do I just find it to be a nasty habit, but it's becoming one that I cannot afford financially or physically. I've been going through *a lot* lately and these couples minutes of peace I get stepping outside for a drag have been my crutch. 

Any and all advice/support you guys could provide me with would be appreciated. I've struggled with substance abuse all my life, and I've been able to fight off all my demons (things like MDMA, pills, etc) except this one. Probably because it's legal, but I digress. 

Thanks in advance for anyone who reads this far. Hope everyone is doing well today!

Something funny happened today

During lifetime smoking I was a smoker of a particular brand of cigarettes who NEVER and I mean never sent me coupons through the mail. I had signed up for them several times through their website and through reps at my local gas station.
I’ve been smoke free for a week now and I go to check the mail and low and behold there are two coupon booklets for said cigarettes in the mailbox. 
I’ve already threw them in the trash but I found it hilarious that they finally sent me coupons when I no longer had a need for them.

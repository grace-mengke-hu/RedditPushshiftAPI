Almost broke down

Went to the 7-11. My intention was to purchase a pack of cigarettes, withdraw one, destroy the rest of the pack.

Go to the counter. See an advert for nicotine gum. A quote catches my eye, "Every cigarette less is a victory." I stare at it dumbfounded for a moment.

I buy a candy bar and leave.

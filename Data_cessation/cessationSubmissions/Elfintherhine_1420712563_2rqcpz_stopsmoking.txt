I need help quitting!

It was only six hours without a cigarette before the anxiety started kicking in. Eight hours without and I started munching on anything I could to keep my mouth busy. Eight and a half when I started getting bitchy. 

It got so bad that I raided my ash tray for tobacco and rolled a pin thin cigarette about ten minutes ago. I have reached a new low with how far I would go for a smoke. 

I've tried e-cigarettes, meds that while moderately effective soon became too expensive,  inhalers that seem to make my mouth numb,  nic gum (same results as the inhalers, and found that I am allergic to the adhesive on the patch. 

I started smoking when I was nine and quit cold turkey at fifteen. When I reached twenty-one I started up again and haven't been able to stop. 

What do I do? I don't want to be the loser that goes through ashes (even if they are just mine) just for a hit of nicotine.

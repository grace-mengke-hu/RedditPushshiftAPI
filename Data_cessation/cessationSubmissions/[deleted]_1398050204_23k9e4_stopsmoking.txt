First Legitamate Badge! Hit 1 month on 4/20!

So I've quit and relapsed so many times I've lost count. And every time I quit I reset my badge but then I releapse and just let my badge go so I've had many badges that are 3 months or 7 months that weren't really truthful. However I have quit and am going strong and I finally have a legitimate badge reach that wonderful 1 month star. Stay strong my fellow quitters! It feels amazing to have reached this point!

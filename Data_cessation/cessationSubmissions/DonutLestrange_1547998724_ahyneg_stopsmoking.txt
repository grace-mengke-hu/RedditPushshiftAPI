67 days.

67 days and still “going strong” very minimal cravings sporadically but strangely enough when I get them I’m now trying to reason with myself as to why I’m trying to tell myself it’s been this long, one won’t hurt, I won’t get addicted again, and wondering what it would be like to have just one.

I’m still on patches, another few days and I’ll step down to 7mg. Hoping for the best after completely off nic and seriously contemplating using bandaids after as a psychosomatic thing as I still wear them through the night and when I don’t I wake up cranky and anxious.

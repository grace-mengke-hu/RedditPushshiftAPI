Depression and assholes

Hey Peeps


So I'm on day 2 now and I am feeling extremely depressed, normally I'm a fighter I don't just give up for now reason but this has knocked me on my ass. I feel like I wanna crawl into a corner and just cry myself to sleep. My "friends" are laughing and joking with me like its the funniest thing they've ever witnessed. Pointing out half smoked cigs when we walk somewhere and suggestions like "oh so and so has go a Marlborough for you *wink wink*" Its gotten to a point where I'm just rude and fed up and swearing at all my "friends". I don't know what else to say..... I'm just.... like this :(

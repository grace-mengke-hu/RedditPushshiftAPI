First full day without a cigarette was July 1. I think I drunkenly had one drag a week or two ago and I feel really bad.

I was very drunk and a friend was smoking in my apartment (even though we've been making him smoke outside since my bf and I quit. everyone was so drunk so i'm not mad at him or anything), but I took one drag of a cigarette that night. Just one. I told my bf about it the next day (we're both quitting) and he said to not worry about it. I haven't done it again even though I have been plenty drunk and also had plenty of opportunities. I don't want to smoke ever again. Ever. I've had cravings, but they're mostly gone at this point. I sort of feel like a hypocrite looking at my "smoke free for..." thing in my quit smoking app and just now I messaged badgebot asking for a badge that says I haven't smoked since July 1st. 

Idk what I'm asking exactly. I finally made a reddit account that isn't associated with me anywhere else on the internet and finally decided to post this.

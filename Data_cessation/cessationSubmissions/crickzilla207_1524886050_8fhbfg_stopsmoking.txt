10 years, most of which well over a pack a day, and Im ready.

I just looked up 'quit smoking' for subreddits, found you lovely people and figured since all of my friends smoke, I could get everything off my chest and the best support/advice from here. Dont really know how long this will be since I'm writing it on the fly, apologize in advance if it turns into a novel. 
I started smoking at 18 to get my mum to quit. She had tried a few times, each one a little longer than the rest. I figured if her son picked it up, at the legal age, and told her I would quit when she did that it would be the kick in the ass she needed. The title says how well that worked out for me. 
I tried to quit cold turkey two years ago when I found out my girlfriend of five years was pregnant, that lasted a few days. The day she was born and held her in my arms for the first time I quit for a few more days, but screaming babys really spike up that anxiety and rage. A few months ago I went at it again, this time taking a different approach and cutting back to five a day for a few days, then two, then none. Made it a week and a half.
I currently live in an apartment in downtown of an area I've lived all my life. A few days ago I made the decision that I really want to finally get a house out in the woods like the one I grew up in as a kid to raise my family in. I also realised that I'm going to need to save money to do so and if I want to see my beautiful baby girl grow up and run around the house with her that I'm going to need to start taking care of myself. So I made the decision. The time to quit is here. I will no longer be a slave to this terrible monster I have descended upon myself. Only thing is, I have no idea how to go about it.
What are the big things y'all recommend? And what worked for you?

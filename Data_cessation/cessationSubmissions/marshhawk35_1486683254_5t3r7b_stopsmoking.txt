This is probably the 30th time I've quit

Nothing like feeling like a failure, right? Smoking has ruined my life. 

Honestly I do only have myself and my addiction to blame. But sitting here on day 1, crawling out of my skin and nauseated like crazy - I am wondering how I will stay quit when my boyfriend, who I live with, smokes all the time and will only stop when he dies from it. 

I feel like I have no escape and I resent him for it.

Or maybe I'm just super fucking gloomy because it's day 1.

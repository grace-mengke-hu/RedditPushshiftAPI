I've personified my addiction, and I think it helps.

So...I'm way too into video games, fantasy novels, movies, role-playing, did the whole D&D and magic card thing.  
  
I imagine that's why picturing my addiction as this smoky, gray-black, spiked serpent inside of me was so easy. When I smoke, I feed it. Quitting cold turkey, withdrawals are angry spasms from this thing inside me.  
  
So now, quitting with a patch, I'm seeing this serpent-addiction go from smokey gray-black to clear, it's spines smoothing out, it dying out, more like it is withering away in a sort of comatose state. I doubt he'll ever be gone, but at some point, there will be less of this serpent-addiction, and more of me.  
  
Every so often it will wake up and lunge a dulled spine into me, and I will find the urge to rummage through the apartment for my roommate's smokes, but I've done a good job of realizing the danger there, and getting out.  
  
I'm not crazy for thinking of it this way, am I?

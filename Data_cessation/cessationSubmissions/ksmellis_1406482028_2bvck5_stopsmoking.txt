First Real Challenge Since Quitting

I'm on day 3 without any nicotine products, and as fortune would have it, my boyfriend and I broke up this morning(it's been in the process for a while now, so no huge surprise.)

My first instinct was to think about the smoke I would have once he drove away. I almost always followed up our arguments with a personal smoke. It would have been partially to spite him since he hated that I smoked, and partially to deal with the stress. BUT! Thanks to YOU wonderful people here at /r/stopsmoking, I decided that the best way to both spite the son of bitch and deal with my stress would be to write this post and then go for a jog, showing that I'm strong without him AND on my way to getting a cut bod. Who needs cigarettes? Not me. Who needs a man who doesn't make them feel good? Certainly not me.

Post here instead of smoking any time that you have a craving.

Hopefully more people than just me can use this. I don't want a cigarette right now, but I wanted one earlier. I know I'll want one in a few hours. But right now I'm going to set this thread up so other people can be encouraged to post here each time they have a craving and do this post instead of lighting up a cigarette!!  
  
  
Post here when you want a cigarette. Say something like, "I want to have a cigarette right now, but I'm NOT going to smoke one because I want ____________ instead."

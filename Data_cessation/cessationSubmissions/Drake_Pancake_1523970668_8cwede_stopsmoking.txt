How to avoid triggers / alternatives to smoking?

22 years old. Smoked 1/2 packs per day for 3 years.  There was a time where I quit for a solid 8 months but relapsed after breaking up with my narcissistic girlfriend.  The hardest part for me is avoiding triggers (drinking, after meals, during study breaks- Iâ€™m in professional school, etc.).  

What alternatives to smoking did you use when faced with these common triggers?

I just quit again after blowing a year and a half smokeless streak.

I smoked for 6 years and quit for a year and a half. I started smoking again at parties and bumming smokes occasionally. I let my guard down and was surprised how quickly I hit a pack a day again. Never let your guard down don't think you can have just one when you're out drinking and be fine. I am one week without a cigarette it's just as hard to quit the second time. Be careful out there.

Requesting Advice/Help

I am a 20 year old college student who has decided to quit smoking entirely. I've been smoking about a pack a day for four years now, and it needs to stop. 

My chief problem here is that, during withdrawal, I don't just get irritated or get cravings - I feel like my mind is completely clouded and like I can't think whatsoever. I have four research papers to write and am preparing two papers for conference presentations. I simply do not see how I can possibly try and quit smoking right now with all of this going on. I am not exaggerating when I say that not smoking for 2+ hours makes me feel functionally braindead. 

I'm sure that there have been other people who have quit smoking under similar conditions. What can I do to quit when not smoking completely destroys my mental faculties?

Thanks in advance!

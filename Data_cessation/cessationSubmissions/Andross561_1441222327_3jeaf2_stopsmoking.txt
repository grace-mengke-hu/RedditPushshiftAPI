I'm a smoker again

Hi everyone, I'm here because I have fallen victim to smoking again. I have no excuse but I'm scared I will become a heavy smoker again. Currently it's only a couple a week for the past month or so. Last time I was able to stop cold turkey but I'm worried I won't be able to again. I'm thinking of buying the easy way, and trying again after I'm done this book. Thoughts? Suggestions? Failure is very discouraging but I know it happens to a lot of folks and I just need to pick myself back up again.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and encouragement. I know I can do this again and I will beat this addiction! At this point there are so many people to reply to I can't keep up. But thank you everyone. My first quit that lasted 4 months was mostly because of this sub. I need to reinvest myself here and try any and all means necessary. Let's not smoke today!

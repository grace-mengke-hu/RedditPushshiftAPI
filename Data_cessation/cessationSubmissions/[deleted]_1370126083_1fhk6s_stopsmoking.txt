Day 4 and cravings are worse than ever.

This is my first time trying to quit smoking, I've successfully just reached 4 days without a single cigarette. 


However, the night of the 3rd day and the 4th day so far and I've been having the worst craving ever, like EVER. 


I haven't caved yet and I've read Car's book and I know that the physical nicotine addiction should be somewhat subsiding now, but I know it wont get easier. I keep reminding myself that i want to be a non-smoker and I'm not giving anything up, quite the opposite actually, but still, can't help but be a bit crave-y. 


Sorry for sidetracking but I'm just wondering if this is going to get better, or what? Or if anyone else has experienced anything a long these lines.

First week without cigarettes after 5 years of smoking

I started smoking at age 19 when I started working at a bar. Throughout college I lived with all smokers and never was able to quit for this long. Although I am using a Juul pod for nicotine, my lungs feel better already. I honestly can breath through each nostril again, no constant cough, and no constant sinus headache. 

For everyone who started in college and didn't think it would be a problem to give up after: Quit now. I graduated two years ago and I'm finally now on the right mindset to quit. Don't tack on this extra time.

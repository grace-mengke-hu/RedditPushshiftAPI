I just smoked

I'm 19, been smoking for 2 years. I've only been smoking habitually (over 5 a day) for the last year. I told myself I'd never be a pack a day smoker and in the last couple months i've been getting close, i smoke a pack in like 2-3 days now on average. I think about quitting every time i smoke and have had a bunch of half-assed attempts to quit over the last year. 2 days ago I got up the nerve and felt extremely determined to quit. yesterday was really hard and today was even harder. I only now realize how addicted I am. I have so many triggers, even listening to music makes me crave. In the last few hours all i could think about was smoking and all my reasons to quit suddenly seemed so pointless and stupid. I know that's just the addicted part of my brain but I got to the point where I felt like i couldn't prove it wrong. So i just smoked and although i no longer feel the withdrawals i don't feel any happier. I feel ashamed and stupid and it seems like i was really close to the threshold of breaking through the addiction when i gave in. I don't really know what kind of advice i'm looking for but i feel like I don't really have it in me to quit at this point in my life and i know it'll only get harder as time goes on. 

edit: after a few minutes now i already want to smoke again and i now actually feel reinvigorated to quit because it will never be enough and i gain nothing from it.

Stopped during holidays, shit hit the fan when I came home

I smoked my last cig on Dec 25, on the first day of a 8 day vacation.  Things were great, I had very few cravings,even went full days without one. 

I cake home yesterday and it was the worse day by far. I had to take a couple nicotine gum to cope. 

I guess this is expected since I met all my triggers at once. What can I do to ease this?

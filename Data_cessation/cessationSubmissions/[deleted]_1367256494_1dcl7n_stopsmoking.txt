Nice try, troll-brain.

"Hey, congratulations on making it 10 days without smoking.  You should reward yourself with a cigarette!"


Fuck off, troll-brain.    


"Hey, you're having a rough time.  You should ease the stress."


Yeah, a great fucking idea.  Let me ease my stress by adding a stressful addiction to my life.  



"You're just going to end up replacing your nicotine addiction with alcohol.  It's better to be a smoker than an alcoholic."


Nope, not going to work.  Try again.  I'm on to your shit.

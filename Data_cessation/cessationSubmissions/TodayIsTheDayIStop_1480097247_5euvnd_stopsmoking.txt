Today is The day

I am 21 years old and have had a history of pneumonia ever since I was little. (Mostly in the harvesting seasons). I'm a bit weird to how I ended up getting addicted to nicotine. In high school during freshmen year me and my friends were sold a mini hookah from some guy at a stand in the mall. Every day we would smoke that thing after school and let me tell you the buzz I got back then was INSANE. Well eventually when our hookah broke we all turned to Cheyenne wild cherries cigarillos, this turned into me stealing marblo light 100s from my parents everyday before school. (I hated this so much the guilt/addiction to nicotine drove me crazy). Freshmen year of college I was a pack a day smoker of the cowboy killers marblo reds. I then was introduced to vaping I loved everything about it, The flavor, the throat hit, the satisfaction I got from not having to smoke cigs. Well now I can honestly say I am heavily addicted to vaping. I have it with me at all times during the day and I hate it. The past few months my body has felt really weird and I went and got blood drawn and the results will be in today. (fingers crossed) Last night my vape also nearly exploded in my hand and that was the final straw. Having my body not feel well and never knowing if this thing is gonna explode and cause me harm is just something I do not want. So today is the day I retake control of my body. Looking forward to getting to know you guys and any tips would be great! 

Also sorry if this text is poorly put together typing up long paragraphs on my phone is not an easy task for me apparently.

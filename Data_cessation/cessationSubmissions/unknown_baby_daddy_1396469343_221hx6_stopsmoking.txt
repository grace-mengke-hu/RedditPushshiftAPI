I think I'm over the hump, AND its hump day.

Today marks the third day I have completely abstained from nicotine. I have smoked 10 or more cigarettes a day for a decade, and this week I finally ballsed up and kicked my biggest weakness in its stinking ass!

I feel freaking amazing!  My complexion has improved pretty drastically, my mood and anxiety levels are way better and more consistent, AND I don't smell like an ashtray any longer.

I found that quitting was very easy mentally once I wanted it bad enough.  The physical withdrawals have been a bitch, worst part is that I have been getting really bad sleep (im also out of town in a hotel so that doesn't help).  Im freaking exhausted today, but my spirit shines with the strength of 1000 suns.  THIS SUB IS WHAT REALLY MADE ME DO IT!!!!!   I was scared to take the leap without a support group but just going through and reading all your posts motivated me and I DID IT! I really appreciate you guys and I hope I can pay it forward to some one one day.

I know its not over, and there will be hard times and temptation...  I just cant see myself going backwards after getting through the initial withdrawal period, but I know its possible so Ill continue to motivate myself.  Does anyone have tips on how to sleep better?  I literally am tired in the daytime, then I come back and have a beer or two and cannot get to sleep for the life of me.  Has this happened to any one else?  Does it last long?  Thanks and love!

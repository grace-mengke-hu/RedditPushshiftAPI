Sometimes God Uses a 2x4

On mobile, but will be hitting up the desktop site to reset my badge. I have made a few quit attempts since setting my badge the last time, none of them lasting more than a few days. Well, I prayed really hard about it yesterday. Told God that I was willing to really try this time, but I desperately needed some divine intervention, because I can't do it alone. The check engine light came on in my car. Stopped by the dealership to have it looked at. Turned out to be something covered by my warranty, so no big deal. However, it will take a couple days to get fixed, so I got a loaner in the meantime. I can't smoke in the rental. And by the time I get my car back, I will be past the initial 3 days of hell. I've got a few more left in this pack. Didn't buy anymore on the way home. God apparently has my back in this, so here I go.

Help me help my girlfriend

Hi, /r/stopsmoking! 

I just recently met up with my girlfriend today and when we kissed, I noticed a very distinct taste in her mouth. I'm not a smoker, but her mouth tasted like  how some cigarettes smelled. It wasn't the first time I found this taste in her mouth but it was the first time I decided to confront her about it because she told me she gave up smoking for good. 

She confessed that she had started taking nicotine supplements. Something to put in the mouth that helps stave off cigarette cravings on stressful days. She felt bad about it and immediately threw the supplements out. I asked her not to because I believe it helps, but she says it's as good as smoking anyway because it has nicotine and tar too. Are these things like that? 

How do I help her in this situation? Should I give her space or should I be proactive about this? 

What are the best ways to get her to stop her reliance on this substance? 

I wish all of you in this sub the best in your endeavors to quit smoking too. I just want to remind all of you that there are people around you that love you so much and want you to be healthy. Please be strong! 

Much love.

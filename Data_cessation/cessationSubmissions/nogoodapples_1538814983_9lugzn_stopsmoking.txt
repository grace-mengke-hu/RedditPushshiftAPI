Two weeks now.

I started smoking about six years ago, and I’ve been a pretty consistent pack a day smoker, stopped smoking for a year or so and picked up vaping, and now I’m two weeks (cold turkey) without any nicotine. 

It’s made a little more difficult by the fact that I’m currently sitting in Iraq right now.  

I’ve read a few things about depression being a common side effect of nicotine withdrawal, and over the past few days it’s hit hard.  I’m sure having mental health issues run in my family probably doesn’t help matters much, but did anyone else experience this?

I’m two weeks today without any nicotine.  I’m sure it varies from person to person, but any advice is welcome.

Curious and a little scared...

I've been using the patch for seven weeks.  Monday I stepped down to the 7mg.  I'm curious to hear from other patch users and a little scared, because I fear not doing the morning routine of putting on a new patch will leave me missing something all over again.  Am I just over thinking this?Luckily, and believe it or not I didn't plan it this way, my first day off the patch will be my first day on vacation in Florida.  I'm hoping that will be a huge help.  Any input would be appreciated!

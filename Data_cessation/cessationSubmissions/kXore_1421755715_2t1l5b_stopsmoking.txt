100 days

When i first quit smoking, i thought "Man, i'd be lucky to make it a week". But here i am now, over 3 months strong, can't even remember what smoking feels like. You can make it as far as i did, all you need is determination. Good luck to any new quitters, old quitters, shit even if you still smoke, good luck anyway.

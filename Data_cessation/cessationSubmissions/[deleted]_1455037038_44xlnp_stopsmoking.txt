Day 2. So easy this time around.

Don't get me wrong, I want nicotine. But for some reason it's not nearly as bad as it usually is when I try to quit. I'm just a little annoyed. Nothing is really driving me to go get cigarettes.

I saw that picture of Bryan on whyquit and I think I scared myself straight to be honest. Saw that picture and haven't smoked since. This wasn't a planned quit.

I just can't die like that.

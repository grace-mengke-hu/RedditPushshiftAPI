Damn the series Narcos!

So I only smoked for a few months before realizing that I was gonna dig myself into a ditch if I kept it up. I quit, no biggie.

But god *damn* does watching the (excellent) series Narcos make me wanna go grab a pack. Everyone is always smoking! And they make it look so casual and enjoyable too. Came here to dissuade my temptations, which I think I've done, just had to get this off my chest.

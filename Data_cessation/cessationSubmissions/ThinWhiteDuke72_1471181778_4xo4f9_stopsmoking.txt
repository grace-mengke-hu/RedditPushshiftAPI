Day 6. Hardly any cravings. Allen Carr + Zyban = easiest quit ever. So thankful.

I smoked for 25 years and I've quit here and there for short spells but it wasn't until I read Allen Carr that I really understood what smoking and quitting was all about.  I almost feel guilty because I haven't really struggled much at all.  Still, I'm proud for making it through five days nicotine free.

36 hours and my eye is twitching

I quit drinking 201 days ago and can't remember the withdrawals, but this feels worse. I can't find my vape pen, my neck hurts, my jaw keeps popping, my eye is twitching, I keep raising my voice at my kids over stupid shit, I am FIENDING, and feeling guilt for bugging my husband at work to talk me off the ledge from going down the block and just buying a pack to quit this damn twitchy, itchy, spastic, cranky, awful feeling so I can be normal enough to get through the day. Logically, I know I'm being ridiculous, but I can't seem to be logical. I need some support, guys. Remind me why we go through this and what is on the other side of withdrawals. Thanks!

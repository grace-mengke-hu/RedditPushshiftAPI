I quit smoking about a month ago, and I don't feel any different.

Currently 28 y.o. Pack a day smoker (sometimes 1.5) for 6 years, quit cold turkey about a month ago. I don't feel even a little different. Breathing is the same, exercise is the same, smelling and eating is the same. Which is to say, none of those things really bothered me before, but I still thought they would improve after I quit. Its left me sorta frustrated, and I'd like to hear anyone's thoughts on whats going on. Did my youth blunt the normal bad effects of smoking? Did I smoke so much that there were no tissues left to recover?

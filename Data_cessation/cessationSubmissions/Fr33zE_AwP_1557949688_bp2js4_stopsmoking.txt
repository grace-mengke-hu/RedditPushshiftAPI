Quitting after 12 years

Hey guys I have been smoking for the last 12 years 10-15 cigarettes a day and about 3 days ago I decided it’s time to stop. Set my cold turkey date to May 16 2019. I’ve planned on having coffee when cravings hit since I’ve not had coffee since the start of the year. Wish me luck.

Day 13, setting some rewards for stopping

Not posting that much anymore because well it's going pretty good! Still getting cravings often but I will not succumb, I set some proper rewards for myself when I make it to certain points so that helps a lot too! 

1st month I will get myself a 1x12" guitar cabinet, 2nd month a 3d printer, 6th month a nice vacation, 12th month way too expensive guitar. Since I'm super bad with money this actually helps only buying a couple things every month instead of emptying my bank account :)

Hopefully this helps someone else as well.

Day 5 - I don't really know why I stopped, but I did!

So, I'm on day five of a cold turkey quit.  I've tried many times before and barely made it past a day without crumbling to the craving for nicotine.

I had one cigarette left in a packet on Sunday morning, had it with my first coffee of the day and then just didn't buy any more.  The craving still comes and goes at certain times but looking at a few sites, this is likely to continue for a while yet.

I think having a double dose of flu over the last few weeks has helped to reduce my need as I've been much less likely to go outside in the cold to have a smoke whilst feeling ill.

Money's been an issue recently, so I think keeping track of how much I haven't wasted on cigarettes is going to be a little more of an incentive.

The worst bit about this is that my wife, who has bitched at me for so long about smoking has not offered a word of support as things haven't been that great recently.  This makes it equally surprising that I haven't reverted to cigarettes as an emotional crutch!!

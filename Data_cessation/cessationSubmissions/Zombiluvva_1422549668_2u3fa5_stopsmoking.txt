I need some help

Really struggling with this. I've been sick since I quit - continual head colds, sore throat, sneezing. I don't sleep well now and wake up with a stuffed up head every am. It's been a very long 24 days. I'm trying to keep positive but I'm  just getting it hard. I know it's better not to smoke. But when does this get better?

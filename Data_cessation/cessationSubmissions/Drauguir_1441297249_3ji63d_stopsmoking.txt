Yesterday was terrible (never let your guard down)

I never thought I would suffer such a terrible craving 27 days after my last cig. The day before yesterday I slept very bad, had nightmares and stuff. So the next day I went to work very tired and sleepy. Then I remembered that in days like this, I used to smoke much more cigs than average to "wake me up". Yeah, it's silly, but the thing is I was all day fighting against this urge.

Today I feel much better and I'm very proud I overcame the worst craving I've had since quitting. Just letting you know NEVER let your guard down. Beware of possible triggers that might make you want to smoke.

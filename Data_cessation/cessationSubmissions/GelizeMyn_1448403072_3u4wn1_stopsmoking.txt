2 weeks and aint going back

Some months ago I posted "6 days and still going strong", it didnt went as well as it should have. 

Now I am back, and by 25/11 I have not smoked for 2 weeks. 2 weeks ago I smoked a cigarette, just to "celebrate" that I hadnt done it for 1 week. But I feel like it was my first smoke, I nearly threw up :O

I got no taste for it anymore. I dont see the point, it is money out the window. And I also want to get back running, doing things like that!

I am walking with you all

How do I beat this super trigger?

I’ve been smoke free for 4 days but I have a trigger that’s always been really hard to break. I always, ALWAYS smoked after completing a chore or some kind of work around the house as a reward. After tidying up or cleaning, organising spaces, building something or fixing something. This is the one thing that I think is going to be the hardest to resist. What can I do to make it easier?

I am drunk right now. In a post a !!few!! hours ago, I said I can't think of ever wanting cigarettes again. It's hillarious, but now I do.

And of course I won't smoke. These are just withdrawal symptoms - they just took longer to show for me. 

You know what?! I am so glad I can drink beer and Vodka right now, and not need to have a smoke. I would feel bad, smell bad, would be hooked up again (obviously haha), and my head would hurt as fuuuuck. But now I will only shit a bit less uncomfortable the next day. That's it. 











There's no need to fucking smoke. I'm so glad I understood that. If I did smoke right now.... I would be so done I couldn't finish these comment. Right now I am able to enjoy my buzz:) cheeers you fuckin faggots, who try to quit, but light one up, only because you're drunk. But I understand you. I did the same several times. It feels good, to be onn the secure side.

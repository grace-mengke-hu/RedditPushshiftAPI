Mid 30’s, smoked for over 20 years, 20 attempts to stop - but this time = easy!! The key for me was two things. First - champix - it was amazing 10/10 would recommend. Secondly it was to properly and fully understand that I wasn’t giving anything good up. I’ve gained health, wealth and a happy wife.

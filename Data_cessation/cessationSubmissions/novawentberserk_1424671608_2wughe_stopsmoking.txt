Question about a quitting cold turkey urban legend.

I've recently quit cold turkey and developed an itchy feeling in my throat. I did some googling and came across some sites that claim that quitting CT is a shock to the system for long-term smokers, and that the cells go into healing over-drive and become quickly cancerous. These sites and their members recommend cutting back slowly. 

I know it sounds stupid but...still. Cancer. Its scary and I have to ask.

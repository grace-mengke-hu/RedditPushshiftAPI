Should have tried harder these last 13 years

Well I decided today I was ready to do this. Already I've lost 70 pounds since 2012, and haven't smoked marijiuana in 3 weeks at least, which has been a daily addiction for me. Now I will take on cigarettes. 

What amazes me is that at first I told someone Oh I'm going to try and quit smoking again, for about the 100th time... then I thought about it. I've been smoking cigarettes since about 14, I'm 27 now... and really I've only even tried to quit maybe 5 times. I'm shocked with as much as I've wanted to be a non smoker I havent even tried more often. 

This time is different, I don't need to kill cravings, I don't need to eat something or chew gum, all I need to do is make up my mind and be strong. 

BTW: This is my first ever post on reddit :)

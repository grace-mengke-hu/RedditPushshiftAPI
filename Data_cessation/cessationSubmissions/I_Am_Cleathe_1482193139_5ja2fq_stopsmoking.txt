Question about nicotine patches

Good evening r/stopsmoking

I hope you're all doing well in your journey of quitting smoking! I have a few questions to those of you who have used nicotine patches, or other similar products: 
-What type of product did you use?
-Did you find that it actually helped you with quitting smoking and reducing your cravings?
-Did you get any negative side affects of using that product?
-Woukd you reccomend this product to others who are also trying to quit smoking?
-What other methods did you find to be useful when quitting smoking?

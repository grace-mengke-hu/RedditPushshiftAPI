Need help quiting

I've tried many many countless times and just gave up, for the last 3 months I've been having at least 8-13 a day. I've tried apps, nicotine gum, vaping but nothing works I always fall back. Even though I'm not legally able to buy them which you think it would be easier to quit I still cant. Please help me out with some advice.

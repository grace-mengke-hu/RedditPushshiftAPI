365 days today :)

This subreddit deserves my thanks especially for the support during those first few weeks, so I thank you /r/stopsmoking !

For those of you just starting out, know that after a couple weeks it gets easier and easier. Somewhere around 100 days or so, you begin to lose track of/concern over the number of day since you quit. It continues to get easier thereafter.

Don't be discouraged by lapses. It often takes more than one try to get it right for many people.

I'm confident that I am free from the addiction this time around, but respect the power it once had over me enough to know to remain vigilant.

Best of luck to you all and keep up the great work!

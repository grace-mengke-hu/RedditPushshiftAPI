5 days so far

I've been smoking for 25 years.  After breaking a tooth on Sunday night, I decided to give up smoking and sugary drinks.  I'm on Day 5, and honestly, it hasn't been that hard.  This is the first time I have ever tried though.  Cravings have been minimal.  My brain does try to trick me, but I won't let it.  Been subbing gum and pretzel sticks when I do get a craving.  Also using a bit of homeopathic cytisine, which is supposed to cut down on cravings, but only used it once today.  So far so good.  I'm waiting to hit my wall, but so far I've been surprised how untortuous the whole thing is.

Thoughts please! (Quitting in the thick of it)

What are your thoughts on quitting smoking when you're surrounded by stress and anxiety or just going through a difficult situation? 

I know it seems difficult, but the theory is if you can survive through it, you definitely won't need cigarettes at your best. 

I'd like to add this thought came to me (*though not originally mine*) as I want to attempt the quit but I'm working solid for the next week. Rather than waiting, I'm thinking of just taking the plunge. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. Stay strong, guys.

Really bad panic attack 20 days into quitting...

Smoking was what got me out of the house but now I’ve just been at home all day, everyday and it’s really effected my mental health. It doesn’t help that on top of that I’ve been so stressed with life and have bad anxiety because of a medical condition I got almost two years ago that makes me not be able to work or do much.

Anyway last night I just felt the fear, stress, anxiety and depression building in my mind and body. I was extremely restless and all I could think about was dying. My body became pins and needles, I was having trouble breathing and shooting pains were going through my chest it hit me so hard I couldn’t do anything it was honestly one of the worst psychological experiences of my life. I somehow managed to sleep, today I woke up feeling pretty crappy but worse I feel like how I felt last night before that panic attack! I’m really worried and am seriously considering buying cigarettes and smoking the whole pack in one sitting if I have too to avoid it. This is absolutely awful I feel completely helpless...

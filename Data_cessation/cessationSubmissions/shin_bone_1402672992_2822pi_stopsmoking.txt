Day 2 - everything is easier than expected

So with my mantra, "I don't need them.", resisting my cravings has really been easier than I initially thought it would be. The toughest time of my day I walked around the buildings that I work near for twenty minutes. That's twenty minutes of straight walking, pacing quickly around outside. I was looking at every single person smoking a cigarette and imagining myself trying to bum one. I played around with the thought of asking for a cigarette, and even made eye contact with a few of the smokers, but then I'd just repeat to myself that I don't need them. After my twenty minute walk I went inside and bought myself a chocolate bar. I was really proud of myself for not bumming a smoke.  
  
I'm usually not a prideful man, but I can't even explain how good I feel about myself having gone a full day without a cigarette. I can't wait until I hit that seven day landmark, that's the day that I **KNOW** my cravings are purely psychological.  
  
I also like checking my flair, that justification is small but I've assigned a little bit of meaning to it and it's helping to keep me going that much more.  
  
I'm really glad to have this soapbox, even if nobody reads it.  
  
**TL:DR; Day 2, had an intense craving, fought it off, rewarded myself, couldn't be happier that I'm actually doing this. THANKS /r/STOPSMOKING**

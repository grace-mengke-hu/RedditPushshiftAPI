It begins tomorrow

Tomorrow I begin my descent into madness. Two weeks ago, I relapsed from depression after successfully quitting for two months. I have quit nicotine several times before, so I am well aware what I am in for.

The trick is to ignore your own invasive thoughts. Your brain will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to convince you however it can that you need nicotine. I am my own worst enemy in this regard.

I wish I listened to everyone when I was younger. I wish I never touched the stuff. I'm so tired on my mood being dependent on it. I'm  tired of losing what I have left of my sanity when I don't have it. I had such an aversion to it, but the moment my anxiety wracked brain got a taste- it was over even if it wasn't habitual at first.

Please do what you can to can to make sure your loved ones never fall pray to this shit. Despite the major quantity of anti tobacco ad spots, the destructive aspect of it is so downplayed.

Thanks for listening.

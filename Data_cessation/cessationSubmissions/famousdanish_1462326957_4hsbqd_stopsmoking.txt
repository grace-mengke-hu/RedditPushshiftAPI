7 months smoke free - then complete relapse for 1.5 weeks - anyone else ever relapse hard?

I smoked again. Like, really smoked. Been smoking at least a pack a day for the past ten days. I have quit again, for 4 hours now! Thought I would post on here for some support. I will reset my badge; just wanted people to see it was a relapse.

Before, brushing my teeth religiously, chewing heaps of gum, posting here, keeping busy, and the Smoke Free app helped. Doing those all again. Jeez louise what have I got myself into, haha.

Anybody else relapse hard, then quit again? Is it easier this time around? I definitely don't crave them as HARD, but there are still some devious cravings :/

No sleep for me

I was a smoker for a long time and it was a nightly ritual especially. This is the longest I have quit and I have having so much trouble turning off to go to sleep. It sucks . I feel awesome during the day but then at night, with no distractions , find myself worried about everything, stressed and thinking of the past too much. Is this abnormal part of the process? Have I been using smoking to distract me from life and dealing and ,if so, how do I stay strong and focus on quitting when I am an emotional wreck when I am alone? Please anyone have advice? I can not go back to smoking but I would like to find a way to not stress to this point every night. Thanks

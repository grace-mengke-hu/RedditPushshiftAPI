Today I quit after a year of smoking with 30 cigarettes a day.

Hi,

i have bought some nicotine gum two weaks ago. I tried three of them, it works, but I had no decision done so far. Today I have thrown away all my cigarettes and I am ready to quit now. I already had quit for eight weeks, but then I got back to it after a dumb thought, now I want to be free of smoking. I just can not take the it anymore.

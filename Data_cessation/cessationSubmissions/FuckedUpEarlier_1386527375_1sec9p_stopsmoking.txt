Why I fucked up and how it may benefit you!

Today's the day I broke my promise to myself.

After 2 weeks of not smoking, I fucked up tonight. Bought a pack, lit up a cigarette. Shame washed over me like a wave, then nothingness. 

Let me back up a bit. I had stopped smoking (for, I think, the 4th time) after 8 years of on and off (more on) smoking on the 23rd of November. 

I'd had enough. I was tired of it. Tired of the low energy levels. Tired of my ragged breathing and racing pulse whenever I climbed the stairs to my 4th floor apartment. Tired of not having the motivation to exercise. Tired of smelling like an ashtray, tired of worrying about my health. Tired of spending a fortune on something that was slowly killing me.

Most of all, I was tired of being a slave. Tired of the panic that set in when I got home late at night and realized I was out of cigarettes. 

Hey, I really don't have to explain this to *you guys* any further. You know exactly what I'm talking about. 

I quit using Allen Carr's "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking". It was easy. I only had the very slightest of cravings, we all know that cravings are in the mind, the physical addiction is laughably easy to break, when you realize what it actually is.

It went fine for about 10 days, then the problems started. In the earlier instances I quit, the benefits were all but immediate. My breathing got much better, my resting pulse returned to a healthier rhythm, my sense of smell got much better and I *just felt better*.

Not so this time. Most noticeably, my sense of smell didn't really improve. My energy levels remained low. Breathing got better and I could wear perfume again without it being an exercise in futility, but I wasn't enough. 

I was impatient, I wanted results NOW! THIS VERY MINUTE! I was blind to the very real benefits that were already happening. After a frustrating weekend, I bought a pack and lit one up.

Only then did I realize that my sense of smell had already gotten much better, because it smelled and tasted *disgusting*. I've washed my hands three times now and I can still smell the foul taste of tobacco on them. My roommates will smell the tobacco on my clothes and they'll silently judge me for giving in.

So what did it give me? **Nothing.** I don't feel better about my frustrating weekend, it just added another failure to it. I'm not relaxed, or satisfied in any way, I'm just ashamed, left here to lament all the progress I've carelessly thrown overboard. 

Because now I'm at Ground Zero again. I can't pretend that my slip-up was a one time thing. If I did, I'd just have another cigarette in another trying moment, say 5 days from now. 2 days after that, I'd have another. In two weeks time, I'd be back at a pack a day.

No, what I'll have to do is to start the whole process again. The rest of my night will be dedicated to reading Allen Carr again, hoping that I can do it again. I deleted the best thing I did all month in a moment of careless and stupid daydreaming, because I wasn't *satisfied* with my progress. Only after I lit up that cigarette did I realize how much progress I actually made:

- I saved a ton of money
- I ran 5k every day!
- My sense of smell had gotten better
- My breathing was better
- I was way less nervous
- **I had a reason to be proud of myself!**

Well, that's all fucked now. I start at zero again, if you ever smoke one cigarette, you will too!

I wrote this diatribe for 2 reasons:

1. I wanted something solid to remind myself of what I've done, and how it wasn't worth it at all!!!
2. Some of you will be tempted to start again, for the same reason I did. Not because of the cravings, *but because you're frustrated with the slow progress.* Think long and hard about how much you've progressed since you stopped, and consider the awful truth - even if you don't see any progress since your stop, you're still way ahead of me - because I'm going backwards, with every puff. I hope I've given some of you some reassurance that you're on the right path!

Now if you'll excuse me, I'll have to go restart my path to being a non-smoker again - because that's all I want to do after smoking a cigarette!

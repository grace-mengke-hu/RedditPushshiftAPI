Tommorrow is the day.

Today I will finish my pack.  I refuse to buy more.  I've been smoking for 13 years.  I've quit twice before.  Once for 8 months, and I started again after a divorce.  Second time was for 6 months, and I started again after I lost my job.  I want to quit, it's so hard.  I have found that cold turkey is the only way I can stop, so that's the plan.   I also have a vape with 0% nicotine I plan to use when times get tough.  I need this for myself, my kids, and my wallet.  I'm writing this with hopes that somehow writing my thoughts down helps.  Any tips?  Wish me luck!

I Have To Quit Otherwise My Doctor Won't Let Me Transition (M to F Transsexual here!)

So, kind of feels like my whole future depends on me quitting (which I guess is true for anyone who smokes) but any advice, tips, guidance would be appreciated. I have made it a day, and feel a little irritable at times but I appear to be coping thus far.

How bad is this about to get? Any advice?

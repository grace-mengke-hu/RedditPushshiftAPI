Sore throat and lack of stress reliever

Just wanted to ask two things and I'm assuming this is the place to go. It's been two weeks since I quit but the biggest issues are:

1) Random sore throat. Any idea when I can expect this to stop happening? Hot drinks seem to help and it goes away after a day or so.

2) How do I deal with getting pissed off? Before hand I could just have a smoke and that'd relax me but now I have zero methods of dealing with things causing me stress/anger beyond dropping whatever I'm doing for 30 minutes and wandering around muttering to myself angrily.

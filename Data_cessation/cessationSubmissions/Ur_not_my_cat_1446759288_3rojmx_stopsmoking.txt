I'm done. Advice ?

Okay today is the day I decided to stop. I have smoked for round about 8 years now . I started at age 16 I would take my mother's cigarettes go down to the park and light up. It all started with my friend one day after school when we were bored and talking about how we wanted to try it to see what was so "great" about it. So we found a pack in the kitchen drawer and I was hooked instantly. I am now 24 and I smoke a pack to a pack and a half a day. Although I find it to be a disgusting habit I still enjoyed. The longest I've gone cigarette free in the last 8 years is only two weeks. I find the hardest part for me is being around others who smoke. As soon as I see someone light one even on tv I instantly want one and it's nearly impossible for me to stay away from people who do. Most of my friends, family, and coworkers are smokers. Here's to finally kicking the habit though. I am so set on it this time. I'm done burning money away just for the relief from the cravings for a little while. Any advice would be appreciated . I know it won't be easy but it will be worth it.

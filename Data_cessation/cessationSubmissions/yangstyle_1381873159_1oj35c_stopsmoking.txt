Just realized today is 100 days!

I just wanted to thank this subreddit for helping me to accomplish this. I wanted to post a gif of the dance of joy but couldn't figure out how to do. No matter: I am at work and didn't want to take the time to figure it out.  Anyway, thanks...and my wife thanks you for the smoke free kisses.

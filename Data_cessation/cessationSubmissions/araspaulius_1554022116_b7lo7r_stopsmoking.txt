Has anyone relapsed on weed?

I stopped cigarettes since october last year, and so far it's been easy because I have no friends. I'm going to be visiting my bro and weed's legal there, so I'm figuring we'll get there eventually. It won't be regular and I just want to ask if anyone has any experience on relapsing with this.
Thanks in advance, stay nicotine free.

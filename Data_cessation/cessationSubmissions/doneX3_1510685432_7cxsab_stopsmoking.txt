One week away from 2 years. You can do it! There is only one trick.

Hi brave warriors! I knew I quit smoking about 2 years ago, so I thought I better check-in. My freedom anniversary is one week away. See, I don't think about it much anymore. I would be lying if I denied that under the occasional moment of stress, a tiny memory says, have a smoke. It disappears in less than a second because you know, smoking sucks. 

Allan Carr types etc will try to convince you that you do not enjoy smoking. Recent quitters know better, right? They actually enjoy smoking but are quitting because it's just bad for their health etc. Wrong. It is the recent quitters who are mistaken. It takes a little while, but man I know for a fact smoking sucks. It is only the brainwashing that makes it seem like a kind of pleasure. On the odd day that I think about the fact that I used to smoke, I am so happy I quit. I love breathing the free air! The freedom is yours for the taking. 

There is only one trick. Be resolute. Be done done done. Do not look back. Do not negotiate with your addict brain. Be done. All power to you. Freedom is worth it!

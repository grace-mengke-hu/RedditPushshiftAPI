45 days quit and I just had sex without a single fear of a coughing fit or smokers mouth problems!

By this point I am really starting to feel the difference from quitting! My lungs only hurt when I take a reeaally deep breath but apart from that I feel great! 

Im a single pringle and been working on bettering myself recently so havent seen much tail, until tonight! My usual anxieties were:

* My breath stank
* I was going to cough uncontrollably
* I would tire physically within minutes
* I was sure I would lob a phlegm missile at her (god how vile is smoking)
* General anxieties about how lack of fitness will affect performance

ALL OF THESE ARE GONE! YOU CAN DO IT TOO!

(P.s turns out the self control respect gained from quitting is a real turn on.

Quitters are so much cooler than smokers they smoked then had the coolness to not let it rule their lives.)

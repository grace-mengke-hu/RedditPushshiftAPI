Week One

Just got week one under belt, can’t believe I’m even saying that, it’s simultaneously been a struggle while also being easier than I initially anticipated, it varies from moment to moment.  Just had surgery to fix my deviated septum, but the cravings have really been hitting hard despite this.  Having a doctor strongly advising me not to smoke while I’m on the mend certainly forces me to make the right decision, but I also feel like I have less freedom of choice and I resent that.   I want a cigarette so badly but I know my sinuses can’t physically handle one right now, and I also want to keep my streak going now that I have already have the first week down.   No real point to this post, just feeling angry and hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when this surgery has left me feeling so miserable, smoker or not.  My whole routine has been completely flipped on its head this past week and I’m struggling to truly relax and feel at ease while I try to adapt to both my healing body and my new smoke-free lifestyle.  Thanks for listening.

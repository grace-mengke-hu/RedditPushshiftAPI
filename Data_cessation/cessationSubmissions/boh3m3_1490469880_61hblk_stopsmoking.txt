Just celebrated one year without!

I quit cold turkey using Alan Carr's Easy Way method (just the book though). Breathing is so much better and I spend soooo much less. I've actually managed to save a few thousand to move across the country. I smoked a pack a day minimum for over a decade. If I can quit, anyone can. Just keep trying. Every day, every craving.

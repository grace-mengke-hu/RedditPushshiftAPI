It's day #8....

I'm starting on day #8 and, although fleeting, I still get very intense cravings. I decided to use chantix, as I found the patch and the gum largely useless for myself. I feel that it really does help but I still get the  intense cravings every now and again. I've heard people that quit smoking months ago say that they still get periodic cravings. Will mine end soon?

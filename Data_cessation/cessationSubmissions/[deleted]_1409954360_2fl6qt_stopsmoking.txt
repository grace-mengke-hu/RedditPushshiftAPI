Feeling Nostalgic

Do you guys ever get nostalgic with some of the best smokes you've ever had? Having moved back to my condo for school, I'm sorta missing the time I would have to myself while going out onto my balcony which overlooks west Toronto, being able to see the hills of Caladon for a smoke at 1:30 am, a light summer nights breeze,  nobody outside to bother you, and just the sound of cars over the highway 1.5 Kilometers away. 

I guess the only thing I miss about smoking is the time, taking a break from watching a movie or a tv show on my PS3, or while writing an essay. Its not tempting me to go back to smoking, i'm just feeling a bit nostalgic.

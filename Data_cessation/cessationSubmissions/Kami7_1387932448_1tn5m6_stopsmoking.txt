Funny

It's funny I am smoking right now and stumbled in this sub via the random button. I had given up on trying to quit. But reading these posts while smoking is actually starting to make this cig taste nasty. I think this may be it. Every time I smoke now I'll browse this sub until my leftover pack is finished. After that I won't buy another pack and every time I crave it, I'll come back to this sub to counter my urge. Hopefully this will work. 

Edit: 

**Update 1**. I am a chain smoker as well. Usually 3-4 in a sitting. Right now I read some posts and kept staring at the lungs pic posted in the thread. Felt disgusted at my self and threw the 2nd cig before it reached 1/2 way. The urge to smoke is still here somewhat, but can't bring myself to light up another one. Going back inside now. 4 remaining in the pack now. I know my weak willed butt will be back out to curb the craving again in a couple of hours. Let's see though. 

**update 2** As expected, I threw my jacket on. Grabbed my car keys, came out side in 21 degrees of cold, sat in my car, started it and started revving the engine to get the car warm enough. It's 2am right now. Holding my 3rd cig in my hand, after the 1st one, I started browsing google images for smoker lungs. I feel morbid. Feel like throwing up but kept forcing my self to smoke. I wanna say my goodbyes as soon as possible. 2nd and 3rd cig I could not make myself inhale due to the disgusting images and the stark reality that my lungs could possibly be like the ones I'm looking at. 10 years, 10 years I have smoked these cancer sticks, off and on. I do not want to think about the times I failed my self and kept coming back to smoking. My last cgi remains in the box. Thoughts of when to smoke it are coming in my head. Maybe I will maybe I won't. One thing is for sure, I want to wake up tomorrow smoke free. I still have some wiring I need to finish up in the basement before I hit the sheets, maybe I'll smoke it after I finish the wiring.... Maybe.

**update 3** so last cig still remains in the box. Went I sleep after I finished my little project. I was too sleepy to smoke. At this point I have not smoked for almost 12 hours, not by keeping myself from smoking, just that I was sleeping lol. 

Fighting the urge to smoke the last one. Keeping my self distracted with anything and everything

Weird side effects of quitting??

Iâ€™m 12 days cigarette free, and Iâ€™ve got two side effects that are BLOWING my mind. Anyone else can relate? Neither of these symptoms Iâ€™ve ever experienced my entire life 

Iâ€™ve been getting heartburn like crazy 
And Iâ€™ve been farting like MAD I mean like way more than normal. ðŸ˜‚

Are these normal? Anyone else relate?

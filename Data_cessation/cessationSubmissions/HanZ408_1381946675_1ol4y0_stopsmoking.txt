Day Zero

Hey guys,


Just quit smoking today and just wanted to say I am really fucking excited. I am craving like a motherfucker but I am hopefully and determined. Stuck at work waiting for lunch so I can go buy the patch, even though times are a little tough. 

I have had really bad nerve pain in my leg over the past 2 years and I really think it is due to the smoking. So hopefully in a few weeks here I notice a difference and if I do I think I am going to lose it (the pain is that bothersome). 

Here's hoping!

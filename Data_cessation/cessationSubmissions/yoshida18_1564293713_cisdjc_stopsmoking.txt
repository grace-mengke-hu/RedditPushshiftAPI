I nearly succumbed to this nasty vice. My badge says 737 days and seeing it I realized I've just made 2 years without smoking

Hey. Its just hard times for me right now. last weekend I had some friends in my house and a couple of them are smokers. I let them smoke in the varanda, and as I'm already past the point of bothering with smokers beside me, I collected the cigarret butts and tossed them inside a beer can.

  1 Week later I'm drinking by myself and cravings hit me. Hard. Really fucking hard. I remembered the can and went to it. Got about 12 cigarret buts. Even tried to light one of them. Luckyly to me, they were absolutely soaked, so I took about a minute to light them up. The minute was sufficient for my mind to realize the fucking stupid shit I was doing and throw all of the poison down the sink. I felt a fraction of one puff and I know the next week will be hard and I will crave nicotine. But I wont budge. Fuck nicotine. My life is still in shambles, but one step at a time I'm taking control. I wont go back to nicotine ever again. I still have the taste of it in my throat and unfortunatly I love it. Alot of water and sleep will kill it. Had to share. Writing it down to register my determination because it's been two years and it is still really fucking hard. The times I have the urge are more sparsed, I realize that, but it will always be hard.

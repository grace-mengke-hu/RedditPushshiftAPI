Barely Made Day 4, but I'm here!!!

I'm at day 4 today!! Yesterday, I was having a horrible craving before bed. I am also at day 5 of quitting marijuana so the justifications are strong. I didn't smoke because I'm so tired of quitting and restarting. I'm tired of wasting my money on toxic chemicals. I want to grow up and move on with my life. I want to be done with this phase of my life. So I barely made it to Day 4 and I am very proud of myself anyways!

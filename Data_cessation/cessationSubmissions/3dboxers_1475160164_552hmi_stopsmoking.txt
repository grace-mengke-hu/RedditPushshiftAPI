5 weeks cold turkey and having bad anxiety

I quit cold turkey 5 weeks ago and this past Friday I've been having very bad anxiety/panic attacks for the entire week. Every day the moment I wake up. I bought a pack yesterday to see if nicotine was the culprit and I haven't had an attack since. I think I mentally could not/cannot cope with the stress of grad school, work, and quitting smoking. Is it the right time to quit? I started going to the gym to see if that helps as well. 

Will the patches helps with this severe anxiety? I hope I do not have an anxiety disorder and it is just all the things going on in life right now that is making the anxiety creep up. Any and all input would help! Thank you all for your time. I do not know where else to go besides seeing a therapist.

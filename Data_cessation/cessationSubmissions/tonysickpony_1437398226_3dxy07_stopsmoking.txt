My lungs start talking to me again

Hi everyone. My first post cause this is  only my 8th day. I don't know how far I can go this time. I decided to quit, cause I hate feeling my lungs exhaust themselves everyday.
And no shit, this is the first time I can feel my breath, not like an old damaged machine. I ran for 3k today. And that to me is unbelievable since I would have ran out of breath after 2 or 3 min. I don't know if it is wise to work out as much as I can though, but I know it feels much better than smoking and the shame after smoke.

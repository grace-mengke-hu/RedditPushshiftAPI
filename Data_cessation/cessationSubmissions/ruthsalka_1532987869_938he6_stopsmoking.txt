stuck on the habit, all in my head

So I'm stuck on the mental part. I admit that readily. NO way 'm physically addicted having gotten down to 2 or 3 max per day. I find myself still lighting up because its a particular time of day and I'm siting out on the steps with my smoking SO after work. The voice in my head says' 'you're not craving..." and the response is 'yeah, but it's time...." 

We have changed SO much of our old routine- I thought it was enough. Apparently not. Keep tweaking, keep tweaking, never quit quitting...

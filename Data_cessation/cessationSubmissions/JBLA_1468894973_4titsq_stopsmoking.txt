5 days and 100 cigarettes

It's a new record for me folks.  This is the longest I've gone without smoking in 20 years.  Finally read and listened to the audio book for Allen Carr... it resonated with me.  Suddenly smoking just seemed like a very silly idea.  Maybe I'm just riding the O2 high,  but I don't think I'm looking back.

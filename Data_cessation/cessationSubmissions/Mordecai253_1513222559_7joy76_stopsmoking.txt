Some light reading re: Neuroadaptation to nicotine use and withdrawal or how scary the beast truly is.

I'm in the early stages of what I hope will be my final quit. This time I'm leaning on bupropion and while it isn't a walk in the cake, the drug has been surprisingly helpful. 

Anyway, I wanted to share to articles I've found that answer a number of questions I've had about nicotine addiction and the neurobiology behind it all. I've have found them motivating myself. It's good to know the enemy.

This article is longer and denser but I think even a layman can follow the essential points. It's a bit of a downer. Essentially, nicotine near-permanently changes the synaptic network in the brain. It's the ability to adapt at the margins that helps people abstain. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY, from 536-538 explains why a lapse during a quit is a BIG deal. The smoker's brain is essentially primed to go right back to where it left off with even a square's worth of nicotine. Once a smoker, always a smoker, and the neuropharm behind it explains why people can hardcore relapse after decades of abstinence. 

TLDR: It's a great read if you're interested in what is going on in your head when you smoke/quit.

This here is a more manageable review of nicotine addiction. It doesn't get into the rarefied air of the first article, but it does succinctly lay out the widely recognized nature of nicotine addiction without gazing to far ahead. 

Thanks, good luck y'all, and if anyone else has some hot science to toss my way, I'd appreciate it.

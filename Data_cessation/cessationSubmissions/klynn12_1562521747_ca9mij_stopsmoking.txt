I was just diagnosed with cancer.

I have only been a smoker for about 2 years now. About a year ago I noticed a small, painful lesion on my tongue that didn’t go away. Last week after the biopsy (incredibly painful by the way) I was diagnosed with stage 2 carcinoma of the tongue. 
I’m only 26 years old. I have to go through a surgery to remove half of my tongue, a skin graft to try and rebuild my tongue, chemo, radiation and all of this for at least the next 2 years. All of this because of a stupid habit. 
I’m writing this here to hopefully inspire some of you. It only took one year of smoking for me to develop cancer. I had no history of cancer in my family. 
To me, it’s only a matter of time. 
I implore you all to quit TODAY.

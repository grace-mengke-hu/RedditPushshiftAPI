Day 2: This time, I stop!

I am now ready to quit smoking. This is my second serious attempt. I tried to stop in March and had one month without a cigarette. I was really proud of myself but a very stressful event made me smoke again. 

Now that things are calmer, I try again. Actually, I have tried for weeks, but not seriously (throwing my cigarettes to the trashbin, then buying a new pack after 12H, then trying to stop again 2 days later, etc.). The difference is that this time, I have spent the last 24 hour without a cigarette, and even if it attracts me now, I do not want to smoke again at all. 

I have my "no-smoke" pack with me: a box of toothpicks, sticks of liquorice roots, cloves, mint candies and yerba mat√©. Wish me good luck!

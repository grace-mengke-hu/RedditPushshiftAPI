Depression and cigarettes; in your experience do you think that they can be linked?

Just putting this out there for others that have quit smoking: has your depression or mood improved since quitting smoking? 

I have struggled with depression off and on (mostly on) for the last 13 years of my life and since quitting smoking I feel like my depression has significantly diminished, or something in my brain just kind of flipped and I am generally feeling a whole lot better mentally than I have for a long time. 

Don't get me wrong, the first few weeks of quitting smoking were very hard for me and I felt like I was definitely more depressed than would be the norm for me, which I think is typical for anyone quitting smoking who doesn't already suffer from depression, but I could be wrong. 

Anyways, I just wanted to see what others' experiences have been with this and if anyone can relate. Since quitting smoking I have also made other healthy changes which could also be contributing to the improvements in my mental health. I'm fairly sure it is all helping at this point!

Good luck to everyone on their non-smoking journey :)

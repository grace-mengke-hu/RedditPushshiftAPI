9 days in - just a reminder why I chose to quit

I've gone about 9 days now without smoking. As I'm typing this, I'm sitting outside one of my classes waiting for the teacher to get here. A girl in my class stands next to me and I can hardly breath, just from the smell of cigarette smoke coming off of her. Every time she talks too, the smell is SO MUCH MORE UNBEARABLE. I actually had to move to get away from the smell because I was coughing from it so bad. 

**No one** finds it attractive to smell like that. Please remember this and hopefully it will help you!

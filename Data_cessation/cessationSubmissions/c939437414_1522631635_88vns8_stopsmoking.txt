Headaches, chest pains, weird feeling in veins, general drowsiness, mood swings... Is this normal and when will it stop?

I haven't smoked for a month. I'm proud of that. But my withdrawal symptoms make me want to go back. I'm so close to going to my local newsagents to pick up a pack of sterling. I have no idea what to... Is this normal because it's really worrying me.

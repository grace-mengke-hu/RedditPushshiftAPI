Almost 2 weeks! What is different to you?

Last week has been very tough, this week however I've manage to cope a lot better. It helps not to think about it.. I consider myself a non-smoker now and I will fight whatever to stay this way


For me in the last 12 days, This is what I have noticed:

1. How much it actually stinks. I remember that my grandfather (only other smoker in the family) use to smell like this, and how I hated it. 

2. I suddenly have a lot more respect for non smokers that actually puts up with this and dealing with me without judging openly. I get that now. Sorry

3. Everything doesn't suddenly tastes better, but its like changing video quality on you tube.. the whole experience of something simple like a beer, a bowl of cereal, even a breath mint is just so much better

4. I have a lot more energy. I also started training while still smoking, and was always tired the following morning after a training session. This is not the case anymore.

5. I can suddenly go to a lot more restaurants as I'm not limited to a restaurant with a smoking section!

6. I haven't been to a shop in probably a week, and I actually have money in my wallet!! I always use to justify it by saying its not that expensive, but tomorrow night I can take my Girlfriend out to a nicer restaurant JUST because I don't have a nicotine bill anymore.

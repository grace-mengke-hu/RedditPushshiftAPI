Something they never told you about quitting...

"You will always miss them."

It's important that people know this may be true for them if they're serious about quitting. The physical addiction wanes within a few weeks if you go cold turkey. If you use NRT the withdrawals are less powerful even though the quitting process takes longer.

But if you're like me and you enjoyed smoking irrespective of the physical addiction, and even apart from the psychosomatic aspects, you will always miss them. 

This is one of the biggest reasons some people have difficulty with quitting long term. Relapses after a year, two years, five years, twenty years. I've seen it all from people I've known, those relapses. It's because they never stopped missing the smokes.

Now you know, and knowing is half the battle. Just keep this in mind when you're ready to quit and when you're trying to remember why you quit, or if you need help staying motivated not to smoke again.

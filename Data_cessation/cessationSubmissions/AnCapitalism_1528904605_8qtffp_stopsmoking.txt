Trying again

I gave in after 50 days almost two months ago. I'm 23 years old and want to lay to rest this last relic of an adult boy. I partied, drank, did drugs, and it just about ruined my life. I have a son and one on the way and I don't want to continue smoking my whole life. 



I didn't plan on quitting today, but the urge wasn't intense this morning so I decided why not? Cold turkey, no NRT. Lord have mercyðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ

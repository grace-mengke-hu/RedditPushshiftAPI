Never thought I'd be so grateful for the flu

I've been a smoker for a little over a decade at about a pack a day, and the last few years it's been causing me some respiratory issues. Chest colds lasting a lot longer with a couple of them turning into pneumonia.

I started coming down with the flu Monday morning. Despite that fact, I went out for my Monday morning cigarette. Of course it was god awful. So I figured this would have to be a smoke free flu. 

Days one and two came with a fever. So cravings weren't really an issue. Day three came around, and I decided to stick with it. Day four has now come and gone. It was tough today, but I feel like getting sick again has afforded me an opportunity. I'm so ready to be done 

The combination of flu aches and nicotine withdrawal has been hellish, but I feel really confident about this quit. Plus seeing all of the success stories in this sub is really encouraging.

So thanks & good luck, y'all!

Day 5

I'm on day 5 which is a record for me. I smoked for 16 years and was starting to feel the effects on my health. I forgot my smokes at home the other day and after bumming a few I realised how stupid it was. I quit that day, threw the pack I had in the trash when I got home and haven't looked back. The planets aligned for me this time it seems. I'm not getting as many cravings now, and when I do my will to quit is stronger than the craving. I'm actually doing this! Sorry for the rant, just feeling great and needed to get that out.

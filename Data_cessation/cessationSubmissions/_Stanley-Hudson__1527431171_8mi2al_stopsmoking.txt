Stopped smoking, but today it feels like I smoked a pack.

Hello fellow stoppers, I have a question that you guys might be able to answer. I recently stopped smoking, went from smoking around 15 RYO per day to none, and I’m on my fifth day. Yesterday night I went partying with friends, they smoked, I resisted the occasional urges without any problems, so all is good. Shows that you can party hard even if you quit. But today after waking up and going about my day my lungs feel as if I’ve smoked a whole pack yesterday. Might be the hangover, I dunno. Might be the fact that we were in a room where people could smoke (so second-hand), might be the analgesic effect of nicotine wearing off and making me feel the years of bullshit accumulated in my lungs, I really don’t know. Have you guys experienced something like this after quitting?

I myself don't smoke cigarettes but a buddy does who Is trying to quit

I'm worried about him he's trying to "quit" but he's not really. He's substituted it with hookah and he says he is 3 weeks smoke free. He's had a few freak outs at us when it gets bad. He takes nicotine gum which I prefer and everyone else he just does. Also he is about to dump 75 dollars on an e cig. I understand the oral fixation and I understand he has an addiction that he is fighting through. But is it healthy for him to be doing the hookah and e cig thing? Are these actually being a beneficial way to quit? We as his buddies and closest friends I are worried he's not really on the right track. We are proud he hasn't had a cigarette but we are still concerned. Sorry for the choppy writing I can't get all my thoughts out right.

TL;DR Friend smokes hookah and is buying an e cig to get rid of his nicotine addiction and quit smoking, is this the right way?

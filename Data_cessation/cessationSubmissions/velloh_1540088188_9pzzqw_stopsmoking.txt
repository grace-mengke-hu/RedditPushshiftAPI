Smoking update

After only smoking about 15 cigarettes since January 2018, I am sitting here smoking one now. Inside I feel so bad that I am smoking it. My vape is currently dead and I’m at work thinking I need this cigarette. I have changed so much since I stopped smoking. However I don’t want to start again every time my vape dies. 

I think I realised though that we are all human, we all make mistakes. Even though I’m having a cigarette now and it is disgusting but I feel like I need it, it doesn’t matter because I know in my head I won’t buy any cigarettes (smoking my girlfriends cigarette) I know I won’t get back into smoking as it has done so much for me to not smoke. 

I just thought I’d share what I’m thinking here and if any of you guys could weigh in on what I’m saying. I am have changed my whole life since I stopped smoking. Started going to the gym 3-4 times a week started to eat better. Happier. Not so stressed out. But what could help me when my vape dies and I want a cigarette. This only happens at work btw. 

As if put the cigarette out it taste like shit on my breath I hate it. Just thought I’d put this here

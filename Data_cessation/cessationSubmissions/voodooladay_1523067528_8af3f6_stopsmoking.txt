Finally, day 100.

The last few weeks have been a struggle but I was determined to get to day 100 and now here I am. Thanks to all of you who have been posting  about your experiences, struggles, and successes - you have been a huge inspiration to show me that quitting IS possible.  Your posts provided much needed reminders about why I needed to stay strong on the days I was craving the worst. 

I'm still taking this journey one day at a time, sometimes one minute at a time, but it's nice to know there are so many in the same boat journeying with me. To all of you who have just started your new chapter in life as non smokers, congratulations and hang in there - before you know it you'll be celebrating day 100 too!

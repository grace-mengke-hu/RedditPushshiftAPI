Help! Need encouragement!

Background: I am (37f) who decided to quit. I have been smoking since I was 18.   I am on Chantix and shear willpower! It is so hard. I started a hobby with my hands, herb gardening. I wish is was marijuana but, itâ€™s just cooking herbs. My quit date was 6-17-19.  I am struggling with this addiction. Any advice?

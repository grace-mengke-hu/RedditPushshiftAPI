I made it through the wilderness...

Somehow I made it through

Didn't know how lost I was

Until I found you



I was beat incomplete

I'd been had, I was sad and blue

But you made me feel

Yeah, you made me feel

Shiny and new



This is dedicated to all of those who kept my spirits in a dark period in my life yesterday. :)

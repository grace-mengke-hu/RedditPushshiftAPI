Stopped smoking 1 week ago.

I stopped when i knew i had a burn in my Esophagus , i couldn't eat or drink only to feel the pain when swallowing , since i stopped smoking and starting eating healthy etc.Physically i'm feeling well , alive.
But psychologically , it's the great emptiness, now i have too much time to spend and i'm feeling so bored , physical addiction to nicotine we can get over it , but the state of mind where i only think of a cigarette that is the hardest step i'm going through right now , hope i'm on the right path.If any of you got any advices i'm all ears/eyes open.


TL;DR : Smoking sucks !

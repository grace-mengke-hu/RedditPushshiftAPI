- redditors helping redditors to stop smoking

I just read that in address bar when I typed in "stopsmoking" and I want to say thanks to all of you. Thinking of changing my badge (again) which would inevitably lead to changing my badges in /r/stopdrinking and /r/pornfree was really what stopped me from taking a cig today. 

That and the knowledge that the one cig is really only a setup  for the next one. But the badge bot thing was big. Thank you folks.

Edit: Well the badge bot should be saying "2 days" pretty soon now. If not, I'll have to figure out what I did wrong. I reset it to 2015-06-10 yesterday.

The bandaid that saved my life & made me quit smoking cigarettes .

My husband bought me a Swarovski encrusted vaporizer to help me quit my 12 year strong pack a day to pack every two days habit. Never ever thought that anything could help me, figured I'm going to die of lung cancer. ðŸ˜” I haven't smoked another cigarette since the moment my lips wrapped around the mouthpiece of my vape. For those of you who can't quit cold turkey, this is a God send. Now I'm just wondering why it took me so long to get one!

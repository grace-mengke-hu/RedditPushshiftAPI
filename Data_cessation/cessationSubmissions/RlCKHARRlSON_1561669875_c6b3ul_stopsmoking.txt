Need some encouragement to not go down this path with e-cigs.

Hey all, I might seem weak for asking for help here since I’m a very new user in the grand scheme of things.

I’m 20 years old, and before a month ago I never owned any nicotine devices, but would happily take a hit from a friends juul if they had one (maybe once a month or so). 

My friend left his NJOY at my house 2 months ago and I found it a week later and asked if he’d be fine if I finished it. It had more juice in it then I expected and it lasted me about a week.

A few weeks after that, I was planning out a psychedelic trip at a concert and decided it would be cool to have my own Njoy to use during the trip. After the concert, I justified keeping it because, hey, I had already spent the money on it so I figured I might as well njoy it (ha).

Unfortunately, near the end of that pens life, I noticed a headache and knew that nicotine would make it go away.

I’ve bought two more since then and the last one lasted me about 4 days. It’s been 2 days since I last used it.

The issue I’m having is my brain keeps thinking of ways to justify using nicotine. In the 2 weeks or so that I was using regularly I accomplished a ton at my work and even got a 17% raise. I also went from drinking an energy drink every day to not drinking caffeine at all.

I’m just worried that I’m messing up my brain chemistry by using caffeine/nicotine at 20 years old, but I also feel like it’s making me more productive and opening up different career paths for me.

Any advice is appreciated!

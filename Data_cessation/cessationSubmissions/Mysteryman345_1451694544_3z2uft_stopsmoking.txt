One Year On: some advice for the quitters

So I have gone an entire year smoke free. I was a new years resolutioner for 2015 and now I've never felt better. My fitness is better, I don't smell or have yellow teeth and my skin looks healthier. So you have decided to quit? Here are some things that I think will help you to vanquish this demon.

**Really want to quit** - You are not going to quit smoking unless  you seriously want to quit. It has to be a powerful internal driver. If you are not fully committed, there is no point in trying because you will just be wasting time being uncomfortable going through withdrawal. Go buy that pack and put your feet up if you're going to half ass it because you will not be able to quit if you're not serious. It took me about 10 attempts to quit but I only took it seriously the last two times.

**Try vaping** - This is a bit controversial because vaping is also unhealthy for you. But I believe it is slightly better for you than smoking and if you can successfully shift your addiction from cigarettes to vaping, then it is easier to quit vaping outright. Think of it as a halfway house. It is also quite enjoyable. I vaped from January 1st to about mid February. I chewed nicotine gum for a month after which also helped relieve withdrawal symptoms.

**Don't have that sneaky one cigarette** - This is a lot of people's downfalls as well as mine for the majority of quits. Simply put, where you have gone without smoking for long enough that your brain tricks you into having just a cheeky one. What's the worst that could happen? Well you probably will start again. It always tastes horrible because your taste buds are used to not smoking and it is never as satisfying as you think it will be. I honestly did have a cigarette when I was drunk and feeling lonely (didn't inhale it however) and it was a terrible decision. Very risky and nearly threw away 3 months smokefree.

**It gets easier** - What you are attempting is a hard thing to do. It is scary and a pain in the ass. You just need to stay strong and remember your motivations for quitting. Fitness and health was mine but it's your life, you know why you want to quit. Remember why you're quitting and you will have the strength to quit. And it gets easier. All you need to do is make it to April smokefree and it gets significantly easier.

Stay strong and good luck. You can do this!

I am now 3 weeks smoke free, but I am coughing so much. Is this normal?

Around 27 November I got sick and couldnâ€™t smoke, so I decided since I have endured 3 days of no smoking that I would take the plunge and completely stop. I am successful.

However since then I have been coughing often, much less than when I was sick. But I am surely coughing (heavy coughs) a lot more than when i used to smoke.

Any advice or help regarding this?

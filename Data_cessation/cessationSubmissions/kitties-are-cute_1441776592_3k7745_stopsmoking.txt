Day 5, I wish this were easier.

I've quite before, and started back up again after about two months because of the whole, "just one won't get me started again."

This time around, I was motivated by my fiance and our best friend to quit. My personal reason? I want to be able to laugh and talk with my friends without going into a coughing fit every time I do laugh.

The app I use to help directed me here, and already I'm so proud of how strong all of you are. I hope I can achieve that someday.

Weekend

Weekend is coming up and I am starting to get little antsy. Not sure if I can not hang out with my friends. I have an option of getting some stuff done at the house and just go full Defcon 1 lockdown on my friends.

Biggest challenge for me will be this weekend. 

What do you guys plan on doing this weekend?

First night out with friends.

Folks,

Need a little bit of advice or some tips/tricks that have helped you through here.

It's been eight days since I last had a cigarette but tonight is the first time I've been out to a pub for a few drinks with friends and I'm not going to lie, it was tough going.

The routine of having a smoke after a few drinks after years of making it a habit was a hard one to break!

I am very pleased to say I didn't have a cigarette but I did rely on the ecig I have became a reliance tonight

I'm not wanting to replace cigarettes with an ecig and form a new habit.

Stayed strong and plan on keeping it that way!

Any a advice on how to get through it after a few drinks?

Thanks folks.

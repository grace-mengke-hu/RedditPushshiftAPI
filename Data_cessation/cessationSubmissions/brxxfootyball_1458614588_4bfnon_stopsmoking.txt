new revelation

Hi so i'm 23 been smoking on and off for say three years although I don't smoke say more than 4 a day and only on some days I have realy bad cravings after I quit. However, i've noticed that I will always see someone who is hot who is smoking and it will make me want to smoke more because I want to be like them, having a moment to themselved in the sun whilst having a cig. However, I know this is bad but it has actually helped so much over the passed days. Whenever I start to crave a cig instead of my mind racing to the hot guy smoking, I try and find someone who is ugly, maybe with visible signs of smoking on their face etc and it makes me not want one . lol

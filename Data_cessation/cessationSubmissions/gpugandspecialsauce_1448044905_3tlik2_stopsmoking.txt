ummm. oops? a little support?

Day 6. 

I caved. Ugh. Could poke my eyes out. Same stressor that kept me from quitting reared its ugly face. I thought I was prepared. Not so much as it turns out.

I bought a pack and stared at it. I rationalized that keeping 3 was okay. I tossed the pack. I lit one. I felt like an ass. SIX DAYS. I took a drag and stomped the hell out of it in the parking lot. (Mosh pit for one!)  I crushed the second one and stared at the third and figured, "screw it." I smoked it. 

It was wonderful and disgusting. My lungs burned. My pretty girl smell was gone. :( And I just wasted $5.39 on what? A crazy woman dance in a parking lot? Hopefully somebody got some entertainment out of it so it wasn't a complete waste. 

I'm trying not to beat myself up too bad. I want to still count today. Is that reasonable? 

Oh, and I'm still stressed as hell. 

Looking back, I think what got me is knowing my husband is smoking today. We're doing this together. He had a really rough day yesterday. Really rough. He caved. He's usually the tough one. He fessed up when I asked him how he had done. I asked what he did with the rest and he said he kept them and would probably smoke today. I counted the patches this morning and his was still there. 

I'm not going to fault the man and it certainly isn't his fault that I got weak. I know he'll get back on track. I have no doubt. I think I need to learn not to ask him how he did each day. I think I just figured, "Well, if he can do it, so can I!"

This is still the longest the longest I've gone without being forced.

Upward and onward...

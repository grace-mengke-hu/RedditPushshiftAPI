Are there people who not only supported smoking tobacco but also cannabis?

I am in the pieces of quitting both but I find it very hard. I am looking for advice, tips experiences anything.I am pretty sure that I can stay of cigs now, but it's the other thing that is giving me a lot of problem.Thanks in advance :)

Guys, I really need your help...

I have been smoke free for 4 plus years! It was amazing. Never thought about them. Even when I drank. Now this new position I'm working on within my company has a lot of smokers. I started going outside with them for social interaction and then I started having a smoke every other day or so. Now I think about cigarettes as soon as I get in to work. Outside of work things are fine and I'm not thinking about smoking. But now at work I constantly feel the cravings and know that it will bleed into all aspects of my life. I'm very disappointed in myself. I smoke a cigarette almost every day now and it feels like it's getting worse. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.....

2 weeks without smoking, feeling pretty down

Using 17.5mg patches.. I am afraid after I remove them  I'll face the real withdrawal.. (I will probably take the 10mg one afterwards). 
Smoking for 10 years, I also didn't choose the right moment to quit probably (having no job and no relationship at the moment and living temporarily at my parents house).
My family keep saying that I should continue smoking.. Because I feel down and for them I shouldn't quit now.. (quitting if you have depression, which I think I have, it's even harder) But I have a feeling that keep smoking would make me feel even worse because I feel like a slave to this addiction. 
Staying strong for now..

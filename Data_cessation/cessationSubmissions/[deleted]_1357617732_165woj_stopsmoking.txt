Almost done with day six! 

This was day six for me. I was what a lot of people consider a light smoker (two-three packs a week), but I still felt like I needed them every time I had a drink (often). Feels good to be six days in! I've been to both smoking bars I frequent (wanting to challenge myself early) and successfully hung out with my smoking friends without being tempted.

I'm on patches for now, so the cravings haven't been that bad. Started out with step two (will be on that for two weeks total) and going with step one after two weeks. Then it's off the nicotine for good.

This is my first time posting, but I wanted to thank this subreddit! Reading all of your stories has been very inspirational. Whenever I think I want one, I pop a piece of sugarfree gum and come here and read everyone's stories. Keep 'em coming! And if anyone has any advice going forward, please share!

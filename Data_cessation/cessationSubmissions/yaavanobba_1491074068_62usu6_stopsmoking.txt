It's been 45 days since I quit smoking. Entire credit goes to this subreddit. But I have a question!

I have been running for a while since quitting and observed that my heart rafe on an average would clock 180 and goes up to 200 at times. Should I be worried or through daily practice will it gradually come down? During normal conditions while working, sleeping etc its around 85-90. I am 23 years old. Please help me out.

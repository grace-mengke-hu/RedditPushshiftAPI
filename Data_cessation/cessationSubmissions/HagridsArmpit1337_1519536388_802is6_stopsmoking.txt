How much did this ruin my progress?

I’m shattered right now, I was 5 weeks smokes free but this past weekend it was my 21st and I was drunk for 3 days straight and was smoking ciggies on those 3 days, now it’s monday, Is it still worth quitting it again or should I keep smoking? if I do quit will I have to wait another 5 weeks before I get better or will it be shorter withdrawal period?

I am...

I am...

- 21 years old

- addicted to marijuana

- a chain smoker

- a heavy sufferer of OCD

- scared of ''unlucky numbers'' because of my OCD. I can't quit on the 12th December because 13th December would be my first "smokefree'' day, can't quit on the 13th of December because the 13th of December would be my last smokeday. I can't quit on the 14th December because ''it's an unlucky number in China and it will ruin my life because of that'' Thanks OCD...

- depressed because I can't quit marijuana and cigarettes on the same day, another symptom of my OCD. I want to quit it all at the same moment.

- quitting smoking today.

I am gonna look my illness right in the eye and tell it to fuck off. I'm gonna stop smoking now. Even if I think it's an unlucky date. Maybe I'll still think that stopping on the 14th will curse me for life, but at least I'm not giving in anymore to my illness...

I'll go talk to a doctor, I promise. Wish me luck.

Made it through my second finals period without a cigarette.

I'm in law school and I decided to quit in November before finals last year after deciding that I couldn't give myself excuses any more and just had to quit.
I had my last final today which means I've made it through finals twice without breaking down and having a cigarette.

Just wanted to share with everyone and tell all of you who are just starting to quit or are thinking about quitting that you can do it!

Convince me not to try marijuana

Hey everyone, I am 15 an have never smoked weed before, but I fear I am dangerously close to trying it for the first time. I have been spending a lot of time during the past few weeks browsing r/trees and have lost sight of the downsides of weed. Please convince me not to try it.

3 WEEKS!

So this is my first post here.  Hope i don't get destroyed for it.  But today marks the 21st day I have been tobacco free.  I'm 25 years old, have been using tobacco for on and off for 7 years.  I've always said that I'm not addicted to it and could quit whenever.  And i've gone a few months without doing it.  But its been years since I tried again.  And three weeks ago I told myself its time to grow up and quit the shit.  Enough talk.  And have been sober since.  Just wanted to share my story with ya'll.  Here's to another day/week/month without the stuff.  Cheers!

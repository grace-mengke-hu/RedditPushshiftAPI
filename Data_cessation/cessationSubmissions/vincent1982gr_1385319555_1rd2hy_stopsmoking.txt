what if smoking has nothing to do with cigarettes

So, I've been an ex-smoker for five or six months. I managed to quit cold turkey, I began exercising, I lost some pounds and apart from one or two moments of strong cravings, I really felt great in my new, non-smoking, healthy self.

And then this really close friend of mine is diagnosed with cancer. It takes two months for his health issue to get under control. So, this whole time I am as supportive as it gets and despite the hard times, I am not even considering smoking, because smoking is really not an option for me any more.

And then, when everything seems fine again and the pressure is supposedly off, I have the strongest and most persistent craving ever. My head feels like it's going to explode, I am dizzy, my mouth feels dry, I am full of tension and I come up with a million excuses for this need to have a cigarette.

"Why do we have to be perfect", "what if my body needs it", "how come I became such a tyrant of my own self", "why do i always have to be the nice guy" etc.

So I buy a pack of cigarettes. I smoke two or three in a row. I don't even finish the third one. I feel really sick of the bad taste, the nausea and the stomach-ache. I throw the pack away, brush my teeth and try to figure the whole situation out.

And the thing I now understand, is that smoking addiction has absolutely nothing to do with cigarettes themselves. It is an addiction of feeling comfort in fulfilling a strong, physical need. In my case, I had to re-create the need of smoking, so I could then fulfill it and feel "well". But five months later, at least I now have the sincerity and the clarity to say to myself that smoking feels like shit, that my non-smoking self was a far better person and that my smoking self does not feel well at all.

It would be so much easier, if smoking felt nice and I could actually become a smoker once again. But the truth is, smoking is really awful.

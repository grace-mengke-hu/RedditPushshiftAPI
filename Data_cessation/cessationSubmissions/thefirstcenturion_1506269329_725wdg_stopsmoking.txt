Fell off the wagon after over 2 months quit.

I'm back down to day 4 and have had to reset my badge sadly. I could handle the stress from work but the break up got me good. Found out my ex is dating the guy she told me not to worry about their just friends, only 3 months after we broke up. Seeing it on facebook I just lost it and before I knew it found myself in a familiar place at the gas station by my house asking for a pack of marb next's. 

I smoked an entire pack that day, and then the next day, and then the day after that before stopping and saying that's enough. I'm disappointed in myself for falling off the wagon just from someone else doing something when they don't even care about me anymore. I shouldn't have let it effect my progress so much but it did and I have to face those facts. 

Welp here we go, back to the drawing board.

NRT vs. Cold Turkey

There is a lot of debate about the best way to quit. Many believe the only way to quit is cold turkey. Others find it's easier to wean themselves off of lozenges, gum, the patch, or e-cigs. What have you found to be the most effective way to quit smoking? 

Personally, I tried lozenges in the past, but fell back into smoking, possibly because I was still putting nicotine into my system.

This time, while I only have 7 days, I quit cold turkey, and I'm feeling really good about it. Whyquit.com recommends that you quit cold turkey, and Joel has a lot of great articles about why cold turkey is the only way to go.

Please give me your thoughts on the subject. How are you quitting? Is it working?

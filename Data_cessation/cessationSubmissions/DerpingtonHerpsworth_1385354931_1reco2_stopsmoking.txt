About 13 years of smoking. Time to try this quitting thing again.

I've never been a super heavy smoker.  I've gone out drinking and finished off a pack that I opened that day but those kinds of things have happened maybe 10 times in those 13 years.  I'm typically closer to a half a pack a day smoker.  Still, regardless of the intensity, a routine you've had for over a third of your life is nothing to sneeze at.

I know all too well how weak willed I am.  Cold turkey is not a very viable option for me.  So this time around I've enlisted the help of a vaporizer.  I know it's really just swapping my nicotine ingestion method to something else, but I'd much rather be stuck using this for the rest of my life than smoking.  

I know some see vaporizers as cheating too, but so be it.  If I couldn't beat this game before, I'll put the konami code in as many times as I need to.

The first night was rough even with the vaporizer, but I've gone about 27 hours now.  The cravings are relentless, but it's gotten a little easier since yesterday already.  

Wish me luck!

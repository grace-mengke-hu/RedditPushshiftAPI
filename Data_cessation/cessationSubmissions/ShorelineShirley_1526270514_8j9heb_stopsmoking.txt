Mood swings and temper tantrums

Being a bitch lately. I reached 2 weeks today, but for the last couple of days I've been snapping at people left and right, getting so angry and worked up. I've also cried like a toddler - sat on the floor and sobbed. I feel full if venom and hate, and I don't know how to make it stop. I'd really been doing so well up to now, with few side effects and a steady reduction in my cravings. This has come out of the blue - I'm not even sure it has to do with not smoking. Maybe this is just how I feel about stuff. Or is it just some weird addicted brain last-ditch psychological warfare to try to make me cave. Maybe I'm going to overreact more and more dramatically to everything around me until I crack. But if I don't stop the tantrums soon, I'll have pushed everyone away and have very little reason left to quit.

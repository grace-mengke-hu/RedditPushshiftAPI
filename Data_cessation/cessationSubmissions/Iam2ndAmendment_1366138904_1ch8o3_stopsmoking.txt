It's been 14 hours since my last smoke...

Fuck I can't hardly focus on anything. I feel like there's imminent doom. It feels like somebody just said an asteroid is 1 hour away from destroying our planet. I am having weird spontaneous pains all over my body. I'm trying to stay busy but I literally am having trouble getting my eyes to focus. It's like I'm hammered.

I’m done... What is a good supplement/liquid/pill I can take to start cleaning my lungs?

... even though I know I can’t really “repair” anything. I’m just really scared all of a sudden that I’ve messed up my insides and want to do what I can to be as healthy as possible going forward... 

Thanks in advance!

Feeling depressed the last few days

The first 3 days were pretty damned crappy, but I felt great at the end of the day knowing I didn't smoke. But in the last few days I've been depressed as hell, I don't want to get up in the morning, I don't feel any joy in doing anything without cigarettes now.

Yet at the same time, I know cigarettes won't really give me back the joy I once had. I just feel empty without them. I'm kinda lost. I think I'll make an appointment with a therapist soon. I want to smoke again, but I don't. This isn't a pleasant feeling.

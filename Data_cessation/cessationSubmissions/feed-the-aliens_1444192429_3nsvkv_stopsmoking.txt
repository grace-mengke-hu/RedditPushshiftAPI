Not sure if I'm on the right sub for this but I need some help.

Two years ago I picked up vaping without even taking a real hit of a cigarette. I started vaping with 6mg of Nicotine. It's been 5 days since I last took a hit of my vape. I wanted to quit vaping because I was spending too much money on juice. These past days I find it hard to get out of bed, be active, and maintain a positive attitude. Is this a sign of withdrawal? If so, how long would it take for my brain to readjust?

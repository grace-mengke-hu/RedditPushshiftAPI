I've always said I could do it... I just needed it to be "the right time"

I started smoking in college... out at the bars with friends who smoked... I wanted to not feel left out.  A year and a half later I met my ex and I quit cold turkey when I moved in with him.  A few years go by, and while working on my second degree I started socially smoking again.  As our relationship fell apart, I eventually graduated from bumming off friends to buying my own.  I kept saying I was going to quit again, that I just needed this to get thru my marriage falling apart.  That passed and then it was still, "I'm gonna quiet, I just need to be ready."  A little over two years go by and I hadn't made any progress.

Well... This past weekend, that time came.  After leaving a movie Friday night with a friend, I had to run to the gas station to buy a pack as I was out... I bought the pack, and told myself this was it.  Sunday afternoon, I smoked the last cig and haven't had another since...


I wish i could say it was as easy as it was the first time around.  Thankfully I have an amazing support network who are supporting me through this, even though I have turned into an insane rage monkey.  I broke down this morning and went to my doctor and am going to start on Wellbutrin. 

Wish me luck!

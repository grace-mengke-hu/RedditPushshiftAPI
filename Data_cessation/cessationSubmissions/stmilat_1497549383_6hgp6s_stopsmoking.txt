Made the decision today!

I've been a smoker for the past 10 years, and over the years I've given it up, taken it back up in a pretty erratic fashion. However, it's been a solid 7 years. Oh gosh, just typing that makes it feel like it's been way too long. 
Anyway, after toying with the idea for a while and having a mentor diagnosed with lung cancer, I decided enough is enough. 
My reasons for quitting:
My health, having as much time as possible on this Earth with my loving and supportive husband, my pet's health, trying to get pregnant, a non-stinky self and home, to be an example to my students that mind-over-matter is a real thing (even when it comes to homework), and (my only vain one) to not look 70 when I'm 40.
I have these posted above my sink in the kitchen and have come up with a few activities/other things to do when a craving arrives. 
If any long term quitters have some extra advice, it would be most appreciated. 
Cheers all! Glad to be joining you in a smoke-free life :)

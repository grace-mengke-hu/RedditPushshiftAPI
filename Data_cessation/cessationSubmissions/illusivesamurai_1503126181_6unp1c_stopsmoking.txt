100 days yay!

Well it's been officially 100 days since a kind redditor bought me the Alan Carr book and I quit smoking. I haven't had a single craving since I quit and I feel amazing. Probably got awhile before the damage I did to my lungs gets better so I can breathe, but I don't plan on getting back into it. Just wanted to share, cause I love this sub and it's positivity.

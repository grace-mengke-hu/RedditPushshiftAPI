I've tried numerous times to quit, but this time I feel more motivated. im finally past my 72nd hour.

Yesterday was complete shit, I was shaky anxious I couldnt stop fidgeting while I was watching tv with my girlfriend. I've been using a nicotine patch just because it does seem to help with my impulses (like when entering a car, after a meal, after sex). 

Im not sure why im posting but I think there might be power in writing out my experience so far. I've been subbed to this for a while, and have stalked and seen all the successes even tried the badges once (that didnt last long.) Anyways Im 21 have been smoking for 6 years, and Im done with it.

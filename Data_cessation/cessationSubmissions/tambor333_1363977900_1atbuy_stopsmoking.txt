Hello, I am Tambor333 and I am addicted to Nicotine 

I quit smoking on March 7th 2013, I am using the 2 mg Lozenge ( about 3-5 a day currently ) and walking for habit modification. 

I am looking to start stepping down the number of lozenges when I get around my 4th week free from tobacco.

Anyway I thought I would add this subreddit to my support options as I free myself from this addiction.

Benefits of Smoking

I quit Opioids cold turkey a few years ago after using everyday for 4-5 years. The hardest part for me was the positives of taking Opioids. Opioids made me feel like everything was going to be okay, they took away my existential anxiety and gave me a real feeling of euphoria. While withdrawaling from Opioids, my mind only thought of the positives and never the (so many) negatives of my addiction.

So I just read "Allen Carr's Easy Way To Quit Smoking " ane I tried thinking of a positive benefit of Smoking 2 packs a day, and I couldn't. Smoking is absolutely pointless, and for some reason I never really thought about it. Reminding myself of this fact, has been helping a lot whenever I have a craving.

I'm only 12 hours without a cig, and who knows if I'll make it, but I definitely recommend "Allen Carr's Easy Way To Quit Smoking". I usually don't like these types of books, but it helped me realize a lot of little things I never noticed about my nicotine addiction. I found it recommended on a bunch of posts on this subreddit and want to thank the people that have shared it. 

By the way, I don't want it to seem like I am implying that quitting Opioids is easier than quitting nicotine. I just want to share my thoughts on the subject.

I know this is pretty much just a big ramble, but it helps me with the cravings. Thanks for reading and thanks for everyone here sharing their knowledge and methods to help others quit.

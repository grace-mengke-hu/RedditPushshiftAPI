17 days as a non-smoker...feeling proud, but these morning cravings are tough! Adderall related?

Hey everyone. 25 y/o now former smoker here. 

I picked the habit up four years or so ago in college, and I was about a half a pack a day smoker for the last two years.

These last two weeks have shown me I can definitely do this, but I wanted to run my scenario by you all to see if anyone else deals with something similar.

I have ADHD and take a 30 mg XR Adderall capsule every morning before work. I've noticed that when I take my adderall, I have a much higher desire to smoke. When I don't take it, I basically have no cravings at all.

As I mentioned, I have been smoke free (no cigarettes, no vaporizer) for the last 17 days. I've been taking my Adderall to show myself I can do this even with the stimulant active, but man, these mornings are TOUGH!

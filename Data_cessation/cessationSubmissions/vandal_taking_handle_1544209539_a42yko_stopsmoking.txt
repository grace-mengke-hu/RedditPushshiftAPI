4 and 1/2 days in, my app sent me here.

I’ve been using the app Smoke free, like I said I’m 4 and 1/2 days smoke free so far.  The apps gives you ‘missions’ everyday and today’s was to visit a smoking cessation website and read at least 10 posts. It recommended this subreddit in particular. I’m already on reddit so wasn’t hard to just pop over and check this place out.

I’ve been smoking a pack a day for at least 20 years. Tried to quit many times but obviously never the forever quit. Today has been the hardest yet. I was messing around on the app because I found myself negotiating with myself into smoking ‘just 1 more’.  The carvings are awful today. Haven’t broken down yet, but have come damn close.

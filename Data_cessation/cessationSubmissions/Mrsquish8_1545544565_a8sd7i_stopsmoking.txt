Going on day 5

Just need to vent, don't care if nobody reads...


I don't really "notice" the withdrawal...but it's so apparent in my behavior. I'm on a family vacation...first time I've seen my fam in 6 months (I'm only quitting under these circumstances Bc I went to the dentist and they told me I have a pre cancerous spot in my mouth). My dad asked me to put together this bedrail for my grandfather and 10 minutes into it I got frustrated and started yelling at my brother for not helping me. I'm exhausted during the day, and restless at night...I didn't think anything of it, but since I haven't taken a shit since I quit almost 5 days ago (I usually go at least once usually twice a day) I googled the symptoms of withdrawal and apparently those are all on there. I wouldn't say my cravings are super intense, but my body is obviously suffering without it. Anyway hopefully im over the hump..fuck cigs

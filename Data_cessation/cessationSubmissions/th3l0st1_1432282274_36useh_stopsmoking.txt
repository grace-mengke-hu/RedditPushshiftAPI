200 Days :D

I wouldn't be at 200 without you guys. And I love the badges. Good stuff to keep me going. :)

4 failed attempts late, I never thought I'd be able to stop smoking, and I accepted that, but after suggestions from someone here, I bought an ecig.  And it definitely helped me get started. And the Allen Carr book made me stop vaping after just a  week. 200 days, and I am clean. No smoking. No vaping.

Btw, does weed count? :P

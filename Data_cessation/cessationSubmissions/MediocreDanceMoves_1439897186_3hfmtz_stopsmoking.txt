Trying to quit, any tips?

I'm new here and looking for some new or unique tips to helping me quit smoking. I went a full 30 days before I caved into smoking again. I'm 26 and have smoked a pack/day for about 12 years. I had recent stressors on the weekend including, my job, break up with girlfriend, and legal issues. It seems when stress comes about I break down and smoke. Thanks!

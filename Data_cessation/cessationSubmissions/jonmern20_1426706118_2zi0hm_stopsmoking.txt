Now the nightmare begins.

A couple days ago I found an old cheap cigar that I busted up and rolled, and theres still enough for a day or two, probably. Or, was enough, rather. I made the decision to quit almost a week ago and smoking more isnt helping anything. I just finished my last smoke while I poured the rest of the busted up cigar into my ashtray (along with stray cigarettes lying around the yard with enough left in them to still light, because I know Ill be desperate enough to try that soon). I poured zippo fluid in and lit a match and boom, there goes my escape. Its gonna be bad for a while but I've made up my mind. I may post a pic of the burning ashtray later if I feel like opening an imgur account.

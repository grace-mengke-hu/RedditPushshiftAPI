1 week without a smoke

Today marks 1 week that I have not had a cigarette.  It also is the 2nd day that I haven't had nicotine replacement.  So far so good.  I am learning my triggers and getting familiar with the things that set me off.  Oh and I am eating like a maniac!  I'll deal with that later.  I just want to say, if your going through this then you know how hard it is.  just keep saying "10 more minutes".  it really works.  For me personally, I cannot look at long term plans.  That freaks me out so each day, I deal with that day.  I don't deal with the thoughts of never having another cigarette otherwise I would smoke.  just deal with today.

Went out on the town without smoking!

It was the first time in like 20 years that I went out on the town at bars with a bunch of friends and didn't miss smoking.  I just was drinking soda water and lime, so it helps that I wasn't buzzed.  But this is huge for me!  A couple of people were smoking and I just felt happy I wasn't a smoker.  I did chew the hell out of some breath mints, but I can live with that.  

I feel like I got this.  Finally.

96 days, and it's been a week of strong, mysterious cravings

I had bad cravings the first two or three weeks, but from late October to basically Christmas I haven't been the least bit interested in smoking.

The past week, though, it's like I'm back in October and all I want is a smoke. I keep reaching for them. I don't know what the problem is. All I can figure is from a few days after Christmas until just yesterday I was completely broke. I had no food and no money for laundry or anything. Back when I smoked, I had this problem all the time (this time it's due to a medical emergency back in December taking up all my "extra" money), and when I was this broke all I could think of was how I could scheme to get cigarettes. Not food, or quarters for the laundry, but just cigarettes. 

Maybe this is just another habit? Every time I'm destitute I crave a smoke because it was always my first priority on payday? I don't know. I just don't understand why nearly 100 days in, after all these weeks of no cravings, I would suddenly want one so bad.

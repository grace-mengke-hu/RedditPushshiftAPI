Too dependent to quit. How did you do it?

I'm a college student and smoking is the only thing wrong in my life. 
I am just too dependent on it with my studies. 
I feel pressured in college with the workload and assignments and I can't do it all without it. I know how shitty this is to believe. 
But I seriously feel that my work will take a hit if I quit.

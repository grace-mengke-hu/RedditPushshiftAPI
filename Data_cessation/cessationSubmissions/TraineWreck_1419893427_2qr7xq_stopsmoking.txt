Today... it finally happened...

Got into the elevator at work with a coworker who had just had a smoke.  For the first time since I quit I didn't take a wistful sniff... didn't think for a second that I could "just have one..."

For once, he was just that guy who smelled like an ashtray in the elevator rather than the guy who was having what I couldn't.  

It made me smile :)

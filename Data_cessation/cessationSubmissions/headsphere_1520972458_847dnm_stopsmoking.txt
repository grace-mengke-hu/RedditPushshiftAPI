Really want to quit, but still have a lot of outside stress. Need advice please.

So here goes...everything in here has been in the last 2 months.

I've nearly destroyed the relationship I had with the closest woman to me in my life (I've known her for 5 years, been intimate before) We're supposedly on our way to 'making up', but she's still maintaining a distance which stresses me out.

Then there's my best friend (male) of 7 years with whom I'm currently in a huge disagreement with. It's affecting my plans for the future, and it might kill our friendship. As you can imagine, that's stressful too.

Then there's the uncertainty of my future. I literally do not know where I might end up in the next 2 months, I do not have a job or a decent amount of experience to find a good one, and although I've got a little financial support from family when really need be (thank god for that) it's definitely not something I'm proud of. More stress.

Here's what's positive: I barely drink anymore and plan on abstaining as much as possible (the moment I have a cold beer or any other alcoholic beverage, it makes my nicotine craving 100 times stronger)
  
Every morning for close to 2 weeks now, I've been doing sets of 20 pushups. Sometimes I do 2, sometimes 3. I know it's nothing compared to people who actually go to the gym, but it's the best I can motivate myself to do right now.


Now, about my smoking...I roll my own tobacco, and I have a bit over half the pouch left, with filters and papers. I have maybe 30-35 cigs worth of tobacco left. I've already had 2 today.

I've attempted to quit maybe 3 - 4 times in the last 5 years. Every time was the big dramatic destroying of it all, only for life to kick me in the shins shortly after and screwing it up for me.

I think it would definitely be easier for me to quit if I didn't have all this anxiety...fuck, I wish I could afford a 3 month rehab retreat or something, lol.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

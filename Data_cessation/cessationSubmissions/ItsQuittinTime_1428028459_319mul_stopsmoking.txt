Just smoked my last cigarette

I just smoked my last cigarette. I've been smoking for about 5 years now, and enough is enough. I am tired of leaving my friends to grab a smoke, I am tired of breaking up my work day so I can have a smoke, I am tired of spending countless dollars on a habit, but I am mostly tired of lying.

My family and girlfriend thought I quit years ago, but that was short lived. Ever since, I have been sneaking them in when I'm alone. I had to create a throwaway account for this because of my lies.

I already gave my fresh pack away so I have no temptation to have just one more. I know I have a long road ahead of me, but it's one I have to take.

Any advice for dealing with cravings and words of wisdom will be gladly accepted.

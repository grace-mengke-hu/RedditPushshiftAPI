I'm having a little trouble, and it's only the first day

So yesterday on my drive to work I had my usual morning cig which just happened to be the last on in the pack. I figured I'd make it through the day and end up buying one of those vapor pens the guys I work with use to try and ween myself off. Yesterday was fine, I only smoke two or three a day anyways so I wasn't bothered until this morning. That bothered feeling stuck with me all day, so of course as soon as I got out of work I headed to the nearest vapor pen place. As soon as I walk in I'm hit with a cloud of fruity, humid, warm air. It was so disgusting, almost like walking into a room filled with people smoking real cigs but fruitier. I couldn't take it and left. So after I got back in the car I decided I should just quit cold turkey. My dad did over a decade ago, why can't I? Anyways, I just wanted to rant a little. Any advice is welcome, I'm not too familiar with the board itself.

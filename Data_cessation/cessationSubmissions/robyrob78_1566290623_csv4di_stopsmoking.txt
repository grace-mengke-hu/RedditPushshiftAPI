Cancer Scare

Hey guys, I'm a male 26 YO. I had some sores in my mouth and went to the dentist for the first time in 5 years (I know, I should go regularly). I'm a pretty heavy drinker (which multiplies the risk of having mouth cancer) and I basically thought the worst ( mouth cancer). Let me tell you, finding those sores and expecting it to be something bad was one of the scariest things I've ever been through. I smoke when I'm drunk, maybe 10 cigs a month. The dentist cleared me and said it was just routine trauma from maybe biting my cheek or grinding my teeth, but it really opened my eyes. It made me consider my own mortality, and led me to the obvious conclusion that tobacco products have no beneficial qualities and only hurt your overall health. If I can offer any advice, It'd be this, I'm a party guy and really enjoy a drunk cigarette but please please please consider your long term health. I 'm cutting out cigarettes, the idea that you'll have to go through radiation, or worse, be disfigured because they have to operate on your mouth, it just isn't worth it. This post is geared towards casual smokers like myself, no one is immune and cancer is fucking scary. I know it's tough, but please stop smoking.

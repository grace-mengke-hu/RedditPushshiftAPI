4 months!!! Treated myself.

I haven't smoked 3000 cigs, saved $1200.  I recently built myself a new computer as my stop smoking gift.  Spent more than $2000 on it, but I'll make up the difference in no time.  Plus three 27" monitors are so nice.  May replace my graphics card with a GTX 1080 card once those come out.

I'm a little addicted to spending the "cigarette" money now, even if the spending is outpacing the savings.  I think it helps to get some nice things, and think about how you used to light that money on fire in a quest for suicide.  When I quit for a year, I may buy a truck.

Where did my motivation go?

Tonight would have been my 2 week mark at not smoking had I not relapsed Monday night because of a stressful day at work. I quit cold turkey, and was extremely proud of myself throughout my 10 day run. 

I never thought I would have lasted 10 days, when I stopped 2 weeks ago. Furthermore I said to myself that if I made a week there was NO WAY I would go back. 

I've bought 3 packs so far. That is almost a pack a day. I now have a fear or anxiety about trying to quit again that I did not have the first time. I can't bring myself to crumple up my cigs. I'm almost scared at how I could go from where I was to where I am so quickly.

Any thoughts? Thanks.

I'm on day 3 amd feeling way better than I thought I would.

I don't know if this is the right sub to share this but I feel like talking about how great I feel and all my friends are smokers so they don't really get it. 

I've been a pack a day smoker for almost 10 years. I've tried quitting before and never had any luck but for some reason it is just working right now. 

Sunday night I bought a pack and some beers thinking it would be my last hurrah and just smoke and drink a bunch. I knew I would have to quit drinking to quit smoking so I figured lets do this right. I also bought a cheap gas station ecig to handle the shakes I might get.

Day 1 was rough. I have an annoying co worker who was relentlessly talking to me about bullshit I do not care about. The ecig helped me get through the day. But I didn't break. When I got home I didn't touch the ecig crutch.

Day 2 was a lot better. I would reach for the ecig during my habitual moments and after a puff or two I realized I didn't really want it and stopped. Went to work and the last time I used it was 7:30 pm last night. 

Today is day 3. I woke up three and a half hours ago and have had some mild cravings but I'm able to convince my self I don't need it.

I'm just really excited that this might finally be the time I quit for good. I've never felt this confidant about quitting  and my lungs already seem to be clearing up a little.

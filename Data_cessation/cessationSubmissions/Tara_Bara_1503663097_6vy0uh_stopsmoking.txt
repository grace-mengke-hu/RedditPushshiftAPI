Thoughts on Wellbutrin?

I'm thinking about asking for a prescription from my doctor, but was wondering about other people's experiences using the drug. Does it help to quit smoking? Any gnarly side effects? I don't know what's wrong with me, but I can make it for a week or so, then I relapse. I'm to the point of desperation.

Please spare me the lecture about willpower and what not. I've tried everything except hypnosis to quit smoking, and I'm to the point of feeling defeated. This thing's got a stronghold on me, so I'm willing to try anything if it might help. Everyone quits in their own way, so I'm really just looking for advice from people who have used Wellbutrin and their experiences.

Thank you.

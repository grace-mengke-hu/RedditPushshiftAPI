Nine days smoke-free

I honestly didn't think I could do it; failed and failed and failed over the years. It doesn't help I've been drinking more lately with a fairly stressful job, which led to pushing two packs a day easy.

Coincidentally had to move, and the apartment I loved has very strict rules on smoking (basically: NO, not in the house, not on the balcony, not anywhere in or near the building). Knowing cold turkey/patches/gum do not work for me, I went to the vape store. Cheap e-cigs did not work in the past but the salesman hooked me up with an intermediate starter kit... I didn't even finish the half a pack I had left that day, threw them out.

I get maybe one real craving a day. It passes quickly. I think even if I had cigarettes on me I wouldn't actually smoke one.

I'm disgusted by how badly I ruined my stuff, the smoke smell moved into my new apartment. Throwing everything out isn't an option so... Febreze Febreze Febreze. It's fading. Still disgusting. It is just in EVERYTHING. The couch was the worst.

Vaping worked for me. I can't believe it. I'm not out of the woods yet obviously as the taper down is yet to come but I am so glad I finally found something that gave me the power to banish cigarettes from my life once and for all.

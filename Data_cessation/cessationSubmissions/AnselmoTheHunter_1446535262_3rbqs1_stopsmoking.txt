I stopped.

I haven't had a cigarette in a week plus, before that, I had about pack over the span of a week and a half. I came down with a rather nasty lung infection and was put on an antibiotic. I started my meds last Monday - because I was coughing so much, in so much pain - I decided to just give up smoking all together.

However, from my very "loose internet / probably not reliable" research it appears that my hacking, wheezing, chest tightness, and being short of breath all appears to be cigarette withdrawal symptoms? Has anyone else had this before? I am a week in my antibiotic treatment, and I have another week to go. 

Has anyone else experienced these withdrawals? It is kind of scary to be honest, I have decided to go to the doctor tonight to make sure I don't have a tumor in my lungs because that is what it feels like, and I am a paranoid idiot. 

Edit: I had my first cig at 16. I am 29 now. I would say that I really started smoking at 21, and then I moved abroad and started smoking even more. About a pack a day - I moved abroad four + years ago.

Quit date set!

I've been smoking half a pack a day for 25 years. I've made several attempts to quit in the past and feel that with support this time around I'll actually succeed. For the first time, I've joined a support forum and downloaded an app to help me with daily cravings. Congrats to everyone who've been successful at quitting. For those who've had relapses...don't look at it as a failure, take it as a learning experience and as long as you keep trying you haven't failed. :)

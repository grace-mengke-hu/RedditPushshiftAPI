Muscle aches without doing exercise, anyone? (3 days) I'm scared

Well, I quit cigs a few months ago, started myself out with the standard 1.2% ecigs. I decided that I finally needed to quit nicotine iteslf, and what better time than now, right?

I feel like my mind is muddied, I have a long-lasting headache in the back of my skull. I have muscular feelings that are not painful, just unpleasant, but they last for as long as I'm anxious about smoking, my life, my love life, and school. 

Has anyone experienced similar anxiety-induced muscular pains?

I'm startin' to quit and I'm gonna need tips!

First of all I'd like to say sorry for my (posibly) bad English, I'm spanish and here we most have a poor level.

Today I've decided to quit smoking by the cold turkey method, and I'm partially scared. My main fear are the university moments, because I have many mates that smoke too and I feel embarrassing saying to them that I'm not  gonna smoke anymore and a few days later if I fall in my purpose, having to hear their jokes about I failed to quit.

I've tried to quit a lot of times and most of my insicurities came to my head when I had a crave ( for example, I think about my ex gf, and why she left and the bad things I did during that relationship, or I feel so worried about my studies). I don't know if these kind of thinkings and feelings are because of the lack of nicotine.

Thank you to all people that read me and people who answer me !!

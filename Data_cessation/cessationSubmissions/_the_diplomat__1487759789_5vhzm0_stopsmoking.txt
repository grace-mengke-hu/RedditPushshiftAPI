Finding it hard to stick to 3 days or more, back again.

I just tried to quit and it was going well until day 3 when I had a drinking and started to smoke around 5-10 in the evening. The next day I didn't have any at work and then had a glass of red wine then had 3. Today I woke up and had a cigarette to work. 

It's clear to see that drinking is triggering me want to want to smoke again. Unfortunately, it feels like my will power to quit again has gone and it feels like I will be smoking today. 

I need to quit again and want to. Please can someone offer me a tip of advice or a harsh truth to get me started again. I feel like I need to get this sorted now.

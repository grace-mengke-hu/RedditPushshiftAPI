I want to quit smoking. But so far, I just can't. Help, please.

As I've said in the title above, I want to quit smoking.  I've tried patches, gum, lozenges, cold turkey, organised NHS quitting programmes, even the Allen Carr book, and despite a desire to quit, so far I've drawn a blank.  This is despite the encouragement of people I care about, along with a full understanding of the manifold benefits of quitting, as opposed to carrying on.  I'd rather not try champix, hypnotherapy and e-cigs, mainly due to a lack of resources right about now, so I need some tips and pointers if any of you have them.  

I have to stop, I want to stop, and I know I need to stop, but such is the nature of my addiction and the hold it has over me, it makes it very difficult to make the final leap.  The longest I've managed is about 4 weeks.  I can't bear this addiction any more, as I know in the end it will kill me.  I've already had a cough that has lasted six weeks.    If this group can help function as some sort of online nicotine addicts anonymous, so much the better.  Just please, anything.

I'm not using a throwaway for this post, incidentally.  But I'm reaching out as right now, this appears to be my last resort.  So if you can see it in your heart to help this willing but apparently for some reason reluctant quitter, please help.

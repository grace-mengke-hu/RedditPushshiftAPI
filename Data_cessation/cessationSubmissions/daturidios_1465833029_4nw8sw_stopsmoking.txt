How does it feels

I'm on the 8th day of no smoking, smoked for 15years, I'm 31 having some breathing issues last couple of years.  I've tried everything to get rid of them but, except quit smoking, silly me.


So here I am feeling some type of of general physical and psychological improvements after I quit, par example, less fatigue, or better concetration at given tasks, but I would like to know from your experiences what it feels after 1 or 9 months, etc. Is there any more improvment, or a big plateau after hitting the next level? in other words what were the big landmarks ( Im not asking for the pop list, 20min to 15 years, just personal experiences).

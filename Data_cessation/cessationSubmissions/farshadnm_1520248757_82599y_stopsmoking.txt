Vaping with 0mg nicotine

hi. i'm 9 days in and i still crave cigarettes,specially if i'm out with friends who smoke or after a meal and whatnot. been smoking for 13 years since 15 yo.
i want to get a vape and start vaping with 0 nicotine because i'm not that much addicted to nicotine, but to the act of smoking itself. my question is that is it safe? there aren't any helpful resources on vaping out there. is vaping with 0 nicotine harmful in any way? would it affect my workout or my breathing? i know it's better that real cigs or vaping with nicotine, but still. what do you guys think?

Today is the first day of the rest of my life (day 1)

I have made the commitment to myself. My SO is on board, but may not be quitting for a few more days. We have an e-cig that we're going to use for him to taper down on, since he's a much heavier smoker than I am. I plan to use it when I have weak moments.

Thanks for existing.

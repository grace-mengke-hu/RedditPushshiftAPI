Smoked a pack but now quit again. 30+ days people help.

I smoked a pack on day 23 of my qutting. But now ive quit again and not smoked for the past 4 days.

I cant understand why i smoked that pack but i think it was just a hindrance in my quit process.

I hope it doesnt happen again.

Question to all 30 day+ people : Did any of you smoke 1-2 ciggs in the first 30 days ?

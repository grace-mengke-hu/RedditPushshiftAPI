I need some advice in order to convince my dad to stop smoking.

I'm sorry if this kind of post is not what this sub is intended for but I really care about my dad and I need some outsiders perspective on what helped them in order to stop smoking for good.

My dad is in his early 50s now and has been a smoker for many years (about a pack a day). He manages two gas stations so he has no way of avoiding contant with cigerettes during his daily routine. I asked him to please try and stop but I guess that doesn't help a lot when you're not motivated yourself.
I tried to threaten him with things like "if you're not going to stop I will start" but wasn't serious about it. So basically I'm just trying to find a way to motivate my dad to finally stop. I'm 23 and have never been a smoker, neither a dad so I just can't relate to it at all.

Do you have any advice on what got you motivated or any tips on what worked for you ? 
Any kind of story or advice is very welcome. Thank you.

So I quit smoking...

I quit smoking. 8 weeks in. Started smoking when I was 17 because it was cool as shit. Classic story. “I just smoke when I drink” blah blah. Ended up smoking through the day sober and didn’t stop for 12 years. The funny thing is what it took me to quit. I had had a steady income for those 12 years never being out of a job. I quit my job because I fucking hated it towards the end and had enough savings to be like “fuck it. I’m awesome. I’ll find something easy” turns out I wasn’t so awesome and couldn’t find shit for 6 months. Any way I simply couldn’t pay rent/food/bills anymore and continue to smoke. Average around 3 – 4 packs a week at $27.00 a pack (that’s a pack of Peter Stuyvesant 26’s classics. I live in Australia) was money I no longer had the luxury of going without. It’s been 8 weeks in now and I wish that I had been put in this situation 12 years ago. Once you start seeing the financial/health benefits (sense of taste was the biggest for me health wise) coming back you can’t justify why you even did it in the first place. My girlfriend still smokes (because she can still afford it) and I have friends who still smoke around me (I never want to become one of those non smoking faggits who bitch and moan about smokers. I hate those cunts) but it gets easier every day. Another thing that helped was to have some control over something in your life and not be such a fucking pussy. That challenge is great and a real motivator also. Every time I want a cigarette I just tell myself “if you can’t go without a cigarette how the fuck are you going to succeed at anything in your short shitty life?” that helps. 56 days in and I honestly believe I will not go back. Hope this helps anyone. X

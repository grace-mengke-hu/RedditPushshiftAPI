Staying Accountable

I really messed up today! Today was my fourth day free and I bought a pack of cigs and smoked half the pack.  I have no excuse except I was so stressed out from my problems at home and I couldnt take the emotional pain.  Why when others hurt us, we then do something like smoking to hurt ourselves? I will reset my app and start over tomorrow. Blessings to all of you.

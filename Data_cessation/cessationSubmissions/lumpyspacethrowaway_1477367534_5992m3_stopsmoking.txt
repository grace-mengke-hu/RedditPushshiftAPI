i have failed day after day and need advice

I have been trying to quit for the past two weeks and have only managed to go from half a pack a day to two cigarettes a day. I hate being so dependent on cigarettes but struggle constantly with feeling like i need to keep that dark side of my self. I hate even writing this because it sounds so.. stupid and needy and just sad. Like grow up, self, youre not a "dark and mysterious" 16 year old theatre kid anymore. Has anyone else struggled with this feeling? That cigarettes are a part of your identity? Its almost midnight and i will start again tomorrow and try harder but if anyone has any motivation or advice, please throw it my way.

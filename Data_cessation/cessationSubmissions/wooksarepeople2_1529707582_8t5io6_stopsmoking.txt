5 Days in. Still feeling uneasy.

Hey all,  
I made a post a week ago about how I was going to stop smoking after looking at my budgeting. Well I went home to see my family, smoked and drank like crazy all weekend. I woke up Monday morning without a pack in my pocket and drove back to where I live. I haven't touched one since. All cold turkey.   


The first two days was a breeze. It wasn't until the 3rd day it hit me like a ton of bricks. I went to the bank to deal with an issue and I've never felt so irritable. It latest the rest of the day and I got stuck in terrible traffic. I know this is not me. All I could think about is how I hated and loved cigs. I'm three days in, I'm not going to break.  


Now comes today. It's Friday. I'm drinking and I'm worried. I still want one. If I'd buy a pack I'd probably smoke half of it tonight.   


When the fuck do I get to calm down again?

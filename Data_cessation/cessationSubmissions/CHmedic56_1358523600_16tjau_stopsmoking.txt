Using working out to keep me focused. Down 15 pounds!

I was so afraid i would gain weight when i quit that i told myself i would start working out. I was around 290 pounds when i quit. I have been working out every day and dieting. It's amazing how in a little over two weeks you can go from being so unhealthy to feeling so great!

edit: I quit cold turkey and started dieting the same day. Started working out 5 days later

Any tips to help with cravings...

Hey guys. I quit smoking for around 3 years. Recently I've been under quite a bit if stress and stupidly turned to smoking. 

  I've only been having the odd cigarette here and there but I've cut it out again. I am getting small cravings when I am stressed and was just wondering if you have any tips to help with these? Thank you.

I really need help

this isn't a post bragging about another month or so without nicotine, this is a rant so sorry in advance but i have nobody to talk to. i was a poly substance addict, using alcohol, marijuana, xanax, hydros and a variety of stimulants for an unhealthy amount of time. i've developed depersonalization disorder from an insane amount of LSD abuse, and i still get cravings.

every single waking moment.

It's awful, it really is. out of everything i've been addicted to nicotine has been the worst. i don't know what to do, i'm not gonna end my 47 day streak but i cannot imagine a life without nicotine. fuck, i can't imagine a life without drugs. i really hope i can look back at this post in time and be happy i made it but i honestly don't know if i'll even be alive by then if i break this sober pact.

I'm not even out of high school and i am a disappointed. i'm sorry and i know this isn't really the right support sub but this has been my favorite home for a while now. i have nobody to talk to at all.

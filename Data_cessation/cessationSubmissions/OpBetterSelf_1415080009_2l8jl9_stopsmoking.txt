Today is the day

Well fellow redditors, I only started smoking 4 or 5 months ago as a sort of stress relief. I had a very stressful job over the summer, and the only mental type of break I could get was the sit with some of my friends that I worked with and have a cigarette. I told myself I would stop as soon as the school year hit (I'm a uni student). And of course I rationalized and kept smoking. I've been trying to quit, but around day 3 I would be having a lousy day and tell myself "Who gives a F***, I want a cigarette" and I would start again. I found this group and you all seem like pretty awesome people, and I know it's time to stop. I hope to become smoke free alongside some of you who successfully stopped. This is day 1.

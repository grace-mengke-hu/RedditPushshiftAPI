I quit smoking 4 days ago. Oooo look at me...

I've smoked half a pack+ of cigarettes everyday for the past 9 years and decided 4 days ago that I'm done - finito. I'm actually having a great time - I find it humerus as the physical and emotional affects of addiction plague me. It's like when something hurts so bad that you laugh - I guess that's the best way I can describe it. It feels more like an experiment to me, even though it's my body that I'm analyzing. Liberating indeed.
       I've never been one to cherish human life, nor take it seriously for a second - so in my mind smoking fit with my personality. The whole 'kill yourself slowly because you're too scared to do it quickly' always made me chuckle and rang of truth. I've always valued human life greatly, much more than my own. I'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal. In fact, I live an amazing life. I've never had to try and get laid, always had plenty of friends, everything has seemed easy all of my life. I graduated early, started a business, fucked around, surfed a lot, and I do some serious damage to the female human vagina. These past few days I feel extremely energetic, confident as hell, and my thoughts are clear and sharp. Obviously the cravings hit, a wave of confusion, a little anxiety, then back to feeling great. The liberation of quitting something as addicting as cigarettes can really make you change your life. I could truly see myself making lots of big changes, solely because of the liberation of cigarettes. Pretty cool stuff. Thanks for reading.

Psychedelic experience with my cat + being sick have kept me smoke-free since Tuesday. But what happens when I get better?

Brief background: Smoking for 11 years. I quit in November for about 40 days. I'd come off of being sick enough that I couldn't smoke and my motivator was to enjoy Christmas with my bf's family. After the holidays, I "accidentally" eased back to smoking.

On Tuesday I came down with strep throat and didn't smoke because the thought of cigarettes made me ill. I got a penicillin prescription and started feeling better by Wednesday night, so I thought it'd be okay if I had the last puff of my bf's marijuana joint. It wasn't.

I coughed harder than I've ever coughed. I was drooling and had to get down on all 4s. I could literally feel the sickness move from my throat to my nose and I've been in bed with flu-like symptoms pretty much ever since. 

I was also really stoned. Not long after I coughed, my cat, who's been on steroids for a while for possible asthma had a cough, longer and louder than I'd ever seen him do. (Looking back, I feel really dumb and guilty for not putting the smoking and his coughing together. I don't have any experience with asthma, we haven't had him for very long, and asthma was only a guess by the vet). 

In my stoned mind, I couldn't stop thinking about his cough, my cough, and the weed smoke - really just smoke in general and how bad it is for our bodies. I mean, duh, smoke is bad. But I feel like I had a revelation where I *really* realized it this time. 

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to tell my story and get advice for when I'm not sick anymore - for when the thought of smoking isn't physically repulsive.  Has anyone else been able to quit due to sickness? Did it keep you smoke-free in the long run? How do I remember my "revelation" when the cravings come back up?

**tl;dr**  Sick. Didn't smoke cigarettes. Smoked weed. Got sicker. Made my asthmatic cat cough. Tripped on that. What next?

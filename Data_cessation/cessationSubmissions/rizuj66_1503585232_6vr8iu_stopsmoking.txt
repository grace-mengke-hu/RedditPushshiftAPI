This quitting lark works!!

Well after being so disheartened a couple days ago, now I'm stoked! Have been hitting the gym a lot since quitting, but no real cardio, mainly strength. So tonite I thought I'd try a jog. And holy shit, what a difference 23 days smoke-free makes!! I was able to comfortably jog 3km on the treadmill without feeling like I was going to die. My heart rate maxed out at  15bpm lower than it used to do when jogging, but i was never able to jog that far without a real struggle - this was like 'Yeah, that's a good start but i could probably have done more'. Amazing stuff!! I had set a goal of doing a 5km race in November, and now I actually think it will be totally doable!! Yessssss ðŸ˜€

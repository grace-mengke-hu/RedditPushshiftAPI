Tips for those quitting with New Year Resolutions!

Hey folks! I thought now would be a good time for those of you with tips to share who might want to help out the wave of people who are **GOING** to quit smoking in 2014! Here's mine, but be sure to add your own!

* Joel over at [Why Quit](http://whyquit.org/) has a lot of amazing resources for free. He runs stop smoking clinics in the real world, and puts his talks up online for free to help smokers quit on their own.

* One of the things I learned from Joel, is that when you quit smoking, your body needs to relearn how to regulate blood sugar. See, when you smoke, your brain releases adrenaline, and that causes your liver to release sugar in a case of 'fight or flight'. Since your quitting smoking, be sure to eat often (It will be hard, I know) but if you let your blood sugar spike often, you'll attribute the feelings to the smoke, rather than what it really is. To help with this I just drank a lot of cranberry and orange juice the first few days. Its not the healthiest thing if your trying to diet too - but it wont hurt you for a few days. 

* There's a lot of debate in this subreddit on the types of 'quit'. NRT in the form of patches and e-cigs doesn't remove the addiction, it just replaces it with a safer product. While I'm in the 'if your going to quit, then do it all the way' boat, I did use an E-Cig early on. You can find them with 0 MG juice, and use that during the times that you really get a craving. essentially what you do is trick your brain into thinking that even if I -want- a cigarette, all I'm going to get is some vapor, and no nicotine. I used it often at the start, and progressed downward after a month or two, and now I don't use one at all. 

* In addition to having lots of gum & candy, try cutting some straws down to about the size of a cigarette. You can chew on those during the day, and you get the feeling of having a smoke between your lips. 

* **DONT LET YOU TALK YOURSELF OUT OF IT** There is no 'maybe', there is no 'if this doesn't work'. This WILL work, and its going to work. There's not going to be a next time, and there is **NOTHING** that will stop you. I have zero willpower. If I can quit, so can you. Bring it on 2014!

My SO has gone a month without smoking. Reddit, I'm proud! Welcome words of encouragment!

He's been smoking for about fifteen years, and it's been a month since he touched a cigarette. The beginning was really hard, but at this point he's over the shakes and is just fighting off the urge to smoke when his mind is not occupied. He's also been working out and eating much better, and I want to proclaim how proud I am. Words of encouragment are most welcome.

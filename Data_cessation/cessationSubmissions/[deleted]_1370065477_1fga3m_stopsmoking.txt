Slight slip up, but I think I handled it greatly.

I had an hour and a half drive to make today on nearly no sleep. This never happens to me but i caught myself dozing off and leaving my lane several times on a major highway, both the to left and the right.

Now, coffee doesnt work on waking me up, niether do energy drinks, neither does a sugary snack, loud music, and neither does a soft drink. As much as I didn't want to do this, I went in and bought a pack of smokes in order to make it home safely.

I smoked 3 on the way home to keep myself awake. They didn't taste good, it wasn't fun, and it didn't even give me a buzz as I couldnt take deep hits, however they did keep myself and the drivers around me safe for the rest of the trip. Oh and did I mention how I felt like complete shit doing this? When the cashier set the pack on the counter she must have thought I was nuts because I know I stared down at them in disgust and disappointment.

I forgot I had even bought these (the same day) and just found them in my office. Thinking they were an old pack I forgot to throw out from weeks ago, but I open them and theres 17 cigarettes staring me in the face.

I felt like a failure, I felt like shit, I felt like a truly let myself down. So you know what I did? I cracked every one of those fuckers right in half.

As I literally only smoked a couple to extend my life further than 10 minutes into the future with the way I was dozing off driving (i was truly scared of running right off the highway), and my immediate disgust at seeing them again and breaking them all, what do you think?

Also if you were me would you reset your badge? I love seeing the thing there as a reminder to how many days its been since I've changed my life.

Thanks again /r/stopsmoking you guys are the only ones that listen to my bullshit, and I truly appreciate it.

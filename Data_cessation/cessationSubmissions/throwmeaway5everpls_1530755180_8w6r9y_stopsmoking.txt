Almost caved today

I battled a craving for about a straight hour today, convincing myself it was OK to go buy a pack. I told myself it was gratification for making it one week, and that it was not failure, but a break. I gave myself a choice, with this $10 I could buy one pack or three cups of coffee tomorrow. I got my phone, wallet, and keys and headed to the car. I even brought my lighter, which has been sitting in the same spot on the counter this entire week.

Everything was great, I walked out to my driveway with the grace of a king. I was so ready for a nice smoke. As soon as I started my car, I felt so dissatisfied with myself. Deep down I knew this was a horrible idea. Even if I still plan to quit afterwards, I know I've just wasted my own time, and I would probably hate myself for the next week.

As I pulled out of my street, I'm blinded by the bright sign for dunkin donuts, and had a sudden revelation of coffee. I continued no further. I pulled right in and got myself a large iced, which I'm now enjoying to the greatest extent, in my bedroom at 9.30 pm.

I haven't been so proud of myself in years.. 

Today marks 8 full days without a cigarette. A nice downgrade from one pack per day. I'm really happy I have coffee though

Just a dream

I just had a cigarette in my dream. I thought it was real. I felt bad that on my dream I gave in. I said to myself that it's ok, I could just try again, but I felt sad. Then, I woke up feeling bad realising what I dreamt of, but feeling great knowing that it was just a dream. Not another puff, no matter what. I'm 9 days smoke free.

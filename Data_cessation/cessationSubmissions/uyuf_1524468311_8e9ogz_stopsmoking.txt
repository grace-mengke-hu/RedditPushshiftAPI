Almost 2 months in, never been happier.

Hey, thought I'd just make a post discussing my feelings towards quitting smoking as I'm nearly two months in. Hopefully this will give some encourage to people who are struggling, or lurkers who may be interested in quitting. 

Basically, quitting smoking has been like this catalyst that I've needed in my life. I've always felt as if smoking acted like a dam blocking the flow of water. I'd think to myself "why eat a healthy meal if I'm just going to smoke afterwards?" or "why exercise if I'm already destroying my body?" To begin with I thought it was nice having this "I don't care" attitude, but it's not until now that I've realised how much of a hinderance it has been. 

Quitting smoking encouraged me to care more for my body, so I changed my diet and replaced snacking with eating fruit, and recently joined a gym to start working on toning my body. It's insane how much your body rewards you when you begin to look after it. 

My outlook on smoking has massively changed too. I look at my friends who are still smoking and fail to see the appeal of it anymore. The smell disgusts me, and the thought of having a cigarette just doesn't attract me. 

I've been taking quitting pretty seriously for the past 6 months or so, trying numerous times to quit and failing, and I'm glad that my determination to quit has finally paid off. I've still got a long way to go, but damn, I've never been happier. 

If you're having a rough day and can't see the point, trust me, it does get better. It gets so much better. All the pain and suffering will just be a distant memory. Withdrawal is temporary and you will thank yourself later for the struggle. Thanks for reading.

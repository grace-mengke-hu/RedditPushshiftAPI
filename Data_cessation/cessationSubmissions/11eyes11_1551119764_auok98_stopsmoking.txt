How bad did i mess up

I quit smoking cold turkey 35 days ago, and today I had 3-4 puffs while out with a friend, but ended up throwing the rest of the thing. I'd been noticing way better breathing and started running as well. I'm sure it's mostly in my head but my breath is shallower. Is there any hope? How do I get myself to be more determined I'm totally broken. Help!!!

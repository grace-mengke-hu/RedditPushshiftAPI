I've decided to stop because I'm afraid.

For a while now I've had constant pains in my chest, sort of a dull ache, and despite having gone to the doctor and being told a large part is anxiety, I know it's the smoking.

So I've decided to stop. But a part of me is so afraid that it's too late. I've been smoking since the start of last year, purely socially. But it turned into a pack a day situation a few months ago as my addiction to it just got worse.

I'm just so afraid it's too late, because I'm not sure what this ache is. So I'm going to stop, and if it gets worse I'll get more professional help. 

What are your guys' thoughts?

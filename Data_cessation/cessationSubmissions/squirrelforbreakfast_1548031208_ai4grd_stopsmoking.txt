I have to. I can’t keep smoking.

I’m recovering from a do-over of a bone surgery two years ago. They said the first one may have healed properly if I had quit smoking. I have three cigarettes left. I’m rationing them -one per day - till they’re gone, thinking if I wean myself off them, then leaving them altogether will be easier. It’s difficult picking when during the day I’ll have my one smoke. I’m on pain pills and they seem to kick a little harder after a smoke, but I know I’m only hurting myself. I like smoking, but I also like walking. I haven’t been able to run in over two years, and hearing one of my favorite things is keeping me from it hurts. I need motivation to actually put them down for good. I don’t feel good about the short leash I feel like cigarettes have me on. I can’t do NRT, because nicotine is the thing that’s keeping me from healing. I’ve smoked for over 20 years - more than half of my life. I’ve tried to quit four separate times in the past 12 years, and none of them for longer than 6 months. I have to get my mind in the right place. I can’t go to the bookstore and thanks to the recent surgery, I don’t have spare cash to buy support materials. Can anyone offer advice, resources, or maybe just a good kick in the ass I need to get this done and through?

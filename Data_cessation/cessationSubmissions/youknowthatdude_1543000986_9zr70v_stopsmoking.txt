I need some help

Hi! I need some help, i have smoked since i was 13 and im now 23. The last few years ive started smoking a lot more, like 15+ on weekdays and 20+ on weekends if im out. I have tried to quit before without any help but always started again after just a few days. I am wondering if you have any tips or things i could replace ciggs with while im getting past the first few weeks/ months. I have been thinking about getting a vape and then stop using nocotine in it after a while, thoughts? Thank you for reading.

I failed. Will try again

Exactly one month ago (27/06) I had my last cigarette. The days after that were easy and I kept asking myself why i hadnt done that before. Why is it so hard for others? 

I would do my stuff that would usually be followed by a cigarette without any problem. I went out to drink with my smoker friends, no problem. I live with smokers, no problem. I would light one after work but now it wasn't a problem.

Even when facing some depressive episodes, I would think "hey, you know the cigarette isnt gonna get you out of this mess, right? dont do it" and thats the only situation where I had to "argue with myself" over a quick smoke.

But this week it's been hell on earth and I just couldn't control myself properly. I asked  my friend for one and just as he gave it to me I was thinking "nothing is gonna change". And, indeed, nothing changed. No peace of mind, no difference at all. Nothing changed.

After the first, i kept having more whenever he went out to smoke. I am asking myself why now and i concluded that the only reason I smoked was to be destructive to myself. Why though?

I made the mistake of buying a pack on my way home. Same deal as last time: once this pack is gone, no more for me. 

I hope I can deal with my current struggle and get back on my tracks of self improvement and I hope i remember the feeling of "nothing has changed" the next time I reach out for a cig in a moment of pain.

Sorry about the long post.

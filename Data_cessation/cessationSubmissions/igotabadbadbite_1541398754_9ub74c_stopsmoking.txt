Has anyone here had success with "I can still have one once in a while"?

I went all day without smoking today, I cleared all the smokes and ashtrays and everything out of my house. The day was rough but I made without too much trouble. Then I found a cigarette that I missed at the end of the day. Of course I smoked it. I don't have any left and don't intend on getting more tomorrow, I'm going to continue not smoking as just like yesterday. But I cannot help but think if the opportunity arises and I don't smoke 99% of the time, what's the big deal if I let myself have a cigarette once in a blue moon when the opportunity arises? 

This is how I successfully quit smoking pot everyday. I know it's not the same thing, but when I wanted to quit I didn't outright ban myself from pot, I just stopped buying it and seeking it out. I allowed myself to smoke if somebody offered it at a party or whatever, but eventually I started turning it down more often. Before I knew it I was going weeks and months without it. Now I still smoke pot maybe like once a month but I've never gone back to the habitual thing I had going on.   

I don't have to go out and buy a carton if I just have one right? I also don't interact with a lot of smokers on a day to basis. On the other hand, another side of me thinks that this a dumb idea and I'm better off completely swearing it off for good. Has anyone here managed to quit and truly just have a smoke once in a while without turning it back into a habit?

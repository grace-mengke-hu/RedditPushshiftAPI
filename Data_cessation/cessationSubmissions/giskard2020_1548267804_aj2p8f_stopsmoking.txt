Today, I smoked my last cigarette.

Hi All,

40 yr old male here. Happily married to an amazing woman. Father of two adorable boys. Pretty successful so far in my career but also the sole provider as of now. Family depends on me.

I have smoked for roughly 20 years. Overweight. 230lbs, 5’9”. Also, I am diabetic. 9ish HB A1C last check. (Pretty bad although it is down from 13 two years ago. On meds although I really should be on insulin.

Three weeks ago, I started the ketogenic diet and it's going ok so far. I definitely see the sugar levels go down but the weight loss is not as rapid as I hoped. Maybe 5-6 pounds in three weeks. But I'm keeping at it. 

Anyways, that's a different story, but related cos it's another challenge along with my decision to quit smoking. Writing this down seems to solidify it. I still have a pack of cigarettes in my backpack. Maybe more than half full. When I get off this bus, I am going to trash it. Enough is enough. I have been irresponsible with my health and life for too long. It might already be too late as my body is showing me evidence of how I have been treating it. 

Today is day one of a smoke free life.
I do have a Juul in my pocket. I think I will use it to kill the craving for a few weeks. However, I do plan to get rid of that as well.

For now, wish me luck!

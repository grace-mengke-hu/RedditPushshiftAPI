34 days?! HOW, WHAT, WHEN?!

Time seems to just be flying by. I can't even picture myself with a cigarette anymore. It just doesn't seem real that I used to smoke. The smell of cigarettes makes me want to puke. Did I really smell like that? Everyone who is trying to quit, just take some deep breathes, let time fly. Don't think about how many days, how many hours have gone by. Just live.

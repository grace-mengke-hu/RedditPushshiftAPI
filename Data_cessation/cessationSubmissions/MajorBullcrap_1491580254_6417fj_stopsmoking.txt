New to this and tired

I'm new to not only being smokefree, but also to reddit. I really don't know how this works yet, I'm getting too old for this. All I can say is, that I have been without a smoke for longer than this, but for the wrong reasons. Now I want to quit for the right reasons, but I can feel how this addiction wants me back.
I'm so tired, 30 hours without a smoke and just plain...drained.

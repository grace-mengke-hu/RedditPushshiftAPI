It's been 14 days...! Don't choose a day but rather let a situation take over.

For me everything came so unexpected I've been smoking for 6 years now. Half a pack per day. There are friends of mine who have been smoking their entire life and they have never tried quitting - for me it's the fifth try, going full cold turkey.

It all came out of nowhere. Really. You know what they always say in the guides for quitting smoking. Never chose the date. Don't quit because someone wants you to. You smoke because you chose to do so. And you will be the one that takes the decisioun to quit once and for all.

14 days ago, I had that moment. I was visiting someone (non-smoker) that had become very important to me in the last past month. We were sitting in a bar and eventually after several hours without smoking, I decided to get outside to have a smoke. After getting into the bar again, I was sitting down next to that person and started talking. At some
point I got asked to drink a sip so the smell of my breath would get back to a decent.

Every single smoker can relate to such a situation and if you're honest, we just laugh at the person or we'll invent some random stuff as an excuse. For me this was different this time, perhaps because it was someone that really cared about my health - it just "dinged" in my head.

Have you had a similar experience? A moment where your decision was based on something serious?

Never smoke again...!

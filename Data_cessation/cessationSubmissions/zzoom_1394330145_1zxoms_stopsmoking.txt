I fucked up, but can still do it

Its day 3 of my umpteenth attempt to stop smoking, went for an engagement party and couldn't say no to an offer for cigarette. I just want to make sure that this is just a small blip and i continue being a non-smoker tomorrow onwards. Going to bed now, need all your tips and suggestions. Thank you reddit.

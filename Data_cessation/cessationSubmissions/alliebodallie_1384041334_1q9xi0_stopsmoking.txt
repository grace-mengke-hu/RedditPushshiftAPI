Struggling hard. I need some encouragement.

Today is the second day since I quit. I'm craving REALLY bad right now. I tried to get my roommates to go out with me so that I could get my mind off of my cravings but none of them want to. I just know it could be so easy to drive right to the gas station and buy more. I started the Nicoderm patches as well but I am still having a really hard time. Some words of encouragement or advice would really help me.

15 days and feeling good

It's now 15 days since I quit smoking. I'm taking Zyban which helped me with cravings but I believe it's my willpower which is very strong right now, especially after reading Allen Carr's Easyway to stop smoking which gave me a good insight about nicotin craving and how it works.

I now pledged to never touch it at all. I was smoking for 7 years in my teenager years and stopped smoking for 16 years. During a trip, I smoked some cigarettes to help with my stress and i fell back in the trap in the last 2 years. That's why it's important to not touch it again no matter what.

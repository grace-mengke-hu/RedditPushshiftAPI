276 Days since I bought my last pack. 60 Days nicotine free. :)

I stopped smoking cigarettes 276 days ago and took up vaping. I know a lot of people are against using them to quit around here but I just wanted to tell you guys my story. 

I threw away my last pack and picked up a good vaporizer. I started vaping at 24mg and slowly turned it down until I was around 3mg over around 7 months. It was a struggle and vaping never quite filled that smoking spot for me, but it kept my hands busy and stopped me from thinking about physically going outside to have one. It changed my habits and created some new ones, but they weren't as strong of habits as my cigarette habits were. When I got down to around 12mg, I stopped feeling the intense need to vape. Sometimes I'd go all morning without it. Finally, I just stopped using it. I left it in my purse, and let the battery die. It took me 9 months to quit all together. After 6 years of smoking, I finally am completely nicotine free. Most days are good and some days are a struggle, but mostly I just have to push past the thoughts that smoking one will make me feel better because I've done it and it didn't make anything better. 

If you're thinking about quitting, do whatever works for you. Some people can't do cold turkey. Vaping worked for me BECAUSE I used it as a quitting tool and not another addiction. You have to lower your nicotine level and eventually stop using it for it to work.
 
If you're struggling today, just remember, smoking isn't the answer. Look at your flair and know that you don't wanna lose all that hard work for something that's not worth it. 
GOOD LUCK & KEEP FIGHTING!

Best Songs to keep inspiration/motivation on high while quitting.

One of my ways to treat my cravings is listening to favorite inspirational songs that provide me with the few minutes of inspiration to get through the craving.

My favorite one when I walk home from work or drive my car (two situations I used to smoke regularly at) is ["Keep Your Eyes ahead" By The Helio Sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIicqULYhGw)

eidt: messed up song name haha

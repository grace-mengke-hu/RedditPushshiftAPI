If you need another reason to scare you

Bit morbid but say you get hit by a bus tomorrow and will need immediate medical assistance.

When you need to be put under general anesthesia for surgery, the anesthesiologist can usually calculate very well how much you will need based on your weight/height..etc. The precision of the dose is extremely high. This is good because they can provide you with enough to stop you from waking up in the surgery and not enough to kill you from an overdose.

Smoking however can affect the rate you metabolize the anesthesia, so essentially the doctor will have to guess more for you than a non-smoker. This increases the error associated with your dose.

Now, anyone can get hit by a bus. But it would be extremely horrible to have an incorrect dose of anesthesia due to your choice to continue smoking. The thought of waking up in an amphitheater (bit dramatic i know) mid surgery is something i am truly afraid of and i am using it as even more motivation to quit this stupidity.

Plus.. impotence (shivers)

Day 20! Woke up without a headache and I haven’t cried yet today !

Day 20. 

Woke up without a headache today which is a huge relief. But just knowing that another one could pop up at any moment gives me extreme anxiety.  Going to try some magnesium today and see if that helps, also going to try some cold compresses to help with the pain. 

Honestly since quitting, I feel like a crazy person. I’m not an angry person whatsoever but I find myself being short with people that are close to me and I feel myself getting annoyed and angry over little tiny things. 

So far I’ve been able to push those thoughts of having just one cigarette to the back of my
Mind. IT DOES GET EASIER... I think! 

Also have been super emotional while quitting nicotine. Weaned myself off with the gum for the first 10 days and then quit altogether after that. The first couple of days without nicotine I found myself crying multiple times a day and just feeling lost and lonesome. Hoping that goes away soon.

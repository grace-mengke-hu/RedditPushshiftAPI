I need help..

I've been fighting with my cigarette addiction for eight years.  Two of those eight I didn't smoke at all.  I started again about 9 months ago and can't stop.  I even began running 5k's at the Gym for two weeks about a month ago.  I just keep convincing myself I'll do it some day, it's not so bad, it's something I like so why stop, person A and B survived it, etc.  I truly lack the motivation to stop, and I can't find it anywhere.  I've wanted to quit since I started, so I truly feel as if I've gone through the motions hundreds of times.  All I've stuck with is don't quit quitting.  Any help at this point would be greatly appreciated.

I smoke American Spirits.  I do not have a good support structure so far, I work at home and the only person I see is my GF who smokes.  I'm 27 and male.

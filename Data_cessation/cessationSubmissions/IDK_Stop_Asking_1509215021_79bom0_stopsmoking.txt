Quit, feeling pretty low.. help!

Hey all, 

I quit smoking about 6 days ago, used to smoke ~10 a day and vape too. Been smoking for a long time.. amount 20 years. Quitting really hasn't been that bad so far.. I've had cravings etc but I haven't really been seriously tempted to smoke (which I'm really surprised by). However, the last couple of days I've been feeling really.. well.. depressed I guess! Totally out of character for me too so it's got to be the lack of cigs. I feel like I was maybe using cigs to make stuff that I found boring more interesting, and now I am just bored and agitated all the time.

Anyone got any advice? I've read this is a pretty common side effect of quitting, anyone else had this? 

Many thanks, and keep on not smoking!

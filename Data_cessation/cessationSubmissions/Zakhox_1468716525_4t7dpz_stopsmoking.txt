I quit almost 3 months ago but feels like 3 hours for some time

Hi reddit!

It all started good ~3 months ago. I was able to quit smoking without any treatment or medicine. At first, it was very easy. I wasn't feeling the need to smoke and there were no side effects. 

For whatever reason, two weeks ago, I wanted for the first time a cigarette and since then I've became very angry, very short tempered and the need for smoke remained. From time to time, I crave for a cigarette and even dream of smoking. My girlfriend says I am changed  and I'm treating her bad. Even I can tell that I'm changed and I'm evil with people around me. 

Why is this happening now? Shouldn't this be happening at the beginning? What should I do? I am a bit scared. 

English is not my native language. Please be kind. 

Thank you!

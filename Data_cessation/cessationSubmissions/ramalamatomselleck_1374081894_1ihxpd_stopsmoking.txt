11 days cigarette free, only 4 cigarettes in the 5 days before that.

Now that I'm coming up on the 2 week mark of not smoking, I'm finding it surprisingly easy to not smoke. Granted, I'm not around smokers very often, and I've limited my drinking, but the cravings have almost all but subsided and I'm feeling great.

The trick for me was using tea tree chewing sticks. They filled my oral fixation with something to play with in my mouth, felt "cigarette-ey", prevented me from excessive snacking, and made my mouth minty fresh. I know they say that cold turkey isn't the way to do it, but I feel like I've kicked the physical addiction part and now just have to stay strong.

I've tried to quit before using nicotine replacement, lollipops, etc., but this is the first time I've felt confident about the attempt.

If I make it to a month, I'll request a badge. Gotta keep some goals.

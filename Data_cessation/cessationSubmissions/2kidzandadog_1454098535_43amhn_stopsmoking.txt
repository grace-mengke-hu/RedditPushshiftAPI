Chantix???

My husband has been a smoker for over 20 years. He is currently on Paxil (30 days on it) He has past history with depression. His doctor gave him an RX for Chantix. We haven't picked up yet. I'm concerned from what I've been reading and was looking for your experience and thoughts. He has very early stages of COPD and wants to quit but doesn't have the long term follow through. Thanks!

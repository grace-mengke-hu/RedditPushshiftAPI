Healthy replacement for nicotine?

Hey. I'm addicted to nicotine. I have been smoking some 22 years about half a pack for day or so. Every year i have done smoking free month. But then start smoking again. Longest streak is 3 months. 

I quit smoking cigarettes over a year ago and replaced them with cigarillos. When i try regular cigarettes i feel instantly sick and i want to puke. Cigarillos seems more pure to me (less chemicals). Now i haven't smoked cigarillos for 13 days and it is easy for me because i replaced cigarillos with SNUS. I know SNUS is not healthy for my teeth and i want to stop using SNUS but i'm 100% sure that then i will start smoking cigarillos again. I also tried nicorette gum last year but then turned to cigarillos again after a month because people always told me that i am chewing loudly. 

So it is either cigarettes, cigarillos, snus or nicorette gum but i always have to get my nicotine dose. 

So is there some healthy replacement for nicotine ? 
Or is there subreddit for fighting with nicotine addiction ?

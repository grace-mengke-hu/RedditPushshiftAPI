Is this milk bad or is this what milk tastes like?

And other such questions. It's been 40 hours. TIL my blankets smell like old homeless man ass. And my coat smells like bad part of town apartment building hallway. 

I'm 26 and I've smoked since 13. I should have done this a longgg time ago, why does everyone say this is hard? I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD, THATS WHY I DIDN'T TRY!!! 

LIKE WTF?!? HARDER TO QUIT THAN HEROIN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What is your definition of hard? 

I feel double lied to. I feel like all the warnings prevented me from trying to quit. 

This illustrates how I feel. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AojhTY963s8

1 year and 3 days without a cigarette :)

Been a hell of a year and the last few months have been so hard but looks like things are getting better and didn't start smoking again so feeling good this morning :)

Anyone who smokes weed, be very careful as I started putting a bit of tobacco in my joints in September till October thinking it wouldn't matter but it brought back very weird cravings that were more like existential angst and depression than really craving a cigarette but they would only last a few minutes at a time and looks like they are finally going away! Good luck to my fellow non smokers, not that we need luck but it's still good to have!

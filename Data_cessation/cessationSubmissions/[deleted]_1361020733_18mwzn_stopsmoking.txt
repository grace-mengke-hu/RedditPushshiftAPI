Day 5 - Help.

It's been 5 days since I picked up a cigarette, for the first few days I was constantly puffing away on my e-cig, afraid that if I didn't, I'd find myself sprinting to the corner shop to purchase some Golden Virginia. 

The e-cig's run out, I decided I'd have a crack at the whole "cold-turkey" technique, which involves barricading yourself in a smoke-free environment until you "think" you don't want a fag anymore. 

Anyway; it feels weird. It's been so long since my brain's been able to focus entirely on something without going off on a cigarette tangent. It kind of instills a sense of nostalgia, it makes you remember how you felt before you started smoking cigarettes, it's not good, but it isn't exactly horrible either, it just feels...normal. 

The next stage is to get myself into the mindset where I am comfortable to go out and socialize with smokers without begging them for a cigarette or gleefully accepting one from an outstretched hand. 

Does anyone have any tips for just...being normal? Being a non-smoker without even THINKING about smoking? It's been so long since I wasn't a smoker that I've forgotten what it FEELS like. Is there any way that I am supposed to feel?

p.s - I recommend e-cigs fully. Yes, you're still getting nicotine, but if you plan it right, you can adhere to a carefully planned routine in which you gradually lower the amount of nicotine you are taking until you're down to zero (in theory, it should work)

p.p.s - don't fucking run out of cartridges on day 2

inabit :---)

p.p.p.s - I wouldn't have even had the desire to quit if it wasn't for this page, it's a godsend, I recomend it to everyone I speak to (...EVERYone)

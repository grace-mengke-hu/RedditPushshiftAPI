Help: where do I find 'release'?

Hello. I've been smoke free for 28 days now (cold turkey method). I exercise daily. I also take an hour and a half long walk. I indulge myself when I eat although I wouldn't say I eat particularly unhealthy anyway. I listen to funny podcasts while I work for that dopamine shot. I do things I enjoy when I'm not working.

I don't have a particular desire to smoke for the sake of smoking but what I do desire is some sort of release, an exhale. All these things I do are merely distractions. And no matter how distracted I am, it doesn't stop the pressure from building up and up and all I want to do is, as I said, exhale (which is the greatest benefit I got from smoking).

I'm sorry if I'm not explaining myself very well but if someone does understand my situation do they have any advice?

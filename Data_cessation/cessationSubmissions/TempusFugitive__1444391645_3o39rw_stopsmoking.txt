Rough days ahead

My grandmother died yesterday. I've been fighting the urge to light up for the past almost 24 hours. I'm committed to keeping my streak. It helps that she hated my smoking habit. I just keep thinking how disappointed she would be if I went back to it. I'm very tired. This too shall pass.

Guess I just wanted to unload a little bit. I'll be okay. Fresh wounds, that's all.

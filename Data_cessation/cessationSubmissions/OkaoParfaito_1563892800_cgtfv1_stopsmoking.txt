5 months ago...

5 months ago, under a different username I posted to this community about quitting both cigarettes and chewing tobacco. I asked you guys if you thought it was wise to deal with just one vice at a time. That was my plan. I was addicted to both, but preferred chewing because it didn't cause lung damage and it didn't make me stink. 

You guys told me to quit both cold turkey. I tried. But chewing came back after like 8 hours of will power. However, I stuck with quitting smoking. I have been without cigarettes for 5 months! 

Yesterday, at the end of my can of chew I just simply couldn't bring myself to buy another $7.50 can. Even though I only chew about a can a week, that's still $30-$38/mo that I can't afford. 

24 hours without any nicotine. Now it's real. I'm being a total asshole. Grouchy to co workers, my poor kids, everyone. I hope the irritability gets over soon, the rest of the symptoms I can bare. 

Ugh, please someone tell me there's another easier side to this.

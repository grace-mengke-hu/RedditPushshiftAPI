Need input: Is my boyfriend really trying to quit smoking if he's still "social-smoking"?

My boyfriend knows I don't like him smoking, and while I've never given him an ultimatum to quit, he's said he doesn't want to do anything that'd upset me. I appreciated this and said I'd help him if he needed any from me.

He used to smoke maybe 1-2 packs a week, but in the last 4 months (since I've started dating him) he smokes maybe a pack a month. I'm happy about this but now at the same time, it seems like he's stagnant? He says he social smokes now, as most of his friends smoke, so when he's out with them, he mostly smokes.

I know if he wants to quit, he's to do it for himself. I'm not pushing him. I just want to understand. **So what I want to ask is, those of you who are trying to quit or have successfully done so, was it very hard for you to reject the offer to "social smoke"/when your friends are smoking too? Or is my boyfriend perhaps just happy not quitting and just down to social smoking?**

I don't expect him to quit for me, because if he wants to he needs to do it for himself. Just need an input on the bolded part as I don't know how it's like to quit smoking.

The energy is overwhelming.

I finally understand what you guys were talking about. I was smoking for the past 7 years without a single break, while living a very lazy and passive lifestyle and now that i don't smoke anymore, i feel like i want to run like crazy. I had this feeling for a little while now, i just have so much energy i can't sleep at night, i have to spend it. I think i'm gonna buy a winter sports clothes for running and just do it. Just wanted to share this with you guys, can anyone relate to that?

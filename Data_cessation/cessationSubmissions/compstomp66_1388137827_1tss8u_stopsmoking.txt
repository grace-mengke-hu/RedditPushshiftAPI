Discipline

I have a friend who told me something simple. 

Discipline is choosing what you want most; over what you want right now.

I've tried to quit many times. Once I made it 30 days. Another time 60 days. But eventually I always went back. I'm not the kind of person who can have just one cigarette or the kind that can smoke occasionally when out with friends. One always leads to two, and two leads to.. well, you guys know.

The thing that was different about this time is I had a goal and it wasn't just to quit smoking. 

I'm a skinny guy and I've wanted to gain weight for a long time. Smoking fucks with my appetite and I end up eating less because of it. Since quitting I've gotten into working out (anyone who is interested check our /r/gainit, they've got some great stuff over there) and have tried to focus on improving myself.

For me it has been important to choose a goal that was more short term than just wanting to quit, or for my overall health. While those concerns are valid they just weren't enough for me to change my behavior.

I just wanted to share my experience and my friendâ€™s adage, which I think of every time I want a cigarette. Best of luck on your quit.

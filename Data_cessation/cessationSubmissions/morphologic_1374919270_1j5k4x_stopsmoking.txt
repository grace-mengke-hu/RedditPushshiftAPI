my brain is not good

Hi there folks!
I started smoking around 1989 and by my calculations have spent over $20,000 on cigarettes.
I just quit a couple days ago. My brain feels like it's short-circuiting. Every cell in my body is screaming. I think I may have waited too long to quit though as I frequently have chest pains.
Oh well. Better late than never I suppose. At least I don't stink now.

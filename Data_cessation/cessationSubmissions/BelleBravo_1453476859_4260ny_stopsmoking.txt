In need some advice

Ive been dealing with a hard past couple of hours and that is going to go through the weekend. I'm trying hard not to have another smoke but at the moment it feels like its the only thing that will just at least ease my emotions even if its for a little bit. 

So any words of advice would be appreciated.

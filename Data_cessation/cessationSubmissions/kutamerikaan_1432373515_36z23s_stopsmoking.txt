Questions about stopping smoking

I have smoked roughly for the past 8 months... Not a lot, a couple a day and a lot when i went out to drink... I have decided to stop, but i'm curious how long it will take for the toxins and nicotine to get out of my body? I am currently taking in a lot of vitamin C products (such as juices and fruits) and i'm taking vitamin D pills.

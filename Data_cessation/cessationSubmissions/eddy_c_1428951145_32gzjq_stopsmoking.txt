3rd Attempt, this time using vapor pen. Day 2!!

So I just wanted to say how well this vape pen actually works. technically I started Saturday with the vapor pen, but still had cigarettes so I was using both. Sunday I decided to only use the vape pen. Yesterday was really hard I was puffing it all day. Maybe I'm starting to get used to it today, but I really have no urge to smoke today. It's mid day an I would have smoked at least 6-8 by now. Don't know anyone else's experience using the vape pen with nicotine, but it's helped a lot!

Today is the official first day of my umpteenth attempt at kicking the nasty habit. Let's make it permanent this time

I've quit a few times in the last, nothing major, maybe a month here and a week or two there and I always get pulled back into it. This time I have what I never did before on my side, rage and spite, as well as a little bit of support from family, and some family health issues. 

To start; my father just had a heart attack which resulted in him having a triple-bypass surgery. Seeing him in that bed coughing up all the tar and other crap he had from 40+ years of smoking 1.5-2 packs a day, made me seriously reconsider my life choices.

My SO has been on my case about it for 3 years and I kept trying to quit in there but every attempt was unsuccessful. And this time she brought it up in a caring fashion, and I decided to give it a Real go again. Well I got weak yesterday and today and went through about a pack, and when she asked I told her I had given in a little but I wouldn't let it stop me. Well she followed up with "you're on your own" and "you're never going to quit" and even went so low as to say "[your brother in law] loves [your sister] enough to drop the drinking and go to rehab and I just wish that's something you could do for me but that won't ever happen and he wasn't even with her but like a year then or close to it"

So I decided that I was going to do it for myself, and I don't need her help. I know somewhere in her heart she means well, but she doesn't know a thing about quitting any addiction because she's never been faced with one. I know part of this fits more-so in 
r/relationshipadvice but I know fellow smokers (or former smokers) would be able to help point me in the right direction.

Also I'm going cold turkey, no gum, no patches, no-cig, nothing. So when i defeat this beast, victory will be mine alone! :D

Thanks for reading!!

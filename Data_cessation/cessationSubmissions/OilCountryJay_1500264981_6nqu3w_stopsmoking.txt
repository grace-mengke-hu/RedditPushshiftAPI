Day 13 Cold Turkey

I am doing excellent but I am ready to do this. My wife asked me every day for 16 years to quit but I wasn't ready to till now.
I smoked 10 a day on average (30 years) and when I was ready I made the decision to quit.
I descided to do this cold turkey because it is all on ME.
If I use the patch, gum whatever and get weak I could use this as an excuse to smoke again because "it wasn't working for me".
Will power is as strong as you want it to be no excuses.
Day 3-7 was hell and it is getting better everyday now.
I will never go through that again, not worth it.
Stay tuned

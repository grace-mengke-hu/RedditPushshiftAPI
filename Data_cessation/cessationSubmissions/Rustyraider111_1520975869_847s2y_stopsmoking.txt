Quitting smoking

As I smoke my last cigarette, and download the smoke free app, I'm thinking back to all the bad stiff smoking has caused me. I'm excited to quit and begin my new healthy life after smoking for five years(since I was 14). I just want to thank this community for all the inspiration. I would also be very thankful for all tips y'all can provide.

Environment changes and mook

I have had a nasty tobacco habit now for a few years (2-3+) Although it started with cigarettes it quickly evolved into smoking tobacco and weed out of bongs. The feeling is 'great' but it also intensifies the addictiveness to tobacco. 


I am currently a college student and this last semester almost destroyed me. I was a slave to the tobacco. Everyday i would tell myself i needed to stop, it was effecting my relationships with friends and family and impeding my ability to do school work and be the person i wanted to be. I didn't even care about the weed anymore, i just needed to have a bong rip of tobacco every three hours or so. I would become incredibly grumpy and irritable, i was unable to focus, it was awful. Not to mention the intense stomach pains and occasion nicotine OD. Fuck! I felt stupid and helpless. I would tell people i was quitting, lie to my SO, and was tethered to my room. 

However, and this is a recurring pattern, when i returned home after the semester i had no urges no withdrawal symptoms (this time) and i really don't ever want to start again. I am afraid though that once i return to my dorm and am reunited with my friends, many of which smoke mook also, I will fall right back into this dangerous habit. 
I feel weak and powerless against it sometimes and i hate that. My So recently broke up with me ,although it was mutual it defiantly was exacerbated by my addiction. 

Also i almost can't even consider not smoking weed (maybe the real source of the addiction) as my whole family and nearly all my friends both close and not close smoke weed very regularly..., i will check out r/leaves for that though.

thanks for reading, or 

tl;dr tobacco out of bong is the devil

[18F] Not smoking puts me back into bad habits so I can't stop, and I'm not sure what to do

After years of face picking, I stopped. 6 years later. I haven't picked at my face in 3 months. There's some scars from before and I don't want new ones. I dont want to go through any of ot again - the endless hours, the marks, the self-disappointment and insecurity ...

Ever since I started picking I would say I'm gonna stop, but I never could. But i finally did it. (Ironic how I'm posting about ending my picking habit and not my smoking habit lol) 

I've only been smoking for 2 months, about a month after I stopped my picking habit. I was on vacation and everyone did it, so I did it as well. It was a huge social thing where I was at, almost everyone smoked.

 I'm back in the US now and I want to stop. Every time i try I get anxiety and urges to pick my face. 

2 days ago I had gone about 48 hours without smoking, but I found myself at the mirror getting ready to pick my face, and then I stopped immediately and started smoking. 

I don't know what to do. If it was just the anxiety I had to deal with I would just deal with it until my symptoms went away. But what's not manageable is ruining my face again.

Thanks

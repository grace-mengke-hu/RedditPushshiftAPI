No tobacco, just plants

In a few hours I'll be one month smokefree. I bought myself a new houseplant to celebrate today. Which excites me greatly! I also bought one the day I quit. Despite not being a green thumbed person I liked the idea of having an outward visual of growth while I was going through my own period of growth and change. I named the first plant Melior which means "better" in latin. There were days that I underwatered and had to remedy my mistake and make consistent effort as she requires moist conditions. Just as there have been days I have struggled and had to remember to take better care of myself. I get genuine joy from seeing her grow. Melior is thriving and so am I. Not one puff. Now to name my new addition.

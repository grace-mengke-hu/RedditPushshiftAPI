Observations from 1 week.

I'm entering my 9th day without a cigarette. The longest I've gone in over ten years. Here are some observations I've made so far.

I'm learning who I am without nicotine and it feels kind of strange. Smoking really helped flatline all my emotions. 

&amp;#x200B;

This process has been hard. But not as hard as I spent years telling myself it would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the cravings get bad I keep telling myself smoking will only intensify the cravings. The only way out is to stop completely. I can look at it like I've been living in a perpetual state of withdrawal for years with only the occasional relief.

&amp;#x200B;

I prepared for this quit by quitting certain habits at a time first. Proving to myself its not so scary to quit smoking in the car. After a little time it wasn't so scary to leave cigarettes at home when I went to work. Imagine how terrifying forgetting my smokes would have been a few weeks ago? I'da left work and booked it home or hovered outside til someone came out and I could bum one! Encountering situations like that, where I'm in such a panic without smokes really helped me come to terms with that smoking is not the anxiety medication I act like it is.

I have some 2mg nicorette mini lozenges. I'd personally recommend them. First couple days they were a real life saver. Not only do they take the edge off the cravings, they take a good 30 minutes to dissolve. By the time they're done you're mostly moved passed wanting that smoke. Yesterday I only had two. Haven't had any yet today. I don't want to replace the cigarettes  with another nicotine product. That being said one of these mints are better than lighting up in my book.

I bought that Alan Carr book but honestly haven't read a lot of it. Just the act of buying it set me down a good path. I still intend to check it out but its been hard to make the time lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have the stop smoking app. A good tool as well.

I thought I was immune to hangovers. It was really exciting. A lot of folks will warn against drinking as its such a strong trigger. They're probably right but I just ended up drinking  a little extra while fighting the urge. I found myself so much less hungover and dehydrated in the morning! A cool little perk. I got cocky though and overdid it on friday. Still didn't light up though! Now I think I'm gonna just have some nice tea at night for a while :) 

&amp;#x200B;

Man. I can smell things! I thought I could always smell things but I go through the hot bar at the whole foods or something and there are so many smells! And people who are still smoking. I can smell them a mile away. At first the smell was enticing but its actually starting to become off-putting. I'm a little embarrassed for all the years that was me and I didn't think it was so noticeable. Before work meetings or job interviews. Bad move. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still looking for a good replacement. I'm finding something really needs to take the cigarettes place. It was such a strong force in my life. Beers worked for a couple days but not sustainable haha. I want to take up riding a bike or something. I'm not very much a fan of gyms or exercise  equipment but I can see how moving around might be a better outlet.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling pretty strong so far. Appreciate the subreddit. Thanks for letting me ramble on here.

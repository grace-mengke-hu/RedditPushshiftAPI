Accidentally smoked over the weekend...

So this weekend I went over to a friend's place to BBQ, drink some beers and smoke some weed. There was one guy who was rolling joints for a lot of the day and I was partaking. Right as the night was coming to a close he goes to roll the last of the night, asks to be passed his smokes, and then lights a spliff.


Big oops realizing I was having spliffs instead of joints all day. I should have asked if he was putting tobacco in when he was rolling. I could have stuck to my own tobacco free stuff.


Suffered through crazy headaches and cravings on Sunday. Today has not been much better. I definitely see how a slip up restarts the cycle now. Almost 6 weeks down the drain. Or do I not count this since it was an accident? I guess it doesn't matter as long as I keep my quit going and learned my lesson.


Just needed to get this out there. I didn't tell anyone how badly this affected me... Suffering in silence as they say.

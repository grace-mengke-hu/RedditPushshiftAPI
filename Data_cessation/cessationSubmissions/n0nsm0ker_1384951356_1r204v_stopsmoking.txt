My story!

Hi everyone,

First time poster to /r/stopsmoking, and using a throwaway for professional reasons- I just thought I’d share my story with all the wonderful people in this sub. 

I'll start with a side note. The city I live in ([Canberra, Australia](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=canberra+not+sydney+capital&safe=off&rlz=1C1ASUM_enAU520AU520&espv=210&es_sm=93&source=lnms&sa=X&ei=FayMUtiTFImBlQWnuoHIDQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAA&biw=1920&bih=951&dpr=1#es_sm=93&espv=210&q=what+is+the+capital+of+australia&safe=off)) has introduced [strict laws](http://health.act.gov.au/c/health?a=sp&did=10152911) when it comes to smoking in public. I am proud to say that my beloved city is leading the way in this area, with the rest of Australia to follow suit. The Australian government has also made, and continues to make, drastic strides to lower smoker numbers, including [raising cigarette prices beyond belief](http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/cigarette-packets-to-cost-more-than-20-as-smokers-hit-with-53-billion-in-extra-taxes/story-fnihsrf2-1226689145482) (now USD18 for a pack of 25), [tightening customs laws](http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4352.asp) (used to be 200 cigarettes- now 50), and [introducing plain packaging](http://imgur.com/a/yTanz).

Anyway, I started smoking while doing night shifts at a supermarket. All of the “important” staff smoked, and they all took smoke breaks together. To get anywhere at this store you really had to be a smoker. So, desperate for more shifts/higher wages (as a young student), I decided to join them. (The irony of course being that I spent approximately $23k on cigarettes in the past 6 years.) Anyway, my tactic worked, and within a month or two I was running my own team of workers. To me, cigarettes were psychologically analogous to a well-earned break from our hard work, so there was a definite aspect of positive reinforcement (a bad thing).

I quit the job after a few years but the habit still remained. I met my now fiancé (non-smoker) doing a restaurant job and I continued smoking. My sister also smoked at the time, and having landed an awesome job in another city, she moved to live with my brother (an ex-smoker). While she was smoking her first cigarette at his house after moving in, he casually mentioned to her that this cigarette would be her last. She was taken aback, but had nowhere else to live, so she reluctantly accepted. She was bummed out at first, but then approached the whole situation from a new angle- this was her new life, her dream job (and salary), and let that inspire her. She hasn’t touched a cigarette since (2 years).

Along similar lines, I finally moved in with my fiancé in August, after we saved up for a deposit on a house. I approached this purchase as the start of my new life, of our new life, and as soon as the last piece of furniture went through the door, I threw out all my cigarettes, lighters, ashtrays, cases etc. 

The first 3 days were brutal, to say the least. I won’t go into detail, as there are many in this sub who know what that’s like. There are probably fewer who know what it feels like after those three days, a week, a month, and in my case, nearly three months. I want to assure you guys that it does get so much easier. You develop your own coping mechanisms- mine is to simulate the suck/puff of a cigarette, breathe in really deeply (**which I can actually fucking do now!**), and breathe it all out. It instantly nails any cravings that I get. I don’t think I’ll ever touch a cigarette again, and I don’t think I’ll ever need to. 

Anyway, that’s my two cents (and 75 bucks a week). Maybe one or two of you will find something worthwhile in my rant. Peace!

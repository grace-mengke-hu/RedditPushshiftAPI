Experiences of people who returned to smoking after not smoking for a longer period

I am non-smoker for about 4 months. Generally, I don't have any attraction to cigarettes whatsoever. However, a few times a day I get lost in memories of all the good times when I was a smoker (parties, frequent coffee breaks, chatting with smoker colleagues and friends), and ofcourse it makes me wonder how awesome would it be to start smoking again and relive all of these small joys again.
As I said, I have no wish to taste cigarette ever again, however those daydreamings keeps making me requestion my decision.

So, could someone, who got back to smoking, express their experiences? What was it like? Was there any joy? Did you feel like it was worth it? At least for some time? Or did it instantly feel like making a mistake?

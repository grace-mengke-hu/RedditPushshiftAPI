Feeling pessimistic

This is more of a rant than anything, but I welcome any suggestions or advice :)

I've been smoking through all of my 5 years in college. I "quit" last summer and slipped up in the fall months, but have been smoke-free since December.

I've always struggled with anxiety and have a very difficult time dealing with stress. Although I try to exercise and eat healthily, I still feel overwhelmed with cravings when the stress hits. I'm also a hair-puller and have had other unproductive stress coping mechanisms in the past, as well. 
Next year I will be headed to a rigorous 4-year professional school program. I'm scared shitless about the inevitable stress overload and how my brain will react to it.

Even now, just looking ahead and freaking out has me thinking, "if I could just have a cigarette, I would feel better..." :\

Cravings..

I just got a pretty bad craving. I had a feeling I might be getting a few of these so I lined up a wee deterrent for the occasions. Before I stopped I put a few ends in a jar with some water, put the lid on and put it in the shed. Just gave that a quick smell and craving gone, lucky I didn't throw up. Horrendous but that worked a treat.

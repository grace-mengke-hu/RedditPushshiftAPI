Back again...

Hopefully this time for good! I quit on Sept. 29 of 2016 and was doing really well up until May or June of this year when they weather started getting warmer and there were more wobbly pops around. That was a long stretch to go to screw it up. 

On day 3 of the Tootsie Pops again and it's not so bad. Maybe because a part of me believed the entire summer that I wasn't really a smoker again, I had quit and I was just having a few sociables - which does, in fact, make one a smoker... but I didn't have that mentality I guess. Even though it wasn't just when I was having drinks, it was 4 or 5 a day. 

Anyway, I found you lot incredibly helpful last time, so here I am, back again. Hopefully this time it's for good.

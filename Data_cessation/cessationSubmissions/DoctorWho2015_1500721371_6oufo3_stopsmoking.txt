[Motivation] This is how many years you lose as a smoker.

I tried to look up and calculate how many years you lose if you are a smoker. To motivate myself to stop. And this is what I came up with, hopefully, it can motivate someone else to stop as well:

The average life span for a non-smoker is 82.5 years. 
Then we remove all the time and years you can't enjoy:
You can't really enjoy life when you are younger than 4,5 years old. 82.5 - 4.5 = 78 years.
You spend 33% of your life sleeping. 78 - 33% = 52.26 years.

In other words, as a non-smoker, you get 52.26 years of time that you can enjoy. Now let's take a look at a smoker.

The average life span for a non-smoker is 82.5 years. A smoker on average has a 10.8% shorter life span. 82.5 - 10.8% = 73.59 years.

Now once again, you can't really enjoy your first 4.5 years in life so we remove them 73.59 - 4.5 = 69.09 Years. And you spend 33% of your life sleeping 69.09 - 33% = 46.29 years.

Now, assume you started to smoke when you were 20 years old. And stopped when you died at 73.59 years old you would have been smoking for 73.59 - 20 = 53.59 years. Now assuming that you have been smoking one pack a day for all those 53.59 years. To smoke one cigarette takes on average 7 minutes and 1 minute to go from where you are to where you are allowed to smoke = 8 minutes. 8 * 20 = 160 Minutes per day. 160 * 365 = 58400 Minutes a year. 58400 * 53.59 = 3129656 Minutes in your life. 3129656 / 60 = 52160 Hours. 52160 / 24 = 2173 Days. 2173 / 365 = 5.95 Years of time that you spend smoking.

46.29 - 5.95 = 40.34 Years of time that you can enjoy.

Smoker: 40.34 Years of time.
Non-smoker: 52.26 Year of time. 

52.26 - 40.34 = 11.92 

So, you lose 11.92 years of time that could be enjoyed with better stuff than smoking. We are not talking sleeping here, or the time from when we are toddlers. We are talking actually enjoyable time, time that could have been spent with loved ones, grandchildren or whatever. 

Unfortunately, I used Swedish sources to calculate this, so I won't post the sources (assuming people won't understand them). The values could also be a bit different for your country.

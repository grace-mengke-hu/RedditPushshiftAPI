Am I even addicted to cigarettes?

I want to quit smoking, but... I just like smoking too much. I was talking about this with my friends the other day and they all thought that I wasn't even addicted to cigarettes. I guess the only thing that would hint that I am is that I love my morning cigarette. Other than that, I only smoke throughout the day because I like the taste.

I've decided to quit smoking, and I need advice.

I'm 20 years old and I have been smoking for three years, and before that I had been dipping (shit you put in your lip) for three years. Just recently I have seen 3 family members die of smoking related deaths and I just don't want to be another number in the chain, so I decide to come here. What's are some things to expect, and what are some good tips to help me quit?

Needing some moral support

Hey guys first time posting here. I'm struggling to quit and looking to hear success stories. About six months ago my wife cheated on me and I had begun to quit and spiraled out of control and starting smoking heavily without a care in the world of quitting. I'm trying to build myself up now and know I need to quit for my health. It's wearing on me mentally that I can make it three days before breaking down and buying a pack. I'm willing to try anything at this point. Did anyone here think they'd never quit and tried over and over but made it through? I just bought a pack and the guilt is eating me alive. I will admit I am an addict. Thanks for reading this! I REALLY appreciate it.

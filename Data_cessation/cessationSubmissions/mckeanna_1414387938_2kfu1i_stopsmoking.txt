Fighting pangs...

So I've smoked on and off (mostly on) for the past 15 years. I started weaning myself off cigarettes about 4 years ago. I made rules for myself, the first of which was "You can't smoke at work". I work in restaurants but also have asthma so it just made my shifts better.


Then it went on to "can't smoke in the car" and "can't smoke during daylight". It really worked! I went from at least a pack a day to maybe two a week! It was great!


I've had some lapses, the worst was when I worked at a bar and everyone smoked. That only lasted about 8 months though and once I was done there, it became "only when I was drunk". At this point (the past 7 months or so) I was smoking about 2 packs a month.

I visited home about a month and a half ago and didn't smoke at all while I was there, didn't miss it or anything.  I came back, had a half cig one night and my mouth tasted like butt and my lungs hurt. Haven't had one since but tonight was the first night I've really really wanted one. I keep reminding myself how gross it tasted and how I didn't catch the cold everyone else at work had. I didn't end up in the hospital with a lung infection. I had a day of sniffles and was back on my feet.


It was a weird method how I quit and I'm glad it worked. Just wanted to share and vent a little, I hate getting the pang because I know how terrible smoking makes me feel.


I never went cold turkey so I don't have a quit date, but I'm guessing roughly 6 weeks since my last cig, and about 4 years of breaking the addiction.

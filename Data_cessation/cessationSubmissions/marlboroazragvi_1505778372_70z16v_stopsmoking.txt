Just wanted to share a book that helped me quit smoking, I haven't smoked for 20 days now and it was really easy.

This book changed my mindset about smoking and addiction in general, everytime I think about smoking (I don't much) I just remember what's written in it.

I hope it works for you guys, just make sure you read till the end.

Anyway here it is:

 **ALLEN CARR'S EASY WAY TO STOP SMOKING**

Good luck!

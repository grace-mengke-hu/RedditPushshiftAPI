On my first day without smoking

First day without smoking but I have Nicorette gum to help with the cravings. I have been smoking for 4 years and this is my second attempt at quitting, the first time I quit for 2 weeks but fell right back into it. I am 22 years old, does anyone have any tips to help with breaking the habit?

badge reset? the worst

I feel terrible, 24 days and then...
last night drunkenly smoking 2 joints with tobacco in them, fully aware.
How does one reset their badge.
Anyway else had this with problem with weed?
I'm not even a big smoker of it anyway but I was a little drunk and it almost felt like an excuse to smoke without smoking...?

Disappointed

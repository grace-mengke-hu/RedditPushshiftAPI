Time moves slower

One of the things that smoking does to you is it helps you pass time. Bored? Take a puff outside?. Boss e-mails you about deadline? Smoke. 
There was a reward mechanism kicking in every time I did something of purpose. The last week has been hazy. I didn't even meet my friends on weekends as I was afraid of a trigger moment.

The worst is as soon as I finish running or workout I need one. Now I chew on a gum or rinse with mouthwash. 

What do you do with your new found boredom?

Seven days makes one strong

I posted yesterday how I have this annoying mental tug, "Have a smoke, have a smoke." Just phantom pain, I guess, and I know from experience it will go away. Unlike the grievous mental warning that doesn't fade when I smoke, "Quit smoking, quit smoking." Best to you today, especially if you're struggling.

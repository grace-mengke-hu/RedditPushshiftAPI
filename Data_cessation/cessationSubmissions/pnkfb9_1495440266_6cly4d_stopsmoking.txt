day 8

Hi guys, just venting! I'm on day 8 and I feel calmer than the past week. day 6 was totally shit but then things started to go easier and easier. For the past week I used to smoke a pure weed blunt before going to bed but I am planning to reduce also this vice to once in a while. I stopped weed for six months, then relapsed, but now I want to remove totally tobacco, and then gradually switch to a weed-free lifestyle once for all. have a good day guys!

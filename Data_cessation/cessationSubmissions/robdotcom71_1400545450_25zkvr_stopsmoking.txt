2nd time trying to quit. I think I am winning this time. It's been 5 days without that filthy habit. :)

So last time I posted here I didn't last... but this time I think I have the motivation to quit for good.
I've been unemployed for quite some time and have always wanted to take up flying. I figured with the money I waste on smoking, I could actually follow my dream of Flying. So anyway the other day I took a [Trial Instruction Flight](http://imgur.com/a/6nSxv) with the money I normally would have wasted and I currently feel great and very happy with myself. I look forward to my next lesson and continuing on and getting my license to fly.

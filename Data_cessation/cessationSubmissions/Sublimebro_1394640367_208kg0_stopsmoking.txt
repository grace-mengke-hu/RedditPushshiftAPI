43 days and I still have 5-10 pretty bad cravings. Needing some advice.

I'm mostly looking for advice from people who have quit for a while or are around my quit date but any advice will do :)

Around day 25 my cravings were a lot better and I was getting maybe 1 or 2 cravings a day. Now they're back and it's getting harder to get through the dray.

A mix between this beautiful 70 degree weather and my new manager position at work is really making this hard to deal with.

I'm having guily smoking dreams (I'm sure you're all familiar) every night. 

When did the cravings stop or lessen for you?

Does it get easier?

I want it so bad, im losing it..

I made a mistake. I don't know why I quit when I started dating this girl. I've only shown her my stressful, anxious side since dating. And now shes giving me the cold shoulder. And I can't deal with it right now. I need a cig. A cig will make it better because I'm in this vortex of emotions and it's killing me inside. Goddamnit, I can't deal. Why is this so hard still??

Advice

Hey everyone, hopefully we are all on our way to having smoke free lives! 

I've developed a few tips and tricks and I figured I would put them all here into one spot, and then everyone can add what has helped them in their own lives in particular. 

1. The car. My mortal enemy. More so the red light then the car itself. I recently posted somewhere else to put a few of your favourite CDs or songs aside and develop a "no smoking song". It's gotta make you happy. Then keep something for your mouth handy (gum, candy, toothpicks have always worked for me because I can twirl them around), when the craving comes on, distract your mouth and sing along to your song. 

2. The cravings. Remember, each defeated craving becomes a POW. You line enough soldiers up together and you have a real shot at winning the war. I have to aggressively counter each craving with the idea of taking another soldier to aid me in my final fight against humanity (smoking). 

3. ORANGE JUICE. I have absolutely no idea why and I don't care! Orange juice, grapefruit juice etc, there must be a link but it will reduce your craving by the time your done the glass. I've even had people tell me they dipped a couple smokes in the juice and tried to smoke them, it was so awful they never lit up again. 

4. Sprint. Literally if you have "the ultimate" craving, you sometimes can only sprint that bad boy out. I'm talking a full on 100 meter dash as fast as possible. You will either be way to out of breath to even consider a cigarette for a while, or so god damn impressed at how far you just ran after quitting and how EASY it was again.

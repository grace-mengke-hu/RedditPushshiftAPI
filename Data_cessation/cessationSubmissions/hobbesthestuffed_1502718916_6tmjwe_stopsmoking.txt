Its Time

I have one cigarette left and then I am going to quit. I know its unhealthy. I know it will kill me. It makes me stink. It makes me an outcast among most everyone I know. I can't keep doing this. The worst part, though, is I'm not sure if I really want to quit. And I'm not sure if that's the addiction talking or how I really feel. But I know all the above is true so its time to stop.

I've been smoking for almost 30 years. I started at 16. The first time I smoked I was fishing and had the cigarettes to keep the mosquitoes away. Inevitably I tried a puff. I was impressed with myself because I managed to inhale without coughing, like is commonly depicted with first-time smokers. Later, when school started, I was one of the 'cool' kids! But I was even cooler because I did it because I liked it.

I've quit a bunch of times since then. The first was boot camp, though I'm not sure if its actually quitting if you are forbidden from having one. That's not to say I couldn't have gotten my hands on them, just that I was too terrified of getting in trouble and being sent back. The dumbest thing I've ever done was buying that first pack right after leaving boot camp. 

After that I quit a bunch more times. I made it 6 months once. But I always found some excuse to start back up. And it was always the same. 'I can have just one cigarette.' One turned into two and by the end of the week I was a smoker again.

I don't know what makes this time any different. I'm already getting nervous about it and I haven't even started. I've got the patch to help me. I can't take any of the medications for various reasons, though they did help in the past. This time its just the patch and me making a concerted effort to change myself and my habits. My plan is to start exercising every day and use push ups or sit ups to get past cravings. Hopefully it'll work. Wish me luck.

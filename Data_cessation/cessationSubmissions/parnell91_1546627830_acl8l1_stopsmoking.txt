Dealing with the stress

Hi guys, today is my first whole day without having a cigarette, but I’ve been so tempted to just have one to de-stress. 

Usually, when I get worked up or stressed, I go outside for a smoke and then I’m fine, but trying to calm down and going outside without having a cig, doesn’t seem to cut it, so just wondering if anyone has any tips or advice on how to deal with the stress.

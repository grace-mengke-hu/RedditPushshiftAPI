One month down!

I feel soooooo good.  SOOOOOOO FUCKING GOOD!  I have the energy of a 9 year old and I'm 31!

I love walking out my front door on my way to work.  I check my pockets.  Phone?  Got it.  Keys?  Got 'em.  Wallet?  Got it.  Train pass?  Got it.  Shit..... I'm missing something.  Something ain't right.  

Nope.... everything is right.  Stay strong everyone!  It gets awesome each and every month!  I just found this out :)  GOT MYSELF A STAR!!!!!!

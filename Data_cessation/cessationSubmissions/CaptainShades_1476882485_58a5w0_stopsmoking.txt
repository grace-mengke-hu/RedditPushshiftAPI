my wake-up call

Last Monday night, I had the worst feeling of anxiety that I hadn't had in years. It felt terrible. The feeling was still there in the morning. Having a cigarette made it even worse. I started to think about what if this was something much more serious like a heart attack. It scared me enough to toss away the smokes and give it my best shot. 24 hours in and I am already feeling better.

Patch experiences

So I have been on the patch since the new year and while it has helped the cravings a lot, I'm having really vivid fucked up dreams. Has anyone who has used the patch experienced a similar response? Will they go away with more time? I'm nervous to stop using the patch as this is the longest I've managed to make it quitting since I started smoking 12 years ago. Any advice would be appreciated.

It gets easier

Just wanted to say after about 50 days, all cravings were gone except the social aspect of smoking. To this day I still feel down when I see any 2 or more people socializing over a smoke, but I forget that cigarettes exist except for those moments. It really sucks but you need to avoid those social smokes as much as possible and the rest is easy. I can still talk to groups while they are smoking no problem, those are the only times I ever ask myself how bad it would be to bum one of of them. Hopefully this is not an issue for you all but I use to bum smokes daily just cause I knew people would not say no and I miss it. Hang in there.

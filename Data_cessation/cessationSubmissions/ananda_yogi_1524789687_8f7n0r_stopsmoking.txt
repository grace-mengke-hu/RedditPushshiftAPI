I just ate a piece of cake as big as my head.

Sweets get me through cravings, the same helped me quit booze.  I'm not feeling one bit guilty about the extra calories today, or probably for the next couple of weeks. Anything to not smoke. I actually might crack open the stash of my favorite candy I've hidden for a rainy day. 

Hope you're all well, glad to be checking in here on day 2 :)

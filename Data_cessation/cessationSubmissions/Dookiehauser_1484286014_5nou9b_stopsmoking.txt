Disoriented when holding breath

I'm an otherwise healthy 29 year old male. I quit two days ago and today I took a really deep breath in and held it for a few moments and nearly passed out. It's difficult to explain, although I felt disoriented, nearly fell, and blacked out for a moment. I was in the shower and my gf thought I fell down. Is it because of the increased oxygen? Has this happened to anyone else?

Just extinguished my last cigarette

I've been smoking since I was about 13 (I'm 36 now). I quit previously for a year - TWICE!!! - so I know better than anyone the dangers of "just the one", especially just one puff of a joint, which was ultimately my downfall both times. I've tried half-heartedly a few times in the past few months but I'm seriously sick of it now so I'm determined to make this my last quit EVER. I've officially torn up and thrown out the remainder of that last pack, and I have this sub and whyquit.com bookmarked for easy access over the coming days. I remember feeling so good about myself when I was weeks and months into my last quits, so looking forward to hitting that stage again and sticking with it!

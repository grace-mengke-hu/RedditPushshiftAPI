Sleepless

At 11am my third day without smoking was completed. Eventhought Iâ€˜m not yet 30 I smoked almost over the past two decades... sick! But now I feel even more sick while quitting. My whole flat is all cleaned to the tiniest bit, I spent more then 5 hours every day at the library (Student) and the last two days I went running for 10km each, each in an hour, not because Im so sporty.... naaaahaaa! Just because I was getting angry so badly about not smoking that I couldnt help it and it was the smarter Solution than crying on the kitchenfloor. Never felt so physically healthy while starting to worry about the psychological one so extremly. Any suggestions ?

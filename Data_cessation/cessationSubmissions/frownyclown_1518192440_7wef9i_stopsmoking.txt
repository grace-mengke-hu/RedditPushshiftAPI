After 20-odd years of being a slave to cigs and nicotine, 100 days of freedom!

I started smoking when a college friend and I used to drink wine on the porch and talk philosophy.  He would say, "There are three requirements to talk philosophy: wine, company, and a good cigarette." I lost touch with the friend a long time ago, but he left with me a long lasting addiction to cigarettes. 

I feel better, my energy is higher, my discipline improved, I feel cleaner, my breathing is better, I am not as "down" as I used to be.  It's a whole new life and I wish out of all the smart and intellectual talks my friend and I had, we had had enough sense to not start smoking. 

Anyway, here's to another 100!

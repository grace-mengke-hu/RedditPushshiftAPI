Here's another day one post

I've wanted to quit for the past 5 years or so. I occasionally would put together a week or two, a few periods of a month and one 106 day run in there. 

I hate it. Every single time I light up I wish I hadn't. 

I hate how difficult it has been for me to quit, too. I quit drinking over 2.5 years ago and haven't looked back, but these damn cigarettes I just can't seem to shake. 

Here goes another, and final, day one. I make resolutions, but never a decision. Today I'm deciding not to smoke, no matter what happens, good or bad.

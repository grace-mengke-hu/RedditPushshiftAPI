Introduction, my first quit attempt

I found this subreddit today while I was looking for online quit support. I figured I'd post a brief overview of my story and see what kind of advice I can get from any of you who are more experienced with quitting than I am.
I'm 20 years old - I'll be 21 in July - and I've been smoking since the summer of 2012, so I would've been 15 or 16 at the time. I typically smoke between 8 and 15 cigarettes a day depending on what I'm doing and who I'm with (I'm not sure if it makes a difference, but I've been smoking almost exclusively non-filter cigarettes for the past 1.5 years or so). I'm making my first quit attempt. I started taking Chantix yesterday and my quit day is next Monday, March 6th.
Like I said, this is my first try and I'm hoping for some good results. I know that I can be good about not being too hard on myself if I slip up, but I also know that I tend to be flaky about commitments that are this difficult.
Basically that's all I have to say! I'd be happy to hear from anyone about their experiences and to discuss tips for quitting. I'd also be glad to offer any help that I might be able to give to anyone else that's quitting.

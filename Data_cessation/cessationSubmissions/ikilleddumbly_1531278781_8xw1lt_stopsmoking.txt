Today is day 7!

Last week I ran out of cigs and made a choice to not buy any more. All day all I've wanted to do was go to the store and buy a pack. I didn't though! I'm really proud of myself and I finally told the people around me that I quit but no one seemed to care. I just wanted to boast on myself a little bit!

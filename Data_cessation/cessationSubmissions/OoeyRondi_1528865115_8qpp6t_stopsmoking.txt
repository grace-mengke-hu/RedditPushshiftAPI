Just one last ciggie right?

Smoking 3 years daily now but this is the end of my third day without a cigarette or any tobacco or nicotine. I kinda drunk tbh and had a rough day with my roommates, I'm thinking to go buy a pack, smoke one, and toss the rest of it. I started a new job yesterday it's been a little more stressful than I thought. Maybe I could dip the ciggie in hot sauce? I hate anything Spicy lol

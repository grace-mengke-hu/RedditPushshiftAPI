Had my last wisdom tooth pulled, using this to quit as I can’t smoke anyway

Hey guys. Been lurking again a while but I thought I would announce my quitting so I have to answer to someone.

Having a wisdom tooth pulled at 45 sucks btw. But I can’t smoke while recovering, so I am using it to quit permanently.

Congrats to those of you who have already quit. I am hoping to be one of you. I will be one.

Twenty four hours and counting.

2 years and counting!

I've actually been so busy lately that I just realized that my 2 year anniversary was 2 weeks ago! It's crazy to think that just over 2 years ago I was struggling through one of the hardest weeks of my life, leading into 2 pretty difficult years. I had just quit smoking for the umpteenth time, and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to stick with it. That week I got into a minor car accident and waited 5 hours for the cops to show up. The next day the only bar I ever went to, a place with people I had grown to love and considered a safe space, informed its patrons that it was closing by the end of the week. I was working a job that I didn't like with people I really didn't like. In the two years since then, I've dealt with depression and health issues. My father was in a very bad accident. My grandmother had a serious health scare. I struggled personally with my sexuality and then finally came out. I started a new job with significantly more responsibility. And don't even get me started on what happened on November 8th, 2016 and since then. And through all of that and more that I didn't even mention, I managed to not once go and buy another pack of cigarettes. I still have cravings very often and I will admit that in those two years there were two instances where I took a drag of somebody else's cigarette, once in that very first week and once just a few weeks ago. Both times were quick reminder of why I quit. I can't say that I have any specific tricks or tips on how to make it through other than to constantly remind yourself why you never want to pick up another cigarette again. For me it was partially my health but a big part is that I just didn't want to smell like cigarettes anymore. I truly think that if I can make it through the last 2 years, anyone can do it.

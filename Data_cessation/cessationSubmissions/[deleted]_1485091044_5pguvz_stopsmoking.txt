DAY 21

HOORAY!

Just wanted to tell that I have quit smoking starting from this year.

JAN 1, yeah that's right a new year resolution..more like a rest of my life resolution.

It's been 21 days, Allen Carr's book which I read mid December completely changed my views. Anyone of you guys trying to quit have to HAVE TO! read his book.

It amazes me how cigarette is depicted as a symbol of coolness and crutch. The real big scandal of recent humanity is this stupid smoking.

When it is so acceptable, addictive and accessible it makes it so much a pain in the ass to get rid of. 

One of the takeaway of the book is it tells you that you have not sacrificed anything instead you are free by stopping the smoke.

Any Bojack Horseman fans here, When Todd yells at Bojack,

"You can't keep doing shitty things and feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay. YOU NEED TO BE BETTER!". 

That quote is stuck in my mind. People who have depression anxiety related problems, should watch this show. It cathartic.

Anyway just wanted to let this out to encourage any one trying to quit and this incredible sub.

Thanks guys!

When the gas station is just down the hill...

It is so difficult. Just one spark to make all these feelings disappear. But it will only create more feelings to make disappear. 

Day 8 was so easy. I have a stressful family event coming up though. How will I handle it without my emotional crutch? 

I have felt so many positive results. I can't throw them away for a brief moment of relief can I?

15 years / 2 pregnancy’s / pneumonia

It just hit me 18 days ago when I had a little flue: I don’t want to go out.. but I didn’t realise I had smoked my last cigarette last night before going to bed, I thought I had another pack, somewhere.. FUCK IT! If I can do a whole day without smoking I’m gonna try to quit. I had some nicotine patches my mum had bought a couple of months before when I went into labour to help my at the maternity, but I didn’t need them as I was able to go outside and have at least 2-4 smokes a day. 

I did my first day smoke free and decided to buy stronger patches and give it a try; if I would manage a whole week that was it, I would quit!

It’s day 18 and I have started dance hall and singing in a choir.

It’s been 15 years at an average of 1 pack a day.. I have had pleumonia and two pregnancies and none of that could make me stop, not even for a day! I don’t understand how or why I finally managed to take the step, but it feels amazing to regain this much control of my life! And my kids no longer need to have a ashtray smelling mum.!

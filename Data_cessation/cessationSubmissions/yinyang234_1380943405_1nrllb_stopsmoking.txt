Do you remember your first cigarette?

My first cigarette was when I was 14 (although I didn't start smoking regularly as a habit until I was 16).  A friend of mine had bought a couple of cigarettes from another individual in school and we smoked it after school. He seemed to know what he was doing and I was puffing awkwardly at it until I inhaled for the first time. Then I felt like I was about to choke....but not to be discouraged I inhaled again and again until my throat felt numb to it. At that point I was too focused on processing that pungent and disgusting bitter taste and blinding smoke. Thinking of that moment now I realize....How stupid were we all to try that 2nd cigarette?
  
  What's your first cigarette story?

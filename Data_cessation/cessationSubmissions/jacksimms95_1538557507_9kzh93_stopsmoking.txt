When do you stop thinking about cigarettes?

I’ve been 58 days without tobacco, and I thought by now I’d not be craving them anymore. 

I’m still thinking about smoking. Not nearly as much, but still anytime I see someone - on the street or tv - smoking, or anytime I have a drink, or when I’m walking to work, i still have super strong cravings. Is it too late in the process to go back on NRT stuff? I stopped patches after a week and have been cold turkey since...

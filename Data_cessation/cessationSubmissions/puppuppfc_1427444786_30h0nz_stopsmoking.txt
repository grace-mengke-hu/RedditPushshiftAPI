Worried about cravings? Dont.

Went out last night and didnt even THINK about smoking. There were smokers around but I never made the connection to myself. Only thought about it this morning now im on reddit and saw my stopsmoking subscription! 

One of my anxieties (which made me closer to picking up a smoke) was that I was scared I would feel cravings my whole life. Let me tell you from 200 days in that they are extremely few and far between! Have a good day guys!

No more.

Smoked my last cigarette for the 100th time. I simply can't stand how I'm a slave to these things and I'm done. I smoked a half pack today in a 10 hour period. My throat hurts, my mouth tastes nasty and I hate myself for doing it after my girlfriend said she'd dump me if I smoked another one. I know she wouldn't...she just wants to help. So this is it. I took a picture of the last pack I'll ever buy and made it my wallpaper on my phone. 

Posting on this sub makes it real somehow so thank you, all of you. Good luck to you all!

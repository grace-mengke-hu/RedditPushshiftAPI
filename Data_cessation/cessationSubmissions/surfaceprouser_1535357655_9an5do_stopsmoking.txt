What did you replace your relaxing smoke time with?

I quit for ten days, but yesterday smoked 2 and again smoked 2 today...My brain is always looking forward to those few minutes I had of peace and “time out”...Coffee and a cig...Just stepping away from everything for a moment...How can I replace those times? Thanks

Advice on how to step down slowly?

Okay, so I have in someway decided I want to either smoke only 5 cigarettes a day or completly stop. My problem is: I am a gamer, but smoke outside. I have somekind of OCD that the game I play, when I am done, i have to smoke a cigarette before i get into a new game ie: Dota 2 and CSGO. Games like PUBG and Dead by Daylight, it doesn't matter that much. I usually smoke around 20-25 cigarettes a day. I roll my own cigarettes. I don't know how I am being able to cut it down, since i feel like i "miss" the nicotine if I don't smoke before the games. Anyone have any ideas how I can help myself becoming either smokeless or smokefree.

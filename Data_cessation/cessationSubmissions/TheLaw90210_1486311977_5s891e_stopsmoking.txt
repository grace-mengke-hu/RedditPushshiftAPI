Uncomfortable hunger when not hungry. Even when I am full after eating.

The only way I have been able to quash this horrible sensation is to chew the NRT gum. I am clearly not actually hungry but it makes me feel so uncomfortable.

The problem is it comes back within an hour after the gum runs out, when the nicotine from it has worn off. 

Any suggestions? This is by far my worst symptom.

How long till relief if I stop using the patch?

I've been on the patch, and have quit this way before (only to relapse a year later).  I did all steps and then ceased all nicotine after step 3.  I'm on day 4 now.  If I stop using the patch right now, how long until the nicotine cravings let up?  I get fiercely angry and depressed during withdrawal, so the shorter the better.

So . . . tired . . .

I constantly feel like I've just run a marathon after taking the SAT and not sleeping for 3 days.  How do you deal with chronic fatigue when quitting smoking?

Edit:  Also, I've had the same headache for about 3 days now.  Tylenol, aspirin and advil do nothing.  Thinking about how miserable I am just now made me really, really temped to go ahead and buy a pack.

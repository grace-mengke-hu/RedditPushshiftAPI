Tonight I felt freed.

It’s been close to 2 and a half weeks since I stubbed out that last cigarette and gave up all nicotine cold turkey. Since then it’s been the usual mish mash of varying emotions that I’m sure you’re all familiar with, with the flare ups and the mental wrangling between feeling confident in my progress and having that confident stripped with almost no warning. 

Tonight I went to a band practice - the first one since quitting. Out of the five of us, four of us were smokers, and we’d practically chain smoke when we were neck deep in the creative process. So of course I was terrified that I’d be overwhelmed by desire and I’d slip up when one of the guys pulled out a cigarette. 

But then nothing. 

I still hung out and we still talked amongst ourselves when we’d step outside. I had my bottle of water with me and like my fellow non-smoking bandmate (he quit several years ago), I felt fine. I felt freed that it really had no effect on me. I couldn’t feel happier than I was on my drive home. 

God, it smells like shit. Thank goodness I’m not a smoker.

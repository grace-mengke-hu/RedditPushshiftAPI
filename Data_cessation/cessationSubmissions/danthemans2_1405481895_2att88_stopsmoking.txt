So I'm 34 hours in.

Yesterday after contemplating for days about quitting smoking I threw all my tobacco products out. Cigarettes and chew. I bought all 3 steps of patches. I was smoking almost two packs a day at the age of an early 22. I started almost six years ago. I have been using step one of the nicotine patches to ease the cravings. Now I must say they do work. And if they don't, it's totally a mental game that is making me believe they work. Tonight I was invited out by coworkers to have a few drinks and I obliged. I didn't think it would be too much of a problem until after a few drinks in I realized how much I associate smoking and drinking. I am having such bad cravings but I keep telling myself no. I'm so close to breaking under the pressure. Are there any tips you guys have to veer away from those smoking/drinking urges and also the "well I'm not doing anything, I might as well smoke a cigarette" cravings. They say you can only quit when you want to. I really do. But the withdrawal is driving me insane.

Edit: Posting this and thinking about it is causing my heart to race. I don't know how many people go through this but I'll be damned if the thought of one sounds so good, but so bad. It's like the devils advocate. (Non religious,just a saying)

Double edit: My goal that I plan on making true is making this one day into one year and then into one decade and so one. I want to be done for good.

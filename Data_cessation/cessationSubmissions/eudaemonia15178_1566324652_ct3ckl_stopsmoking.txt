If I'm miserable with cigarettes, I can also be miserable without them

I just had a small realization. I've been feeling blue for no reason all day. So I decided I'm having my last smoke now. If I'm still down "despite" smoking, I'd still be down without them but at least I'd be a non-smoker.

What's the worst part about *trying* to quit smoking? It's living with the fear that one day, or just hours later, you might give in and get to square one again. I'm done carrying that fear around with me wherever I go. 

Now I'm not trying to quit anymore - I am *certain* that I did. Problem solved.

Just relapsed today

I stopped smoking cold turkey for about 5 days but then I couldn't stop thinking about having just one and ended up buying a pack. I smoked two then threw the pack away.

I'm not sure how to prevent myself from doing that again. Also, am I going to experience withdrawal again from the two I smoked?

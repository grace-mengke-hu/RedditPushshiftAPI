Loss of Concentration

Hello quitters. I have been smoke free for 15 days. I can manage cigarettes cravings and other nicotine withdrawal symptoms. But the thing that I am concerned about is my focus!
I am a PhD student and focusing in writing and reading is so essential in this period. Can any veteran quitter advise me when will I have my concentration back?

Second day of a surprise quit

So I decided to stop smoking Friday 4pm, I was thinking on a cut back method so I smoke less each day. 

Finally on Saturday after reading about nicotine withdrawal I thought Iâ€™d better go cold turkey.

So here we are, my throat felt so good this morning when I woke up. Thanks on this sub best reading I find !

My struggling friends, some good news for you.

I thought I would never be able to enjoy my life without cigarettes. Well, here I'm 23 days cold turkey. I do get the desire to smoke some times but it's not difficult to ignore them. I'm drunk now. And honestly a cigarette would just be an excellent thing to do. But you know what  guys, a cigarette is going to be another cigarette then another. I have understood that nicotine is a very powerful drug and manipulative and dangerous at the same time. I'm just enjoying myself, drinking whiskey and enjoying some good music. I thought I would have to abstain from everything, but I was wrong. The real thing is how much we want to smoke cigarettes. Once you realize and accept that cigarettes (nicotine) are out of your life no matter how fucked up your life becomes, It becomes easy. Really easy. No, friends don't worry that you can not enjoy your occasional drink, your occasional joint if you quit cigarettes. My, friends I would strongly recommend you to not quit every fun activities just because there is risk you may end up lighting up a cigarette. Don't torture yourself for getting yourself addicted to cigarettes.
JUST ignore cigarettes and enjoy rest of the things that you love to do once in a while. I don't know what I'm saying makes sense or not  because I'm drunk.

Help!

Every time I try to quit I get this sensation just one a day won’t hurt. I’ve been on this horrible cycle where I will stop for a couple days smoke one cigarette to three and feel like a complete failure after smoking it, but giving myself gratification for going “so long” without one. I can’t take it anymore. Help please.

2 months in!

Its been a bit over 2 months that I have been a nonsmoker!!! I am so proud because this is the longest I have ever gone and I feel like I actually quit for real this time after 10 years!!!! 

Over those 10 years, I struggled a lot with my skin. I have mild eczema and mild acne but I would often get 1-2 cystic pimples and sometimes even more than that. I have barely broken out in the past month!!! If I do break out, they are just tiny pimples here and there.I have had wayyy less eczema flare ups as well!!!

If you have skin issues and are struggling to quit, definitely look forward to the possibility of looking way better!

In additiion to looking better, i feeeel so much better!!

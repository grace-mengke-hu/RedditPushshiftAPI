Evening Triggers

Hi - Today is my 6th day and approximately my 4th attempt at quitting smoking. Previously, I have been smoking for almost 2 years. Also, I consider myself a closet smoker as only a few people know.

During the days I have been able to eliminate or mitigate all cravings. I am glad for this. I do not worry about my current morning routines and potential cravings.

On the other hand, my evenings are another story. My cravings are very intense and I find myself spending 5-10 minutes, in close intervals, contemplating travelling to the nearby store to buy a pack. I can't focus on anything other than possibly giving in and trying to rationalize buying a pack for a single smoke with the intent of quitting later.

This is likely due to the fact that I would often binge smoke at the end of the night when both my parents and girlfriend would not be able to "catch me" as they are anti-smoking... I wish I were like them and never picked up this habit...

Anyway, I wanted to get that off my chest. Definitely not looking forward to my triggers tonight. Thanks for tuning in.

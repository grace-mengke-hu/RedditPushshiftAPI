44 days in just another non smoker.

I haven't posted in the sub for a while but for the most part everything is awesome. I've rarely had any cravings besides yesterday when I was sitting in a smoke pit. I felt like it was just one big test to see if I could handle it. I did. I only thought about how easy I could smoke right now for several moments. Then I was just another non smoker surrounded by smokers. I feel like a have stepped over a new milestone. I thank everyone in this sub for their support of one another and wish everyone the best.

Should I reset my badge?

A few days ago I smoked a few cigarettes. I was severly sleep deprived (2 hrs of sleep), and I haven't wanted to smoke since and am certain the only reason i did was because i was around another smoker. I also didn't drink nearly half the dose of coffee i usually have. I feel like it wasn't a big deal, since I don't want to smoke and since the decision was made while in a weak state of health/mental clarity (coffee drinkers you know what I'm talking about), I don't think it changes all the progress I've made. What are your thoughts?

the quiet before the storm?

I'm on day 10 today and I seem to be finding it a lot easier than I expected is this normal. I'm scared of getting to comfy with it incase it all come crashing down soon!!! I'm not using anything as a substitute just willpower. I was a smoker for 8 years and had about 20 a day!!

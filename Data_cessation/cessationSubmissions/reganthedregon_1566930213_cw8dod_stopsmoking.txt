Tobacco alternatives for joints?

Long time lurker, first time poster. 

Day six of being smoke free and I'm feeling fantastic. Smoker of ~12 years and have mixed tobacco in my joints for as long as I can remember. I don't miss the taste of tobacco but I have noticed the burn is different it and I'm going through more weed than I normally would.

Wondering if anyone has been in the predicament and can suggest a nicotine free substitute? I live on the east coast of Canada incase that makes a difference. 

Also quick general thanks to this sub! Really enjoying reading everyone's quitting experiences!

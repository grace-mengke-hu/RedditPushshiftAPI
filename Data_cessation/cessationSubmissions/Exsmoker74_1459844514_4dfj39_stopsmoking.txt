Day 5

I know Jesus Christ has pulled me through this. I used the patch day 1 and 2, and decided i was going to quit cold turkey. It has been very hard. I have a lot of other personal (very serious) issues going on. However, i want to do what i can to be around as long as i can for my son. I believe that the patches were helping me, but I choose to depend on my faith in Christ to get me through....

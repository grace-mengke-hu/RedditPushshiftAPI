Day 2

I have been "trying to quit" for a few weeks now finally have made it 2 days smoke free and think i can keep it up.  Here is a little back story started smoking at 13 now 25, I have quit a few time over the years the longest 1.5 years.  It always ends the same was one day I have just had my limit with work/home whatever and end up smoking "just One" which as we all now is a lie.  Well the current situation is I am 19weeks pregnant did not smoke when I planned my pregnancy or when I got pregnant however a few weeks ago I picked it back up, I have a very high risk pregnancy and absolutely know smoking is not helping anything.  I will make it through this quit and hopefully this time I will be smart enough to never pick it up again.

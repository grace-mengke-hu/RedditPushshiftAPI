Thanks for helping me quit!

Smoked for 15 years and didn't get the courage to quit until I read all of the positive posts while lurking on this sub. I'm still occasionally using a low nicotine vape whenever I go out, but I feel a million times better. It's been over four months now! Keep up the good work everyone!

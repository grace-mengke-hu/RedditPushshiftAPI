Icy hot to the brain

I’m 25 days in, quit cold turkey after 22 years. Most of the time I’m okay, but when I have those trigger moments it feels like I have just put three layers of icy hot on my brain(like Vic’s vaper rub). Anyone else feel this? I’m also forgetting a lot of things, like who I’ve emailed, meetings at work, conversations at home. Just worried that something is wrong...can’t seem to have things normal. Will this ever stop? Not even going to go into my increased depression on this one, more concerned about this at the moment. Thank you for any insight or thoughts.

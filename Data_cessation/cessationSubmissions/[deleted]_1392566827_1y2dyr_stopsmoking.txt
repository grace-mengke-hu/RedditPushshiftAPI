ITT: Taste

Everything talks about this coming back and "oh my God, I can appreciate food again!" but I'm always slightly leery of what looks to me like hyperbole. 

Please tell me your personal (blunt) experiences on *if/how* your sense of taste changed after you quit smoking. And if it did, how long it took to do so.

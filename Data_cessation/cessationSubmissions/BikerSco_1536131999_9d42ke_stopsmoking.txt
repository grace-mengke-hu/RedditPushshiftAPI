Three days in... But will i get through the weekend?

So yeah three days in and I'm feeling good. My cravings have subsided massively but I have the toughest challenge yet ahead of me. I'm off to a stag do this weekend to a foreign country with a bunch of my biker mates. 

I'm dreading it as I have done so well already. 

Three nights ago I got really angy about my addiction to nicotean and my constant requirements to have a joint before bed and when I had no weed I just got angry with myself and thought fuck this why am I bowing down to an addiction. There and then I got out of bed, went down the stairs, smoked my last cig and threw the rest in the bin along with all my weed stuff, grinder, tray, bong, skins, everything got binned and the money I had planned to spend on the weed got put in a glass jar. I have been putting the money I would spend on cigs in this glass jar every day I haven't smoked. 

I quickly builds up, how did I manage to afford this addiction up until now, I should be loaded. 

So any tips for getting through this weekend would be great.

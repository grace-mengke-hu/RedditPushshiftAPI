I put my last cigarette out after lunch today

I started the Fire Academy about a week ago. While tobacco isn't prohibited, it's strongly recommended that we stop smoking now, due to the insane amount of breathable hazardous materials that firefighters are exposed to.  

Several of the other cadets, including myself, have all agreed to quit smoking. I've always thought I'd just smoke until it killed me, like it did a few members of my family.  

I'm absolutely ecstatic about becoming a fireman. It's a childhood dream of mine and I think after a big career change that I've finally found my calling. I'm excited about improving my life by kicking such a terrible habit. Thanks for reading, you guys rock.

Is smoking Hookah not knowing it was tobacco cheating?

I recently went to a Hookah Bar with a few friends. I was pretty paranoid about it being tobacco, but everyone told me it was just water vapour, so I smoked it. Later at home I found out it was tobacco, but most if not all of the nicotine was filtered out by the water. 

I was wondering what you guys thought. I'm not feeling any cravings, or got the feeling I got when I smoked. I'm not going back, and I personally don't think its cheating. What do you guys think?

I know this subreddit is about stopping smoking, and that's why I ask here..

I was born with a very high pitched voice, and one of my friends threw an idea that smoking could lower a voice pitch. Im 23 and I've never had an addiction to smoking. I've tried cigarettes 3-4 times in my life but never got any farther than that. Im also not addicted to alcohol, so everything is pretty much fine with my genes. No smokers or drinkers in my bloodline either. Im also healthy as a bull and the last cold I had was 2 years ago, I go to pool once a week, so I might be able to handle doing this for a couple of weeks or maybe months without getting seriously harmed. 

Before you are going to stop me or telling me that it's stupid and harmful, I want to hear your thoughts about cigarettes and a voice. Is it possible for me to do that just for a month and get it noticabely changed for the rest of my life?
How long it took for you to have your voice changed?

Tbh I'm afraid to do it as well, but my voice is very imporatant in my profession and personal life.

Thank you.

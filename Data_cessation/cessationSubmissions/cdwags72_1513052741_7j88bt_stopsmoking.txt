Juul addiction

So, if you don't know, there's a huge trend of e-cigarettes going around called juuls. These things are nuts with 24 mg of nicotine in each "pod" which is the size of the tip of your thumb. I have been using this thing for a good 4 months quite excessively, and I cannot make myself stop. I've tried quitting cold turkey, but the cravings were much too strong. I was gonna ask for some suggestions on how I should go about quitting. Is nicotine gum a good idea for someone like me who can't quit cold turkey? Any feedback is welcomed, thank you very much :)

Made it through my first week!

Started last Saturday and it's been just over a week since my last cigarette. 
I've had the weirdest side effects. Almost no cravings, but I've got a horrible cough and I'm so unbelievably irritable (although that only really started today). 
I don't even know what I came to say, just that I'm already loving this community and without it I wouldn't even be trying. You guys have already inspired me this early. 
Here's to many more weeks smoke-free!

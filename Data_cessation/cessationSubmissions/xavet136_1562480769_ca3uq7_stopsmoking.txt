Anger

So, I cold-turkey quit smoking about 3 months ago. Before that, I was a 1.5 pack-a-day smoker for about 6 years. I no longer have any temptation to smoke, even if I'm hanging out with my friends and family who do so.

My reason for seeking help today is anger.  Over the last few years, any time I got angry, stressed, sad, frustrated, or any adverse emotion, I would smoke. One cigarette, then another every 20 minutes until I had dealt with my feelings. Now, without that nicotine, the littlest things make me fly off the handle. I say cruel, insensitive things to the people I love. Sometimes, I get so frustrated and angry at silly things (my computer not working right, someone cutting me off in traffic, etc.) that I feel like I'm either going to pass out or have a seizure. I'm afraid of myself. I used to have composure enough to make a saint jealous. How do I fix this? Why can't I just calm down? Has anyone else experienced this? Will it go away after more of my neurons have re-built themselves?

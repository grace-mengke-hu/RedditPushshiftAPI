Hi, im new here!

Ive been talking to a woman I want to spend the rest of my life with and I realized that I want to spend as much time with her as possible and as a smoker for 6 years I decided I would quit.  I ran out of smokes last saturday night and havent had one since!  Woohoo 7 days!  I quit cold turkey, with nothing but toothpicks and altoids to keep me occupied and to keep the oral fixation problem at bay, the only problem i have now is the urge to start smoking again.  I doubt I will go out and buy a pack right this minute, but I really want a smoke from time to time and I know it might take a while for the urge to go away.  What are some good alternatives to curbing the urge or even replace the urge for nicotine for something else all together?   Thanks for the help and stay strong!

At 80 days, been craving really bad, but had a realization

I've been really busy with school, and been feeling down about myself for a few reasons, and as such have been telling myself that I really want a cigarette. I haven't come close to caving, but I had a realization. It's not that I want a cigarette specifically, I want ANYTHING that will fill that void--it's just that cigarettes are the easiest life change you can make. Just buy a pack and boom! You're a different person. But I'm working hard to fill that void with something healthier, or even better, just get rid of the void!

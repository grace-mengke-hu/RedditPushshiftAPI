Can't use my vape, afraid of what's to come

I'm currently under 18.. I've only been a smoker for a year and a half. Since I quit, I've been using my vape to help, and it's been working great! However, my parents found out about it and swiped the charger from my room. Now I'm forced to go cold turkey and I'm afraid my will won't be strong enough. I don't know what to do. Please give me some advice before I'm not thinking straight...

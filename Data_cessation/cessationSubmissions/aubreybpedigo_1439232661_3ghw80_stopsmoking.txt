First 24hrs, for the last time

Tried quitting a few times, 24F, but the biggest problems were situations that i have become used to smoking through, my 40min commute is a big one. What are some replacement habits that have proven successful? 

Also, do NRT like patches or gum or ecigs really help out all that much? They're $50ish and I want to know before i commit to one.

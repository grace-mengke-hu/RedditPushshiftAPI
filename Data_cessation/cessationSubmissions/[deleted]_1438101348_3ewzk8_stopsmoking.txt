I can't stop.

Hey, it's my first time posting here. I'm male, 19 years old. I've been smoking for 3 years now, 10 cigs a day at least. I already tried to stop a lot of times. The longest time without a cigarette was 5 days, I'm trying to stop again right now because one of my friends gave me nicotine patches for birthday and she really wants me to stop, so do I.

It's the 4th day today without a cigarette and the patches help me a little bit. I usually sweat a lot when I don't smoke or I get angry for no reason, but not with the patches. The main problem is the psychological dependence. 

Believe me, I've done a lot of drugs. None of them got me addicted except for nicotine.

It's not the nicotine itself I'm craving right now (Because I use the patches), it's the act of smoking. I really want to smoke a cigarette but I also want to stop. 

Do you have any advice for me what to do? I always have this picture in my head: A sunny day, a nice glass of beer and a cigarette. Whenever I think of it I'm about to run outside and do exactly that.

This week a friend will celebrate his birthday and I will be drunk. I'm really afraid that I'll relapse. Any advice from people who were in the same situation? When will the urge to smoke go away or at least get weaker?

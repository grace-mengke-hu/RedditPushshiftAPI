Insomnia my old friend 😳

So everything is going good, no desire to smoke and still have a real fear of the thought of even putting a cigarette near my mouth. My moods have been up and down but have seemed to settle. My sleeping was great, I was having the best sleep but unfortunately the last week my old mate insomnia is back ☹️ I am really hoping that this is a temporary thing, as I have had to cut back to one cup of coffee a day since quitting so can’t drink it throughout the day to keep me going.

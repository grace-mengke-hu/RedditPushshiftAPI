Awwww Shiiiiit.... Made it to 4 weeks! Thanks /r/StopSmoking!

I've finally done it.. I've made it to a month!!! I feel AMAZING. I still get some slight cravings from time to time, but mostly only when I think about how long I've gone with out one. 

Even though I've quit, I'm still reading Allen Carrs Easyway, and it's doing nothing but reinforcing my decision to never smoke again. I'm only half way through.. but I'm already thinking about all the people that I want to recommend this book to. 

It's truly incredible how this book makes you realize that smoking has been the cause to all the problems you've been trying to solve by smoking. Smoking doesn't fill the void.. it creates it. That part really resonates with me.

At any rate, just wanted to say thanks to all those in here that have given me the tools & support I've needed to finally kick this habit! I feel like I've got a new life ahead of me now!

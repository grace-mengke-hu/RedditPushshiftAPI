It's the second day.

I knew was going to get here as feeling poorly last night and no energy to get cigarettes. So it was an easier give up moment.  But now morning and off to work and it does seem to be a lot harder. Ho Hum. Well good luck for all you ex smokers, those folks trying to give up and well just all of us really.

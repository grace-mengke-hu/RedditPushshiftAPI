21 days! I feel and look healthier.

Sometimes is hard to resist the cravings, but then I look in the mirror and I see that there is something different about me, I look better than when I smoked. Also, my hands don't smell like cigarettes...and I can wear cologne now and it feels good to smell good! These little things make it worth it for me. I also feel  proud and it feels good to know I have self discipline. anyway, stay strong!!!

Day 2. Easy peasey eat my shorts.

 I hope it’s okay that I’m posting so frequently. This is seriously helping.
You guys have helped me stay accountable and it’s been nice to read your comments and words of encouragement. 

So far the CBD oil has helped a little. I’m technically only 17 hours in but I’m feeling pretty good. I’m getting cravings but no slips. This morning was especially hard while I drank my coffee. 

This is the longest I’ve ever gone cold turkey without any slips. I’m so freaking proud of myself. 

Guys I really think I got this.

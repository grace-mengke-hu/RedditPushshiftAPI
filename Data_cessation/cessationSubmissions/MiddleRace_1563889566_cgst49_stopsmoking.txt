29 Days and Counting - Anyone get a sudden itch from the nicotine monster?

Heya everyone

&amp;#x200B;

Today I am 29 days free and having a blast! but, for some reason all this week i have had strong thoughts of just lighting up. or thinking more frequently of it. Anyone go through this in their 4th week?  


My mindset is now of a non smoker, and with each thought i tell myself that i will never fall into the trap again. I wont redo these 4 weeks over again and wash away all my hard work. It is getting much easier to say no to cravings.

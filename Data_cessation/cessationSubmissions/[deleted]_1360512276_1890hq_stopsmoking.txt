Boyfriend is quitting. How can I help?

My boyfriend of 1.5 years is trying to quit smoking (not his first time trying). He's been a smoker for probably about 10 years, and is on his 6th day so far. 

I've never smoked a day in my life so I have NO idea what he's going through right now. I can't tell him how proud of him I am, or suggest things that might help, because he doesn't want to talk about it for fear that it will bring on a craving. 

So, what can I do to help? Should I even try to help, or just let him do this on his own? I was thinking a rewards system, maybe. Something nice/something he wants for getting through 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, etc. Thoughts? Ideas?

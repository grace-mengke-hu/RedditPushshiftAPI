Microdosing LSD to help with cravings?

Anyone have experience with this? I’ve been full-out tripping but I still have little inklings. It’s a different sort of craving though, instead of 75% wanting some nicotine, it drops down to like 0.005%. None of the annoyingness of “oh I want a cigarette” ig it’s just because I don’t know what to do with myself. It’s an ingrained habit. I do have some forms of mental illness and wanted to give microdosing a shot. Idk, any words of wisdom or experience is appreciated! Thank you.

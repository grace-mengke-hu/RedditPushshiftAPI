Day 4 with my ecigarette. Things going better than expected

Just wanted to post here because i feel good about myself right now. I have tried quiting so many times and i think this is actually working. Ive smoked one cig in the past 4 days and my lungs already feel better. To anyone thinking about stopping, i think this is a really great invention. Best of luck.

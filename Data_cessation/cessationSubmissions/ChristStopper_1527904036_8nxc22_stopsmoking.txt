5.5 days smoke free. Just rode in a car with a smoker who smoked while driving and offered me one.

I struggled but just didn't respond and tried hard not to think about it. I didn't take one but couldn't say no out loud. 

Went through all kinds of bargains with myself in my head, I'm still struggling not to go to the other room and ask for one. I'll be in this persons company for the next 4.5 hours. 

Help me. 

(Can't be rude or tell them not to smoke inside at their house as it's a work client).

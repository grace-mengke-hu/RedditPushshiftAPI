Tomorrow will be a NEW day.

I just downloaded the smoke free app and set my quit time for tomorrow at 6:00am. 
I lost quite a bit of weight with a similar visual-appeasing app and hoping the constant graph entries and timer will help keep me on track and motivated as with my NOOM weight graph. I'm excited and nervous...
I've been a pack a day smoker since 2006. I wanted to quit so many times. But sometimes- it fills the time.
BUT- since I almost have lost 70lbs., I've taken up running. So, I run about 9.50/per mile....and I try to do 3-4 miles a day.
I WANT TO SEE WHAT I CAN REALLY DO WITHOUT SMOKING.

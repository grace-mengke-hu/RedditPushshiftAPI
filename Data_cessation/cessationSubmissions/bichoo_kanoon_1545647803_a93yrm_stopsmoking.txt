Distractions to suppress the urge?

I'm on my third day and I've been getting urges every other hour. I'm hardly able to whole heartedly concentrate on something productive, and I know Allen Carr's book too says that for a while after quitting the thoughts are going to be obsessed with smoking. But I'd still like to be a tad bit productive. I've tried reading articles/books each time I feel the need to light up. But it hasn't worked, I lose concentration, I've tried throwing the ball, kicking around a soccer ball etc, I've tried confronting the urge, actually evaluating it mentally, and reminding myself what a redundant, futile act it is, with no place for it in my life. But I still get drawn back into the web of urges. The brainwashed part of me tells, I can still enjoy a couple, I'm young and what not. I'm not categorically artsy etc to doodle or something. Could someone give me any idea as to how deal with the urges, what worked for them and also I think I miss the act of lighting up, and that specific "me" time, how to battle that? I think I know the answer for the "me" time would be what I enjoy tbh, and I've to figure that for myself. But the act of lighting up? Anybody face a similar issue??

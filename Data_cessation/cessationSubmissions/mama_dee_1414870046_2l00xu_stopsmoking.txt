Woo! One week down! These apps were helpful, if anyone needs some help with anxiety.

Successfully one week into my nth time quitting.  Hopefully it sticks this time.

I have pretty bad anxiety issues, which I used cigarettes to medicate.  I've found these two apps to be pretty awesome in the past week.  If you're feeling really anxious, try em out:

Calm: The short mindfulness exercises have been really helpful for getting to sleep, and I've set the nature sounds and videos to play while I'm at work with headphones.  Very soothing. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calm.android

Stop Smoking Hypnosis:  Been doing this every night.  I'd like to try a few others, but it's helpful for just slowing everything down. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev9483.app143307

Any other app suggestions and sharing would be great!

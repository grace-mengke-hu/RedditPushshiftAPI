Day 1 Starts Now

So I've told myself I was quitting I'm not sure how many times anymore.  Recently however I've had some serious health problems that involved being in the ICU for three days.  So it's time to man up and do it.  And it seems like I wasn't really ready before, and I still feel like I'm not ready.

5 days in, sort of?

Got an e-cig for a family vacation i am in the middle of - they don't know I turned into a regular smoker (1/2 pack per day) - as I wanted to kinda quit / kinda just hide it from them. 

But my e-cig broke yesterday (went swimming with it) , and also I wasn't even really using it that much, so I guess I have been somewhere around a whole day without nicotine, and I'm feeling pretty good. 

I keep thinking I'm going to snap, and run out and sneak a whole bunch of cigarettes (especially with the beach chilling and drinking) but it hasn't happened yet. 

Think I need to turn this into a real quit attempt.

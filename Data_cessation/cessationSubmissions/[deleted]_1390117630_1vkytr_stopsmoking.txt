Finished Allen Carrs book yesterday

I started reading it a while back, and put it away when i got to the bit where it says "when you finish this book, you will have quit smoking", i guess i was scared.

I can't bring myself to say "yippee" as suggested in the book, but every pang i've had, i've just repeated "I don't smoke" mantra style, and got on with life. It's amazing how quickly the urge passes.

Already i've got through:  
my partners grandmas Funeral  
a big family reunion with relatives i haven't seen in 20 years (some of them were smoking)  
a big fight with my partner  
a couple of long drives by myself.  
  
All of those things would usually put me into chain-smoking mode, but it's been so easy, it's a little spooky.

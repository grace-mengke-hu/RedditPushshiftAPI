Need help quitting, tips would be appreciated.

So a little background if that helps. I'm 18 years old and picked up the habit around six months ago; the stress of graduating high school, going to college, finding a job, and my last relationship going south being the key factors. Since then my friends and family have been hounding me to quit (one friend going as far as threatening me, which didn't help at all). I've tried e-cigs and nicotine gum but nothing seems to be as good as a cigarette. So I'm curious about what's worked for some of the people here.

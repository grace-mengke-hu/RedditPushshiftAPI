5 days strong

I quit last Friday using Champix that my doctor prescribed, and though I slipped and had a cigarette a few days later, I haven’t had the slightest urge to light one up, even though I have a pack in my desk. It’s honestly the best decision I’ve ever made in my life. I still love those bastards tho.

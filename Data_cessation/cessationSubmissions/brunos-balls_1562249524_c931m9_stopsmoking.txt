Didn’t ask my friends for a cigarette!

A month ago I quit. 2 weeks ago, a friend came over and gave me a pack and I said “no I quit” he said he did too and just left them at my house. I decided to smoke one last one, only ended up taking a couple drags and threw it out. 

I haven’t been around smokers lately, but I moved to a different job site, where my friends work, half of whom are chain smokers. Anytime I’ve tried to quit in the past I would bum cigarettes from them the next day. But I haven’t had any desire to until yesterday. My friend was smoking next to my car, and I was tempted to ask him for one, but it was more of the habit of smoking when someone else was, not that I actually wanted a cigarette. So I didn’t ask for one, and I’m glad I didn’t break my streak!

Feeling really good, and I’m going to keep it up.

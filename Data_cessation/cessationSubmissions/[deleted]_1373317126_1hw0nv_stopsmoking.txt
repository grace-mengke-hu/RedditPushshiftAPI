Another Allen Carr recommendation - I read his book after being 7 months smoke-free

I still had strong, frequent cigarette cravings well into my seventh month of being smoke-free. It was usually the worst on Friday evening, right after I got home from work (often on Saturdays as well). The weekend is supposed to be a time of relaxation, not a time of misery, wishing I could have a cigarette. It's ridiculous but I had a lot of miserable days and evenings when I was pining for a smoke.

Anyway, long story short I gave Allen Carr's book a chance (I listened to it on my iPhone, actually). I could go on and on about how awesome it is, but bottom line is my cravings are now nonexistent. I haven't felt this good in such a long time. The mindset of knowing I never have to smoke again has improved my attitude in other aspects of my life as well. 

I think his book is worth reading or listening to regardless of where you are on your journey. If you have any cravings whatsoever, I think it's worth checking out.

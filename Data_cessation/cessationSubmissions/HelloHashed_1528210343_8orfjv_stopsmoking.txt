I stopped without even trying

This post is supposed to be motivational. I never wanted to stop smoking. I liked the taste, the smell, the way it flows the conversation.. everything
One day my friends told me they were all stoping, for like the third time. I got annoyed, and since I didn’t want to be the only one smoking I didn’t smoke
That was 4 months and 7 days ago. Trust me it’s the best thing you could do
First of all you feel like you can do anything. I just started running for pleasure, something I fucking hated before, and it amazing. 

The hardest part isn’t resisting the cravings in my opinion. The hardest part is changing ur whole schedule. Like I usted to Wake up, and smoke one before school. Now I have 15 minutes before my classes start where I just walk around listening to music. Adjusting to these new schedules and tasks is sort of hard

I never took stopping seriously. My goal actually was to just stop till the start of may and then start again..now I don’t even consider going back 

I recomend the smoke free app by the way. Every time I had a craving I listed it on there and it felt like it calmed down a little, and seeing all the cravings I resisted in the first month is satisfying
Lately I don’t feel the need to smoke at all, all my friends smoke and try to make me smoke again (it’s a sort of joke in our group) but I haven’t given up!

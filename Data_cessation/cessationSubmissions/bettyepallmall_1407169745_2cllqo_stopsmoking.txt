It's actually been pretty easy this time, is that normal?

Sorry in advance for formatting/typos, I'm on mobile.


Ive been smoking a pack a day for seven years,  about 2 weeks ago I decided to quit (I actually decided that longer ago, but about two weeks was when I started stopping) So I put on patches but would still sneak a cigarette or two, then last week I thought Well what's the point of wearing the patch if you're still going to smoke, at least give it a shot!' So I quit, and I set my badge here from the day I stopped smoking. I haven't cheated, and the strange part is... I haven't even WANTED to sneak a cigarette.

So I figured this confidence was due to the nicotine patch. Yeah, I wasn't smoking but no big deal because I still had my nicotine. Well, it came to the point that I was running out of patches and still had a few days before I get paid and could get some more. So I decided to see how terrible I felt without the patch. Today is the 3rd day with absolutely no nicotine and I FEEL GREAT.

Honestly, I feel like I am doing something wrong because... isn't quitting supposed to be hard? It sure was all the other times I've quit. Maybe it's because this time I took Allen Carr's ideas to heart. I really don't want to smoke, I know smoking does nothing for me. I'm just a bit stunned that it has been this easy.... am I in for a rude awakening?

Will it hit me later? It has only been a week. Anyone else actually have a pretty easy time?

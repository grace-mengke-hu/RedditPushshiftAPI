I have hit the three week point. You know what happened to me yesterday? I forgot I wanted to have a cigarette all day.

I don't know about you guys but the fact that I forgot about smoking all day is huge for me. 

The first 3 weeks of my new life haven't been that bad. It only gets easier from here.

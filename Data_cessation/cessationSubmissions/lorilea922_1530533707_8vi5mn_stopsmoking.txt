Day 19 ðŸ™ŒðŸš­

I started smoking around age 14.  I smoked at least a pack a day - sometimes more - but always a pack a day. Iâ€™ll be 58 years old this year. I have quit and failed and quit and failed and quit and failed. I feel so different this time, and I know my quit is going to stick.  Iâ€™m not suffering mentally or physically like I have in the past - I have made up my mind that failing itâ€™s not an option. I am cold turkey but I use a couple apps including one with different backgrounds (soft music, lapping waves, etc.) and a subtle voice that repeats: I have quit smoking easily and effortlessly; I breath in only clean air; my lungs and organs are clean and healthy.  I think those affirmations have made a tremendous difference in reminding me to stay healthy.  I look forward to posting month-long and year-long quit updates!

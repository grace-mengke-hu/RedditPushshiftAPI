Day 7 and I'm starting to feel 26 again.

Before I quit I felt as if my body was giving out on me at the ripe age of 26.  Hangovers would consume my day if I had more than 4 beers; running was becoming more and more difficult, and I had always attributed this to getting older.

Now I know that it was my old "friend" doing most of the damage.  I haven't had this much energy since I was 20!  Has anybody else experienced this sudden rejuvenation after they quit?

Day 100: My boss just handed me $100

Just wanted to say thank you to everyone on here for keeping me sane and on track. My boss said he'd give me $100 if I made it 100 days without cigarettes and today he handed it to me. I can't say how happy or proud of myself for quitting such a nasty habit. I smoked about a pack a day for nearly 15 years. I feel healthier and better about life. For anyone else just starting to or thinking about quitting it will be the best decision you ever make. Stay strong everybody and good luck.

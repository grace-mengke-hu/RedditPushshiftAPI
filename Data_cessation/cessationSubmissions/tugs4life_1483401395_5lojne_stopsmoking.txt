Reset Badge, For the Last Time

Almost 3 years ago I quit for almost 1 year. God that felt amazing, unfortunately I went back to smoking as an excuse to deal with certain life issues. Even worse, I got right back into smoking a pack(25) a day. 



This will be day 3 and I'm feeling great. Last time I stopped cold turkey. Now, I'm taking a different approach, Nicorette gum. This is because I've recently started a new job and do not want the withdrawals to cause any negativity to the people or things I interact with day to day.

For those who are curious, the gum works wonders. Of course, it isn't as satisfying but it keeps my mind clear and allows me to control myself for the 10-15 minutes when I get hit with cravings. I strongly recommend it.   

Anyways, that's it for my intro, thanks to all who provided support the last time around and let's now make this my last!

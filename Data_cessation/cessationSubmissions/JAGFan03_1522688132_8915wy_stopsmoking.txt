Never smoked a day..but

I was a board director at the American Lung Association.  That said, I hope it doesn't ring Hollow but I wish everybody on here that's trying to quit the best of luck. I know it can't be easy but just know there are a lot of good people on this board and I wish everyone could give it up as easily as you picked it up. Go do good things and good health to all of you

First post. I was 10 days in, but relapsed today. Starting again tomorrow.

Stress/pressure from my job pushed me over the edge. 

God, that feeling of walking to the store to buy a pack... it's like an out of body experience. The thing that always strikes me when I'm trying to quit is the magnified feeling of "I'm not in control." I feel like I'm at the mercy of everyone and everything, my boss, my emotions, the world. I know the prevailing idea is that quitting turns the (ex) smoker into the jerk, but my experience is more like a bizarre persecution complex... when I quit, it's everyone ELSE that turns into the Ahole.

Anyway, thanks for having me.

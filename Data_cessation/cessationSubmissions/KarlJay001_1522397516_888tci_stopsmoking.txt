8 years since I last smoked, not one relapse.

April 2010 was when I quit.  I was about a pack a day of Camel 99's for many years.  Started about 11 years old.

I used Allen Carr's audio book:

I've posted a very key tip before, but I'll post it again.  Hope it can help someone else.

DO NOT finish your last pack.  A key part of the habit is to understand that there are several parts of the habit.  One part is running out of smokes and going to the store for more.

Generally, I'd "have" to go to the store when there were about 5 left in the last pack.

So, what I did was made sure there was about 3/4 of a pack, then quit.  That means that I didn't have a reason to go to the store for more.  That 3/4 of a pack lasted a day, then 2, then a week.  I finished it off, but was already out of the mind set of refilling the supply.

The Allen Carr book talks about a key concept, that you actually quit and restart over and over again.  Meaning that after about 20 min or so, most of the effect is out of your system.  If you understand what that means, you're 1/2 way there.  Your body had removed most of the effect, it's a very fast hit and run kinda thing.  Training yourself to have longer and longer delays makes it so much easier to quit.

A lifestyle change helps too, doing things that make it harder and harder to find a chance to smoke really help.

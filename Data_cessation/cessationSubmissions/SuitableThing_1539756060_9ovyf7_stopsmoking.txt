I put out my last cigarette 10 minutes ago.

Enough is enough. I just smoked using a paper protector because I couldn't be bothered to buy more papers. Huge waste of time and money all together. It's time to quit for good. I'm 19 and i've been smoking for close to 4 years. I quit smoking pot after 3 years and quit that last December. I use to mix tobacco with it, mostly more tobacco than weed (50 50 at least, preferably 80 20).


I stopped smoking before for 3 months in the past when someone I liked said it was disgusting. That's absolutely true. Went back to the crap when it didn't work out. Now i'm doing this for me, because I love myself.


I'm looking forward to having a lot more $ in my pocket and having more time in the day to concentrate on important things. No more desperately running to the shops for cigarettes.

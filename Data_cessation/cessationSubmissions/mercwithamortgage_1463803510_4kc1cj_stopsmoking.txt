I quit smoking two days ago. Here's hoping it's for good. Vaping questions.

So I'm 30 years old and I've been smoking for about 3 years now. About a week ago, I found out my girlfriend is pregnant and I want to be able to stick around for my little one. Yesterday was Hell. Today was better.

Does anyone think vaping is a viable alternative? My girlfriend is against being around me while I'm vaping. She doesn't even want to know I'm doing it. I do think, however, that it will be helpful in quitting. There's just so many triggers that make me want to smoke. Driving and work are the two biggest.

Has anyone had success quitting smoking with a vape and then stopping vaping? Thanks for the advice.

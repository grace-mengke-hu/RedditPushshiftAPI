How difficult will it be for me to quit? please read

Hey! I'm 18 years old and have been smoking everyday for about a month now, I had been a social smoker (one or two cigs a week) but recently started full time due to exam stress. 
I have been smoking full time for roughly a month now, I bought a pouch of amberleaf rolling tobacco and I roll my rollies very thin, I squeeze the filter to make it as thin as possible, so I smoke the equivalent of say 2-3 full size cigarettes a day, my exams are over on Saturday the 20th of June (in 39 days) and after that I plan to quit cold turkey. Will quitting for me be very difficult if I keep up my 2-3 a day cigarette habit? I usually smoke before/while I study and never any other time.

Is there any better way for me to quit, should I taper down or is my habit so small that I should be able to quit cold turkey and be fine after a week or two? Opinions appreciated

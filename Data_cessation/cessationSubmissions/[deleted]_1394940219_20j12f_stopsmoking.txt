I can't go out tonight.

I wish I could.  I just moved to a new city 2 weeks ago.  I don't know anyone.  It's been a long work week.  I'd much prefer to go out and discover my new town rather than sit here, drinking beer and watching 'The Interniship' on a saturday night.  But I'm about 100% certain if I go out and try to raise a ruckus I'm gonna wind up smoking.  Blah.  I feel like a pregnant woman or something.

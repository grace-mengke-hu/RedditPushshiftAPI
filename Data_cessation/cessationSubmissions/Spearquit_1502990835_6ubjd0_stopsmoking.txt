Joined because of a stop smoking app - makes a difference reading all of your posts!

Decided to quit, cold turkey, for no real reason after 10 years of smoking. In the middle of a big project at work, but is there ever a good time to quit?

Finding the brain has ever inventive ways of getting back to smoking. Fascinating really. 

Resisted so far, seems to be getting worse before getting better.

Good luck to everyone!

One year smoke free today

I never, ever thought I would drop that habit. Ever. Twenty years of my life, I was positive I’d be stuck a smoker until the day I die. I was 120% sure I didn’t have the strength or courage to go through life without cigarettes. Until a commercial came on TV. Changed my insight in only 5 seconds (University of Phoenix). I do it to get a front row seat at my children’s weddings &amp; it’ll all be worth it when I lay my eyes on my grandchildren. Day1 of no vaping.

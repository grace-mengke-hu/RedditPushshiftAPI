I can't believe I've made it this far!

I have more energy than I know what to do with. I had to run to catch a bus the other day and my lungs didn't hurt. I have noticeably more time. I'm calmer. 

A cigarette still sounds pretty good, but the reasons not to smoke are proving to be more compelling and valuable than the reasons to smoke. And I know I couldn't have just one.

The first couple of weeks really sucked, but it's so much easier now.

Hang in there, new quitters!

First time poster, not a first time quitter.

The title says it all. Today marks a week since my last cigarette and I seem to be doing okay. I've been sucking on Juul pods like my life depends on it, but I haven't had cravings or anything which tells me the nicotine strength of these little suckers is enough for me. I'm hoping in the coming weeks to start using the Juul less and less, to slowly wean myself off nicotine. I've tried the patch, I've tried gum, I've tried cold turkey, I've tried "cutting back", I feel like I've tried everything but medication. My doctor was excited for me when I went last week and told her that I'm trying to quit, she even went so far as to say she wouldn't badger me about my weight for the time being so as to allow myself to focus on my nicotine consumption, which I thought was pretty cool in and of itself. One addiction at a time I suppose. 

My mom made a comment that's really stuck with me. I explained that it's been a week since I last smoked a cigarette. She then pointed at my Juul and said "what's that, then?". I mean, she isn't wrong, but on the other hand I'm pretty sure e-cigs are at least marginally healthier than smoking analog. Her heart was in the right place, but I was really hoping she'd be proud of me for staying strong. I guess that's why I'm making this post, for validation. Just typing all this out however seems to be validation enough. I feel good about this choice, and even if I continue to use my Juul for the next couple of months, I'm glad to not smell like smoke or have to leave my apartment for a cigarette anymore.

Here's to all of y'all who have quit before me and those that will quit after me. We're a strong community, and I'm excited to see what the future brings!

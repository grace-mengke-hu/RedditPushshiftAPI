Betting on myself

Just left a dental appt with a 5k estimate due to decay caused by soda and smoking (15years smoking, 30 now). So it's time. It's past time. Plus I need the money saved to pay for the repairs! I might be crazy to think I can cut soda and smoking at the same time, but my mindset now is that I'm accepting two weeks to a month of misery in exchange for something worth much more than that time. Just smoked one last cigarette and had one last coke so there's no excuses. Time to metamorphose into a better, more healthy person!

BUTT

Today I went to the store to get some eggs. On the way in, I noticed a guy bend over, pick up a cigarette pack then drop it back on the ground. It promoted me to giggle. He heard it and glimpsed in my direction, but kept moving. There was an ash tray in front of the store which he went too immediately next, which I giggled once again as I entered the store. 

After buying  my eggs and walking back home I must have laughed a solid 5 minutes because I've totally been in this position myself more than I'd like to admit, hoping noone would notice or see me.

Having been in such a position, I know how humiliating and embarrassing, not to mention disgusting it is. To have someone giggling  at you while you are doing that though must have been one hell of a blow to any self respect you'd still have.

Damn, I'm so glad I don't smoke no more.

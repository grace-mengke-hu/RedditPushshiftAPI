NRT and healing times? Anyone have any good literature about this? Having trouble finding consensus on this issue

Ok so I fucked up my ACL (important part of your knee) and depending on how bad it ends up being, likely requires surgery to fix.   Hoping it doesn't but it probably will.  So.  

I know that cigs and specifically the nicotine slows healing time down- but I'm having trouble finding good literature on the effect of NRT on ligament healing.  I will certainly be discussing this with a doctor, just wondering if anyone here has any good sources or has had experience with this.

If I have to stop the gum I will, but even with the gum I've had difficulty quitting, and I just become massively bitchy.  I'll do what's necessary to heal best but during this stressful time I know what I'd prefer- the easy road of nicotine gum.  :///

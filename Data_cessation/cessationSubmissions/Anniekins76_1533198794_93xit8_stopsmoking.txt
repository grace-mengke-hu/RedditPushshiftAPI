Had enough. It stops now! (Well half an hour ago) with the help of you guys I CAN do this!

Good grief, how many times over the last 3 months have I stopped and started, I couldn’t get my head around it (after previously having stopped for 1.5 years and stupidly having “just one”.. idiot). But it’s over. I’ve had enough of being a slave to nicotine. Smelling disgusting and having no confidence. So I’m back, determined to do this this time, I WILL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CIGARETTE! 

I’m going to spend time on here watching your celebrations of success, taking inspiration and helping others. This sub has helped me so much in the past so I’m here to help you all and could probably also do with a helping hand from time to time too. Badgebot contacted, being reset. 

Thanks to all of you for being an inspiration, a support and generally awesome. This girl here in the UK is hugely appreciative.

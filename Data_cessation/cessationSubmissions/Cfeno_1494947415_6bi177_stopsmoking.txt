Negative side effects?

I quit 6 weeks ago today after hypnosis. I'd tried it before and found it very easy, but then found it very easy to take up smoking again ("ill just have one, sure i know how to quit now").....this time was a lot more difficult and felt a lot more real (proper withdrawal symptoms), which I think is a good thing as i definitely don't want to go through this ordeal again so i think it's permanent now!

One question, and apologies if this has come up in previous posts (I'm new to Reddit)....has anyone suffered physical side effects of quitting. I'm talking specifically occasional hoarseness (like my voice Is breaking!) and an ache in my upper back. Both came on about 2 weeks after quitting and are persisting today. I'm guessing it is something to do with such a radical life change (Ive smoked for 25 years of my 39 year life!) but wanted to hear if anyone else had a similar experience

Im not craving, i'm just angry!

I've been working on quitting for a couple months (I cut down a lot before going cold turkey for the past week).

I learned a lot about myself and my brain, my habits, my stupid reactions to triggers... The one thing that sticks out: i'm not really craving a cigarette, i don't actualy desire to inhale smoke, i'm just angry and irritable!

I guess i used to associate anger with smoking, as if one was the cure to the other. I need to learn to deal with anger without automaticaly thinking that smoking will solve whatever my problem is, nor will it make it easier. Cigarettes won't make me better at fixing my car, cigarettes won't unhurt my foot i just banged on a furniture...

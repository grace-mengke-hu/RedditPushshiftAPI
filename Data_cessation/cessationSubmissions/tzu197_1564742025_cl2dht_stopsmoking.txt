4 days and 14 hours since

My last cigarette was over 4 days ago. No cheating this time with electronic cigarettes or any other “nicotine replacement therapy,” I gotta say I’m starting to crave them more and more, and gets worse when it’s coffee time or after a meal, at this point I can even identify the brand a cigarette people around me smoke just by the way the smell, and I hate to admit it but they smell good... How do you veterans cope with these urges?

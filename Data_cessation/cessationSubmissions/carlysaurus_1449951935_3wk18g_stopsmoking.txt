Almost relapsed last night.

One of my closest friends and I got stupid-shit-faced-blackout drunk last night. At the bar where I always used to chain smoke outside with the waitresses. His lovely pregnant wife sat there with us being drunk idiots for an hour or so, then drove us back to their house. I fell asleep on their couch for a few hours. Throughout alllll that time, I didn't even really think about smoking....


Then I woke up at 2am and realized I had to walk the two blocks home to my boyfriend's house. I remembered the broken half-cigarette that's been at the bottom of my black hole of a purse for two weeks, and the lighter that was there for some reason. It wasn't even a question...I was going to smoke that cigarette. When I found it, I saw that all the tobacco had fallen out (duh, of course it did. Jangling around a purse for weeks) so I didn't get to smoke it. 


I'm really disappointed in myself. I wish I didn't still associate drinking and smoking. I've made it through two Fridays without smoking so I know I can do it. Blackout carlysaurus needs to not happen for a while.

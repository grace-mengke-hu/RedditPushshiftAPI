The dreaded car ride

The car has always been my favorite smoking spot. I've been dealing with my normal commute pretty well and it hasn't been an issue.

Yesterday I took my long trip (3 hours or so each way) since I quit over a month ago. And you know what... It was totally fine. I chewed some gum and that was that.

For anyone who thinks you can't make it through your big triggers... You can.

Today makes 12 years without a cigarette. Quit today and celebrate every year with me.

It helps to pick a significant date to quit and to plan for it. I was usually a New Year's quit date type -- failed several times, of course, but it was practice. The year I quit, I was so sick of it, I just decided to give it up on Christmas Eve rather than even bothering to wait for the new year. Thankfully, it stuck. But I still wouldn't trust myself to have even one. Fortunately, I wouldn't want one either. Good luck!

Day 1 - Girlfriend Issues

Well, I've been smoking for 6 months now, and I've been with this girl for 4 months. She's absolutely gorgeous, sweet. The perfect girl. Except for one little detail: I can't smoke. Today, she found out that I smoked and she gave that look that a person has when someone wrecks you. I'm a fuckup. So, I decided: No more Luckies. Someone badge me up.

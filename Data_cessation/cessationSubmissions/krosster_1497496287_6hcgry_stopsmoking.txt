I really love the badge here in the community. It's encouraging (:
I'm feeling pretty anxious all day today and wanting to smoke more than I have been. I made It through without one though. 
It's also been hot so I wonder if that's why I feel drained. Spacy. 
But I keep thinking about smelling things better. And working on hygiene/fitness.
I am excited about my new non-smoker life (:

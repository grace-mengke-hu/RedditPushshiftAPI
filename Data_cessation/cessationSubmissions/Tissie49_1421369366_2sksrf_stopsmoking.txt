I have a star!! But....

Ok so I'm on day 30 feeling really proud and determined to be a non smoker. I smoked for 22 years. Stupid. But...for the last 3 or 4 evenings I have felt what I think is anxiety. Tight chest, hot flushes. Why after all these days would I be getting anxiety now? I got through the first 72 hours with minimum problems. I was very sick at the time so smoking was not an option. So I just figured I would quit. I am very happy about this new me, but I'm just not understanding why I'm feeling anxious now. I haven't until now. Got through Christmas, New Years and anniversary dates for deceased parents and brother all who passed over Christmas a few years apart. So why now?? Can anyone help?

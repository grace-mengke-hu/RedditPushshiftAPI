My quit, or how I took advantage of a flu

I'm on day four today and I'm very strong and confident.
I wanted to share the way i decided to stop, few days ago. The thought of quitting had been in my mind for weeks (I used to be a heavy smoker, or at least a very compulsive one), but i never found the force, and always thought to me "it's nonsense to try and quit now, i would relapse in an hour", which actually happened.

Then, a morning I woke up with light flu symptoms with some cough and, incidentally, I had no cigarettes on me. 
That was just the opportunity I was waiting for: yes, I spent 2 days in bed and did quite nothing, but now I passed the more severe part of the withdrawal and I feel like I did it (let's hope so)

Conquering the mental boxing match between being rational and giving into the addiction is so damn hard!

This is my third time quitting in the past year, and my first year of developing a proper understanding of what smoking is and what it has done to me. Even still, with having truly accepted the illusions that smokers tell themselves to justify this evil addiction, it's around this point in my quit that I always cave in. The mental gymnastics just become so consuming!
More than anything, I don't want this to become the reality this time! I've been more focused in my quit this time; I am learning a new language, exercising (and loving how much easier it feels, how much further I can run, etc), constantly reminding myself of the trickery of the cravings... It has helped tremendously and am really proud of myself. BUT I still fear that in a moment of weakness it will all have been for nothing, I cannot imagine a life spent wrestling with these thoughts, if so I think I'll go mad lol. I know all quitters say it gets easier, after 3 weeks, a month, 3 months, 6 etc, but that is such a long time (for a quitter)! Really determined to maintain my strength. Any support will be so helpful.

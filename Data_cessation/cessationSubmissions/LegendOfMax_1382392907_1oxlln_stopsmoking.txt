I need some support.

You guys do a great thing here by motivating each other to quit, really, you do. But I have tried multiple times, all with the help of my friends, and still disregard their will for my urge for a cigarette. 

I spent all summer away from home, and the entire time I wasn't addicted to smoking. I would have one occasionally, but I stayed inside 4 out of 5 times when they would go out for a smoke. Keep in mind, these are different friends than the ones trying to help me quit. When I came home, I guess I was stressed. Classes at my university are getting more difficult, I'm getting more and more weight put on my shoulders, and it seemed for a while that a simple cigarette on my porch was my escape. 

So here I am, 2 month into school, trying to fight the cravings. On days I do smoke, it's typically 3-4 a day. The day after, I feel bad and can make it at least 2 days without a cigarette until I reset and start over. 

I'm sick of craving cigarettes, I'm sick of this outrageous chemical dependence I never wanted to be any part of me, and I'm upset with myself for putting my personal health in the back seat. I want my independence back.

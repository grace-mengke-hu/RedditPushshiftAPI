Had a couple on Friday night, none since and no cravings, should i reset my counter?

It was pretty stupid of me (i was a bit drunk)...but seriously it felt "meh" i was so apathetic about it, and no cravings last night or today at all. I guess i have to just be a bit more proactive and bluntly say no next time! so what do you think "stopsmoking", should i reset  my counter? :)

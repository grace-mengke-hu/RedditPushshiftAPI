Those of us under 7 days, Competition maybe?

I'm finding it helps a lot to have all these people to lean on. Support groups ftw! Plus I noticed these early weeks are really tough for people. Finally, I know a bit of competition can motivate some people.

This post is for those people, the ones motivated by competition. I think we should have our own little contest thing here. 

I have no idea what we could win. We need to figure that out. I'm not very good at creating these things so we'll have to work together on that too. 

Anyone in?

PS: Yah I've been posting every day... it seems to help

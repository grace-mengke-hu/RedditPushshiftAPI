Here I go again

So after managing to quit some time back and staying smoke free for six months - I stupidly had that â€˜just oneâ€™ and was back on the road to ruin. Now, nearly a year later, Iâ€™m back to quitting again. Day 1 starts here. Iâ€™ve done it before - I can do it again.  Just need to get past those first days and weeks ðŸ˜¢. Feeling anxious already.

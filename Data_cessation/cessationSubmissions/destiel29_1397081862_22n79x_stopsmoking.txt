9 Days smoke free

I have been smoking since I was 11, I am now 16. Some days I have to literally talk myself down from smoking every hour and some days I barely feel the need to smoke at all. It's harder because everyone in my house smokes, I am dreading going drinking though as I usually smoke twice as much and everyone around me will be smoking. Anyone got any advice for how to resist when you're out drinking?

I smoked a cigarette yesterday. Stay vigilant!

I quit early this year and just made 150 days today. Well, actually only 149, because yesterday I smoked one :(.

I had a bachelor's party with a few guys I hadn't spoken to for ages. Two of those guys smoke and I used to always have a cigarette with them. So at some point the alcohol and nostalgia got the better of me and I bummed a cigarette of one of the guys.

I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. The feeling of smoke going through my mouth was quite pleasurable. The taste wasn't good, but not very horrible either. What I do know is that this is just a small bump and that from now on I'm not gonna smoke again.

Anyway, I hope this serves as a warning to others: don't get too comfortable. Even when you've beat the most difficult situations, there is always the chance that you get tempted.

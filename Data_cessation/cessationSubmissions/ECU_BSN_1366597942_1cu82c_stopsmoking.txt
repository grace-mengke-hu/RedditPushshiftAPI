And away I go....

Last ciggie out. 21:29....I am a NONSMOKER. 
clean sheets on (no leftover smoked outside then smoked up pillows and such. 

Car aired out, febreezed, & dryer sheets under seats. 

Off for a good shower & clean teeth to wash that smoke right outta my hair. 

Everything I have work as a smoker is at the ready to wash. 

Catch y'all on the flip side....

Normal Red Blood Cell Count

I was wondering if anyone knew how long it takes for the red blood cell count to return to normal after quitting smoking. I looked up the longevity for red blood cells and it says 100-120 days. Does the body produce red blood cells at subnormal rate after the "suffocation" ends to return the RBC to the normal levels or does it take about 100 days for this to happen?

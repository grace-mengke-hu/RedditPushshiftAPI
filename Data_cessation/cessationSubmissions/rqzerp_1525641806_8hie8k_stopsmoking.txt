Reseting my badge

Just a reminder to always be careful. I have been struggling with health and relationship issues lately and ended up smoking.

First just a few puffs, then a few cigarettes because I started to like it again. I haven't bought my own pack yet but I am stopping this now before it gets out of control.

I am resetting my badge to keep myself accountable. Thanks you for reading.

Insane craving after a dream about smoking

I don't remember exactly when I stopped smoking, but it has to be around 3 weeks ago by now.

I don't miss smoking at all, in any situation - most of the time it doesn't even occur to me that I once felt addicted and that something might be "missing" from my life. I'm quite happy without it.

But I have dreams in which I enjoy cigarettes almost every single night. Like, in those dreams I will first desperately look for a place where I can buy them, and when I have them, I feel tremendous relief. And begin to chainsmoke. 

Then I wake up and realize "thank god, it was only a dream". But then the feeling of "joy" that it brought me, just won't leave (I know it's an illusion). But I just can't beat it.

Rationally, I know that I never want to smoke again, but those dreams feel so real and so does the enjoyment. It becomes a really tough battle and made me hate my dreams.

DAE experience it and how do you cope with it?

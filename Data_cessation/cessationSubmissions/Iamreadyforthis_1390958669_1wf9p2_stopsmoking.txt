Fell off the wagon with drinking and my five weeks cigarette free went down with it.

I've been struggling with alcoholism for a while.  I had been over four months free from alcohol and five weeks free from cigarettes.  Then I went on a bender last weekend.  I've since climbed back on the wagon and quit drinking (2 days) but am having trouble following along with the cigarettes.

I thought I was back on track today.  I threw out the remainder of my pack last night, woke up feeling great, and made it all the way to lunch.  Then I started the whole "Just have some smokes today, you can quit tomorrow" bullshit.  Well, it worked and I bought a pack of smokes.

I've read Allen Carr's Easyway and after 15 years of wanting to quit, it seems to be the best method, even though it hasn't worked for me yet.

So, that's where I am.  I just really want to be done with it.  I'm thinking of throwing out the cigs I have left and quitting right now.  Then I think maybe I should set a date, say this Sunday evening, and give myself some time to build up to it. I don't know.

Looking for some support, I guess.

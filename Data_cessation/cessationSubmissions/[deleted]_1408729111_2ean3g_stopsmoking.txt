I'm feeling pretty posh right now...

I decided what to do with some of my saved money. I did the math and I hired a professional cleaner to come every two weeks for 2-3 hours to do the stuff I hate doing. Why? Because I hate cleaning the shower and I hate having to carry the hoover over two flights of stairs. It's a very small three level house. Yep and she irons too! Quitting smoking is totally awesome! :))

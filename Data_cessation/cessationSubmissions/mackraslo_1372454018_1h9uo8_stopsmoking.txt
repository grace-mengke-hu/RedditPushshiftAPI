Has anyone else felt a pinching pain near their heart or left lung area while quitting?

Once in a while I have felt a strange pinching pain feeling on my heart or near it at least.  The pain is not too severe and I have mentioned it to my Doctor before but he hasn't really helped at all.  I was just wondering if anyone else has felt this feeling before?  Anyways, Good luck and stay strong to all of you!  Cheers

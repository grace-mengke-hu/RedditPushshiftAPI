Don't mind me, just on day one and need to bitch.

I TOLD my fiance that I wanted to be left alone this weekend because I knew I'd be in a bitchy mood. I explained that I was going to try not to be, but I've never quit before, didn't know what to expect, and bitchiness might just happen. He complains that it's not fair that he wants to spend time with me and won't be able to if I seclude myself. I succumb and say fine. We go get tires for his car. We go to JCPenney to buy him belts because my dogs chewed up his. We go to Trader Joes.  We go to a jeweler to check on them making something. We go back to the tire place because we had to leave his car there. 

I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD BE IN A SHITTY MOOD TODAY AND SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE. and he is pissed at me because... guess what! I'm in a shitty mood!

I really just want to burn the world down right now. Fuck nicotine.

How do you calm your mind the way cigarettes do?

I started smoking just a few months ago, always been a huge opponent of smoking and the industry as well. But for as long as I can remember myself my mind's been hyperactive. I always think about something and it takes a toll. Smoking cigarettes became those "breaks" when my mind could actually relax and I could have some rest from the unstoppable thinking. I'm sure many of you had this problem. How can I substitute cigarettes to calm myself down every now and again and let my mind relax?

I'm in a predicament! Any help would be appreciated

I was a social smoker for about a year, only smoking when I was drinking, never any other time. In the past few weeks i've started getting cravings and have a random smoke maybe like once or twice a week during the day.

Anyway, I have important exams this year in school and I need to be studying. My cravings are getting in the way of my studying, I just cannot concentrate without a smoke. In the past week i've started having one (a small roll-up cigarette) before studying and I've found I can study much more productively. The thing is, I don't really want to be smoking but I need to if I want to be able to study. 

I can't go through withdrawals if I need to concentrate, do you see my problem? I was thinking of getting an E-cigarette and just smoke that once or twice during my study instead of smoking actual cigarettes.

Anyone have any other suggestions?

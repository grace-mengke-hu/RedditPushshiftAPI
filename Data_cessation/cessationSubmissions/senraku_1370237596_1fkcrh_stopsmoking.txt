Dear smokers of Reddit, try r/electronic_cigarettes! There's an awesome world of tobacco-free vaping beyond Blu and gas station throwaways! *xpost from r/electronic_cigarette*

Dear Redditors and friends at r/electronic_cigarette, Let's try to make the front page with the information in this subreddit. There are some people out there who can greatly benefit, myself being one of them.

I used to smoke cigarettes. I would smoke any brand, any time I could. There was a point in my life where if I was broke and needing a fix, I would regularly collect cigarette butts from gas stations, the ground, ashtrays, and make "frankensmokes" --little rolled up burnt nasties of the devils blend. This was destroying my lungs and self respect. I tried to quit cold turkey, with medicine, patches, and nothing helped. My wife hated sleeping with me, my family were disgusted, and I couldn't taste food. I first purchased an nJoy e-cig on a bus tour i was doing with musicians who had a strict no-smoking policy in the bus. I didn't think I could do it, but i did. I must have bought 10-15 refill cartridges of those things and it wasn't smoking, but it was adequate. I figured there had to be another, cheaper, tastier way. I decided to do some internet research and I found reddit and all the helpful information on r/electronic_cigarette, and now I'm the proud owner of a set of super tasty, long lasting gear... and I'm saving money every day. I will never pick up a cigarette butt from the ground and risk slobbering on someone else's canker sore juice ever again.

After 40 years of smoking I am 27 days a NON-smoker.

I was not able to go 24 hours with out a cig until this quit attempt.  This time I am trying Chantix.  No big deal side effects at all.  The big problem is that if I miss a dose my cravings seem to increase.  Now I am worried about being addicted to the Chantix.  I am still proud of the 27 days though :)

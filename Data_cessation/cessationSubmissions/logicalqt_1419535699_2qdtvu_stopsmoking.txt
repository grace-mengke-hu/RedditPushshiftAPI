3 Weeks

I have the additional challenge of staying at the home of relatives that smoke. Somehow I've stood strong so far. It smells really bad inside though so I'm not so happy with the renewed sense of smell. Its so much easier at 3 weeks than it was at 1. Its always getting easier it seems, although of been drinking a lot lately. I'm thinking of giving up alcohol at some point though. It took some practice drinking without smoking but it got easier the more I did it.

Happy Holidays!

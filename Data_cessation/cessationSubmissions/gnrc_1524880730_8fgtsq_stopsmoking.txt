PSA: Be Careful Out There

My friend offered me a puff of his joint(before anyone gets upset, where I live it's fully legal and I'm an adult). I didn't think to ask if it had tobacco in it and I found out the hard way. It was just one puff and I honestly didn't feel the effects of the tobacco at all, but it scared the shit out of me. I had 2.5 years before my first relapse and I'm confident I won't relapse again.

With that said, we live in the age of marijuana legalization. Things are going to be much different in the coming years. I can't tell you how many times I've been offered a blunt and people don't realize the wrapper IS tobacco. Lots of people like to smoke spliffs, why I don't know.

Either way, just be careful out there. Tobacco is everywhere and pairs well with marijuana. ASK BEFORE YOU TOKE!

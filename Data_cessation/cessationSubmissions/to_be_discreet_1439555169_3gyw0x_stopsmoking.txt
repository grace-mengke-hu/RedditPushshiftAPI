Celebrating 6 Months!

I'm celebrating 6 months of not smoking today. I can't even begin to explain how glad I am that I quit. Almost two months after I quit, I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma and I've been going through chemo. 

Had I not quit before treatment, it would have been a lot more risky (one of the chemo drugs can cause permanent damage to your lungs). 

I wish everyone the best of luck on their quitting! It's not easy but so worth it!

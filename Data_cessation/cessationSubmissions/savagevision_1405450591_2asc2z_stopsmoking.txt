Update: First Week Complete.

The week hasn't been too bad.  I did the patch for the whole time and could really tell a difference.  Cravings were far less frequent than other times that I've quit.  Gonna skip to step 2 on the patch rather than continuing on step 1 for another 4 weeks cuz I'd like to get off the nicotine all together.  Wish me luck for the next week!

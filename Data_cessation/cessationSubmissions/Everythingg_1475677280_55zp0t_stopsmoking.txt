How do you manage your nic fits?

What are some of the methods you use to get passed a Nic Fit without Smoking?

Every time I try to quit I seem to fall apart around the 12hr mark. Once I was able to make it to 3 days, but that is the best I have done in the last 3 yrs. 

(note I am a pack(25cigs) a day smoker for about 20yrs)

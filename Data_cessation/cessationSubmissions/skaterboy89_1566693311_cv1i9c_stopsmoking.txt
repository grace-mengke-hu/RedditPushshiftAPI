I Smoked for 14 years and am 8 days into quitting

I have wanted to quit for a while now.  I made it three months and was super proud of myself but then I started again for no apparent reason. I was ashamed and hid my smoking addiction from my gf for several months. She smelled it on my breath the other day and I ended up telling her everything. Obviously hiding my addiction was shitty of me but the catharsis I felt after I told her renewed my desire to quit. I made a list of reasons to quit and taped them to my door so I see them every time I leave the apartment.

My last smoke was over a week ago. I popped a bunch of lozenges my first two days and have not had any nicotine since last Sunday morning. During the first three days I had mood swings and cravings. I had to get through a 13 hour solo highway drive which involved me yelling at myself to the point of exhaustion for the first two. After that I felt a great inner reserve of strength and pride. I was also impressed by some of the vile shit I was able to fire off at my addiction during my temper tantrum.

I'm done with this shit and I'm done thinking I don't have control over my addiction. Thanks for reading, god bless.

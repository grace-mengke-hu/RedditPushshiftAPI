[m26] Smoker for 9 years. Now quit smoking (30+days). This is what worked for me.

Im 26 year old. I started smoking when I was 17. After smoking continuously for 9 years (except for 6 months in between). Now I am quitting smoking for good. I have not smoked a cigarette since the holidays and from the way I am feeling right now, I am confident that I am finally out.

I have listed the things which have worked for me in my effort to quit. Hope this helps others as well.

1) **Start from a safe place**: I took a holiday and stayed at my parents place for 2 weeks. A safe haven where I have never smoked in my life and a place where I really don't want to smoke (<5 year old nephews and nieces). Since this took away smoking as a possibility when being inside the house, it was basically a game of managing the cravings while not going out rather than a game of trying not smoke. Also my parents' house is pretty comfortable (good food, plenty of servants to take care of chores) so you are not miserable quitting smoking (as opposed to quitting while working 70 hour week). Once you have crossed the craving line (usually 15 days) its easier to come back to regular life and not smoke

2) **Replace with harmless non addictive habit**: The keyword is harmless. Mine was coffee. My mom makes one of the best coffees I have ever had and every time I felt like a cigarette I'll ask her for a coffee. She was happy that I like her coffee so much and I was putting cigarettes out of mind. After 2 weeks you lose your cravings for cigarettes so you don't have to this forever.

3) **Go to Gym**: This is a super hack. Going to gym and having other goals will make smoking look less appealing (you will lose the interest in smoking). My goal is to do be able to do a 1Hour long run with an average 9kmph speed. I can currently do 40min at 7.5kmph. Once you have some goal and start working out, your body and mind will take of themselves by adjusting their craving. These days I crave for good food (meat veggies) and put off by bad stuff (smoking, fast food) naturally.

4) **Have rules that affect smoking** : This is opposed to making a non smoking rule. I have made the rules that I don't buy cigarettes, don't allow tobacco inside my room and don't talk to people when they smoke (I ask them to finish their cigarettes first). These are rules which reduces my chances of relapse and since they have nothing to do with me smoking, very easy to implement. By this way you are breaking your habits around smoking and not facing smoking directly.

These three are mind hacks which are helpful once you are at or have crossed the craving line,

1) **Be a non-smoker and not a smoker who quit**: Don't enter the frame of mind where you are using your willpower to stop smoking. Have a mindset that you need willpower to start again. For example, I now think myself as non-smoker who needs a push to start smoking. It is very easy to say no when your default answer is 'no' and need convincing for 'yes'. Also don't tell new people you meet that you quit. Just be a person who doesn't smokes.

2) **Change vocabulary in thoughts**: Don't think that 'you cannot smoke' think that 'you don't want to smoke'. When people offer you cigarettes tell them that 'I don't want to smoke' rather 'I quit or I cannot smoke'. (The truth is if you cross the 15 day mark you will truly **not want** to smoke)

3) **Concentrate on next step**: When facing habits, forget the big picture. Think very narrow. For example, During the occasional temptation for a cigarette, I just concentrate on not smoking 'that' cigarette and forget all about quitting cigarettes. I just tell myself not this one and end the inner discussion. This helps in snubbing the the rationalisation about *'how one cig. does not matter in the long run'* very early. 

I had quit smoking for 6 months around 2010 for my girlfriend and during that time I used to have a cigarette signed by my GF all the time with me. When I am in a smoking circle, I used to put the cigarette in my mouth as if I am smoking it and just concentrate on not lighting that. It helped and may be useful to some of you. I would not suggest this method because it has two flaws 1) it is very dangerous (all it takes is one match strike) 2) It is dependent on external factors (In my case I started smoking again as soon as my GF started smoking). This defeats the whole purpose.

All the best. Be strong. Be a man.

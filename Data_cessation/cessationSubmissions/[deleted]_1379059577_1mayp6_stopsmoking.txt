Some thoughts on quitting.

So I'm 20, started smoking at 14. at a pack a day now, only because of money. If i had my way i'd probably smoke around 2 packs a day. anyways, i picked up an e-cig for work and all those times that having to smoke holds me back. spent about 50 bucks on the whole setup and It has changed my life. I never planned on quitting or cutting down but i cut down to half a pack a day, give or take. My thoughts are, If you genuinely want to quit and cant take the burden of smoking, ecigs are the way to go. don't let those disposable ecigs bring you down. the pen sized ones are just magical, and when you're ready you can lower the nicotine concentrate of your solution. Slowly but surely i see myself becoming disgusted with cigarettes. it's a beautiful thing, and its worth a try.

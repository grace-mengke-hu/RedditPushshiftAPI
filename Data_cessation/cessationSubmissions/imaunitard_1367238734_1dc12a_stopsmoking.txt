I've made it 48 hours.

I quit Saturday morning cold turkey.  I've been a pack a day + smoker for the past 5 years.  The cravings haven't been too bad, yet.  Worst was this morning before work.  But so far so good.  I feel like if I can make it a full week I'm golden.

I'm starting a diet/exercise program today as well.

I've been depressed and feeling like crap because of a lot of things outside of my control in my life.  So I'm focusing on the things I can control...smoking and diet/exercise.  Maybe that will help me feel better about the other things.

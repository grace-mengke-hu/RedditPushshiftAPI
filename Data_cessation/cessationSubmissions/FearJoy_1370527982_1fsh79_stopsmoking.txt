Actually Useful Tools for Giving Up the Lung Darts Cold Turkey

I'm looking to permanently stop smoking, as are the rest of you. I have tried and failed many times. I am 24, have been smoking for 5 years, and smoke on average 14 cigs/day. I usually smoke more on the weekends and less during the weekdays. The longest I went without a smoke was ~3 months before a sudden death of a close family member made me relapse. That relapse has lasted three years and needs to be put down. 

I am looking for tools that actually help make the quitting process easier. I like that read over the benefits of quitting smoking (at http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/guide-to-quitting-smoking-benefits) whenever I have an urge. It reminds me of why I am doing it and puts the small moment of discomfort as ease because of the larger benefits to be reaped. I have also downloaded "My Quit Buddy" on the app store. It makes it easier to keep track of how long I have gone without a cancer stick and offers a few others things like: money saved, motivational facts, etc.

So what do you ladies and gents use that has worked?

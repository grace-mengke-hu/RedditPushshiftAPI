No more cravings, was it this easy for the rest of you?

I stopped smoking exactly 18 days ago and I don't even have any cravings anymore. Was it that easy for all of you, or do the cravings get stronger as time goes on? If it really was THAT easy I'm pleasantly surprised and glad I quit. I mean from time to time if I see someone smoking I get some major cravings, but nothing really that severe.

Ways to quit other than cold turkey?

Hey everyone, first time posting here, and well ever on reddit. I've been smoking for almost 2 years, before that I'd smoke occasionally on a night out. I've been smoking around 4 cigs a day, a little more when I'm on finals. I tried to quit cold turkey last summer and was smoke free for about 2\-3 months but relapsed once uni started. I'd like to know if anyone here has done it a different way, how long they stayed smoke free and well the overall experience.

Withdrawal and healing

Remember patience and time! The withdrawal is the worst of it and it gets easier. After that is some patience as the body heals and we rewire our brains from the addiction. I am having a little bit of a more uncomfortable day today, but it's not terrible. They are much better and easier all the time. And each time we resist an urge or thought about smoking successfully we rework our brains. 
I like this site and little article today! So many great resources and research out there.

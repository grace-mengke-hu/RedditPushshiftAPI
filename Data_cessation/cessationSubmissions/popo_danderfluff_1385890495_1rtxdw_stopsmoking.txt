Problem with clothes stinking of smoke

Croatian here, excuse my awkward wording, please.

I have no problems, at 79 days smoke free consider myself a non-smoker, but, I have a question, and I figured some of you guys managed to solve or bypass this particular problem - in my country almost every bar, club, or local "watering hole" has allowed smoking inside of the object. The smoke does bother me somewhat, when I'm out, but hey, I manage, but the problem is the stench of the clothes (and the hair, but nothing that a shower can't fix). 

How do you get around that? I can wash my shirts and jeans and whatnot all the time, but the bigger problem are coats and jackets and stuff. 

Has anyone any solutions?

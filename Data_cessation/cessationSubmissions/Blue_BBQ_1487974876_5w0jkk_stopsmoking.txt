Non smoking toddler

I decided to quit smoking a few days ago and I worked my best not to smoke. I am only 20 and I have been smoking for a 5 years now. I know that's so bad, but I was under influence of older guys since I was in elementary school. Anyway, few months ago I realized that my heart rate at one point was at 170 bpm and I was unable to breathe. Since then I wanted to stop smoking but couldn't make it. Now, my health got even worse and lately the heart rate is going up and it's occurring even a few times a day. Now that I haven't smoked for a few days I got a little bit better and I would like to keep it this way. So, what do you recommend for a 20yo to do to keep myself of from smoking? I know it's for my own good, but my subconcious thoughts are going wild.

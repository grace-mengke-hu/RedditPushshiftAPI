My one weird craving...

Cigarettes smell gross to me now, and I know they would also taste gross. I never think to myself that I should go buy a pack, or ask to bum one. There’s nothing I really miss about smoking when I think about it (apart from that self destructive sense of control, being able to ignore what’s good for me because fuck everything). 

But when I see a single, unsmoked, pristine cigarette on the ground I have to fight myself not to pick it up... then I feel so gross. I live in a big city. No part of the ground is clean enough to *put in your mouth*. 

And honestly, that’s all I need to know about my smoker brain. It’s nasty, and has disgustingly low standards. I don’t want to have disgustingly low standards.

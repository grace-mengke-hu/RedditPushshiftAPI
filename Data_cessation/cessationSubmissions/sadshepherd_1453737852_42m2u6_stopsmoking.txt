Can't drink from the same bottle as my SO any more!

He smokes and it tastes like an ashtray. Not even like smokers breath, but like someone put a cigarette out in there and left it there over night. EW. WHAT IF I DID THAT TO A NON SMOKER IM SO EMBARRASSED. :O

Anyway, feeling very non-smoker-y and smug.

TIP to help quit smoking!

So what’s worked for me to give up smoking (and I’ve done it quite a few times) is to have my last supposed ever cigarette sometime during the day around 6 PM - 7 PM and then resist all cravings till I hit the bed. This helps because my cravings are strongest in the morning and my will the least resolved that time too so mentally if I quit from the previous evening I feel mentally like I’ve already crossed the hurdle and it’s so much easier to continue the next morning. This is obviously for those who smoke till going to bed thinking they won’t smoke from tomorrow. But then morning comes and it’s so much of a battle all over again.

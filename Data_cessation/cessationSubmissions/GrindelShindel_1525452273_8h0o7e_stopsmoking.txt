1 year quit - my experience

Since may 1st i am 1 year quit.

The first month was by far the hardest.
It gradually got better, still had many urges tho until month 9/10.

Since then i didn't have a single urge.
I totally have the power over those cancer sticks.
I can hold a cigarette for a friend, turn it in my hands, watch it burn, smell it, being around alot of smokers, having conversations with random people in university, going out and being drunk, **without even thinking about taking a single puff** . It's like i've been thrown back before the time i used to smoke, where cigarettes were kinda mysterious for me and i didn't get why people even smoke.

Smoking doesn't make sense to me anymore, even tho i can remember myself needing to somke a pack a day and it felt like i kinda absolutely had to.

To all of you who are struggling staying quit for only a few days or even hours.
I was at your point to. I tried to quit for **so** many times that i stopped counting. Around 50 times i guess.
I tried to quit for a year. Unsuccesful.

Don't tell yourself that you can't. 
I thought i was doomed to be a smoker my whole life.
I thought smoking was the depressing necessity of myself.

But know i fully realized that i am not a smoker.
I just had to prove it.

You don't need people to encourage you. 
It all lies within yourself.

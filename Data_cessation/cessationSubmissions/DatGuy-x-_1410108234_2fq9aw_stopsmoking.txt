the one week mark!....oooooo circle with a 1

so I hit the one week mark as my badge says.

Last night I tested myself well, was up at a friends place and 2 of them were smokers. I hung out with them all night outside and not once did I get the urge to take one of their smokes. It was an excellent feeling.

Each day it gets easier and easier.

My one real psychological trigger I am working on is video games. I play a lot of Counter Strike and at the end of every match when the scoreboard comes up, my brain screams, "GO SMOKE REAL QUICK THEN GET BACK". At first this one killed me and I didn't play the game for a few days. But now Im coping well.

cant believe its been a week

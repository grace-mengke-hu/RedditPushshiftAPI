How do I not feel fat?

Hello! i'm one week in to my quit and like most quitters I have started eating more. I've changed what's in the kitchen so when I snack (a lot) it is at least healthy things. But I just feel heavier and when I try on my clothes I feel like i've gained weight.

How did you guys over come this? I go to the gym when I can and I go hiking on the weekends. Any advice would be great! Thanks!

Edit: looks like my badge from my last attempt of quitting is still up... ignore that.

Forfeits to help quit smoking

Okay, so me and my mates have all come to the conclusion were all going to try and quit. For some extra motivation we are thinking of doing either a small forfeit for smoking a cigarette, or a bigger one for buying a pack. Sort of try and turn it into a competition, as we are all competitive lads. Ideas so far include taking a slit in an eyebrow for smoking a cigarette, to running the block in underwear for buying a pack. Does anyone have any suggestions?

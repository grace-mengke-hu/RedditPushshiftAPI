51 Hours in, I Could Say I Had a Pretty Awful Day

I had smoked for about a half year. 

On February 4th, at 1:00 PM, I smoked my last cigarette and threw away an almost full pack of American Sprits. My Cold Turkey had begun. 

On the day 1, which was the next day, I didn't feel anything particularly uncomfortable or painful, nor was there any cough. So I was happy and thought this would be a breeze and I thought it was maybe because I hadn't smoked for too long. So I packed a bowl on my bong that night. Yeah, I know... I really shouldn't have done that. Such stupidity. 

I got up this morning feeling shitty and angry for no reason. I was mad that my room was at 70F. I was mad that today was Thursday, and it felt as if I was about to throw up. It felt like my throat was constantly trying to close up and whenever I swallowed, it didn't go down the pipes entirely. The spit would just get stuck in the middle of my throat, just about where larynx is, and it persistently made me feel nauseated. 

There was a discernible aching in my lungs so I had to hold my chest for the most part of the day. After I ate lunch, I went straight to the bathroom to throw up. 

Besides having smoked for a little bit, should I be worried about my health? My circumstances really don't allow me to visit a hospital and get a check up before March. 

What I am really worried about is this nausea. This is like nothing I have ever felt before. Lung pain was more like an itch than an ache.

Or maybe the crabs I ate last night were bad. I'm not entirely sure if this was the cause, but I ate some leftover this morning and nausea started around then. I have never been food-poisoned so I have nothing to compare this to. 

Perhaps taking too many cough drops contributed to this, as well. 

As far as craving goes, there is none to very little. It's more of the knowledge that a cigarette will make all these better. It's not like, 'oh I don't know why, but I must smoke a cigarette right fucking now'

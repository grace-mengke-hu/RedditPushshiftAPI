I need your help!

I want to confess, tell something that happened to me today and know what you think.
I started to study 2 years ago and I fell in love with a girl who studies with me, I started to talk to her and every day I liked it more. over time she was choosing other guys to have a relationship and I was always there on friendzone, obviously I did not like that and I ended up breaking up with her (all this happened in 6 months) for the next 18 months she insistently wanted to keep me close to her, but she was always with someone else, I got more and more angry I fought with her and we stayed for 1 year without wanting to look at each other.
I told her that I did not want her friendship because she did not like me, and that if she spoke to me again, I would understand that she liked it. A month ago she talked to me again, asked her to help me to quit smoking (changing habits, having someone during difficult times) and she accepted, said that I would not be alone. We went out and spent a day together, when it was time to say goodbye, she gave me the initiative to kiss me, but how she dated, I thought wrong and I did not kiss her. The next day I asked if she still wanted to help me and she said she did not know, she spent a week (completed the week today) I asked for an answer and I received a no ... After all, I really want to stop smoking and so I came for Reddit, but I have a gigantic fear of feeling bad about this story and having relapses, I feel rejected, I feel terrible for trying so hard and she chooses someone else. What should I do? Should I keep talking to her? Should I ignore? What can I do to overcome this situation that makes me so confused and makes me fall headfirst into this damn addiction?

Two nights, two nightmares

It’s day 4 since I quit, that’s 3 nights and in two of them i had nightmare that I caved in, i smoked. I felt yuck about doing it even in my dreams, was cursing myself for doing it. I am very strong headed this time. I am not having any cravings at all, but wondering if the nightmares still happen to ex smokers? And how long does it take to not get them so frequently? Please share your experiences if any!

About me: 8 a day smoker for 13 years. Quit for 2 years and 8 a day for 2 years. I don’t remember getting nightmares the last time I quit for 2 years :(

Thanks

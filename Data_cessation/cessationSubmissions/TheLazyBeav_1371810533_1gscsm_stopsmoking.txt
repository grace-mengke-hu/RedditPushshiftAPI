10 days in. 2nd weeks been harder than the 1st.

I'm way crankier this week than I was the 1st. I'm almost in tears constantly and have not been sleeping very well. I don't want to smoke at all, but I am about ready to kick myself for being such a whiny bitch. I want to be nice, but it's pretty uncontrollable feelings I'm having. I'm trying to just make it through and trying to be as positive as possible, but I'm still having crazy, irritable outbursts. Oh well. I keep telling myself, "if I make it through this then I never have to go through this again so long as I never pick up another cigarette."

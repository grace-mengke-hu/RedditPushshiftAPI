One Month!

Its been a whole month since i have quit. Theres been some ups and downs, but WOO I feel i amazing! Cravings are a fraction of what they used to be, in terms of frequency and severity. Finally got a hold of and tamed the beast of addiction! I hope everyone here is as successful! Keep on not smoking!!

Slowly quitting

I'm looking for some advice on how most of you guys quit, I've decided in the past week to quit smoking.

I started smoking heavily at about 17, I'm currently 24 and was smoking anywhere from half to a full pack of Marlboro Red 100s a day and I am sick of it.

I work in sales so I can't imagine going cold turkey without losing my shit on a client and getting fired.

So far I'm down to 3 smokes a day and it has been managable so far and I'm planning on going to one per day then just being done completely but my question is how do you guys deal with the anger? 

Anytime I have a bad sales call my go to was running outside to have a smoke and calm down so now I need something to help me control my anger once I decide to be 100% done. 

I'm not interested in any nicotine substitutes I'm just going to be done completely in the next week or so.
If anyone has good tips on dealing with high stress and staying calm I'd love to hear it!

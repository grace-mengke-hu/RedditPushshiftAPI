stopping now

earlier i found myself saying «youknow, you really need to WANT to quit to stop smoking» to my smoking friend. while smoking.
then we complained about smoking, about going out to do it in the cold and how much money it takes up.
i smoked an entire pack today. on my way back home to the train i just thought, no. i cant afford it and i dont feel good from it. and thought about how many negative thoughts i have about cigarettes.

now i wrote a list of cons and pros of quitting. the pros are many, but the cons.. shocked me. its just semi permanent things

its just not worth it. it will be rough after smoking more and more over 2 years. but i honestly lose all my spare money on this. theres too many cons. i need to find another reward to keep me going from day to day.

wish me luck.

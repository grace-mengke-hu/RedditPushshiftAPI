2 cigarettes left in the pack

Hi ive been smoking for 13 years  tryed to kick the habit twice first time it lasted almost 3 months, the second time 33 days, i really  want to quit smoking for good so im looking for any tips/advices from someone who did it, the 2 times i went back to smoke were when i was hanging out with friends on weekend drinking some beers, i feel that drinking and smoking combination its hard to resist i wish i had more self control on that aspect =/ in your opinion if the urges comes what should i do ? most of my friends smoke and drink which is kinda of a problem.. dont know how to deal with this, i dont lack motivation but self control is a issue, im thinking about transitioning from smoking to vaping for awhile is it a good idea or should i just quit coldturkey ?

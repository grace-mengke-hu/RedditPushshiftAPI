Quit smoking for 2 years....then relapsed

So I've quit smoking for 2 years and for some stupid reason I decided to have just one cigarette for old times sake with a friend and relapsed.... That was a year ago, now I'm smoking about 20-30 cigarettes a day. Any tips on how I can quit again? It seems harder this time around, I've only managed about 8 hours without smoking and lost my mind.

Update: For those who took the time to give me advice and commented on this post. I decided to quit cold turkey shortly after writing this post and currently I've been smoke free for 9 days.

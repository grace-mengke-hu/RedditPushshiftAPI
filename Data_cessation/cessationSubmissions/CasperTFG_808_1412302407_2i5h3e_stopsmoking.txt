Need to motivate myself to Quit

So... I need to stop smoking, I want to stop smoking but I don't feel motivated to stop. How can I get myself into the right mindset to quit.

I should also add that I am also an alcoholic, October 28th is my 1 year sober birthday and I was told by many don't try quitting smoking until you are a year sober (too much at once). So with my 1 year coming up I want to start getting ready to quit smoking.

What can I do to get myself into the right mindset.

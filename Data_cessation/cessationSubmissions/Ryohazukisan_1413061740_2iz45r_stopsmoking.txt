I fear smoking again. The thought of not being able to wake up, jog, take deep breaths, save money, smell good, work out, etc, has me so scared.

Life without smoking is sooo much better. It can be hard if I think about it, but Alan Carr's book made the difference. 

I don't have anything profound to say, smoking truly is a dumb habit. And will rob you of your confidence. 

Good luck y'all, and ask me anything.

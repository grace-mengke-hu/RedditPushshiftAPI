Had my last cigarette this morning.

I've tried to quit a lot of times but I really want to this time.

I always get to the point where I feel like I'll die without a smoke and then cave and go buy a packet.

 I had my last cigarette on the way to work this morning. I also had a patch on, but it hasn't been helping at all, and I figure I'll have to stop using those too. I have no money for cigarettes either so it's pretty much not an option at all. Currently have a headache and toothpick in my mouth, feel a headache coming on. Wish me luck!

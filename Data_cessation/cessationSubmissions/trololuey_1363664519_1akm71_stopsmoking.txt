One year

It's been an entire year without a cigarette. It's hard to believe that this is the longest I've gone without a smoke since sometime in the mid '90s. Many thanks for all the support found here. I wish I had some tip or trick to offer, but I don't. Just keep reminding yourself that you're a non-smoker now. When those cravings hit, or you wake up from that smoking dream dying for a cigarette, just know that that's the addiction fucking with you, and that's why you needed to quit in the first place. You can do it.

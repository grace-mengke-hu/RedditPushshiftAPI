First time in the 18 years I've been smoking... I made it 24 hours.

I've tried everything to quit.  EVERYTHING.  And even though I've spent the last year trying to smoke as consciously as possible, it wasn't until this weekend the logic really started to stick.

This is so hard.  But I hit that 24 hour goal. Even though I've smoked since, I really think I can hit 25 hours next.  Then 26... then 27....

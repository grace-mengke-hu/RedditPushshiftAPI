Stupid Smoking

I twice have quit my one-two cig-a-day habit for two plus months and then went and bought a pack. Got a pack a week ago went through 18 just broke up the last 2 now upset I did that because I want to have a few beers this weekend (it's been awhile) and wanted to compliment them with a last cig. Stupid smoking.

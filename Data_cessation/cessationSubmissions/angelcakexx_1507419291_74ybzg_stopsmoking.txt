Starting the journey

I've been smoking on/off since i was 18, I'm 22 now. I also had other addictions, but I've been sober for 2 1/2 years....except for cigarettes. I've quit for long periods of time, but i always end up back at it... I have tried several times over the past couple months, but it never sticks. I always finish a pack and declare it as my last pack, but end up failing miserably. So, at the recommendation of becomeanex, I'm going to take some time to identify triggers and work on separating smoking from them. October 16th is my quit date. 


Has anyone else tried this method? Any advice? Triggers you've identified, and ways to deal with them?

Also, I always end up spending ridiculous amounts of money when i quit smoking(no idea why), I'd like to avoid that this time around lol.

I threw it off the balcony

I have been smoke free for about 3 months now, last night i had a really difficult emotional night my mom came over to talk and after a while my mom asks to move outside for a cigarette for herself. I grabbed one and told her it’s been three months, i just want one. 

I lit the thing took two puffs and it felt so good like so good it scared me. A fleeting thought right after my first puff was “damn i need to buy a pack” and then I threw it off the balcony. Two puffs and over, I felt something in me say if i didn’t get rid of it right that moment I would be hooked again. 

Cigarettes are awful, I project all the strength i have unto y’all. Don’t give up.

My cravings are back, in force

I've been fine these past maybe 2 weeks. I'd say as close to 100% as I have been in a long time. Today everything went wrong. Work is dull, car broke down and I just want a smoke. I don't think I've had a craving this bad since I quit and I'm not lying about that. Have any of you guys had this, and what did you do to stop yourself?

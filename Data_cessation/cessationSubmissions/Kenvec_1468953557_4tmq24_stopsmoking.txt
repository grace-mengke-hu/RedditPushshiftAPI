I quit for 3 days, started again and was so disgusted that I have now quit again.

I just wanna get this off my chest quickly but I quit smoking last Friday  (after ~2 years of a pack a day) and felt pretty okay until yesterday. Didn't really get huge cravings mostly cause I kept myself busy.
Even visited a music festival on Saturday and usually I smoke like 2 packs at festivals. Now I felt pretty much okay the entire time.


Yesterday night was the breaking point though because I still had a slight hangover from the festival and because of some bad planning on my part I had to pull an all nighter at my office.


Cravings got really bad, couldn't concentrate on my work and I had a deadline. Bought a pack and honestly I thought the cigarettes where disgusting. They made me feel like my old self again but the taste was awful and I started to realize how I always smelled.


Finished that pack today and swore to quit forever. My driving force being that I have never had a more disgusting pleasure than I did yesterday night.

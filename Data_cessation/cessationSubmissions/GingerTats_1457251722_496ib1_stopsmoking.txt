2 days in. Massive Anxiety

I'm about two days into cold turkey quitting and my anxiety is out of control. I have a condition already and just had an adjustment made to my SSRI. I knew quitting while making a medication change would be rough but smoking started to trigger panic attacks so quitting became necessary. Right now the withdrawals are awful. I go into full blown attacks, and I don't feel like myself. I just feel a bit afraid, but mostly desperate for it to stop. Did anyone else have severe anxiety/physical withdrawals? How did you cope?

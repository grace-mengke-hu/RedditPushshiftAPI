Day 26, never quit quitting!

Hey all, 

Last summer I quit for close to two months, but then started again for about 4 months. I am now happy to say that I have stuck with my new years resolution to live smoke free. Here's what worked: 1. Never giving up. NO matter how many times you try and fail keep on trying! 2. Having a money jar, it's really satisfying seeing all that cash add up and gives you incentive to 
keep up the smoke free life. 3. Smoke free app! It's really great seeing all the health benefits accumulate as you go on. 4. Staying away from hard situations. This was especially tough for me, as a 19 year old I like to socialize and have drinks with friends which would often lead to smoking for me in early days of a quit. I stayed away from situations with alcohol in them for the first month which kind of sucked, but now as it gets easier I can  go on an lead a normal life. 

Hope these tips helped. Good luck new quitters!

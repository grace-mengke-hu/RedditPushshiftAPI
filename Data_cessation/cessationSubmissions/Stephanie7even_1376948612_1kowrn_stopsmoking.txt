Starting my Final Semester and in need of advice.

I started smoking during my sophomore year at school, and while I haven't been smoking even three years yet I've come to depend on it heavily for stress relief when working on intense research/paper projects. 

Having realized, though, that life will always throw stressful curve balls at you I've decided to quit before the end of my final semester at school. I was just wondering if any of you had some minor habits that you have picked up that would be HEALTHY replacements to smoking?

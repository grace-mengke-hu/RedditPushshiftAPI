'Splains to Me Like I'm Five: The Deal with Smoker's Phlegm

I've come across a lot of mention of the "phlegm milestone"(coughing up brown bits, etc.) in people's posts, mostly talking about how it signaled real recovery in their lungs. I was wondering what y'alls personal experiences have been with it, and what the science behind the process is? 

Thanks!

Is smoking really that bad? Is it *necessary* to quit smoking when you enjoy it?

I have been a lurker on this sub for a while. It convinced me to quit. Unlike most people here, I do admit that I smoke a lot less. I have maybe up to 3 cigarettes a day, mostly 1 though.

It's been 11 days since my last cigarette and oh my god. I miss it a lot. I just miss the smoke and being alone outside and just feeling so relaxed.

I'm kind of upset because it's just something I really crave and want. I don't think I am addicted to nicotine or ever was. I just enjoy the act of smoking. I don't like weed though. I just like how cigarettes don't make you go crazy but it's just relaxing and nice.

So my (controversial) question is: is it really necessary to quit? I understand if you're a pack a day smoker and think about cigarettes every second of the day. Not good mentally or physically. But for casual smokers like me, is it okay? It bothers me that there is this whole mentality over how destructive smoking can be and is deemed disgusting by most people in society. What do you do if you honestly just enjoy it and use it to chill and have some alone time? What do you do if you just honestly enjoy the act of smoking instead of it being an addiction or a health related issue?

PA is raising cigarette taxes....again

Another $1.00 a pack starting Aug 01. 
So glad not to be smokin' anymore. It's really never been a better time to quit. If people mobile phone bills went up suddenly by $30-60 a month they be outraged!  But a smoker buying 1-2 packs a day is gonna pay that price hike now.

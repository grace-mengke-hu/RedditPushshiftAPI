Maybe an Improvement...

I had a really great quit period for a few weeks, and it was amazing.  But then I started back with school this fall, taking programming classes.  The balance between work and school and some semblance of a social life immediately weighed down on me... I started smoking again. Hard.  No fuck's given, despite the progress I had previously made.  But now, a few weeks later, I think about (and regret) that wasted gap where I could be in an incredible place, to be proud of myself for all that time that I could have been quit.  I really was So. Damn. Close.  But then stress and relapse nation hit me hard... I gave it a couple weeks to adjust, not judging myself, not being self-critical, but I think it's time for a new re-evaluation.  I'm going again with the patch, to make a god damn effort, to really and genuinely try... I've been drinking tonight, but you know what? I didn't give in to those fucking cigarettes.  I don't need them.  Thinking about it now, I'm finding myself wanting one.  But the only answer to that dirty craving is "No, fucking no!"

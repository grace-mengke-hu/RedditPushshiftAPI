I failed, trying to find the motivation to start again

I quit early december, today would have been my 70th day but alas my cousin came back from 9 months of traveling last week and smoked a few joints with him (which had tobacco in) and since then i have smoked occasionally... and felt the need to smoke again, i just bought a pack of rolling tobacco just in case but i know i will probably have a cigarette when it gets tough

I quit cold turkey, not sure if i have the will power strong enough for that.. who knows, right now im sitting here, craving... feeling an emptyness in my lungs, with an unopened pack of tobacco next to me, lets hope it doesnt get open

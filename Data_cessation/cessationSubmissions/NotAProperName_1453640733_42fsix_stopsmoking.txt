Hooooray !!

One year today, I almost forgot!

After 25+years of smoking (1/2 pack a day), I decided to stop a year ago. Vaped (very low nicotine) for a couple pf months, then stopped altogether.

If I can do it you certainly can. It only gets better with time, although I still have random cravings here and there.

Gonna enjoy my sunday, good luck to all of you!

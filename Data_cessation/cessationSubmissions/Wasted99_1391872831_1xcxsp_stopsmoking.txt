Alan Carr method, but I'm not happy...

Hi, I've quit two times before with Alan Carr's method. But this time I'm don't *feel* convinced. When I was reading the book, I was like, yeah, I know this, yeah I agree.
There was a little victory in my head smoking the last smoke, but still, I feel like I'm following the willpower method. How come the easy mantra isn't programmed in my head like the last times?

Any tips to become more convinced?

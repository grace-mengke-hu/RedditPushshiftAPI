It's time... Now is the time.

Hey reddit, 12 year smoker here... it's time to quit once and for all. I've tried numerous methods, gum, patch, ecigs... but the habit persists. The one thing I haven't tried is using my balls. It's time to man up and quit the right way. 

I checked out the sidebar and will also be checking out /r/leaves to do the same with my pot addiction. Some people would argue that pot is not addictive but that's just bogus, I'm completely dependant on it. 

Anyways, I want to check out a few of these quit smoking apps which tracks your progress and financial savings. I'm a bit picky when it comes to UIs but does anyone have any suggestions? I don't mind paying a few bucks for a quality app so all recommendations welcome. 

Looking forward to becoming a member of the /r/stopsmoking family.

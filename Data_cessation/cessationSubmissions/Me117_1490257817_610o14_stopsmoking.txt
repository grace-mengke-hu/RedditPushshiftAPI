Day 100!!

Day 100 , Thank you All. I would have not been able to get here if it wasn't for you lot. Thank you so much.
To everyone thinking about giving up smoking or struggling to stay clean please understand that not being dependant on something is an exceptional feeling. I no longer have to brave the elements to inhale cancer and that feeling is priceless. So please stay off and stay strong. 
Best.

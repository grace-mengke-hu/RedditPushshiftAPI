2 Months Today!

My badge might disagree, but today marks the two month mark! This is by far the longest I've gone since I started smoking ~3.5 yrs ago. I have to say, I feel better than I have in years, both mentally and physically. My grades are better than they've been in a long time, I've managed to pack on some muscle, and I have so much energy! To all my fellow New Year quitters, congrats on 2 months! To anyone just getting started or thinking about it, what really helped me was chewing gum for oral fixations and exercising. I've been doing Strong Lifts 5x5 and would highly recommend. Here's to not smoking.

Need support to quit smoking.

Welcome everyone, I will keep this brief.

I've smoked on and off, mostly on since I was in about 3rd grade.

I had about 6 months without a cigarette recently but I was using a vape.  Which is in my opinion, the methadone of smoking.

In the past year i have given up the use of pot, booze, PMO, changed my diet, etc.

However, when I gave up the vape smoking cigarettes came back up. 

This morning, I crushed my pack of cigarettes, rendering them unsmokeable.  I also committed to finding a support group, which led me here.

I just need some insight into some things that have worked for others and some support.

I know from the other habits I have given up that support makes as much of a difference as self-honesty.

I can't smoke anymore and want your help. 

Thank you.

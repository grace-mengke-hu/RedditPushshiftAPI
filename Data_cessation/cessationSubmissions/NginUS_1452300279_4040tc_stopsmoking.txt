Want to quit- but apparently not bad enough

I quit a couple times last year, & then I became able to buy cheap(er) cartons from a local indian reservation which doesn't charge the huge taxes like NY state does. I started buying (& going through) 2 cartons at a time. I now smoke a pack & a half a day, just because I have them. I tried Chantix, & it didn't work at all, so I used that as an excuse to just give up on my attempts to stop. Even with their being cheaper, I know I'd be far better off if I were to quit, but I ignore this truth & keep on smoking. I don't know when I'll ever get the motivation to be disciplined enough to try to quit again. I figure if I really want to I'll quit. I quit cold turkey a few years ago, & during that process I learned that my cravings only feel bad to endure for just 20 minutes at a time, so I'd have to tell myself that I only 'think' I want to smoke, because deep down I didn't want to be a smoker anymore. I was very glad after 3 weeks the cravings subsided. So I know what to expect when it comes down to when I'll try to do that again. I think if I can set a goal to do something with the cigarette money that I normally wouldn't be able to do- like a weekend vacation or something, I might be able to focus on that as a motivator for when I'm battling the cravings. I know you gotta want it bad enough for yourself, otherwise the reasons just fall apart as motivators to burn through it. I'm just not there yet.

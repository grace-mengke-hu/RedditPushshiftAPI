Had a tooth pulled... Best way to be forced to quit!

So I have been trying to quit on and off for a while. Problem is I can never make three days. I just cave every time. 

But I had to get a tooth removed on Monday, and am doctor ordered not to smoke for at least a week. I am officially three days in, and feeling really positive.

The thing is I am still in pain, and the cravings are being subdued by the fact that I feel like shit, and I know it will be worse if I smoke. My mouth is raw and swollen and the thought of doing anything to prolong that or make it worse is enough to keep me going. 

Already I can feel the cravings diminishing, and suddenly feel really excited. I had friends come over this evening, and they were all smoking. The thought of making this pain in my mouth worse just destroyed any craving I had.

I hope I can keep it up after the pain goes away, and I really feel I can. Anyway not much else to say, I am just excited is all.

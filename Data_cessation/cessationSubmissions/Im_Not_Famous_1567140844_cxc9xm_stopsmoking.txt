I'm done lurking

So I went to work tonight and realized I only had 6 cigarettes in my pack. I didn't bring any money to work so getting another pack would be a hassle. As I started thinking about the hassle, I came to the realization that I just don't want to do it anymore. Any of it. I don't want to be tied to these things that make my mouth dry, make me constantly have bad breath, that make me breathe heavy all the damn time.

I have two cigarettes left now. I don't know if I'll smoke them or not. I got an app that I found recommended on here and set my official quit time for 11pm (it's 9:50 now). I remembered that I had started Allen Carr's book (audiobook version) so I started listening to that again too. Got about 4 hours left on that.

I haven't tried to quit in probably 10 years or more. I had myself convinced that I liked it but â€¦ I don't.

Anyway, I hope to be able to support you all and one day post some updates out of celebration. Good luck to you all. Thanks for sharing your challenges and successes. It helps those of us just starting out.

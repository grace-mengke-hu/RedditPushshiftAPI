Gracing us with an update on how far you've made it? Please tell us how you feel!

For me one of the biggest motivators; especially during the hardest first couple days was all these stories of 'finally feeling calm' or 'being able to breathe', etc etc etc.

I highly encourage everyone to not just tell us how proud of yourself you are (don't leave that part out) but tell us what is going on for you physiologically and psychologically.  Some people are motivated by finally not stinking; but I think most are motivated to quit because they feel like shit from it; and, it doesn't really take that long until you start to feel better, but the more data points for a recent quitter the better.

I always want to read about how good people feel; I would love if it became standard for people to tell how they feel; whether it's like shit on day 2 (people rarely leave this out ;-)) or how shockingly amazing you feel on day 7.

Several Health-Issues since I quit

Hi there, 

Since I quit smoking I am suffering from Seborrheic Dermatitis, Extreme Dry Eyes and Canker Sores.

My doctor didn't believe me when I told him that these issues only started up when I quit. Thus I am looking for information from others who have quit smoking too. 

On the bright side, my lungvolume is at solid 80% for 2 years now, which is great.

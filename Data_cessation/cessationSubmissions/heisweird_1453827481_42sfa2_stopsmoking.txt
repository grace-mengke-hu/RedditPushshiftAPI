Dear Reddit. I fucked up.

I'm on my 37th day. But a week ago, on my 30th day I smoked a cigarette. I was in a horrible position both physically and psychologically and someone offered me a cigarette. I don't know why I said yes. I took one from him and I smoked. I regretted my decision as soon as I finished it. Anyways I don't wanna reset my badge but at the same time I feel like 37 days is a lie. :/

31 days and 2nd guessing

I decided to quit 31 days ago. I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years and I just woke up one day and decided to go Cold Turkey with the help from http://whyquit.com/. So the First few weeks were not so bad, I even made it through a party with a lot of beer drinking. But the last week has been really tough I'm thinking of smoking all day it feels like. I have been eyeballing the gas station down the street from the house on my way home from work every night. I have this crave deep in the pit of my stomach I figured this would start fading by now. I have been thinking of all the good times I had with my smokes. I feel like I can't complete anything without smoking and this part of who I am is now missing.

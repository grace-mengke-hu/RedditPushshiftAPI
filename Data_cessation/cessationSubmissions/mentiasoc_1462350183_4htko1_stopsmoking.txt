Mindfulness & science-based approach. Who wants a new attempt?

Hi all,
Great to read these topics and I wish you all strength! :)

We, Lifeboat, are working on the most extensive app-program - with a 45-days program to quit smoking. From preparation to quitting and maintaining.

As of right now - we are looking for people who want to take a fresh approach and attempt to quit smoking. You'll be joining our testgroup and we will sharpen the program based on your feedback - and of course we will help you quit.

You can find some more info here: http://www.lifeboat.io
To join us directly, leave your details here: http://www.lifeboat.io/test/

We will be sharing the results and updates to the approach regularly so other reddit users can follow, and join when they feel confident enough to do an attempt.

Thanks guys.

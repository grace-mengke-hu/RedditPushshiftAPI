I need your help! What to do in your spare time?

Passed my way thru day 5 after reading the book. Minimal cravings. I feel so damn good every morning I wake up. Biggest issue is.... it’s now the weekend. What do I do? I’d usually go thru a pack or two Friday night, Saturday, Sunday. Now I have no breaks. What do all of my hero non smokers do with such free time?!?

39 days smoke free...However...

So I decided to go cold turkey on the 1st of January. I used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day for 9 years and vaped for the last 6 months of last year (with nicotine inside it). Monday-Sunday I am surrounded by smoke. My friends smoke cigarettes and my colleagues smoke the vape/cigarettes.

I have managed to stay clean from cigarettes and the vape for 39 days. I have also gone out drinking with my friends and haven't touched a single cigarette. 

Yesterday and today I had a few hits from my mates vape, just for old time sake. I don't feel guilt (as its much cleaner than having a cig) but I do feel the pull towards the vape coming in again.

I don't want to go back onto the vape. I'm going to continue with the discipline that I've had and not fall into the trap.

Thanks for listening everyone. I know this isn't really a question.

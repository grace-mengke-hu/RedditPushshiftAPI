336 hours down, a lifetime to go.

Exactly 2weeks smoke free. After the first week it got easier. Went to a friend's house, in a smokey garage with 5 chain smokers. I was happy not to smoke after 18 years. The little monster was crying and begging, but I got this. I told myself "not today. I'm not failing today."  
my mom smoked for 40+ years. Ever since I can remember her new year's resolution was to quit. She quit 3 years ago with chantix. She told me that week three was always then she failed. Why is week three the hardest? My third week starts now, and I'm not going to fail this week. I got this. I'm an ex smoker, I'm a  nonsmoker.

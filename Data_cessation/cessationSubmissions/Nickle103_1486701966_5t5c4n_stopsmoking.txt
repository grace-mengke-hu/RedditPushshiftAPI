Ugh! What have I done!

I have been 60 days smoke free....last week I finished the patch and 3 days after my desire to smoke was so strong I gave in. Also had some added stress and didn't handle it well. I've been smoking again for 4 days and I'm so worried that I can't get control of it again. I have tried quitting several times in the past but it never sticks. This time felt different until it suddenly wasn't ðŸ˜¢. Just looking for some support to help get my mind back to being a non-smoker again.

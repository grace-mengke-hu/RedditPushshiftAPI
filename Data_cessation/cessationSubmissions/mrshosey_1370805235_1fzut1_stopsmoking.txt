I accidently quit smoking 4 weeks ago because I'm lazy

I was hanging out on the couch and smoked my last cigarette without relizing it. My pack was empty after that last smoke. I went to grab another one, forgetting my pack was empty. I opened the pack, saw that it was empty, and looked over at the book shelf where I kept the rest of my cigarettes. It was MAYBE 4 feet away. And I just sort of looked at the shelf, looked at my empty pack and went, "Meh I'll quit,". Seriously that was it. Now, don't get me wrong, I have cravings really bad. It has in no way been easy. I just always think the story is hilarious and a testament to lazy people

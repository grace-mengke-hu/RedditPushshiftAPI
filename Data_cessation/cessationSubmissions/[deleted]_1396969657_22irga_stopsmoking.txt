Why do I smoke?

Yesterday I had clocked 36 hours without nicotine, but three at night I drowe 45 minutes to the closest night open gas station to get another pack. I smoked 7 on the way back. And it was sooo fucking good.

How do I NOT drive for miles to get another pack the next time? I am currently empty.

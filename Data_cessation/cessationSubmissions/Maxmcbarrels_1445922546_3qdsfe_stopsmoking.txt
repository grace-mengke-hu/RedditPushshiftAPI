DAY #1

So I took advice I found here, I had a long talk with my SO whom is a heavy smoker. 
4 Rules I set. 

1). No smoking in the house
2). No smoking in my car 
3). Do not ask me to buy cigs
4). No smoking after we eat...
(bc I am always with her and I don't want to wait while she smokes before we leave)

So today is my day...DAY NUMBER 1 
I'm excited about not smelling like ass and having a clean Fresh smelling house and car. 
I smoked my last cigarette this morning after breakfast and that finish the pack so that's it for me. 
I hope my SO follows suit bc smoking is so disgusting.  

So to all you OPs out there who gave me just the slightest nudge to quit, I say thank you. 

I'll update my progress every week for a month or two and gradually progress to zero updates and just some kind words of encouragement for others.

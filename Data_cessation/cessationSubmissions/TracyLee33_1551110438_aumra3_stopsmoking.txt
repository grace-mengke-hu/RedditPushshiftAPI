Trying yet again

I had my last ciggie on Friday 22nd Feb for another go at giving up. In the past I have given up many times. 5 years,  2 years,  18 months,  8 months, 4 years and most recently 4 months.  As soon as soon as I get stressed out the first thing I do is go buy a packet of cigs. I'm doing this cold turkey with no nicotine supplements.  Can anyone advise me what the best thing to do when the craving get so bad please. Thanks ðŸ™‚

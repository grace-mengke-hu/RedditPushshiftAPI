[Advice] Where can I get free or cheap smoking cessation medications?

I live in Teneessee and there is not much support for quitting smoking here. I tried Chantix once before but the side effects were crazy and I cannot afford it anymore with my company's current insurance (300.00 a box). Does anyone know of a way to get any free or very cheap smoking cessation medications in Tennessee or by mail?

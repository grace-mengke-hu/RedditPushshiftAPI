Hey, it's me again!

3/4 of the way through day one, on the 4mg lozenges.  Just saying 'Hi!,' no long bitchy post for now.  Well, maybe a little.  I'm still going to get my 1 day badge from r/stopdrinking, but I'm committed to a pizza'n'beer get-together with the bro tomorrow.  After that.  But I'm not smoking!  I'm doing ok on the r/stopgaming front as well.  Too much?  If I took all the issues I had one at a time, I'll be dead before I'm clear of all the addictions biting my ass.  See you tomorrow!

I slipped..

So me and my fianc√© both quit, but she's all over the shop. Avoiding me, sleeping on the couch so "she doesn't yell or scream at me". I'm sitting in our bedroom, anxiety cranked up-to 11 - and I just went outside and rolled a cigarette and had it.

I feel like crap for doing it, but all day I've been trying not to think about them, everything was going well until the anxiety got too much. Yeah, I know cigarettes don't fix anxiety as now I feel worse than I already do. Relapse is a bitch, but it happens to the best of us. Going to reset my badge and start over. I will be strong. I can do this.

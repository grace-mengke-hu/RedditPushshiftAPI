My fight against nicotine

Two days ago I decided to give quitting a go. 

I have been on a course before and relapsed after 2 months. I was doing ok for two days. I thought about smoking every minute of the day and beat the thoughts. 

The one thing that killed me was the boredom. I dont know what it is but I was bored out of my mind. At work, home and anywhere I was I was just plain bored. Normal things that kept me occupied was not interesting to me anymore until I finally gave in a bought a box and had a cigarette. 

I do feel somewhat like a failure but it was driving me nuts. 

Does anyone have any advice on the boredom aspect?

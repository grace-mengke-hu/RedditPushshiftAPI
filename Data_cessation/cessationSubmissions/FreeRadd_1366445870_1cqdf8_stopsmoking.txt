I have cigarettes left in my pack but I'm stopping right now.

Hello, I'm 44 years old and have been smoking for 26 years. I'm a singer/songwriter/guitar player in my band and my voice is turning to shit. Today is the day I take over my addiction and regain my voice. I would love for you to keep tabs on me to help me along further motivate me. I've never tried to stop so I have no idea what I'm about to go through but I must do this!

Thank You For Any and All Help

- Day One: So far so good. I'm having mad cravings but I can fight them off.

We have been auditioning drummers for the past two weeks. Today was the last one before callbacks. I can and will do this. My bands name is Vawter, thanks for asking \m/

It's all in my head. I'll just keep fighting off these cravings and I will win!
Thanks for all the kind words and support.

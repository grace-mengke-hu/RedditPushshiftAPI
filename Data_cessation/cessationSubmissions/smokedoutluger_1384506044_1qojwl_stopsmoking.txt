Quitting as of tonight

Hi r/stopsmoking

Long time lurker, first time yada yadaâ€¦

After 8 years of this horrible disgusting habit I finally decided tonight enough was enough, I have had it with cigarettes and nicotine. I went clean for 3 days this week on account of being broke. I came into some money today and first thing I do is buy a pack. As soon as I got back into my car I sparked one up, but something was different this time. I didn't get the fulfillment I usually have from it. So I've continued with the day smoking as usual until I got back home tonight. I had one left. Said to myself "I'll save it for the morning." Locked the car and started to walk away. Took two steps and said NO! I'm over this, I made it three days why can't I keep going. So I went back to the car, grabbed the pack and broke the last one into pieces and threw it and the pack away. No more I say. I have reset my quit smoking app and plan to stick with it this time. You guys here at r/stopsmoking are awesome. It's going to be an uphill battle but I can count on you and my friends for support.

After this posting I will quit. Please wish me luck/stamina/whatever

Hi Community,

after I write this I will smoke my last cigarette. I am 39F and I smoked since I was 14. It didn´t help growing up in a smokers household, everyone except my dad smokes but at least nowadays we all go outside but still. I also drink too much so this combination is not the healthiest to say the least.

I quit smoking last year for 3 months but I had a hard relapse. I found out it was because I stopped for the wrong reasons. I stopped for a guy I fell for (nonsmoker, didn´t know I did it for him) and when he kind of rejected me I was back on. Now I have my mind set to stop for me and my health so I am positive it could be a different approach.

I will read Allen Carrs chapter "The last cigarette" after this here and reset my Smoke Free App. And I truely hope this will be the last cigarette I smoke.

I read a lot of stories on this sub and I find it very nice and helpful so I am hoping we can go through all of this together, similar to /r/stopdrinking I have also signed up to today. I just want to improve my life and health and I find these kind of communities very helpful and endearing.

Tomorrow I have planned to wash all my coats which I had on in smoking bars etc (I live in Europe) and later I will take my smoking assecories (ashtray, lighters) to the trash already. So I am pretty excited to finally dump it. I just hope it sticks. I have a business trip coming up next week, unfortunately to France where a) I don´t like it but worse b) everybody from the French team smokes so it is a big thing. I think if I can make it there I can make it anywhere... So please wish me luck. I helps though that the guy I quit smoking for last year is also here so it´s a nice counterbalance...

Thanks for reading. Hang in there!

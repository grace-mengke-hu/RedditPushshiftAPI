Quit recently, anyone else cough up specks of black/brown tar like substance following quitting?

I have quit before on several occasions, each of which lasted anywhere from a few days to several months. I used to smoke heavily but since the last time I quit which was for several months, I have only been a "social smoker." This time I would like to quit for good. In the mornings generally in the shower if I take a deep breath and try to cough out any sputum it generally comes out clear but with specks of black stuff. This also happens after I go running and has been a consistent occurrence each time I have quit. I was wondering, does this happen to other people as well and how long does it last? When I quit for the longest period which was about 6 months it lasted for probably a couple weeks. Other sources on the internet claim that this behavior is my body cleansing itself of toxins but I wanted to post here to find out other's experiences first hand.

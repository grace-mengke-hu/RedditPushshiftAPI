Day 14 of not smoking - issues with the patch

I'm on Day 14 of not smoking by using the patch. I wasn't a heavy smoker, but I did have an intensely strong addiction for many reasons. The patch is working for the cravings (after many attempts) but I have questions. I don't feel well at all, I constantly feel like I'm getting sick and have a weird taste in my mouth and feeling in my chest. 

The patch has 14mg of nicotine. I usually smoked 6-8 cigarettes a day, at about 1mg of nicotine each. So with the higher nicotine intake, am I making my body MORE dependent on nicotine?? 
Am I feeling like shit because I'm taking in more nicotine? Or is that normal and it will pass?

Is it ok to smoke shisha/cannabis?

I quit for 10 days now and even though I still get the occasional cravings I was wondering if I could do some other stuff with friends sometimes. I smoke shisha with some friends sometimes because it's fun. Would it also be okay to smoke weed, not on a daily base, without tobacco?


Thanks in advance

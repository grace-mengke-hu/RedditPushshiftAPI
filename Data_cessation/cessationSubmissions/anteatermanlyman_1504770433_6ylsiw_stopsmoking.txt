:-) 3 months handicapped

Hello, I don't normally log in to reddit very often because I post too much lol. But, I am about 5 or 6 days past 3 months of being off cigarettes and onto lozenges. I actually posted a week or two ago about how I found a liking with twisty puzzles, but I did not mention that I was close to 3 months. I'm proud of myself even though I'm using the lozenges. I know it's not a huge achievement because I've done this with e-cigarettes before, I fell into smoking again pretty heavily. I'm trying to quit, I'm just not there yet. And like I said in my post last time, my boyfriend is completely quit for 3 months:-).

If anyone wants to know how my boyfriend quit or three months, he just cut down overtime. But he was never a heavy smoker according to him, though he had smoked for like 20 or 30 years. I honestly don't believe him lol but yeah, he went from about five cigarettes when we met to 3 then two everyday then one every three or four days, to none. But I wouldn't recommend this strategy because it takes a long time and if you're a heavy smoker it's not worth waiting that long. I'm not aware of any smokers that have done that.

Edit. I think I'm going to leave my lozenges at home today as well. This subreddit always inspires me to keep trying :-)

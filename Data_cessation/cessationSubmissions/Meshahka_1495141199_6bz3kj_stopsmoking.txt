Tobacco substitutes

Hi I recently quit smoking, i no longer get urges for nicotine however I often miss the physical feeling of smoking something. 
Maybe not the right place to ask but does anyone know of any good tobacco substitutes that do not taste awful or contain harmful chemicals? I know that many coffee shops in Amsterdam have them available but are they at all pleasant when smoked on their own as a roll-up?

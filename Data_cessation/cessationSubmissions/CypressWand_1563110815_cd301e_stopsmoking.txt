Trying to quit smoking when your SO doesn't want to quit

I've been trying to quit for some time now. The longest I've gone without is about half a year, but I bounced back after drinking a beer on a terrace on a hot summer day.  
I really want to quit. It's too expensive, I barely have any energy left, and I can hardly taste food (and I really, really love food), but the major problem that I keep bumping into is that my boyfriend doesn't want to quit himself. We live together, and the fact that he keeps smoking right next to me just makes it too damn hard not to light one up.  


Does anyone else have to deal with the issue of living with people that are also smoking while you're trying to quit? How did you handle the situation?

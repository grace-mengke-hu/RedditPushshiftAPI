Quitting in Colombia

I'm a gringo living down in Bogota where the smoking culture is alive and well. Seriously, you can't walk a block without running into someone puffing away and sipping tinto. The big problem here is that you don't ever need to buy a pack since you can buy individual cigs anywhere at anytime. 

I'm closing in on 2 weeks without a heater and I'm doing fine (definitely craving but manageable). And last night I drank a lot of aguardiente and bought an individual cig...

But I decided to put it in my pocket and see how long I could last before I needed it. I'm proud that I resisted all night and in the morning I snapped it in half. Such a good feeling. Goodluck to everyone still struggling and wish me luck to navigate this heavy smoking city!

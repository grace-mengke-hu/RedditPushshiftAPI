42 days... Just moved to the Step 2 patch!

My wife, who is also a smoker, has been semi-supportive but has always been, "Yeah, but you gotta wear that giant patch all the time." Well, today, I moved to the step 2 patch, which is half the size! She was genuinely impressed and now I can hide this dang thing much easier :). 

If you seriously have the motivation, I just want to put my vote behind the patch. I know it's not a common quitting method anymore but it is so set-and-forget, and it also breaks you out of the compulsive "gotta put something in or on my mouth" habbit of cigarettes.

Day 3: Help

I have been smoke three for three days now. 

I feel awful. I can barely sleep, I want to eat every single type of food in front of me, I am beyond irritable and I have the attention span of a squirrel.

How much longer will this phase last and do you lovely quitters have any tips on how to get through this?

I need to be done

Currently standing outside in the alley outside of my work, puffing away at this godforbidden tar stick. This is the longest I’ve gone on continually smoking and I just need to be done. I’ve smoked on and off since I was 18, but never being a daily smoker for more than a few months at a time. I’m at almost a year and a half now, pack a day. 

I read Allan Carr’s book last year and that helped me quit for a few months, but that was before I started a new job, and when it got busy, I caved. Currently reading the book again to remind myself of the reasons I quit, and it is helping, but I still feel trapped. I’m 24 now, and my birthday is in September. My goal is to be 100% smoke free by the time I turn a quarter of a century.

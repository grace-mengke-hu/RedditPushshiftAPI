What do you do to relax now that you're a non-smoker?

I'm in a weird place with my quit...all of the physical symptoms of withdrawal are gone and I've stopped thinking about smokes when I would usually have them (in the car, after work etc.) but the one thing I can't get around is the feeling of needing some kind of activity/ritual to relax. 


Before obviously, I would smoke a cig to feel relaxed. After quitting, I don't want smoke, but I miss being able to do something to relax. Tell me, **what did you start doing to replace the relaxing "effect" of smoking once you quit?**


And yes, tried sex: works until my fiance is spent and I need something I can legally do in public / at work, lol.

The wifey FINALLY noticed after two weeks :)

Today is my 14th day mark! Yay! It has been a super easy journey for me so far, in a HUGE part due to you guys. The stories here, both milestone and relapse posts, really helped me push through some of the worse cravings and keep me focused on bearing the mental game. So, a BIG thank you to everyone here!

So anyway, we were laying in bed tonight, and the wifey asked me, "How come you didn't smoke with my dad today? You didn't smoke last night either at the party. Come to think about it, that pack of cigarette has been sitting there untouched for a while now."

I didn't say anything, just simply showed her my quit smoking app's status page. She was shocked! She asked what prompted it. I pulled up reddit and showed her my first post here: nothing planned, just suddenly stopped feeling like smoking, and that was it :)

I can't believe how much more relaxing and enjoyable parties and long car rides have become, since I stopped worrying about when I can have a cigarette again. I love this!

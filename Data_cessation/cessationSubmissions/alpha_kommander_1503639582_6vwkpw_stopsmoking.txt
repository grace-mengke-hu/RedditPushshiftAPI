What made me decide to stop and how am I doing it?

I've been smoking for over 10 years. I really enjoyed it. I liked to see the smoke, I liked the private 5 mins it gave me. I knew it wasn't good, I knew I had to stop, but giving up all this just wasn't worth it.
Then one day my 4 year old daughter said: dad, smoking makes people ill. What if you'll only remember that you should've quit stop smoking when you've got wings? Why don't you just have one more and then forget about it?

That was hard to hear and really made me think. What if I'll only regret not stopping after I'm dead?

I decided to have 2 more actually and stopped cold turkey. 

How am I doing? It's been day five. I had some ups and downs with the cravings, but it's all under control. Apart from what my daughter told me, 3 things really helped me: smoke free app, iDrated hydration app and running. 
I've been running 6 Kms everyday since and it just helps so much! It's really meditating and makes me feel healthy. It totally replaces smoking for me. 

Hope this helps.

one week!!!

I'm on my first smoke free week and i feel SO good. Honestly, the first four days were the hardest. Now it feels as if I barely think about smoking, because I just know I wont let myself do it, I just don't go there in my mind anymore. 
Anyways... A week in, people say smell and taste gets better... Anyone with any experience or story to tell about this? Any special thing that tastes different or something? All I have noticed so far is just how great it feels to smell like the natural me and not have that shitty smell all over everything i own. And yesterday someone who got on the bus had just smoked in the rain and I found the smell pretty disgusting...

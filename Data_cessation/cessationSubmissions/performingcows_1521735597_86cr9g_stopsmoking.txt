Identity loss with quitting

I am part of a political and cultural scene where almost everyone smokes. No one will tell you you should smoke, but non-smokers are very unusual. Smoking has always been a part of belonging to that group for me, so quitting makes me feel as if i'm giving up part of my identity (part of fitting into a certain clich√© perhaps too). Anyone else have any experience with that, smoking being part of how you identify? how did you get over the perceived loss of that?

It has to stop.

Hi, i want to end this once and for all, i mean Im only 19 half of my salary goes on cigarettes(1 1/2-2 packs a day), I started when i was 14-15, it was something occasional then it became something i did every day, i smoked a pack and a half a day, and i got bored of it, but it's not that easy as my body asks for it, but hey i really will stop, wish me luck guys.

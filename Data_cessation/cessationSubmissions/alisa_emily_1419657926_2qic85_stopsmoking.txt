Okay. It is time.

I've been smoking for about a year and a half. The first year or so it was pretty intermittent, sometimes only one a day or so, never more than three or four a day. Then my life got crazy with work and I almost doubled my daily cigarette intake.  
I'm a long time lurker, and I've tried to quit before. I'm finally ready to try to quit again, for the dumbest reason imaginable: vanity. My acne has been worse than it's been in years (I'm 24), not really in terms of breakouts, but in terms of redness and blemishes clearing. I just realized tonight that this isn't because I've been stressed; it's because reduced circulation has prevented my face from healing.  
So I'm done. Threw the pack away, ready for the hell that will be the next few days, ready for how good I'm going to feel when that passes, and ready to pick up some good habits. Any support would be appreciated :)

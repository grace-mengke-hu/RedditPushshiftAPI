Setting a date

Does it help or make you more anxious and feel overwhelming? My first big quit, (lasted 3 years) I didn't set a date but I was reading EasyWay so as I got close to the end I knew the day was near. I guess I'm afraid of letting myself down by setting a date and not being ready. I knew someone who quit and he used an app to help track something, I can't remember. Can anyone recommend a good stop smoking app for iPhone? Thanks.

I quit 4 days ago...I've been struggling with constipation ever since. Help??!!

I guess the nicotine being a metabolism inducer helped alot in terms of, erm, bowel motions. Within minutes of smoking my first cigarette in the morning I would have a motion. Sometimes I would have up to 4 a day...and now I feel like sh*t cause I've only gone twice in the last 4 days even though I've been upping my fiber intake, consuming lots of chia seeds, water, coffee and NOTHING...anyone who's been in this boat before can guide me as to what to do? :( (having a  bad craving bc of that tbh)

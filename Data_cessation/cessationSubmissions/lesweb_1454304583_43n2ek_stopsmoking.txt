This is it. If I don't do it this time, I don't think I ever will.

I don't want to quit smoking. I need to quit smoking. 10 years of destroying my lungs with 20 a day. Over.

So....What do I do? Update this daily?  

Update 1: 
If this gets read, not read whatever. It's kinda helping me and that's what this place is for right?
So. I've wanted to murder everyone today. my dog is lucky it's not been put in a pot (I live in China). I've broken up with my girlfriend twice. I think we are together now, I'm not sure. Living in China sucks, everyone smokes. every single motherfucker. So I'm just staying away. I got a freezer full of food and my phone is off. not going outside, well, I am but only with the dog for runs and shits and stuff. Fuck punctuation, fuck you, you cunt. 

Update 1.1

Just had a pretty strong craving. It was like a black hole in my chest that sucked everything into it. every thought, I could feel myself imploding and I knew a smoke would stop it. but, Oh no no Mr craving. you gotta do better than that! 

Why does everyone I know smoke? this would be so much easier if I knew some people that didn't smoke. 

Update 2

 day 3 . I went out drinking yesterday, with 5 smokers. I couldn't handle the boredom.
I did not smoke. FUcking A

Update 3

Holy shit that went fast, it's day 5 now. Still not smoked. Cravings feel more like inconveniences now, than a super mega black hole that destroys everything and leaves me empty. I'm not angry any more, but I'm pretty blunt with people and I'm feeling pretty arrogant.  

Update 4. Day 17.
Actually quite easy. just don't smoke.

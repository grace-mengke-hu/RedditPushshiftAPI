I can’t believe I made it this far.

I was with a friend last night waiting for a cab and she smoking a cigarette and I didn’t bum a puff or even want to.  I’m so proud of myself.  Thanks to everyone on this supportive sub that helped me.  Especially to the person who recommended the easy way to quit smoking by Allen car cause that really saved my ass.

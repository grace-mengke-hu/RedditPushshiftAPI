I quit smoking... again.

I have decided to give up again, I have tried a couple of times before but on each occassion have managed about a week, in one case 3 weeks, before falling back into old routine. 

I have reached a point now where I know I want to quit, but doing so just seems like it won't happen. I know it is a matter of determination and just pushing on, but I feel like I am already committed to failure. 

I have made the decision to not tell anyone that I have quit, as everytime I do I end up a week later trying to explain myself and feeling like an idiot. I feel that this might be a silly approach as it gives me one less reason to commit.

If anyone has any tips on getting the mindset right so that this time I succeed, I would appreciate it.

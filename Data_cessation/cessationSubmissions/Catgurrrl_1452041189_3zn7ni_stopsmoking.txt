5 days in...

Over the decades (I'm 51), I've tried tried to quit several times.  I think the longest I've quit in the past has been for 9 months.  But something has always triggered me to start smoking again, be it a bad day at work, a fight with my now ex-husband, whatever.

My strategy now is like AA - "One day at a time".  Corny, but that's what I'm going with.  So, I really, really, want a smoke right now, but I'm deferring the decision to smoke till tomorrow.  And tomorrow I hope to look at smoking as something that I will not do for at least another day...you get the idea.  And I'm reminding myself in the meantime that my lungs are slowly getting clearer, and this is a healthier choice for me, plus I'm saving lots of cash!  (At 6-7 bucks per pack, and a pack per day habit, that's $30-35 so far.)

I plan to join a gym soon for cardio and weight training.  About 10 years ago, I was super-fit and about 70-80 pounds lighter than I am now (even though I was smoking then, but only like 1-4 cigs a day.). So, obviously, I'd like to get more fit and lose some weight, even if I can't get back to the exact weight I was.  My plan is to lose 20-25 lbs, then reevaluate where I want to go from there.  I got very fit before by road cycling and spinning.

And my boyfriend is very supportive and is also an ex-smoker, so he wants me to succeed.  And, if I'm honest, he's a big part of why I'm quitting.

Any tips/suggestions/comments that might help me to get through this are welcome!  Thanks for reading!

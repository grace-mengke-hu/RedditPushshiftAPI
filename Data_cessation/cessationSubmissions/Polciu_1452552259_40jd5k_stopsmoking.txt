Question about vaping.

I had my last cigarette on Friday the 8th of January. I used to go about 13 cigarettes a day and quit cold turkey. I think I'm doing fine so far despite occasional cravings, but I decided to dig up my old e cig and buy a zero nicotine e liquid to placebo the motion of smoking whenever i crave it, usually not too often, up to 3 times a day. Would the zero nicotine e cig still be considered cheating?

On my 31'st attempt to quit, I tried a vape pen. It's working. Is this cheating?

I've smoke for 29 years.  I've previously tried quitting at least 30 times (for real real).  Two and a half months ago I tried a vape pen, and... it's working.  It was tough for the first couple weeks, but this is the longest I've gone without smoking since I was a teenager.

Now, I'm still very much addicted to nicotine, that problem is not solved.  But it is a different world for all of the reasons one can readily think of.  A couple surprises include that I didn't expect to feel as good as I do - physically - and I have no explanation other than quitting the smokes.  The other surprise is that my nicotine cravings with the vape aren't as bad: day was I couldn't go a couple hours without smoking, but now I forget my vape at home all the time and it just doesn't seem like a big deal.  I'm not sure what to make of that, but it seems positive.

It does feel like I'm cheating though, like I haven't really quit because vaping is just mock-smoking.  I'll take it even if it is, but it does make me hesitant to spike the ball over quitting.  I'm curious what other folk's think about that...

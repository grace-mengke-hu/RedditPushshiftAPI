My girlfriend is trying to quit.

She was presxribed wellbutrin to help her quit. Last night she only smoked a third of a cigarette before bed and she didn't want anymore. So she is taking baby steps. 

1. How can I be there for support? 

2. What can I do to maintain a positive environment for her to help with cravings?

3. What can I expect to deal with in terms of mood, eating habits, etc.

On second to last cigarette watching the easy way webcast

And I'm so fucking scared. I read the book, quit for about 8 months, then slowly slipped back into it. Now I'm a full time smoker again and I've been feeling like shit. My partner finally had enough of me and I hated the way I felt/smelled/leaving work to smoke/all of it, so I knew I had to do something. Tried to read the book again and it just wasn't happening so I bought the webcast. I've been watching and it is resonating but I'm just terrified that it won't work, that I won't be able to do it, that I'm cursed to live this life forever. I've never posted here before but I just want to do this and do it right so fucking badly. After this I watch another section, then smoke my final cigarette, then that's it. I'm done and I can never go back. I'm terrified I can't do it. I'm terrified I'm going to fail again. And if I do I have no fucking idea what to do next.

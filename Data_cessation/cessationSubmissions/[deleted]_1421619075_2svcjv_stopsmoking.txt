Took a number of attempts, but 22 days!

After many unsuccessful attempts of "I'll quit on (date)", finally had enough. 

For the last six months or so, I had been slowing down and started going to the gym again. When I would go for a jog, I'd be okay for a mile or two but would then get winded. As of November, I started going a week in between cigarettes. Going to the gym after that day was rough! In a habit of going for a run every day now, and the high is better anyway.

The only thing that is tough is the headaches... They come after I've been walking a while, where I would have smoked, and then stop abruptly. Any ideas to pass them? Gum? Mints? Water?

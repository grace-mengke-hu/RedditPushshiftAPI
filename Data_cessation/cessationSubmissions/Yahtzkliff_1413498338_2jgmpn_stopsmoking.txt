Ex-smokers, what motivates you to not start smoking again?

I picked up smoking around 2010 when I lived in Spain. I did it on and off for a couple of months until I moved back to Texas and started bartending in May of 2011. That's when things got bad. I started smoking daily and without drinking. My best friend is a chain smoker and it made harder for me to control myself. Before I knew it I was buying my own packs of cigarettes and smoking about 5-7 cigarettes a day. Not bad in comparison but still smoking is smoking. I really want to stop, it's affected my lung capacity, my skin, and mostly my teeth. I ever feel good when I do smoke, but I like smoking for some reason. I feel that it's the social bonding of sneaking out the office to smoke with my co-workers, or having one when I'm drinking. I need more motivation to quit, and never return! Please let me know how y'all stopped, what motivated you to do it, and what motivates you to not start back up. (I'm one day without a cig!)

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, it's been over a week and I got bronchitis really bad, which is motivating to NEVER start back up. I also got the quitnow! app and keeping up with my progress. I love the future that I'm going to have as a non-smoker! thanks for all the support yall!

UPDATE: Ten days and still going strong. I've coughed up a lot of mucus, and had a minor cold, but I'm starting to feel better, and I'm finally breathing normally for the first time in 3 years! Thanks for the support

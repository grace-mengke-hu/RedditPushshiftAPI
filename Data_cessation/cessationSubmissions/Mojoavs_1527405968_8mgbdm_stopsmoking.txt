More than 3 months smoke free

When I quit smoking on 21st February, it was without any planning.  I just took a call.  Initially even I did not have belief that I could do it.  It is now close to 95 days and I am still smoke free.  In the initial days, this group was my go to place.  I drew upon the support of my fellow quitters, their motivation was what kept me going.  Today, I am visiting the group after almost a month.
Believe me guys, it is possible and it gets easier.  Just keep at it and believe you can do it.  I did.

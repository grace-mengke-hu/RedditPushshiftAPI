24 hours

I have “quit” many times before, but in the past 2 years, I have smoked more heavily than I ever have in my 22 year long nicotine addiction. The last few months, I’ve started to feel awful - heart palpitations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, my hair and skin has suffered and just a general “giving up” feeling about not living the life I’d always wanted. A life free from nicotine and how sick it makes me feel. I’ve wanted this life for so long, but nicotine had its grip on me. 

Over the weekend, I read Allen Carr’s book. His book really spoke to me. I know I have a long way to go, but I am going to celebrate every milestone. And look forward to the next! I finally feel like I’m taking control of my life. 

I am a happy non smoker! I can’t wait to see what I do with my extra time, money, and energy.

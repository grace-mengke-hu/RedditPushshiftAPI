Happy Friday and 2 Weeks for Me!

This is the first morning, in a long time, that I woke up and didn't crave or think of having one.  I totally forgot, for a few hours, that my smoker morning routine is to wake up and have one.  I didn't think about having one, until I drove past one of my nicotine dealers.  

I am really glad I found this sub.  All the information and support here really helps people quit.  Thank you everyone!

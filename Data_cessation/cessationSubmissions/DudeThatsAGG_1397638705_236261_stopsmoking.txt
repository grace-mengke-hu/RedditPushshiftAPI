Which patches to buy?

I'm a 4-5 year smoker and I average at about 10 a day now after cutting back a lot. Went the e-cig route before, but it was too much trading one crutch for another and looking to go the patches route to kick the habit. What's the best nicotine content for me to buy? And what was your experience with using them?

This is my first post to reddit. So I will give you some insight to my story. I became a smoker when I was 14. By the time my 15th birthday came around I was a pack a day smoker this would continue until I was 20. Then one day I decided when I was 20 I was going to get healthy . I went from 240lbs down to 180 and stopped ciggs cold turkey. I stayed a non smoker until I was 23 so three whole years until my parents divorced. Being an only child and having your parents fight for who's side your on got me into the party scene and one thing lead to another and I was back smoking. I quite 21 days ago and since I quite before I know the signs . For all you first time quiters the first three days are the hardest. Plenty of exercise and healthy eating for me helped with the cravings oh did I mention do not drink booze when you first quite or you could be doomed right from the get go. Your life will be so much better without smoking. Best of luck on your journeys and if you need any advice I'm here for you all! Best of luck you can do it!

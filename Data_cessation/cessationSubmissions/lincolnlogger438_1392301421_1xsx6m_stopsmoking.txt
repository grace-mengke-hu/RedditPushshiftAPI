Day 1...Depressed x.x

I usually smoke one right in the morning, which leads to a chain reaction of smoking all day.

I woke up feeling depressed, and a cig would usually help out with that. I guess this way I'll just deal with my emotions normally.

the longer I smoke the harder it'll be to quit, so today I QUIT!

Wish me luck!

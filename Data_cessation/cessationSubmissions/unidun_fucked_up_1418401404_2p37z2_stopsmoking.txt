Guess I'll say 'hi' to the community!

Been smoking for 4 years casually, but this last year has become the year where I **needed** cigarettes to function. I decided to quit after I finished my finals this semester. I finished up on Wednesday, and smoked my last cigarette that morning. I went all day yesterday without smoking, though I really wanted to, so that's good.

I have a bit of a weird question to begin my journey: What do I do with my hands? I feel so uncomfortable not holding a cigarette at all times.

Lastly: If I can do this, I can do anything. And I *can* do this, so I *will* do this, because *I can do anything.*

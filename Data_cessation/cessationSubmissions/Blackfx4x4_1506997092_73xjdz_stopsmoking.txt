Decided I want a new pickup next spring (and to be around to enjoy it!)

Decided yesterday I wanted to buy a "new" (to me) pickup in the spring, and that I'd like to not only be able to afford it, but be around to enjoy it. So, I had my last cigarette yesterday afternoon around 4pm or so. Feeling better, printed or a picture of the type of pickup I'd like, made a list of ways to save money, how much I'd save, etc etc,  and my goals. 

I'm a truck driver, but oddly enough didn't start smoking until about 5 years ago when I wound up basically homeless after a water pipe flooded my apartment in a Saturday night. Hoping I can go back to my pre smoking habits while driving (sunflower seeds, drinking water every time I get the urge to smoke or get bored). Thanks in advance for your support!

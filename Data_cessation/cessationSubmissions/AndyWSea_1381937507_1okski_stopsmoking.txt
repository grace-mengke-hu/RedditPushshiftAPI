Day two and something tasted strange...

OK, so last night I had some bourbon, my go to drink. It tasted like ashes! A couple hours after that I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. It tasted like ashes too!! What the hell. Please tell me it is just my taste buds adjusting to the no smoking. 

Everything is going fairly easy, no major cravings. Well, going easy aside from the fight me and my partner got into last night over a bag of popcorn. We never fight.

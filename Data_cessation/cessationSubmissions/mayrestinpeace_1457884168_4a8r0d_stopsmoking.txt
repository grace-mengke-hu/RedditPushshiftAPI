It's time to quit.

Hi guys. As of now I am a chain smoker. I smoke 20 per day. I have exactly 16 days to quit. 
I have been a smoker for almost 4 years now. This is the first time I'll try to quit smoking.
I will update my smoke counts everyday for the next 16 days. I hope the last few days are 1 or being more optimistic 0.

Edit: Daily updates

Day 1: 17
Day 2: 17

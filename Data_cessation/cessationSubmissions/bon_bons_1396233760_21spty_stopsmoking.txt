Alright, how do I do this?

This is it. Well, it has to be. I got a job as a camp counselor this summer, and I have to quit. I've tried before, and failed at 25 hours. When I found out I had to quit by summer, I didn't buy any packs in my hometown before coming back to school (its much cheaper back home), so I only have 10 cigs right now. I have a big exam on Thursday, is it going to mess with my grade if I am having withdrawls on Thursday? Is it smarter to buy another pack and quit after that (be honest, i know its a bad decision in terms of quitting, but is it a good decision in terms of my grade, because this is a very important exam). 


furthermore, how do i do it? how do i not cave? 


p.s. I've been smoking for three years, a pack every 1-2 days, and all my best friends smoke

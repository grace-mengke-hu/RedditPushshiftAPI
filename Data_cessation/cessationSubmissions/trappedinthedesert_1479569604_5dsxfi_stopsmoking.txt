Cold weather making it harder on me right now. Ugh

I don't know why, maybe it's because of how much I love the cold and everything about it, it makes me want to smoke again. I love cold weather and the smell and feel of cold air. The look of the sun rising over trees without leaves. The calm quiet of a winter morning. All these things just make me want to sit outside and appreciate the beauty of it all. But it makes me want to smoke while doing so. Really can't explain why. I guess my brain associates two things I really love and wants to enjoy them both at the same time. 

Whatever, fuck off cigarettes you're not winning this one. Anyone else feel like weather or certain times of year influence your desire to smoke? Holidays are obvious cause of the combination of social and stress and drinking, but what about just times of the year in terms of the weather and climate?

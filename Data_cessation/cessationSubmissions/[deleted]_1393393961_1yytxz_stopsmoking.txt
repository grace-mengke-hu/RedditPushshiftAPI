Moved to a new country where cigarettes cost twice as much as back home. Scandalous! I quit 90 hours ago. Let's see where this goes.

I've been in Australia for just over two weeks now. I figure the time to improve my lifestyle is *now*, before I've settled into a routine yet.

Virtually all my craving triggers (unpleasant relatives, embarrassment over certain aspects of my professional reputation, ennui, cold weather, friends that smoke) are back in Canada. I've got everything going for me...I'm unsure how long I can keep this up, but I have to at least try, right?

Edit: it appears my badge is slightly off due to international dateline issues...I guess when it starts counting weeks instead of days it won't make a difference. :)

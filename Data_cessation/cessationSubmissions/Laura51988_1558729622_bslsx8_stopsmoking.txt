Depression after quitting

I’m on day 6 of my quit . I’m determined to stay quit, as stopping smoking has really improved my anxiety , but since I quit I’m noticing I’m very depressed . Not just about quitting , about literally everything . I feel like a part of me died , and I react so strongly to things that upset me , when normally I’d be able to acknowledge these feelings and let them go. 

For example I follow a sub for my city , and someone posted a link to an ad for an adult dog that’s being giving away for free, as the owner can’t take care of it anymore . Normally I’d think of how sad that was and move on but today I cried for a solid 20 mins about it. I don’t know this dog, or the person giving away the dog, but I cried like it was my own dog. Wtf. It’s like any emotion I feel is ridiculously intensified . Suddenly the world is just ugly and dark and I don’t have my coping mechanism to help deal with it. 

I can handle the cravings , but this sadness is really weighing me down. I quit to help my anxiety but is it really worth it if I’m just deeply depressed ?! I’ve read online that this can happen, but I don’t see it talked about on this sub at all, so it makes me feel even more alone . 

I know smoking doesn’t help stress , I know cigarettes don’t miraculously solve problems , but I’ve only felt this low since I quit so my depressed / addicted brain automatically keeps telling me that being quit isn’t worth it. That it’s better to be unhealthy and happy than healthier and sad . 


Has anyone else felt this after a quit? I really don’t want to give up, logically I know smoking causes a whole new set of problems and I’m really proud of myself for getting this far , but it’s hard to celebrate my progress when everything seems so bleak . It would really help to be reminded  this eventually will pass by people who might have experienced it. 

Thanks for reading! :)

1,000 days, cool.

Hey folks, I just realized that today is the One-thousandth day in a row that I have not smoked a cigarette. I never smoked too much - got up to about half-a-pack a day during the week, two packs over the weekend. But, I quit cold-turkey and haven't looked back since.

I still want a cigarette sometimes, and I still love to smell it waft through the breeze. But I'm glad for those continued, little cravings - they remind me to keep my guard up and not think "oh hell, I'll just bum one." 

I don't know how helpful my process would be to anyone else - but I didn't limit my exposure to other smokers. For one thing, I work with the chronically mentally ill and smoking is a big part of a lot of their lives so there was really no avoiding it.

Also, I didn't cut back my coffee or drinking as I know some say to do - in fact I think I used them to overcome some of the boredom and cravings, but I wouldn't suggest that practice to anyone else. 

I also began to rethink my self-image and change sort of my personal mythology. I stopped thinking myself as an over-worked, over-stressed whiskey-drankin' smoker, and began to think of myself as a busy, committed, whiskey-drankin' thriver. I began working out again and taking more pride in my physical health and appearance. That might help some of you all that worry about your identity post-smoker.

This was sort of rambling but I've had a long weekend that included hiking up a mountain with a beautiful woman in the middle of the night, chopping wood with my brother-in-law the next day, then camping with my buddies again that night. Smoking would have made all of those activities at least a little sucky. Probably a lot sucky on the mountain climb...

So for those of you struggling to keep at it or deciding to quit, just keep your head and maybe think about writing the next chapter in the story of you. A whole new existence free from cigarettes.

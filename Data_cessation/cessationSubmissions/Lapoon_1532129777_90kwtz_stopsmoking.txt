Are there any nicotine-free lozenges that taste like the ones with nicotine?

So I have successfully stopped chewing tobacco by using the off-brand nicotine lozenges you can get at target or wal-mart or whatever. So I figured the next logical step is to use lozenges without nicotine. The only problem is the mints and stuff you find in stores is not the same texture and has too much flavor. Do any of you know of lozenges that taste the same but without the nicotine, or have any other good ideas?

Feeling kinda down today

It's day 5 of my quit. I'm feeling pretty irritable, and kinda sad. Not only does it feel like I lost a companion but a lot of my social contact was through smoking. I sometimes go sit outside with the smokers just to get some sun and have a break but i'm actually finding that I don't really like these people lol

I'm also trying not to eat everything in sight so I'm doing intermittent fasting. There is a box of donuts in the office and I want to go eat them all

This sucks and I'm going crazy

Definitive day 0

I don't see better first serious post in reddit to communicate that today is my day 0, 100% definitive.

After smoking more than 8 years I leaved it for 6 months, but I went back to smoking when I changed jobs... It's been 8 months since then and I recently had several attempts... but this is the good one, I'm sure. I feel strong.

I have also requested an extra help with a Online monitoring of a local hospital and the support of my people.

Right now 1 hour and 30 minutes without smoke. :P

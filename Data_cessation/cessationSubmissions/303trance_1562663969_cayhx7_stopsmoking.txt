Smoked for 25+ years, failed quitting hundreds of times, thought I would never quit. I'm here to tell you it's possible.

My 7th month, most stressful time of my life: extra nasty divorce, loss of work, loss of home, loss of friend - yet I don't smoke cigs anymore and have no plans to. I have the weakest will of all - yet here I am, an ex smoker. 

I must admit - I am still addicted to weed, but that one I stopped yesterday - so, that's the next dragon in going to slay. Here we go. 

You can do it - you can read books, listen to Robert Carr, take pills and lozenges, but ultimately - you choose to buy that pack. You can also chose not to. Every bit of help... helps - something that struck me is something so obvious:

Someone here said something along the lines that we choose to avoid things we don't want. For some of us it's some food or activity - you will never try it no matter what (KFC,  Arby's, LA Fitness, etc.)

Add cigarettes to your "do not want" mental list (somewhere below Avis, Comcast, and Taco Bell)

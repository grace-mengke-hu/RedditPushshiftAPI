Feel terrible....

I quit about 7 days ago...it has been relatively easy because I haven't been around many smokers. That said, I feel terrible...my chest feels cold...does that make sense? Its like how you feel after you have been outside in the winter. I am not particularly wheezy at all or coughing otherwise, just left with this cold feeling in my chest. Anyone have the same feeling?

Day 4 - Feelin' emotional(is this usual?)

Hi all,

I recently quit smoking, and wanted to know if there is a trend with people getting a bit emotional during this quitting phase?
I'm essentially sleeping worse, and waking up at night - but alongside that I'm feeling incredibly sad and angry with even really small stuff.

Honestly the emotional reactions have made me consider getting back to smoking, so I want to know if it is caused by quitting, and when that may end?

Thanks.

Spicy foods are SPICY now!

I've always put sriracha on everything I could think of - eggs, pizza, mac n cheese, etc.  And I've always opted for the spiciest/hottest options on the menu.  But after 2 weeks of not smoking, my tolerance for spicy foods is so low!  Crazy how much different taste buds are when you aren't killing them everyday!

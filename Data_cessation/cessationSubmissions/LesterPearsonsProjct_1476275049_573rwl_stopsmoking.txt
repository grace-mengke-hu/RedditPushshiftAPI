It just occurred to me that I can't remember what brand I used to smoke. This feels like a big deal.

I used to ask for "a large pack of _____ king reds" but I can't remember what the name in the blank space is. I know it's a value brand that only exists in Canada but I can't put my finger on it.

**Edit:** It was Viceroy. Viceroy was the brand.

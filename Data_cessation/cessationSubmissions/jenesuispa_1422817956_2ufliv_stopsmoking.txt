I quit today.

I'm 21 years old and I've been smoking since I was 14. That's a seven-year habit, and I'm done wasting my money on a product that is slowly killing me. 

Both of my parents are chain smokers, and up until recently most of my friends have been smokers, which has made it really hard for me to quit. I recently moved to a new town, and I'm starting a new job and a new school. It seems like as good a time as any to kick this habit.

What worries me the most about this is that smoking has almost become a part of my identity. I am known as that girl who always has a cigarette in her hand. I feel like I have been deluding myself into believing that smoking is somehow "romantic" or "artistic," or that I have to have some sort of crutch or vice in order to get me through the day, to reward myself for completing tasks, or to stimulate my creativity. I've realized that this is bull, and I'm ready to silence the whiny voice of my ego. 

I'm wearing a 21mg nicotine patch, and I plan to handle my cravings by drinking tea, exercising, and meditating. Wish me luck Reddit!

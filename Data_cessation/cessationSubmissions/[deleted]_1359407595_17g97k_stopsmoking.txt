Closing in on exactly one week.

It's tough. Especially for the fact that I decided to work things out with my ex and it's been hell ever since, but I haven't given in.

I wanted to, hell I want to go outside and smoke one right now, but I do not want to let myself down. That's what I'm more afraid of. I'm not afraid of getting hooked again, I'm not afraid to smoke another cigarette; I just don't want to let myself down.

By not smoking 101.75 cigarettes, I've saved $40.70.

That's where I'm at.

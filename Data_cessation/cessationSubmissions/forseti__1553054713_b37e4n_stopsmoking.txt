I failed at quitting and now I di it again.

I think last time I made 1 year then a girl broke my heart and I started again.

I'm here for the next round. Right now at day 3 and I think I go crazy. Not that I can't stand it, its just my thoughts are totally strange. I thought that everything might be just a dream or I don't get the whole picture. Maybe I am "crazy" but don't know it and nobody tells me. Damn, I think I might have huge trust problems - thanks mom and dad for lying to me.

Hope this shit goes by quickly and I'm normal again.

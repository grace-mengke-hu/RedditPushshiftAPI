Day 15...

So the start of week three has been difficult. Today has been the most I've thought about smoking since days 1-3, but in a different way. Then it was a constant buzz, with the voice saying "smoke smoke smoke." Today it's been more of a dull ache. I think my brain has realised that my body is healing and exercising, and that this time I might be serious!

I'm feeling like I'm having to deny myself... I think I've been getting complacent. 15 days may not be much to many of you, but to me it's felt like a lifetime with a constant struggle in my subconscious...

On the plus side I've run 5k quicker than I ever had before, and with comparative ease. I didn't realise how breathing *actually* felt.

Anyway, helps to get feelings written, so rant over. Not smoking today! Phew!

3 months smoke-free tomorrow

i never count days since my last smoke until I get the occasional thought of giving in. thinking about cigs tonight for some reason so i counted the time and just realized I've made it 90 days, 3 months, 1/4 year. now feel too proud to give in to the addiction. the posts on this sub help keep me motivated. cheers

Tips and advice desperately needed!

Hi everyone. 

I'm here looking for some advice. I've been smoking for about 8 years now, I've managed to quit for a few months at a time on a few occasions but I've always ended up back on them again. 

I'm trying to quit at the moment but this time I can't even manage to go a day without having one and I'm just finding it to be more and more impossible. 

I appreciate that the key thing is will power and none of you can give that to me, but do you have any advice or tips on what I can do to improve my chances because I'm really drawing a blank on this! 

Thanks in advance!

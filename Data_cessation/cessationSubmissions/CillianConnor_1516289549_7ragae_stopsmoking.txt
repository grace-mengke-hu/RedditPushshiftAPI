Anyone else dealing with eating disorder whilst quitting?

Hi there I was just wondering if any of you are dealing with eating disorder whilst quitting? 

I'm a recovered anoxeric and I'm aware that even after recovery, for the last two years, smoking became bundled up with symptoms (it was a means of skipping meals and like a lot of people who don't have eating disorders, the idea putting on weight was a big reason I didn't quit sooner). 

I'm doing ok at the moment and this quit is going well but whilst I haven't been snacking, having a healthy appetite for the first time in a long long while is a very strange sensation for me. 

Just wondering if anyone else with an eating disorder or who has previously used smoking as a means of skipping meals etc has any tips on how best to navigate this? 

I should say as well, I'm living at home at the moment (I'm 22) and have supportive people around me who've been with me through very severe times in my mental health and when I got very ill and underweight so I do have a good network of people around me and I'm safe.

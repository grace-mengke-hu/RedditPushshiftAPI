I'm Dying of man flu

Hey guys so for the past 3 weeks I have been sick on the exact same day every week. It seems to be getting worse and longer each time.

I coughed up a ball of plem the other day was not very nice comming up and then vomited this morning from coughing

Anyone else experienced this and have a suggestion. I am about 5 weeks nicotine free

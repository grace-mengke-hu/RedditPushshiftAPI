One whole week :-)

WOW TIME HAS FLOWN! The cravings are down to one a day... I feel more clear minded. I can't wait for all the weeks to come as a non smoker. 86 cigarettes, not smoked.. I never coughed, so I don't have a quitters cough... my chest feels lighter and my breaths feel deeper and more satisfactory. I should have done this a long time ago. 3 years too long.... I'm only 22... and smoked since I was 19... but not any longer. I AM A NON SMOKER. I am still young, my body should recover fast.

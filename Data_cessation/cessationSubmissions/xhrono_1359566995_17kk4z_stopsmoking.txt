Haven't quit yet....

I've been thinking about quitting for a while, and recently I've set r/stopsmoking to open automatically with my browser. All the kind words and support here seem like they will be a great help when/if I make the decision. All the success stories, and the honesty of people who have struggled or had setbacks while quitting really keep things in perspective.

I'm getting married in April, and while I'd like to be smoke-free at my wedding, I'm afraid of being a grouch and jerk because I will have cravings. I'm also going on vacation in two weeks, and I think the temptation will be too much while I'm there to resist.

Does anyone have any thoughts on when they were ready? Were you waiting for a specific day? Does it even matter?

Thanks for sharing all your stories and support, and I will be back here, looking for inspiration.

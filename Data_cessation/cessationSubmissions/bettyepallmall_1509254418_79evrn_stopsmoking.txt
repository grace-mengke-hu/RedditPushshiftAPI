At a bar with my best friend last night

I got to see a friend of mine that I haven’t seen in a few years last night. She was the one I started smoking with when we were teenagers because we thought it was “cool.” She still smokes and I did up until almost 2 years ago. I don’t even think about smoking anymore, really. It’s not hard anymore. But last night was a different story. 
Especially when we were playing pool at the bar and when it was her turn to shoot she handed me her cigarette to hold. She didn’t think anything of it-  it’s what we’ve always done. We shared cigs, we’d smoke together, etc... I was a few beers in, I had plenty of good friends around, and a lit cigarette between my fingers ...the thought came “Maybe just one drag.” 

She took her shot at the pool table and I handed her back her cigarette and said “Take this before I get too tempted.” She immediately apologized, like I said- she wasn’t thinking about it that way and meant no harm. And if I would’ve taken a drag it would’ve been my fault, not hers. 

Anyway, I survived- didn’t smoke at all. Probably one of the hardest obstacles in quite a while and I passed with flying colors. Just thought I’d share my story to remind you to stay on your toes- but you can do it!

I'm scared to quit

I'm still quite young and about a year ago smoking went from wanting that buzz to wanting to feel normal. I just can't afford to keep smoking and I feel so guilty after every cigarette. 

My problem is I'm so scared to quit. If I can't afford more cigarettes for a day I can't concentrate and it affects me so badly while I'm studying. I started smoking with my friends casually and we still smoke together once or twice a week but none of them are addicted like me. If I mention quitting they don't understand how I feel so they aren't supportive of me at all and don't take me seriously.

I don't really know where I'm going with this but I know I need to quit. I guess I'm looking for some support and hopefully some motivation from you guys.

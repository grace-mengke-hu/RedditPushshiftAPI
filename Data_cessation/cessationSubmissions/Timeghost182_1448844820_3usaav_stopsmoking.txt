Today makes 1 week but this totally sucks

So today makes a week with no smokes. Sure it's great and all I guess, but honestly, this sucks. I want a cigarette almost all the time. Everyone says they get cravings and then they go away after a couple minutes. Well that happens to me, but it still sucks. My life has just been really "gray" and bland since I quit. I run every other day. I started working out again. But I don't really feel any better. I don't like to drive anymore, it pisses me off when I drink coffee, drinking alcohol is the worst, I don't care to hang out with anyone for the most part. This is a very negative post, I get that, but so far this whole thing blows. I feel like I'm not me. It's like if your best friend died, life goes on, but a part of you dies too. That's how I feel. I'm still here, life just kindof sucks. Is this evey gonna go away. I miss my smokes, going outside and looking at the stars every night while having a cig, conversations while smoking, etc.

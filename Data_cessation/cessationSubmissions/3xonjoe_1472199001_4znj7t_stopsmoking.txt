Quit roughly 30 days ago kinda ;/

I have to type this quick bad spelling incoming ;) I have a question for everyone! I quit smoking about a month ago. In that time i have had maybe 10 smokes but for good reason. After day 2 like my last 3 or so times I have tried to quit I have zero craving for a smoke. Actually I really never even crave one its more of sitting in one area and getting bored. But here's thr problem.  I get really bad mouth sores if I go with out smoking for a week give or take. I can't eat anything because of the pain. I bought a pack 4 days ago and had 6 smokes than tossed the pack. It sucks I smoked but I can now eat after not being able to for 3 days. Anyone have any remedies for this?

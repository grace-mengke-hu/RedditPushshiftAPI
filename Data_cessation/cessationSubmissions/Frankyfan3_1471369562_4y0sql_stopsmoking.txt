It seemed nearly impossible

It's been awhile since I've been on this sub, because I've just been living my life, coping with stress by other means besides nicotine.

I'm coming up on my 3 year anniversary of my quit in September, and I'm excited to report that I barely think about smoking anymore. Even when I'm around people smoking, it doesn't even trigger me even a little bit, like it used to.

Happily, my boyfriend quit smoking cigarettes shortly after we'd started dating, which he says isn't BECAUSE of me and my quit, but that was one of the influencing factors, so I'm pretty elated to have had that positive influence in his life as well as my own.

I had struggled with my cravings for months, into my first year, but with practice, it became second nature to identify as a "non-smoker"

My mother recently went through open heart surgery, and had her last cigarette the day before. She was going through nicotine withdrawal WHILE going through her surgery recovery, and it was a hellish thing to watch and know she was experiencing. Thankfully she hasn't smoked since, and my choice to quit back when has been helpful for her to maintain that change in habits.

I wanted to pop in to offer my gratitude for the support the folks in this sub offered while I was struggling to keep up my quit, and also to offer some hope to those who are currently battling with the cravings. Believe in your choice, believe in your health, believe in yourself, and reach out when you need help.

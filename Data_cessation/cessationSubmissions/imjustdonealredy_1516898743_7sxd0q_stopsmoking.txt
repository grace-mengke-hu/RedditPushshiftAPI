For those of you who quit drinking and smoking

How did you do it? I am two weeks sober and I want to quit smoking too. Yesterday was my quit day for cigs and it did *not* work. :(  I want to be free!

Any suggestions are very appreciated, thank you!

Edit for clarity

Edit to say thank you all for the solid advise and the encouragement. I'm not done with this battle and I will quit smoking!

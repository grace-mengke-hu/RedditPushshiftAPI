Observations from first smoking restriction.

I'm an avid smoker. I roll my next smoke while still smoking the first one. I know how that sounds; its pretty fucked up. I'm the dude that smokes while he's working out. I get shit for it :)

Today i set a timer for 30 minutes. I would not smoke during those 30 minutes. I smoked my next cigarette 2 hours later. I kept resetting my timer with 30 minutes. This is a record, god that sounds horrible :)

OBSERVATION: Holy hell, i never realized how much time is wasted just smoking. I would literally just stand or sit somewhere having a smoke. As if smoking is its own activity. This means you don't just take time away from shortening your lifespan. You also take time away from what little time we have by smoking instead of doing useful stuff.

I tried just standing/ sitting without smoking. My living room is cleaner now, took care of some plants in the house. Put some things in its place and did a few handstands. For some reason my living room is bigger now.

I didn't cough for two hours. As soon as i started smoking, I started coughing again. I've set my timer for an hour now. Going to watch a movie while rope skipping for half an hour. I've been doing that for eight days now. Started with 5 minutes, amped up to 30 minutes. When I quit smoking permanently, i'll be able to go for 12 hours in a row. You are not allowed to question this statement :)

Unmathable..

660 days smoke free!

This pack-a-day EX-smoker only has 70 days until I hit the big two year mark! Just wanted to let everyone know you can do it! Some days will be worse than others, but you will get through it. I am literally to a point where I am disgusted to see people smoking or smell cigarette smoke.

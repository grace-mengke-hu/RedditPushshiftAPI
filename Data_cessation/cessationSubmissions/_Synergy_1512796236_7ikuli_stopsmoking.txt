I'm unsure.

I'm really not sure of where I stand or how I feel. I had a cigarette tonight with my father in law. Weirdly, I almost feel in control, though I doubt I actually am.

Back story about me, I'm a quitter. I give up on things when they get difficult. That's probably why I'm so lazy and the heaviest I've ever been in my whole life.

I don't know what to do.

Grateful.

5 days in to my 2nd quit this year and this morning I am happy that I'm not making a beeline to go outside and puff myself to death in the freezing cold. 5 days ago that was exactly what I was doing- going outside for an hour, wrapped up like a mummy in blankets and a housecoat and chain-smoking with my coffee in hand. I just realized how great it is to be doing any of that. Thats all.

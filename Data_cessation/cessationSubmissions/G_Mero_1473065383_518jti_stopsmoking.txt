Day 6 + Surf City App

To whoever it was that mentioned the Surf City App yesterday, thank you. It was enlightening and fit nicely with the ongoing of today. 

I was late for work and my staff weren't brief on the load for the day which led to nothing getting done for the first half of the day. My mum then had to take over my work load during lunch (a family company) as I made my way to the office. Got there and got news of my "little brother" being an asshole and got majorly stressed out. Felt like everything was against me. Got home, remembered the app and needed reinforcing. It was great! Some parts hit home real hard I teared up as well. 

I can't remember who you are but thanks for the recommendation. Couldn't be timed any better.

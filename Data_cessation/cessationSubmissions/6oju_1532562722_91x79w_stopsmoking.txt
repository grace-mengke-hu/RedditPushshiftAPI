2 weeks nicotine free tomorrow but still feel like i cant breathe.

Im 2 weeks cigarette/nicotine free tomorrow, however i feel like i should be able to take deeper breaths. It feels unchanged which is strange because the times i have quit before i recall feeling an improvement with my lungs within the first week. Is this normal?

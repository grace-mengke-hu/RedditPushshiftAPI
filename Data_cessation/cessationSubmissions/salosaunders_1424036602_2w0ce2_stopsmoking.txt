First craving in a while...

My boyfriend did something that triggered my classic mix of guilt, anxiety, and irritation. I instantly craved a smoke. Isn't it so annoying how your brain makes those connections and holds on to them just to throw them in your face when you're having a hard time? I will not smoke today.

SIX MONTHS SMOKE FREE!!!

ERM MEH GAWD I DID IT! Can't believe it's been six months already. My partner quit six weeks after me as well and he's remained smoke free also! Not a single puff from either of us! Can't wait to be posting up that we've made it a whole year!!

Keep it up guys, you can all do it to! This sub has been such a blessing to me and has truly helped keep me motivated at the roughest times. Thank you!!!

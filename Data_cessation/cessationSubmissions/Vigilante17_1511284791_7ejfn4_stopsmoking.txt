I'm quitting today! I want to be a non-smoker!

I had my first cigarette when I was 15 in 1989. I have been a pack a day smoker for over 25 years. I've loved my coffee and smoke each morning and countless drunken cigarettes at night, lighting the wrong end and chain smoking to where I feel gross the next day. I'm done. I've realized that it's not the current cigarette I want, it's always the next one that I'm thinking about. And there was always a next one. I don't have a large support group, but I do have a plan. I've got nicorette, a contract and a strong desire to stop. I'm going on vacation with family and there are no smokers and I won't be sneaking off or trying to wash up and hide a disgusting smell from them. I know it won't be easy, but I'm determined to make this work and will have plenty of things to distract me the first several days. This post is another form of me putting it out there to have to random internet strangers hold me accountable. I've lurked in this sub long enough and now I want to be part of this non-smoking group. Have a great day and wonderful Thanksgiving everyone!!!

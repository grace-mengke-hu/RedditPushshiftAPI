Bizzare tongue symptoms from quitting nicotine gum?

I'm on day 4 of dropping nicotine gum cold turkey after chewing it for a little over a month. Last night I noticed my tongue was white with a red stripe down the middle, accompanied by symmetrical white bumps on either side. I am hoping this has something to so with withdrawal, and is not a sign of some other more serious illness. Anyone else experience this from quitting the gum?

Getting honest.

This is for me. Since Sat afternoon I've had 4 cigs. Normally I would have had 60. I want to quit and I'm struggling. I wanted to quit cold turkey and be on my third day but I'm behind schedule. Tomorrow is work and my intent is not to smoke. But I have one cig saved if the morning start is rough. I wish I could throw it out and up my resolve to do this.

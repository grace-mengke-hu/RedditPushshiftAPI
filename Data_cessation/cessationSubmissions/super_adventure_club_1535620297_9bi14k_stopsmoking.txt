Keep failing, need a buddy or someone to hold me to account!

I made it a few months and ever since can't make it more than a week; I teach kids and get worked up, and there's nothing around my workplace so the idea of a cigarette pops into my head and I do it. 

I'm in Korea and if anyone is looking to quit and wants a buddy within this timezone, get in touch and we can support each other. I'd love to have my last cigarette ever tonight.

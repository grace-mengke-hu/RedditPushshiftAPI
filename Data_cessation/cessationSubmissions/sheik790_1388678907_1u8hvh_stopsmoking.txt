Stupid mini crisis I could use some help getting through

**Edit: thanks guys and sorry but i think i'm resetting the timer. i've been sitting here on the verge of a nervous breakdown that I'm not even sure is connected for about 2 hours and i just can't cope with today. I reallly appreciate the comments though and i'm not really giving up. just a setback thanks to a rough morning =/ Anyone know if it's possible to reset your badge?**

So i quit on christmas and so far have been doing ok, though the cravings have really sucked at times. Cold turkey is no fun, but whatever. Anyway I went to visit my mom and sisters today. Often when I come over my mom will offer to pick up a pack of cigarettes and generally i would (obviously) be amenable to that. I had myself all ready to say no when she asked, but upon my arrival she had already purchased a pack and everybody is still asleep. So now I'm sitting here with a full pack and I really just want to justify this to myself but I'm trying not to too. Like the money's already spent on them and waste is bad and what's one day and blah blah blah

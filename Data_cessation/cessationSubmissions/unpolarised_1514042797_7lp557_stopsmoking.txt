Not smoking is making me less aggressive.

Hi, I started cutting down on cigarettes 6 months back &amp; I am down to maybe 1 per week. I love this however I also seem to have become less aggressive towards my goals and my working hours. Has anyone else had this experience or is my laziness something else which I am blaming on cigarettes. Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience.

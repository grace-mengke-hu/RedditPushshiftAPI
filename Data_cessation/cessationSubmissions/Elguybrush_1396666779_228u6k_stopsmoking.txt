Well, bout time to try this quitting thing again

Just got a shipment of e-cig stuff, so far I've been sticking by it today, hoping to make it these next 24 hours and see where I can go with that.

I would really love for this to work out, I've quit drinking thanks to naltrexone, I'm lifting daily, I'm in the best shape of my life... and this is my last grand enemy to be annihilated 

edit: if you feel this belong in the ecig subreddit instead, feel free to tell me so, preferably in nice terms

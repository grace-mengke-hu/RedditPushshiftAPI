My problem with smokers is that they don't understand it's bad for their health, why don't they understand that?

My brother is smoking cigarettes and I've told him that as long as he understands how bad cigarettes is for his health there's nothing wrong with smoking cigarettes. He has to choose his own lifestyle if he wants to live a short life with a lot of added benefits (there's a lot of unhealthy things in this world that can make life both shorter but a lot more enjoyable) or live a longer life that will still be a good life just that you will miss out on some things. 
So whichever he thinks makes him more happy is better but he keeps saying the same bs that most smokers do.. they either say yeah I know its bad for health but i dont care and if that was true I would say ok thats fine but then at times he wants to argue and starts talking about those lucky 100 year old men who have supposedly been smoking their whole lives without gotten any cancer etc and that smoking cigarettes is not any more dangerous  than eating too much bananas because he read about a guy that got poisoned before a performance because he ate too many bananas because he was hungry and didn't have anything else to eat. stupid stuff like this is what i hear from most smokers, i dont think they have any idea about what they are doing to their bodies. 
You might say its none of my business but then you are a POS human being if you are not wanting to help another human such as perhaps you see a blind person suddenly start walking into traffic, are you just gonna be like "that old lady has got to know what shes doing" or are u gonna stop her and check to be sure, if you saw someone standing atthe edge of a skyscraper and you ask him if he isnt scared of falling and then he says that he can fly which he obviously cant just like smokers think they arent damaging their health but they are, what are you gonna do? just be like, oh ok, well go ahead and jump then.

1 day until happy star

hey all,

I haven't posted around here in a while, but I still lurk and read and post encouragement where I can.

Its been a year as of tomorrow. I feel fantastic. I never thought I would make it this far at this time last year. I was gearing up to quit at this point, heading to the grocery store to get supplies for my week long shut in. 

I smoked for 20 years at about a pack a day. I tried every type of Nicotine replacement, and gimmick out there. And in the end, cold turkey was what worked. I shut myself in for a week and rode the wave.

As I sit hear now it amazes me how long I smoked for and why I didn't quit earlier. 

To those of you who are just starting out, stick with it, its worth it, and it gets easier really quickly.

in conclusion, I just wanted to say thanks to this subreddit for being here for venting and to keep the minds of quitters off of the ciggies. Keep being awesome.

31 hours smoke free - first day update

Today was my first full day without smoking and so far, I feel gold about it! The hardest time for me was after getting off work and while driving home because the drive home was usually when I'd smoke 2-3 cigarettes usually. I downloaded some podcasts to keep my mind off of it but it still required a lot of willpower not to pull over at a gas station and buy some. 

Other than that, I somewhat forced myself to stay home and watch movies and cook a meal so that I wouldn't be tempted to buy some while driving anywhere. I just gotta stay positive and remember that the cravings, though bad now, will lessen and that it's growing pains to making a positive change. 

Continue to wish me luck along with all the other people who want to kick their addiction!

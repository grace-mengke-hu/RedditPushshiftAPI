I want to quit smoking, but I get really agressive when I try.

Hello people, 

I want to try and quit smoking again. Every relatively succesful attempt was after having the flu, and not having nicotine cravings for about a week. I skipped the hard part that way. 

When I try it without having the flu, I don't just get agitated or cranky, but I get really,  REALLY,  agressive. It's so bad, I get violent. I currently work full time at a customer service job, so I can't be agressive at all. I do have  2 week holiday coming up in a week. I see that as a good chance to try and quit again. I can be agressive without anyone being bothered by it. 

Anyways, I'm still wondering if other people got agressive in the first week or so. And if so, how do you get rid of the "aggresiveness".

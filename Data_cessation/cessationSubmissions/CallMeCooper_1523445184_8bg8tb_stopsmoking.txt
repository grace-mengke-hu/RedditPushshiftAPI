You always have something to feel good about

I'm three weeks into my quit! I'm so happy about it. Haven't so much as touched a cigarette for the longest time since I started smoking years ago, and I'm so proud of myself.

Which brings me to this thing I realised: as someone who's very self-critical (which I'm sure many people can relate to), quitting has had an interesting side effect. I always have something to be proud of, to feel good about myself for. 

Even if I'm having a shitty day where I forget something important or miss a deadline, I just watch the timer on my smoke free app slowly tick on and I smile to myself. I think 'Well, you might gave done something pretty stupid today, but hey, remember how you quit smoking? That's still kind of amazing!' 

It's something I did myself, and something no one can take away from me (not even my own hypercritical brain). And that's a really nice feeling :)

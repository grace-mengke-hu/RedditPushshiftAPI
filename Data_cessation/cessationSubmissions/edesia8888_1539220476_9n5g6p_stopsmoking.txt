I have one more ciggarette left.

After 2 years of procastinating a promise i made to my fiance, and almost 8 years of smoking ive finally decided to (try) end it.

Ive got one smoke left, were going to dinner. Im gonna smoke it afterward and then thats it. 

I smoke because i enjoy the feeling, and the actual action of smoking itself. Even the taste i love. So this is going to be hard for me. But im going to do my damndest.

Ive already downloaded the tracker app and set it to start in 2 hours.

Anyone have any tips for when i get the cravings?

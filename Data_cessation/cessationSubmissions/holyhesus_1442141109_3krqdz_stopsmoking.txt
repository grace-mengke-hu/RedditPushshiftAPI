I am starting to doubt quiting is possible.

I have been really wanting to quit especially since I start a great new job no one wants to be the ashtray smelling new person. 

These past few weeks/months have been the worst smoking periods of my life. I sent to smoking 1-2 a day to 5-6-7 a day or more especially when I go out. I just need to hear that it's possible and maybe any sort of anxiety response alternatives.

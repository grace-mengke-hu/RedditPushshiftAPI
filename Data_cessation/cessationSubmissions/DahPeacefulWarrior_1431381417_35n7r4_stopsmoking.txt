130 days: Some insight

Greetings everyone. I'm on my 130th day, I wanted to share something.

My strategy, as it worked for my cousin who is smoke free for 4 years, consisted in saying " I'll quit by new year's" on June, and remind myself everyday that I'd quit on January 1st. It has worked and I want to share some insight:

I was checking something about habit building and realized that the key to quit smoking, at least my strategy, consisted in resisting the cue to smoke and feeling satisfied by having done so.

If youn hack your brain to release dopamine, to feel good, because of resisting the urge to smoke, this becomes a new habit and you will succeed.   The mental preparation made it easier to stick to that decision, I had put that idea deep in my mind since July.

Of course one thing is to just resist the urge to smoke. I have to make a strategy to get good habits. But being smoke free is a good start.

May we all be smoke free

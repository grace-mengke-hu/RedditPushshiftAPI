Challenging myself to quit smoking and replace cravings with exercise.

Hey everyone. I've been smoking for 6 years now.  I'm turning 23 in about two months.  I've heard many successful under-25 stories about quitting: My best friend's mom quit at 21 for the man who became her  husband, another acquaintance of mine got injured around 23 and simply ran out while healing up, so he stopped.


I myself am concerned about the effect smoking will have on my outward appearance as I get older.  I take obsessively good care of my face.  I wash & moisturize twice daily, and exfoliate 1-2 times a week.  I'm sure it would show better if I wasn't littering my body with poisonous nicotine and all it's carcinogen friends.


Also, my lungs are starting to take a toll.  I did my favorite hike about  a week ago, and I couldn't make it all the way up the mountain!  Not good.  Also, this has been going on for about 2 years but I have a constant cough that comes out, say if, I'm going up some stairs.  Some of my friends notice that I'm the only one who has this crazy smoker's cough, and they'll be like "Yeah purpkush, I knew you were at the door because I heard your cough."  :(


The thing that stands most in the way of my progress here is getting angry and driving. Driving and smoking is a huge habit. No other time in the day do I ever feel like smoking except when I am driving.


I'm getting pretty tired of writing now (lol), but I will say this:  If I start to get pissy, I'm using the gym to go work it off.  This should be good for my progress.  



Any other advice from those who have succeeded would be most certainly helpful.  THANKS!! And good luck to all.

Day 16, feel amazing, but hope I can stay strong now that I'm back in China.

Went to visit family for Christmas and haven't smoked for 16 days. Can I have a badge? It was very easy but I have returned to China where smoking is very prevalent and people can smoke in most buildings. The real test will be when I share some drinks with my friends who smoke. EDIT: drinks not drugs!!!!!!

Quit smoking, but now shortness of breath?

Hey guys, I just now quit smoking (2 days in), and this has been happening for a while now (even when I was smoking). Basically, I feel like I can't get enough air in my lungs, so I sometimes have to yawn in order to "catch" my breath. My chest also feels tight, especially at night. I don't understand, I only smoked for roughly 7 months (2-5 a day), and I'm only 21, but I don't know.

Have I already caused permanent damage?? Or is this normal?

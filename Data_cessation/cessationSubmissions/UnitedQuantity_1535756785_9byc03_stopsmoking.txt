I'M E**FFING READY AND IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY. (all advice is appreciated)

I'm not starting tomorrow I'm starting NOW. Anything you can tell me about experience when it comes to cleansing would be appreciated. Are lung exercises a thing? How much money have you saved by not smoking? What have you done with the extra NONSMOKING time you've SAVED! Has anyone attacked this without getting fatter?

First Day and I NEED advice please!

The very last puff I had of a cig was at 11:20 P.M last night and now it is 8:20 P.M. CST. So 21 hours ago and now I'm craving a cig so bad. My chest feels like it's tightening up (like it normally does when its been too long without at least half a cigarette) and it won't stop. It was coming and going today after I woke up but now it just won't stop. There are cigarettes in my car but I'm trying so hard to beat this and not give in but I don't know if my will power is strong enough, please can someone give me some advice on how to beat this before I lose the battle.

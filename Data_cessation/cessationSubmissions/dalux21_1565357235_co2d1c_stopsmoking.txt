Walking on an oil Paddle

That's how I feel... I've been a happy non-smoker for the past 4.5 months and 2 days ago I was drunk with a friend and smoked 2 of his cigarettes.

I know very well how dangerous is to just have another puff and the day after for some reason I felt a strong withdrawal pang and smoked one while sober when no one was aroudn to notice.

I just found a rollie in my house and no one was around and smoked it. I feel like I'm walking on an oil paddle. I'm still standing but I know I might slip and this little relapse could make me have another one tomorrow and then be a smoker again in a week's time. I need help to stay strong, how have you succesfully dealt with this kind of situation? I DO NOT WANT TO FALL INTO THE TRAP AGAIN, NO MATTER WHAT but you all know how difficult it is to be rational as an addict to the strongest drug.

Any help or support is appreciated, I have a feeling of doom and that the next 2 weeks might be a disaster and turn me into a smoker again. I used to smoke 10 a day and really don't want to go back there :(

Anybody else quit with Wellbutrin?

I am over a week smoke free after using Wellbutrin to quit. My experience using it to quit was pretty awesome. The first week or so that I was supposed to quit I'd smoke like every other day. I think subconsciously I didn't want to quit and once I hit three days without, I knew I'd have to be done or I never would be. 

Once I hit that three day point it's actually been really easy. Saturday is the last day of my medication and I was wondering if anybody had cravings come back when not taking the pills.  I'll be a little under two weeks nicotine free by then. Should I call my doctor and ask for another months prescription or will my feelings and thoughts stay the same?

I have made the decision to quit, forever.

Two months ago, I traveled to a foreign land as vaper of two years, preceded by six years of smoking. Here, it is impossible to find vape juice. I told myself I would just quit, but within a week I found myself back up to a pack of cigarettes a day. 

As of right now, it is 1am my time. Earlier today, I subscribed to this subreddit after endless lurking. Many people have suggested I read Allen Carr’s “The Easy Way to Stop Smoking,” and today I finally did. I just finished reading it, then emptied my pack and properly destroyed each cigarette before throwing them into the trash. 

I am excited to embark on this journey of health and happiness, and take solace in the fact that I have a wonderful community here to support me. 

Thank you all.

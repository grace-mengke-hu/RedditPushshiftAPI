For those who battle with anxiety/depression and successfully quit, did you notice any positive changes?

I have really bad anxiety and bipolar depression. I've been smoking since I was 15. 

I was curious as to those who also deal with related mental issues noticed any benefits in regards to your anxiety levels and depression. 

Did they become less overwhelming? Was there any decrease in your symptoms involving anxiety/depression? 

Thank you.

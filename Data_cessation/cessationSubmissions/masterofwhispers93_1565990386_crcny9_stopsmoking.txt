I hate cigarettes but I am madly in love with them.

I've been smoking on and off for a little under ten years. What's discouraging me is that I can always quit for a breif period maybe a week or two sometimes even a couple of months but I always find myself going back to those little basterds. It's hard to convince myself to try to quit when my track record indicates I'll just do well for a bit and go right back. I hate that I smoke, my parents don't even know because I'm honestly ashamed for falling victim to the nicotine monster. Basically, I need tips for not just quitting nicotine but to not love smoking anymore. How do I make myself hate cigarettes? Tell me stories so intensly horrible and disgusting that I'll run from a cigarette...

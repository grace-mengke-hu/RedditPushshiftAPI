Wife is hiding her smoking from me

Hi, it was a mammoth task to get my wife to stop smoking while she was pregnant. After I insisted she stop, she simply began hiding it from me. In vitro, the doppler showed the fetus was smaller than it should have been, which scared her into quitting for a while. She was a heavy smoker, in excess of a pack a day. Now that we have had our child I am smelling the latent cigarette smoke on my wife's hair and on her clothing again, among other behaviors that make me suspicious she's started again. I love my wife, but I don't want cigarettes around our child, and I want her to have a long life in good health. What should I do?

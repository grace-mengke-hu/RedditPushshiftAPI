Going to try again

I have tried multiple times. Did for 8 months, then 1.5 months. This time I waited a few days, got cigarettes no problem. I set a quit date for friday, but I'm going to go ahead and just quit now. I gave my cigs to my neighbor, even though I had just bought a pack.

Major reasons are financial and the disgust with it. I never have enough to make it last til I get paid. I know there's other options but I really want to do away with it all like I have been trying. The other reason is because it's so friggin nasty. The taste in your mouth just because you're trying to scratch an itch. And the smell! I remember being off for 8 months, no smell is a great feeling. Plus I go to a meditation center usually sundays, so it makes me feel bad that other nonsmokers have to put up with my cigarette smell in a room for 3 hours. No one says anything, but I know. A lot of people there are into organics and stuff (which I really don't believe), and I know they see it.

I have nicotine patches that were prescribed to me, so I'm going to take advantage of them. Last time I was successful for a little bit. I had the patch on for three or four days, which the first two days is usually the hardest for me. I took it off and I made it four days, but I was around a lot of second hand smoke one day and caved.

So here's to quitting for good :)! I want to be free of this crap and no longer have to spend my money on cigs. My contract with my Sprint tablet is up, so that gives me a free forty dollars also when it gets cancelled. That was what I absolutely loved about being off nicotine, a 2 or 3 dollar coffee at Starbucks every morning and maybe a newspaper. It was truly a great life for a while!

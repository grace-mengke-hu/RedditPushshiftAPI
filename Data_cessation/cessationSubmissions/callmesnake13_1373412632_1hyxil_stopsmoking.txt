Want to try quitting, can anyone help with my triggers?

I've smoked roughly a pack a day for about fifteen years. I live in NYC where they are $11. I am turning 31. It is clearly time to quit. Here are the big stumbling blocks for me:

- Work. I work from home and work anxiety drives me to smoke. If I only smoke outside I smoke less, but am far less productive. If I smoke inside I smoke more, but am much more productive

- Talking on the phone. I IMMEDIATELY want to smoke. 

- The classic "after a meal"

- Going out. I periodically get really agitated and want a break from the bar/small talk or whatever to smoke. 

Any advice on how to cope with those? I've tried patches and e-cigarettes, and read 3/4ths of the "Easy Way" before putting it down and never going back to it. Would it be worthwhile to try reading it again?

Any and all advice is helpful. I've got willpower everywhere else but completely abandon it to cigarettes - cigarettes are sort of my coping method for everything else in what is honestly a pretty stressful, anxiety filled life that I live.

First non-smoking dream!

I see all the recent dream posts, and I thought I'd share last nights dream victory!

I've had periodic smoking dreams since I quit, but last night was the first one in which I confidently and without hesitation turned down a lit cigarette. 

Awake I wouldn't even consider smoking ever again, I am a non smoker. (Less than a month until my first birthday!). Apparently dream me is starting to get the hint too!

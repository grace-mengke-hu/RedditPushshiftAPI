Review of Thomas Hall stop smoking sleep hypnosis: No. Just, no.

I forget what sent me down this rabbit hole yesterday but I discovered a bunch of YouTube smoking hypnosis videos, including one that’s eight hours long and you’re supposed to play it while you sleep. I’m not really the hypnosis type but in the spirit of trying new things and keeping an open mind, since my quit date is tomorrow I figured I’d try it out last night... 

All I got out of it was a very bad mood this morning because I was woken up repeatedly throughout the night by a guy mumbling “you do not want to smoke.”. Haha! 😂😂😂

I didn’t have overly high expectations but as always when you read the reviews on the internet everyone speaks in hyperbole. Welp, good thing I wasn’t relying on that for my quit plan, and also good thing I did it last night instead of the night before my actual quit, because I’m so tired and grumpy today that it would have made for an unnecessarily nasty first day smoke-free... oh well it was worth a try! 😂😂

No smoking and I'm 5 Days in...

The cravings are there but not nearly as bad as they had been in the past, when I've tried to quit. Always promising myself one smoke if I make it to a certain timeline...not a smart move at all! I finally realized that I have addictive tendencies and I was only setting myself up for failure. 
This time is different...I feel more confident and I am focusing on getting healthier for me. SOOOO maybe the addictive part will kick in with getting healthier.

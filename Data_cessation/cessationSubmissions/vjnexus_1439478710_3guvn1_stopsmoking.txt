Almost caved last night - powered through it

Last night was rough. I have been smoke free for 12-13 days now, but used some gum to get through the first week. Started at 8-10 pieces of 2mg gum, and have been actively trying to cut it out now as well. Yesterday I got through the day on 2 pieces... Until about 10pm. The cravings hit really hard. Like can't focus on anything else hard. I was pacing like a maniac and kept seeing my roommates rolling tobacco on the table. It was so hard to resist, but I did it. I'm not going to come this far just to cave like that. I did cave to another piece of gum, and for that I'm pretty upset. Haven't had any gum today so far. Going to try to keep it to 1-2 pieces today. The goal is to cut the gum by the weekend, and power through the weekend nicotine free which I know will be tough. Wish me luck!

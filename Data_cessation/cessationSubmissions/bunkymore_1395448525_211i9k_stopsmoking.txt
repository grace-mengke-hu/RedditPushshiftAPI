The final ritual, last cig

I'm back. I quit for a bit and have been smoking again for the last 6 months. Just read Easy Way again and am feeling very excited to smoke my last cigarette tonight. I feel like absolute shit since I started smoking again. I wanted to share this, that I'm done, I'm free tonight after this last one. I'm finally gonna be free from this self imposed hell. Just claiming my space as a new non smoker. So thankful for this forum.

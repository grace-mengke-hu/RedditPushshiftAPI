Looking for a quit coach/accountability buddy

Hi all,
I’m looking for a quit coach/buddy to make sure I maintain proper mindset and stick to my word. The transition from a strong "I can do this" mentality to "I will do this later, I'm not prepared" is nefariously subtle and I’m looking for somebody to check in with periodically to make sure I’m in the right mindset.

The first 3 days I would check-in every couple of hours with a text/email/reddit PM about how I’m doing. If I’m not doing well, you point me to my written up quit-guide which will include reasons for quitting, common triggers and stress points and coping strategies. I’m hoping just by checking in will force me to stay conscious of them. After a few days we can reevaluate how frequently to check in. 

Most importantly I agree that I will message you before I have a cigarette. I think messaging someone will force me to justify my decision, and that that will make me think longer and harder about it.

Edit: I'll update this post when I find someone. Right now I'm still looking

Any takers? Thoughts/suggestions/recommendations? My in-progress quit plan can be found [here](http://pasted.co/05616757)

I use the terms “smoking” and “cigarettes” but really right now I’m quitting vaping, which I fell into after having quit cigarettes for over a year previously. For me the addiction is the same and cutting down has never worked.

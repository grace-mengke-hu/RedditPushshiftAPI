Job News Struggle

Ugh.

Was going to have a very real convo with my manager about my job that could've gone either way (real good, real not good), and was really close to breaking.

HAD that convo and it ended up being another punt to real decisions until next week. Still feeling that closeness to breaking but I know it will pass.

It's the first real test of getting past that immediate "satisfaction" of a smoke when in a stressful situation. No. Will not. Overcoming this one will mean a lot.

I'm walking to go get some pizza. Thank you. Love. Bye.

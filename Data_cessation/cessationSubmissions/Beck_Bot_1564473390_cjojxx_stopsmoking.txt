AHHHH! I could use some motivational help!

Hello all!

I'm on day 10 and finding my cravings going back to how high they were on day 3. I think a big part of the problem was that in the first week I was really motivated to just make it through to day 7, 1 week. It's not working the same to say to myself "make it to day 14". 

Any words of advice? 

Thanks!

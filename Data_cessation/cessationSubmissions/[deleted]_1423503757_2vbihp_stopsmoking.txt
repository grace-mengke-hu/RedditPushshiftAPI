Today is the day I quit forever.

I started smoking about two years ago when I went through my first break up.  I continued to smoke because my best friend and the man I'm with now both smoke which made it convenient. 

After two years of coughing, asthma attacks,  chest pain,  coughing up nasty mucus I'm done.  My jaw recently became locked and all smoke does is irritate the shit out of me.  

The hardest part is saying no to sharing smokes with my boyfriend but I love him and would rather spend many more years with him then to succumb to cancer or emphysema. 

4 hours marks the spot right now since when I had my last cigarette. 

I'm green only now guys.  

Woo!!

7days.

Hey, i relapsed 8months ago from my first "serious" attempt which lasted 6months.

So far no struggle, i had flu for few days which helped i think, but in the time i was even outside and i was waiting for craving to come, but nothing happened though. I did have a dream about smoking today, i didnt want to light up, i knew i dont smoke, but still i did. I wonder if i can manage to win a battle in the dream.

However, this sub is always amazing, i hope you are well.

Post your #1 reason for quitting.

I had a family friend get diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in April 2015 and was given 9 months to live. He died July 13th about 3 months after the diagnosis. He got me into playing guitar when I was younger, and was an awesome dude all around. Since he passed I have been playing more guitar than ever, and just really want to improve my health for the long haul. I think that was my spark this time.

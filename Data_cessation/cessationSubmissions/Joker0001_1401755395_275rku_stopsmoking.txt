Have to be honest: Square One

Was going on my 3rd day of no smoking, and it was my first day back at work since quitting. Throughout the workday, I started getting the sick pangs in my stomach. I held in there, telling myself it'd get better. I made it through lunch, still feeling sick.

Before getting off work, I was feeling really ill. As soon as I got off work, I headed straight to the smoke shop. I bought one Black & Mild. Had 3 puffs and threw the rest away. 

I need to reset my badge, and never stop quitting. I feel like I needed somewhere to be honest.

Angry day!

Hello All
Ok, got to have a little vent. Today I don't want to smoke. But the addict in my head is being very cunning. Everything and I mean everything that is going wrong today or the stupid people I am dealing with at work or the email that bounced back. Is giving me the hump. To be honest I woke up in a bad mood. But the demon is insisting that everything would be easier to handle and my mood would improve if I have a cigarette. Just typing it and re reading is making it sound insane. And making me feel better. But temper is short today. Another thing I keep reminding myself is that I had short temper days when I smoked. So it WILL NOT make any difference if I did smoke. In fact it would make me feel worse, because of the disappointment. Then I would be disappointed in myself and grumpy. Sod it lets just be grumpy!

Long time lurker, finally starting!!!

I smoked from the age of 17 until I was 27 and had a nice break for about 7 years and then started back up, it's been another 7 years and I'm tired of it!  I'm tired of the shortness in breathe.  The stinking clothes.  The stigma from everyone around me.  I'm tired of my kids being sad about me smoking...  
I'm on day 6 of the Chantix.  I'm feeling better, feel like I dont really need them, have even gone out on a smoke break with a smoker and DIDNT smoke!  So I feel like it's working.  I just couldn't do cold turkey, I tried and tried.  I read Allen Carrs book and I tried...  
I've been reading and reading about peoples stories here, getting encouragement and am finally ready to go!  The Chantix has been giving me vivid dreams, to say the least, but I'm excited about being done.  Two more days and it's gone!!!  Thank you everyone for being here, I'll need the support!!

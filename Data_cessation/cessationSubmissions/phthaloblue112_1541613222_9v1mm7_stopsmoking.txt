How to deal with work?

So I made it two days over the weekend and was surprised to find that if I kept myself busy, not smoking was not too difficult. However, woke up Monday morning and was bawling before I even left the house—I knew I was going to cave at work. And sure enough, I did. My job does not keep me very busy and I spend a lot of the day sitting and waiting for my break. Has anyone else experienced this? I cannot wrap my head around not smoking at work...help! I’m not even enjoying the cigarettes I’m smoking, and I feel terrible for slipping up.

Been three weeks and I’m Jones’n baddddd

Hi everyone! First of all this subreddit is amazing and so positive, so thank you all for being encouraging! It’s been three weeks without a cig and 1.5 without the patch and the past few days seem the toughest. I have been pretty depressed and weepy and sensitive. I have problems with PTSD, depression and anxiety, so I knew this would be an issue when I quit. I just feel like it’s a never ending marathon of feeling shitty and sad and I’m trying to just keep on keepin’ on but god I’m so tired of feeling like shit. Anyone stuffer from mental illness quit? Was it hard? Most people I know irl don’t seem to understand how quitting smoking can trigger these mental states... 

Anyway, I’m contemplating just getting a pack and giving up just for some relief but thought I’d try to post here first

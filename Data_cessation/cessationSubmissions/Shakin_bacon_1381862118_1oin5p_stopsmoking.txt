Second Hand Smoke and a Proud Accomplishment.

It was Thanksgiving in Canada this weekend, and my boyfriend and I went to my parents house for dinner. My mom goes to bed early, so after she went to bed, my boyfriend and my dad smoked a few cigarettes together while I hung out with them. My dad is a full-time smoker, while my boyfriend smokes when he drinks. I didn't smoke, nor did I want one, but they had quite a few. Once we left my parents house, I had a sick feeling in my stomach, like how I would have felt before when I had smoked too much in a day. I also had a sore throat the next day, and feel fine now. Is this what the effects of second hand smoke are like? 

Also, I started running a month before I quit, and a month after I quit, I ran a mile. A continuous non-stop mile. I have never been so overwhelmed with emotion at the gym in my life. I legitimately wanted to start crying. I had the biggest shit-eating grin on my face. I can't wait to see what else my body can do now that I am working on turning my black lungs into pink lungs :)

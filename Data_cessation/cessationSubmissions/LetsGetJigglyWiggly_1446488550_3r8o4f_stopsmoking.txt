Tips to quit smoking?

So I've been smoking since I was 14 (now 20) I quit last year and two weeks after I quit I found out I was pregnant and remained quit. My boyfriend and I moved back to our home town before baby was born and had to live with my parents until our house was ready to move in. About a month in the stress was too much and I started smoking again. Now that winter is here I am not going to stand outside in -40 weather to feed my habit and I want to try and quit again. My boyfriend works away during the week so it's just me looking after baby with my mom coming to visit every once in a while so I get pretty stressed.  Any advice on how to deal with the stress and keep quit?

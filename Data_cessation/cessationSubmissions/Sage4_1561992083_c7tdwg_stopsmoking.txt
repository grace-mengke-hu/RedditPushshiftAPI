Want to start quitting. Not sure how I can.

I'm a cook. One of the main reasons I want to quit is I know smoking messes with my taste buds. It's a very competitive industry and I hate that some stupid like smoking inhibits my abilities. On top of that a lot of restaurants wont let you go out for smoke during shift and trying to work a long shift without a cigarette drives me crazy. I want to be done with it. But everywhere I go there's people that smoke. At work, at home with my roommates. I know quitting is supposed to be a personal journey but it being in my face all the time and the stress of the industry cripples my desire to quit. Anyone else been through this kind of situation and have advice?

On day 2!

I’m really excited that I’m on day 2 after being a daily smoker for nearly 10 years (I’m 24). I’m using nicotine gum but only about 2-3 pieces a day because well, it’s awful. I’m starting to get headaches and overall kind of fell like shit so if y’all have any encouragement or hope that this is over soon I’ll take it.

Neighbor below me is driving me crazy and I need to rant

It's not often, but on very cold nights, the neighbor below me smokes without opening their window to ventilate their apartment and all I can smell is cigarettes. Tonight is one of those nights. I'm also bored out of my mind, which is one of the catalysts that used to get me to smoke.

No risk of me starting back up, but just a reminder that you can never let your guard down. And some times the temptation just exists for whatever reason the human brain wants to rationalize with.

It's close to zero degrees F outside right now, so I don't blame them, but holy hell I would love to have a cigarette right now just because that's all I've smelled for the last 5 hours.

To all of those just starting on the journey, keep at it. It's worth it, believe me. I'm just venting to the only place that I know that will understand what I'm going through right now -- even if it is minor and because I"m bored and should be sleeping anyways. It's a rare occurrence, and the last time this happened was Polar Vortex 1 when it got down to zero F outside too. Before that I don't remember when, probably the first couple of weeks when I quit.

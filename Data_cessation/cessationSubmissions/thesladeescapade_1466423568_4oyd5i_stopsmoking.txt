Exchanging time for money and then paying for less time

I had a realization this morning that has me more motivated than ever to quit smoking, and the realization is as follows:

I spend my time working so that I can earn money so that I can afford cigarettes that decrease my overall lifespan, and I smoke cigarettes due to stress (mainly) caused by working. This is a vicious cycle, where I'm working and smoking just so that I can keep on working and smoking.

It reminds me of an Alan Watts recording where he explains that people nowadays are raising their kids just to give them everything that they never had, and then their kids are raising more kids just to give them what they never had, and this cycle repeats endlessly with nobody really getting what they want, constantly displacing their own satisfaction/fulfillment. 

This is all a little convoluted but it has helped me understand that there is going to be no end unless I make one. It's just going to keep on spiraling and spiraling. Here I was waiting for some sort of sign, some sort of enlightenment, some sort of reason... but in the end I had everything that I needed. Funny how often you find that you already have what you're looking for; it just needs some work.

Good luck to you all!

just realized that I smoke cigarettes to hold myself back

Happened this morning in hot yoga... I was having trouble breathing and tried to focus on my intention (don't hold back) and it just dawned on me. I like holding myself back and cigarettes are the perfect physical representation of that. I'm not sure if this awareness will effect my smoking habit, but I'd like to think it's all I really need.. I don't know, just thought I'd share this. Hope everyone finds what works for them. Cheers.

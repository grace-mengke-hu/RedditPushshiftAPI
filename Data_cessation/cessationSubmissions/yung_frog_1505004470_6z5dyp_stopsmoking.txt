Nearly a week in. Have a quick question.

So, I quit smoking cigarettes after smoking from 18-22, averaging 3/4 of a pack every day. I'm 6 days in now. Starting on the second day, I developed quite a cough. Occasionally I cough up yellowish mucous. I also cannot do the physical activity I could when I DID smoke. Is this normal?

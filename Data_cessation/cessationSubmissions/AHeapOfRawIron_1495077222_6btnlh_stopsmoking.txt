I started again a couple years ago after having quit for four years. Feel hopeless.

I quit when I was 21 and started again roughly around 25 or 26 years old. I am 28 now. It just feels hopeless to quit. I feel so totally dejected after thinking about how well I did and so disappointed that I started again. I honestly have not had this much trouble quitting ever.

Day 1: And I take my first few steps into the cave to slay the beast.

Alright I'm ready. I been smoking for 8 years and am sick and tired of being trapped to these fucking things. I wake up every morning and cough my lungs out until I spit some nasty looking phlemy shit. I can't even walk up a single flight of stairs without feeling like I'm going to pass out. I'm pretty sure its cost me more money over time on cigarettes than my divorce and obtaining custody of my son (which is expensive for a dude to do) combined. It was a factor in losing my GF. If for anyone I have to do it for my two little dudes. It crushes me when my 5 year old tells me "fawder (both my kids call me father, by choice I don't even know where they got it from) stop smoking, no more cigawets" and my 3 year old associates going outside to play with smoking cigarettes "fawder smoke a cigawet" as he's walking to the door. Above all they will be my motivation, along with this sub which has made me feel more positive about quitting than ever. I have always tried and failed within hours of waking up. Instead of looking ahead I will do this one day at a time now. Thank you for giving me the courage to break free from this terrible, disgusting, poison, cancer causing sticks with you stories of success. It really has sparked a flame in me to get this done for my kids and myself. 

**UPDATE** Didnt make it "/ got faced with a stressful situation that was too unbearable and I cracked like a whores legs on penny pussy Fridays. Tomorrow I will make sure I am successful let the past stay in the past and live and let live I won't let another person dictate my success. Lesson learned

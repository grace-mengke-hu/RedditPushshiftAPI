Should have been my one year yesterday.

Instead, I chose to spend the weekend leading up to my anniversary chain smoking with old college friends on a visit back to campus. It doesn't feel great but I've realized a few things. First, it's difficult to be a changed person when you are in a familiar place with lots of old triggers. Fact is, I can't be the person I was then. I also don't want to be. Recognizing that makes this slip up less devastating. Which leads me to the thought that hey, I didn't go 365 days without smoking, but I did go 360. That's still notable, that's still a significant favor I did to my body and health. 

I'm not proud, but I was able to stop when I got home. I had bought my own pack and I let my roommate destroy each remaining butt. This experience makes me think of a poem that I've found to be helpful whenever trying to make a real change in life. [There's a Hole in My Sidewalk](http://mymeditativemoments.com/realization-for-change/). 

So, fellow cessation artists, or quitters-to-be, I wish you luck on not only avoiding the same holes you've been falling into, but on taking a different street entirely. And also, be proud of all your attempts to quit. You're trying, and you will get there!

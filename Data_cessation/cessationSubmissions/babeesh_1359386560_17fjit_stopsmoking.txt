Wish to quit smoking, any helpful advice?

I've been smoking cigarettes a little under a year. I picked them up while in Istanbul; they were very cheap and the crowd of friends I had all smoked. I am back in the states now and I wish to quit smoking. It's been very stressful being back in the states with moving and re-situating. Any helpful and friendly advice will be most appreciated.

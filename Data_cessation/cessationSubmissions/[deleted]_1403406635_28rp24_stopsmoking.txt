Writer's Block

Hey, guys! I just found this sub, and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did. I'm four days into my quit, and I just hit my first wall. I quit using the Easyway, and I've had tremendous luck with it so far. That said, my creative life seems to have taken a hit. Whenever I used to write, I would smoke, steamrolling through entire packs. It broke up my writing sessions, and it gave my mind a chance to wander. Now that I don't smoke, I find myself feeling...lost. I'm staring at my cursor now, waiting for the words to come, and I find myself thinking about smoking, about how easy it would make things, and all I want to do is cry. I know I won't smoke, because I don't want to, but I'm also afraid: What if I've lost it? What if I can't write anymore?

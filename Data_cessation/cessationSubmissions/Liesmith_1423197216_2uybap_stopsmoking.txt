Afraid to quit as I've just also developed anxiety

So, around October I had my first panic attack, spent 4 hours thinking I was dying off and on. Then in December I had 4 of the fuckers. Tossed my cigs after the third one because I thought they might be triggering it. But, fell off the wagon again after it happened real bad after 4 days quitting. Today was the first day in a month where I barely worried about anxiety or a panic attack coming on. Reading around sounds like quitting again has a high likelihood of triggering anxiety and panic attacks during withdrawal, I really can't deal with that happening right now though I do want to quit. Do I just wait until I can take time off from work? Until after I finally see a therapist (waiting for insurance card in the mail)?

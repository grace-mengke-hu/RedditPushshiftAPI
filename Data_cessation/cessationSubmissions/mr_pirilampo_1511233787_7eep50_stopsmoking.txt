A new journey

As the title says I will start a new journey to stop smoking. 

I tried a lot of times this year but I failed. So this time I decided to do something different. I wanted to stop smoking with a group of people to be easier to keep us motivated so we do not fail. Anyone wants to join me? 

I’ll start a personal journal where I will register all the changes that I feel related to the lack of nicotine and cigarettes (positive and negative).

Anyone that wants to join me send me a PM. If there are many people that want to start the same day/way that I will I’ll create a chat that we can talk and conquer this objective.

I’ll smoke my last cigarette today at noon (London time).

Join me :)

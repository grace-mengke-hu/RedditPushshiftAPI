Is Blurry Vision a side effect?

Hi All! 33 hours and counting.  
I've always had excellent eyesight, but since I stopped smoking I've had blurry vision and am having to screw up my eyes to read.   
Has anyone else had this, and if so when did it stop? I've tried googling an answer but different places are saying different things

EDIT: By blurry I mean as meatbulbz describes below...

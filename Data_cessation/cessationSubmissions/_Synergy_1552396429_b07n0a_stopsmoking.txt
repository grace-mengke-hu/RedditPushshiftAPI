My Experience

Hello, everyone!

I just wanted to share my journey/struggle with you guys in case anyone here is close to relapsing.

I had, after a lot of struggling, quit for 6.5 months. I was very proud of myself. Truthfully, I never noticed how much better I felt so it made the joy of quitting fade away to a point where I was fantasizing over smoking. I even told a friend of mine "I feel like I'm one really bad day away from smoking again".

Low and behold, I had big troubles in my marriage and on December 16 at 4:45AM I bought a pack of cigarettes and threw it away. It took me a month but I was able to stop smoking for a month again.

Then I did what I always do and gave up recently and smoked again. Now, I'm sitting here about to have my last and final cigarette because my heart has been absolutely racing the last few days of smoking.

My point is, that feeling of having a cigarette you've been craving is NOT worth it. Stay strong. Whether you are a year, a month, a day or even a minute. I am here for support for anyone who needs it. I am NOT giving up on myself this time.

Thanks for reading.

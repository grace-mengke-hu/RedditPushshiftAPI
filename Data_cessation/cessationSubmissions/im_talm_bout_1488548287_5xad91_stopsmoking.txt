Any other stop smoking literature along the same lines as Easyway by Allen Carr?

I just finished reading "Stop Smoking the Easyway" and it's really changed the way that I think about cigarettes. I'm going to follow his advice, and reference back to the book every once in a while to keep the thought process fresh in my mind. I was also wondering if you guys have any stop smoking books that you would like to recommend along the same lines as Carr's.

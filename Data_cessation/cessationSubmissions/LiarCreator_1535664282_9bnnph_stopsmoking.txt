I want to quit but I don't know How

I am 22yo and have been smoking since January, at first I used to smoke on parties or with some friends, but then I got back in the college and start smoking with my friends more often, then one day I just bought a pack and it last for almost a week, but then I start having 8-10 cigarettes a day and sometimes 15-20, today I want to quit, but I don't know how to start, I really like smoking, that makes it harder, I don't feel anxiety or anything, I just buy them when I'm bored, even without noticing that, everyday I'm having 8+ cigarettes. I really need an advice.

Despite being resilient and f*** at all pubs, bars, and clubs, last night I had a roll-up at a friends party....

So... I've been doing well. Like... really well. Not even thinking about smoking. Even when out at bars and pubs, I've not had any trouble with not having a cigarette. However, last night, when I arrived at a friends house party, all I could think about was cigarettes.

So yeah... I smoked a roll-up.. didn't 'enjoy' it any where near as much as I thought I would. 

I've woken up, and feel really disappointed, and am pretty anxious because I don't want there to be a 'nicotine craving'. I'm going to the gym and I'm going to work out to fuck as punishment.

I'm not having one again. Ever.

While not smoking, I am two days Juul free.

I did smoke cigarettes here and there but never developed a fixation on it. Vaping, on the other hand, had me for a bit.

That said, kicked that habit as well. Something about it made me feel...off. So much so that I realized that it was no longer worth it.

Struggling :(

First quit around two years ago and was clean for 6 months but then gave in for just one cigarette. Since then, have tried quitting multiple times but can't go beyond a week :(

Going right now through a stressful work environment and my wife - my biggest motivation - is away for next few months. I know smoking is bad for me and want to quit but can't seem to resist.

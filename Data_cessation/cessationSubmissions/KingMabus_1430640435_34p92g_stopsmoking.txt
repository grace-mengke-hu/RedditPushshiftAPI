Day 28

Hi all.  Its day 28 today. Thought I would join the group to get some support and to offer it to.  I went completely cold turkey after 16 years of smoking and despite it being tough at the start, it's actually getting a whole load easier.  I went bed last night and the last thought that went through my head was "hey dude.....you haven't even thought about smoking today".  Mental......I'm kind of forgetting that smoked.

Having a deeply immersing hobby does help to keep me busy.  (In my case its table top war games, dungeons and dragons, big involving board games, modelling and painting and my 2 kids).   I'm not suggesting anyone becomes a geek like me...but do find something that you love and find interesting.  It stops you being bored and only thinking about smoking.

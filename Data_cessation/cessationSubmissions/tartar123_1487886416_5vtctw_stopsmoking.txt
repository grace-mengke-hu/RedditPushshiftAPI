First post. Been smoking for 10 years.

Been actively smoking for 10 years. I am 22 now. Yeah I started at age 12. It's been between 1 to 10 cigarettes per day. I want to quit but I'm deeply trapped inside my old ways. I'm writing this post as an attempt to escape. 

Why am I quitting? 1. Cigarettes taste like shit. 2 .My body doesn't like it and can't take it anymore - immune system goes out of whack after a smoke. 3. I don't want to be physically dependent on anything. 4. Cigarettes are expensive as fuck around here. Rough estimate of money spent = 2500â‚¬?. Holy fuck that's like a new car. 5. I smell like crap.

How am I going to quit? Making the decision to quit something FOREVER rarely works so I'm aiming at 60 days - the general amount of time to succesfully quit an addiction. The most important question is - What am I going to do during a really stressful moment, when the cravings are at all time high? Nicotine gum, read this subreddit and the good old COLD SHOWER i guess. What do you do? Another thing is WEED. I have to stop weed because using weed automatically makes me smoke tobacco. Weed is another beast but atleast i've succesfully quit that shit for 2 months in the past. Now it's time to quit both. Wish me luck, i'm going to need it.

EDIT: I literally wrote on my pack "X's last pack of cigarettes". Bad choice. Today i got a little drunk (worst trigger ever) and convinced myself "what the hell i can smoke a few as long as i dont smoke them all". This is the last addiction i have yet to conquer in my life and easily the hardest. I have to take this shit seriously. FUCK i didnt even make a single day. Tomorrow i will.

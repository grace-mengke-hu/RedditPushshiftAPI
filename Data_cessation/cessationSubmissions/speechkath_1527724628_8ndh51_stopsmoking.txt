My List of Focus Points

Being a strong and healthy mother to my beautiful girls.

Not dying of a dreadful disease.

If I gain weight, it is temporary, I’ll be able to exercise better so I’ll take it off.

No longer a slave to cigarettes- needing to find somewhere to go to smoke, bad weather, hiding my habit.

Getting out of withdrawal.  When you are addicted you are constantly putting yourself in withdrawal- you have to go through it to get out.

Save money.

Your mind is tricking you.  Don’t let it fool you.

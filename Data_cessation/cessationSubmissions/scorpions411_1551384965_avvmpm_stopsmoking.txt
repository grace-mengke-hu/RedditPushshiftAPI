I relapsed after 4 month

I have no idea what happened. This must be the dumbest decision of my life. I was already a perfectly fine nonsmoker. I believe I wanted to reward myself after getting finishing my university degree. Hell of a reward huh ? I wasn't even craving a cigarette I believe. 
This was more than 2 months ago. Have been smoking since. Sorry I let you guys down. I got back on track yesterday. Withdrawal is kicking in again. But I am also excited to be smoke free again. My body remembers the four month I stayed clean. And I never felt better. This mistake will not happen again.

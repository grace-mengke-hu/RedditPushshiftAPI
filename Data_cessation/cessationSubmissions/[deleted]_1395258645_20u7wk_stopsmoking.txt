Anyone else notice their sense of smell is a little too sensitive after quitting?

Of course the smell of burning cigarettes makes me want to claw out my lungs, but even the lingering scent on my husband's clothes burns my nostrils. I can't eat certain foods, some raw veggies seem too pungent now, raw onions are impossible. I used to enjoy eating fish from time to time, but I can't stomach it at all anymore. From tuna sandwiches to crab cakes to the beer battered junk food that is more deep fried batter than fish, is all hard for me to stomach.

I am very, very happy that I quit smoking, I don't miss it and I definitely do not regret it, but I don't appear to be getting used to this super sense of smell. Does it get better with time?

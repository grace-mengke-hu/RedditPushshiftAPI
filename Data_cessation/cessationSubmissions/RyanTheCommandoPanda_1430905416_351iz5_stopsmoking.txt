Feeling Fuggi'n great!

I post everything with my phone, so I'm not sure how to get a badge and all, but today I'm 21 days in nicotine free after smoking a pack a day for 2.5 years. During this time I have begun taking my martial arts and fitness very seriously. All I can say is.... Wow- this is so night and day, I couldn't do half the drills I can do now, or spar 5 minutes a time with 3 people in succession. Just seeing how much more improved I am over all is enough to make me never want to touch nicotine again. This is more of a "hey you can do it post" but I am kinda humblebragging on my process haha, anyways, guys, if you're thinking of quitting. Do it. If you're on the verge of maybe relapsing, keep this in mind, if you had to run for your life but fell 5 steps short of getting away, just because you couldn't breathe, what will you do? Nothing, you can't, the smoking has put you in a situation where you can't even save your own life. No benefits come from smoking. The sooner you quit, the sooner you can begin to improve your self. These were my causes to quitting and I hope you all find your own. Happy 21 days everyone :)

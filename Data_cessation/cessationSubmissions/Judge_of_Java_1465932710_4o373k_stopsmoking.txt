Opinions on Gum/Patch/Lozenge?

Hello, everyone. I am currently into my 8th day after quitting, and so far it hasn't been too terrible overall. One thing I've been doing is chewing a piece of nicotine gum only when I'm having a really tough craving, or if I'm feeling rather cranky. The directions say to use 1 piece every 1-2 hours the first few weeks, but I don't want to keep pumping nicotine into my system like that. At the same time, I don't want to deal with the harshness of quitting completely cold turkey.

So far, my method has worked out fairly well for me. Just wanted to get some feedback as to whether or not there's a better way to go about this, or if you guys have used NRT to help you quit. If so, what was your experience with it?

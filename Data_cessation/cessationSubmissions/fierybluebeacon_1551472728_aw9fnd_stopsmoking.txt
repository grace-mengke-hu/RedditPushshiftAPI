Warmer weather I associate with smoking is giving me cravings again!

I quit last year just at the end of summer, and now I'm getting on 8 months quit and it's starting to get pretty warm in the UK. But all it's doing is reminding me of spending summer smoking in beer gardens and parks! I've been without any cravings for a few months now, but that bloody sunshine is making me want to crack- anyone else get this or have any advice?

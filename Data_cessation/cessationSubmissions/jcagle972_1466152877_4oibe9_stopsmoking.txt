2 days in, going from Mark Ten to patch.

Hi, everybody! As you'll no doubt see, I'm relatively new to Reddit, and while I'm a seasoned lurker, I've only just started actively participating in most of my lurkstations, Reddit included. This is my first post, so I apologize for any breaches in general protocol, and even after reading the sidebar, I still only vaguely understand the badge system and haven't applied for one.

HOWTHEFUDGEEVER, I haven't had a cigarette in 2 days, but I have been religiously sucking at this ridiculous Mark Ten e-cig I got for free at the bar 6 months ago and never opened. With some financial help from my wonderful mother, I've obtained a box of Step 1 Nicoderm CQ patches, and plan to shave my shoulder forests and begin application tomorrow! I just never truly felt right calling it quitting if I'm still polluting my lungs with another substance, and after years of trying various e-cigs I just feel like I need to buck up and just tell myself NO. Wish me luck everyone! (and good luck to all of you too!)

TL:DR I'm quitting and finally figured I would tell somebody who understands!

Edit 1 - typo

Edit 2 - my Smoke Free app gave me a badge for 50 cigarettes not smoked seconds after I posted this! What I would have done for 50 cigarettes even just a couple days ago...

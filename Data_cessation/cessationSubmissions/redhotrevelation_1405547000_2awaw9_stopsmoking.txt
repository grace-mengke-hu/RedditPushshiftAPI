e-cig/vape question

hey guys
i recently stopped smoking and have been using my vape/hookah pen/e-cig whatever you wanna call it not so much as nicotine replacement (although I am using like 11ml nicotine liquid) but as an occupation for my mouth.
Does anybody know of any negative health effects of vaping/e-cigs?
I am concerned that it might not really help my lung capacity, whether just replacing cigarette smoke with vapor is equally as bad or not? is clearing the toxins from cigarettes slower (carbon monoxide etc?)
any info is appreciated.
approaching the week mark and I PROBABLY could go cold turkey but I would rather not if i run the risk of getting desperate and not having anything to replace it with

I keep forgetting I quit!

This week I find myself walking in to the kitchen and standing at the place that I used to roll my cigs, its only a moment before I realise what I'm doing, I don't recognise a craving just a auto habit kinda thing, I reckon?
It has not been a problem I find it kinda funny.
Anybody else have this

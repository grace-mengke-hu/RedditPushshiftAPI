Stopped Smoking by Accident

Smoked for 35 years.

Was out shopping on Good Friday, passed a stall selling ecigs and letting people try them, tried one, thought 'Thats not too bad', bought a starter kit. 

Smoked 3 fags that weekend, none since. Feel much healthier, don't cough, can ride my bike faster, snore less, don't wake up feeling s**t.

Yes I'm vaping up a storm. still addicted to nicotine, but I'm also addicted to caffeine and riding my bike up hills as fast as I can, but they don't bother me, and neither does being a nicotine user. 

The ecigs are just nicer than stinkies

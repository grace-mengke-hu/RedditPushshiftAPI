How to cope with stress and anxiety while quitting?

Long story short, I've quit before and it caused a lot of issues with my anxiety. I secluded myself to avoid pissing people off while going through withdrawal. 

How do you get through it without being so irritable you want to snap or so scared that you never leave bed?

9 Months and counting.

In April of 2014 I lost my father to lung cancer. The last two years of his life were hell for him, and watching his decline was heartbreaking.

Through all of this I still did not stop smoking 2-2.5 packs a day. After he passed I had a hole the size of a planet in my chest. He was my rock, and made me the man I am today, and now he was gone.

His final lesson was sorrow, and living without him sucks.  I quit about 2 weeks after he died, cold turkey. I have not had a cigarette since.

My suggestion to those trying to quit. Lung cancer sucks. It sucks hard. Movies, books, pictures do not do it justice. Even talking to someone with it might not help. Living around it for years and seeing the toll it takes on the person you love is horrifying. They become a shell of a person, every movement calculated as not to expend too much energy. Towards the end he was at 15 lpm of oxygen and that did not even help.

Do I have cravings from time to time? Yes. But I will not do that to my sons, I want to see their kids grow up.

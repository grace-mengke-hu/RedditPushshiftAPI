Here I go!

I am a long time lurker here and i have been trying to quit on my own several times ,but without success.
I realize now that i need some accountability with this as otherwise i find different excuses to smoke again.
I have been smoking for almost 15 years and this is not how a 29 year old should feel from a physical and mental point of view, there is nothing good that i get from smoking and it is time to quit for good so...wish me luck!

Frustrated, angry, and I can't sleep.

Managed to go 10 hours the other day.  The best I've done in 20 years is #24 hours.

I've done the books. The patch. The gum. The vape. The cold turkey and the pills.

I really want it.  This week.  I ha e no family obligations and plenty of free time so trying ti exercise more and distract myself with video games 

But hot damn I'm angry all the time.  I can't sleep for more than a few hours and cave and head to buy sime smokes.

I'm getting too old for this.  This shit is going to kill me.  I'm going to be an old fucking man with an oxygen tank still smoking.

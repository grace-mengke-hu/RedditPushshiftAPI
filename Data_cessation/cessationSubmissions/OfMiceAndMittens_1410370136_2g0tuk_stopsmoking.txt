Here I go again.

So for a while I was very successful at not smoking. The problem is, that was at university, where I was around smokers a *lot* less. Now that I'm back home, however, I find myself surrounded by people who smoke, and who even offer me cigarettes when I say I don't have any. Even my own dad rolls his own, so there's always that thought when I'm awake and working on something, when everyone else is asleep, that I could sneak down and have one (he doesn't even use filters, which I'm sure makes them *super* bad for me.)

But I had to start doing this someday, so it may as well be today.

I made it through one full week!!

I'm still getting cravings..I think the worst part is the fact I had a.d.d and have to take adderall. That makes it so much harder for me, but this time I am super serious about quitting, Ive done it in the past but had one here and there, this time I actually am doing it without asking for a drag or trying to bum one from a friend..I'm having a craving right now but I made it..I made it through one whole week!!!

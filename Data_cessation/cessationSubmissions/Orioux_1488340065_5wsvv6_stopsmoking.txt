2nd Times a charm

So a few days back I posted something saying how 'this was it' and I was ready to quit smoking. I failed. Bought a pack smoked it all and today has been much, much better. I'm 14h in and about to go to sleep. Thanks to all of you who post your stories on here. They're awesome to read while I'm fiending and pretty much make me forget I was fiending at all! Love you guys, fuck the cigs.

One more hour til the 2 weeks mark...

Wow... the time flew by so fast....!

I am very fortunate, after about a decade of heavy smoking of both tobacco and MJ I expected to go through the worst of terrible withdrawal syndroms. Last year i took a break (a break. no intention to quit) for 3 months from cigs, MJ and alcohol. That one was infinitely harder for me. 

Even the mega-trigger alcohol can't get me to crave a cig at the moment.... that makes me so happy... i'm sorry i sound like a dick for that :(


**To everybody out there struggling**: Please, take some of my willpower! i won't mind! i don't seem to need it right now because my body is handling this on his own apparantly! At least for now! Lend some of my strength, I am there for you! 

FUCK YEAH! Half a month!

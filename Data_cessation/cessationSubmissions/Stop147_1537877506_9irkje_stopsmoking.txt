I WANT TO QUIT SMOKING!!!

Hello, I’ve never done anything like this. I mean, posted about my problems and stuff... But while reading stories I saw how open, believing and helping you are when speaking about the habbit of smoking.
So, I’ve been smoking since 14, I’m 18 now. I always knew how bad it is, but just never wanted to stop, because of my young age... It’s just that I’m healthy, it looks like smoking won’t do anything bad to me. I started in my early teenage years just for fun. It looked really innocent, because I felt cool, found new friends. I feel kinda angry about them, encouraging me to try and start smoking, about believing in them, spending so much time and money to feel cooler, while also getting addicted. But it’s just my past, I’m not friends with them anymore, because almost all girls from that group got pregnant and boys started doing drugs... 
I WANT TO QUIT SMOKING!!!
I didn’t smoke for almost 4 days now.
It only will get worse and worse. I would be very proud if i could stop smoking in this early age.
Thank you for reading my story, I wish someone would respond :)

HUNGRY ALL THE TIME

Why am I so hungry all the time now?  It doesn't seem to be just about having something in my mouth - I feel like I am trading one addiction for another.  This is not something I can afford to do as I am already overweight.  Any thoughts, recommendations and/or personal experiences would be appreciated!

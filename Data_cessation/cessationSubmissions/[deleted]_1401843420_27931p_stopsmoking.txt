I think I've got a chance this time :)

That being said, it was / is a learning curve for me.  It took a dozen or so failed attempts.  Who knows, maybe I'll fail again.  It certainly isn't close to the longest I've gone without smoking.

Thanks to everyone for their knowledge and wisdom on this subreddit though I feel as if I got to where I am today sooner than I would have all on my own.  It just feels... different this time.  Like it's really time.

I guess the reason I really decided to write this is that I feel... with how many comments and links I've saved from this subreddit, it's really helped me.  And I know I've just touched the tip of the iceberg with my floating around for a month or so at a time every time I've tried to quit.

I just feel as if it's a shame all of the good advice and the stories from this subreddit aren't saved somewhere.  Like in a book.  Y'all swear on the EasyWay, but I'm tellin' you...  That's good and all.  But the collective of this subreddit makes the easyway look like some sort of failed 1940's lobotomy strategy.  The pain, the strife, the encouragement, the advice, the stories, the wisdom etc etc. from all that's been posted on here...  Someone needs to CATALOG THAT SHIT!

It's not gonna be me.  I've got a good job.  Hobbies.  A workout regimen.  A girl.  A drinking and watching movies problem. 

But someone... Just fucking do it.  It could be a very lucrative investment of your time.  And it could really help others.  Just a thought.

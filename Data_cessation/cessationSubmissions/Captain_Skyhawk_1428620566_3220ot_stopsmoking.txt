Where are all the magic happy sunshine and roses I was promised?

90 some odd days without cigarettes.  First 60 on the patch, nicotine free for over 30 days now.

When does this get better? I still think about smoking ALL THE TIME. I still hate everything and find myself barely able to cope with the slightest annoyance.  I'm eating constantly and rapidly putting on weight. 

I read through this sub for motivation  and inspiration and I wind up hating all of you.

 "14 days and I feel great!" Fuck you.
"DAE notice how great food tastes?" Fuck you, too. Everything tastes like shit now, all wrong and off.
"Oh, what about the sense of smell!?" Fuck you, too! The world smells like ass, people especially.  I work with the public and holy hell they stink. Body funk and sour onions. 

Seriously  folks, when does this get better? 

I'm not an idiot. There are two double lung transplant recipients in my family. I know the benefits. I can see how much money I'm saving, I understand the reduced risk of everything bad.

What's the point, though, if you're  miserable the whole way through?

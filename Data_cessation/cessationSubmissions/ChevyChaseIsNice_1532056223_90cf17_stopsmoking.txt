Weird symptoms after quitting?

Hey guys!  
So I quit smoking last week, made it to 5 days. I went on a day trip to the lake, smoked half a pack and stopped again. On day 4 now and have some serious health anxiety about possible contracting that brain eating amoeba that enters through your nose. I think I can write off most my symptoms to quitting smoking and anxiety, slight headache yesterday, feeling off balance and foggy, very slight brain tingling sensations. The worst was this morning, I coughed up a yellow ball of mucus or phlegm or something that was the size of a salted peanut, cleared it out of my nasal passage/throat. Been getting heat flashes (don't think they're fevers) but can mostly attribute that to panic attacks.  


My nose has been kinda runny and weird all day and just hoping its not that amoeba digging in there...   
Can quitting smoking make allergies worse?   


I know I sound crazy, just wanted to know what ya'll thought.

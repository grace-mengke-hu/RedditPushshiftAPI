NO AMOUNT OF MOTIVATION IS GONNA HELP WHEN YOUR WILLPOWER RUNS UP. BE PREPARED FOR THE FALL.

I feel like I have a responsibility to this sub. Here's my story. I might be long but I hope it helps someone out there. (TLDR at end)

**Age:** 24 [M]

**How long I smoked:**

I probably smoked two three years. 

**How long since I quit**

SEVEN MONTHS *almost*

**What made me quit**

It was a lot, at least for a relative novice. A pack a day. 

Exams were particularly bad... It was more huffing and puffing than studying. The constant coughing and chest infections didnt help. The smells and disapproval people you love.

*But*

Ultimately it was because every cigarette i smoked was a defeat for me. That I could not control myself. When you smoke a pack a day, theres more tinnitus in there than relief... It was a necessity. A financial burden at that as well. I felt as if i was chained down by this stupid addiction.

There are three types of people in the world. Those who never indulged in smoking. Maybe because they didn't have that rebellious tendencies or too wise to begin with. Those who quit smoking because *they're awesome like that*. And lastly those who just cant stop fucking themselves over and over again.

I didn't wanna associate myself with that group. I didn't want all those people who said that I'm weak willed ... Or that once you start you cant stop...or the doctor who didn't believe i had any hope Or anyone who had zero confidence in me to be proved right.

Ultimately it was a test of character I wasnt willing to fail.

**HOW DID I DO IT?**

I tried to quit a dozen times but never went went more than a week off of it... Most times it was just 2-3 days. I was too impulsive. I would steal from brother if the I had the urge.

I tried an app that slowly reduces your daily count. It actually worked. I could go down to 1-2/day ... But that leap was too much. It never could zero down.

I made bets that Id quit before some date ...  never could.

I tried **nicotine gum** the problem with it is that it just sucks. It works in the sense that it diminishes your cravings but never gives that relief you long for. So if i was ever desperate for some I'd never go for the gum, it was always the cigarette. Defeating the fucking purpose.

Maybe its not as relatable. But more adhd-like people with more impulsivity might .

**the 4 months of 2016**

So last year I decided to go for it. I was off from college. Going home for a few weeks. Thought being from my regular friends would help.

I managed to stay clean for **4 fucking months** ..... But the first few were fucking horrible. The first few weeks I stayed awake for 24 hours .. Would sleep for 3-4 and then be awake again for another 24 hours ... I did a 10K just so i could sleep from the tiredness. It didn't help. The insomnia was very real. 

The next thing which was worse was the constipation. Since i smoked and shat at the same time in the mornings, I no longer had the stimulus to poo. My intestines were too slow for it. And ...* I shit you not* .. It wasn't normal for like 50 days. I was taking two types of laxatives on and off to avoid dependency ..

but ultimately I failed. Mostly because when I was back and college and had exams .. I fell into my old habitats. I smoked to study.. I was hanging out with my smoking buddies... It was the stress that broke me. And my inability to handle anxiety. The cherry on top was the 16 kg weight gain I had worked so hard to lose..

**THE FINAL AND SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT**

This attempt was successful for a few reasons.: most importantly *the timing* .. I had an unrelated surgery scheduled for March but a stressful month around until two weeks before that.

So I what I did was time my attempt so Ill be invested enough to hold off until the surgery even though the anesthesiologist asked me to stop only for a day or two before surgery... And after the surgery i wouldnt be in the condition to smoke. And would be invested in wound healing for a few weeks.

2nd thing that helped and what Id' advise the redditors here is that STOP FUCKING THINKING ABOUT IT. stop reading the wikipedia articles. Stop talking about it. Dont let your mind wander. Keep yourself busy. Eat, play games, workout, watch movies, work whatever you have to to keep your mind off of smoking. This is very important. Most of my shortest streaks consisted of my reading up all the information available on smoking.

3rd thing that helped which was a *very* risky move for anyone with addiction issues, was medication for the insomnia i had the last time. **BENZOs** .. **Valium** specifically. Valium is a long acting benzodiazepine so the withdrawal is slower and more mellow hence less likely to make you act out. And hence less addictive. But on the other hand it stays in your system for a long time so only small amounts regular enough can get you addictive. The average dependency starts after like 10 days its in your system. So it was perfect for me. I took small doses for the insomnia every night knowing the surgery would incapacitate me enough to stop me before i get addicted.

It had another surprising benefit. The cravings were so diminished because of its antianxiety effects that the critical week of abstinence went perfectly.
**Im about to graduate med school so i was rather safe about it.DO NOT PLAY WITH BENZODIAZEPINES WITH YOUR DOCTORS APPROVAL. Most celebrities who die of drug overdoses have something to do with benzodiazepines like valium. BE SAFE**

*** THE NOW ***

Its almost 7 months. I feel better. I smell better. I save so much money. Im healthier. Im on a downward trajectory regarding the weight problems. I have broken old habits. I no longer have issues studying or hanging out with friends that smoke. The smell is nauseous now. The cravings are gone. The nostalgia of the good times is there but I couldn't be happier.

TLDR

**NO AMOUNT OF MOTIVATION IS GONNA HELP WHEN YOUR WILLPOWER RUNS UP. BE PREPARED FOR THE FALL**

* be prepared for the side effects, 

* know your triggers, 

* be well informed 

* plan it right, 

* go cold turkey, 

* break the old habits, 

* use your stronger moments to counter scenarios that might break you, 

* use all the help physical, emotional, biochemical or whatever in your weakest moments, 

* keep your mind occupied dont let it spiral out of control.*

* focus on the short term pros and cons. Nobody is motivated to prevent chest 'issues' 40 years down the line.

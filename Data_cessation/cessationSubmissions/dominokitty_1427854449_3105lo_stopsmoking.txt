How do you deal with disappointing yourself?

I've been trying to quit smoking for the last 4 days. I'm using nicotine gum to help.

I was at nearly a full pack a day. The first day I did really well and didn't smoke at all. The second day went well too. I was positive that I was going to be able to kick this. Yesterday, I caved. I had 3 at the end of the day. 

I feel really disappointed in myself and have been sort of wallowing in self-hatred all day, which just makes me want to smoke even more. Plus, my jaw hurts from chewing so much gum. I haven't smoked yet but I've got one saved upstairs for an "emergency". It feels like a security blanket. 

I don't know how I am going to do this. I've read Alan Carr's Easy Way, but it's not helping me right now. I want so badly to go to the store and buy a pack, but I feel like if I do that I'll be even more disappointed with myself. I'm stuck in this negative cycle where I honestly don't feel capable of quitting. I know I'm going to have that cigarette later tonight and it feels like the only thing keeping me going. I already feel like a failure.

Can anybody offer some advice to deal with this? I feel like I am slowly going crazy.

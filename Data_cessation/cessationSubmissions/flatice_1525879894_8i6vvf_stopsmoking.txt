I have to quit for surgery, considering quitting for good

My dr recommended that I stop smoking two weeks before a sinus surgery, which will be two weeks from this friday. My gf is planning to do it with me, and I think I want to just try to quit for good. I'm 23 and have been smoking since I was ~15. I'm ready to quit this gross habit - I hate reeking of cigs and getting winded walking up stairs. Hopefully it will stick this time - glad I found this sub to help

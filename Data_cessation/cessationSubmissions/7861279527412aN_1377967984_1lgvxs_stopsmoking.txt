Week two and I feel terrible D:

I'm leaving for school tomorrow and the stress is already building. It's been OK the last couple weeks, except a few bad days. I really feel like shit now though. I don't ever feel full, no matter how much I eat. I can't seem to sleep properly either. I know will feel terrible if I give up now but idk if I can keep this up D: I'm about to go back to Orgo, genetics and transmission electron microscopy. Did I just quit at a stupid time? I quit drinking and smoking pot 3 years ago and I don't want to lose this last social thing...

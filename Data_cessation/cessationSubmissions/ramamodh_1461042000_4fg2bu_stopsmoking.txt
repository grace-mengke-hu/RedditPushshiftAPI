Stumbled after 90 days. Restarting from day 1 !

Hello people,
I started my second quit attempt on the Christmas eve last year and had a very good run for almost ninety days. Just a little background info. I'm 27M, been smoking since I was 18. Started as a casual smoker and for the last 5 years ended up being a miserable compulsive smoker doing about half a pack a day. I tried my luck with quitting in March 2014 and went on for 49 days after which I stumbled. It took me almost a year and a half to try and stop smoking again. I tried to implement a few lessons learnt from my unsuccessful 1st attempt and everything was going great. It was smooth sails right through the first 70 days. I was convinced that I am going to be a non-smoker for the rest of my life. After that I used a sneak a cigarette or 2 from my buddies on heavy drinking weekends which then turned into a slithery slope. I left my guard a bit down and everything is back to zero now. I have been smoking for the last 20 days now and I am starting fresh from tonight.

Back to day 1 and reseting my badge. Lessons I have learnt from my 2nd attempt are 

1. NOPE(Not other puff ever!). This might seem very simple and trivial but this time I am not gonna inhale anything nicotine however drunk I am. No to  those 'only 1 for the drink' smokes/hookahs.
2. Learn to change/develop some habits to  solidify the mental feeling of change. Like exercising,meditation, cooking etc,. Following a few other subreddits for these. 
3. Read Allen Carr again whenever I have very bad cravings during my initial days.

Wish me all the best, fellas! I am going on a small retreat this weekend. As usual it's going to flow with booze(thankfully no one smokes and actually encourage me to stop). This weekend will be a huge test for me. I will update you guys after this weekend.

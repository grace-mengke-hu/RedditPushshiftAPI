3 weeks!!!

Hit the 3 week mark today and I gotta say its been a lot easier than the second week. I've been down with the flu most of the week so can't really comment on any changes this time around. 

One thing I'd advise for everyones who is 2-3 weeks in is that with the season changing, any potential flu might elevate the cravings drastically. In my case I haven't been able to work out the entire week and my throats been itchy along with my nose almost blocked. Such conditions led me to believe that quitting hasn't really improved my well being and I'd always be tempted to light one up just to get some ease of mind. DON'T DO IT MAN!!

Here's hoping I touch the week mark in 1 piece. Peace

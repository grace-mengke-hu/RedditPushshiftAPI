Quitting when everybody I know still smokes.

Literally every adult I spend any time with smokes.  My husband and my co-workers and my boss will be the ones to make this especially difficult.  

How do I do this when everybody is always going outside to smoke and socialize?  

My husband flat out refuses to even try to quit. 

There's a bucket full of reasons why I'm wanting to quit now, but basically, it's time.  How do I do this?

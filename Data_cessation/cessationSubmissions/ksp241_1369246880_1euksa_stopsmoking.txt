I don't understand my mind!

I'm 125 days today, and all I can fucking think about is breaking!  What the hell, I've been so good, quit cold turkey, and haven't had any.  I felt great about 40 days ago, but every since I hit 100 days, my thoughts of breaking have been snowballing.  I'm under a lot of stress right now, I'm moving, have to find a new job, my sister is getting married next month so my bank account is bleeding money for her wedding.  I'm pissed that all I want to do is break...I thought you would stop thinking like this by this point!

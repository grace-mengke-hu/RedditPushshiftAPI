Officially two weeks in... Eek!

Using the patch.. Been hard.. Avoiding bars for now.. Not a single cigarette!

I found it helped to become hyper critical of smoking. Friends who smoke asking 'how I did it'.

'I don't want to die in my 30s. You should quit too'

Maybe dramatic. Working for me. Just felt like sharing. Keep strong everyone !

Trying to quit

The first day is the worst by far. I don't even know where to start. This is my 4th time trying to quit each time I've quit for months but I always start again. I want this to be different but I'm not exactly sure how to make it stick for good this time. If anyone has some words of wisdom I'm all ears.

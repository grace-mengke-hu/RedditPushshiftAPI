4 Years and counting!

It's a few days short from 4 years now. And got to say, it has been one my best decisions ever. It's easy to be around smokers in parties and there's no need to pick up the old habit again. Saved around 9kâ‚¬ during that time, but to be honest, I have no clue where that money has gone :D

A big shoutout to this community! Keep up the good work :) I'll get back to lurking and upvoting.

Not quitting on 1st of September as I planned - just smoked my last cigarette.

I guess stopping to smoke in times of "stress" could have enormous benefits:

1. I will kill the excuse to start again: "Oh I am so stressed, I need to smoke one"

2. I am busy and have important things to focus on.

3. Self-respect-boost

So let`s do this, sick of it. Just sick of it.

ps: thanks for the push guys!

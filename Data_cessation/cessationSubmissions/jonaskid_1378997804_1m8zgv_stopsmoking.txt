How i did it

The way that worked for me was avoiding thinking about it.
Even now, about 1 year after stopping smoking, i still don't think myself as a non smoker, i prefer to think that i only smoke when i feel like it, and keep postponing the cigarette whenever i feel like one. I still smoke in parties, when drinking, etc, but i can easily stop the habit the next day with this philosophy.

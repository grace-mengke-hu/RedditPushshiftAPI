It's only been a day since my last ciggarette

I ran my pack of cigs under water, I've thought about quitting before but never made a true effort. I've never been a totally heavy smoker but a constant one, about an average of 3 a day. I've always told myself I'll quit whenever I want but I think I truly want to now. But suddenly I'm facing what seems like a much harder uphill battle than I thought.

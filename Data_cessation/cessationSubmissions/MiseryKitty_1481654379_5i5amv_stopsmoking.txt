I must confess to e-cigarettes.

I am aware that they contain no tobacco and that they are much healthier for you but I still feel like I am dependent on nicotine and the motion of smoking. 

I bought a rechargeable one to help me quit but I know a few people frown upon them. I personally do not but I do feel the nagging need to confess that here.

I've been using it for 3 days.

113 Days - Sudden cravings

Been reading on this forum a few times since I quit, and I feel its been  really helpful. Today I almost messed up, and wanted to share my experience with you. 

Used to smoke a pack a day for 10 years, and have been smoke free for 113 days today, not having any problems for weeks. Went to a party with work, feelt a bit down and not really wanting to go, coupled with some personal challenges. Suddenly a couple of cravings hit me hard, and kept coming. After a while I actually left the party and went to buy a pack of cigarettes, wanting to sit down, have a coffee/beer, smoke and relax, thinking that would make me feel better. Luckily I came to my senses before I lit up and threw away the pack, read my previous diary entries in the app on what changed after i quit, why I was glad I quit and so on, and then read some posts from you guys on this forum. That really saved me today. I'm so glad I got through it! But, just remember; even after 113 days you might still try to convince yourself that smoking could be a good idea, just this once.. Don't fall for it! It's just your previous addiction talking shit to you. Remember why you quit in the first place, ignore the craving, and like the others, this one too will pass!

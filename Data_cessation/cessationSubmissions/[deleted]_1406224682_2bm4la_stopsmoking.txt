Can anybody help me quit using the 'Easyway' Allen Carr method?

My problem is that I have already read this book, years ago and so I already went through having all those epiphanies and realizations and this time around  nothing seems new to me as I read it, so I feel less engaged and also like I'm getting less out of it or not doing it right.

I'm serious about quitting though, I have been listening to the 'Easyway' audiobook which I just dug up from one of my hardrives and a few days ago I was reading the book. I have no confidence though because I have actually been to one of his seminars but I know at the bottom of my heart I didn't truly want to quit at that time which I know now is a big part of what makes anyones quit a success. 

The main thing for me is coffee and cigarettes and I don't think he expands enough on 'special/precious cigarettes'.

I've watched the movie but again I always think I'm doing it wrong because I've already absorbed this stuff years ago. I think I am ready to quit now even though I'm only 2 hours into the 6 hour audiobook.

Any advice or pointers would be really appreciated. Or even if someone could summarize the books main points that might be just as helpful. I'm at 2 packs a day and I tried the Evod starter kit ecigarette last night but didn't like it in the end and didn't want to get hooked on another thing altogether. I don't want to use any devices to quit because the research on them is so mysterious and I'm like what if they find out this stuff is really bad for you. Thanks in advance for your help.

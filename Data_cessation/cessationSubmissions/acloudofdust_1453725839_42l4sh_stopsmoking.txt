2 weeks. New to the sub wanted to thank you for sharing your stories.

I have been smoking for +/- 20 years and I often came to this sub while I was smoking to see if I could get the motivation. 

3 weeks ago I began taking champix and the side effects have been awful. I remembered this sub and during the worst of it I came here to see others stories. 

As of today I am finally starting to feel free of the psychological grip smoking had on me. I know it's early to say so but I wanted to get it off my chest. 

Thanks for sharing everyone.

Help with stopping smoking

Hi guys,

Just stubbed out my 4th "last cig" and I really want to stop at this point

I've only been smoking since March due to a lot of stress going on, and it has helped- the stress aspect and social aspect has made things easier, but not economically- I'm currently on 3-5 packs a week and it's really costing me, and I'm conscious of the health aspect too

If you guys have any good advice (Not looking to start vaping or smoking a Juul) that has helped you, or just some encouragement on it, that would be great

Really want to make a change with this!

I don't want to start this again

I have been trying to quit cigarettes since I made a habit of it. About 10 months ago I went from ecig to nothing, gave it away to somebody more in need. 5 months ago I started smoking again. 2 months ago I tried to stop, but kept having breaks here and there. It's been about 2 or 3 weeks now, and I feel like I'm gonna break again. Maybe I can't quit, maybe the ecig is better, maybe I am just stuck to this. The nicotine helps a lot with my mental issues, it calms hallucinations, but it's a crutch I'm not sure I want in my life. I don't want to stop but at the same time, I feel like a cripple with it. Not to mention it's a waste of money. 

I keep thinking "just buy a pack, it'll be okay" but it never is. The last 10 packs have been my last packs. How do I overcome this urge?

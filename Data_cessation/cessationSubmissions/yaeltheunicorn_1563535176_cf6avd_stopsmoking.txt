I'm so over nicotine, but I don't think I can do this. Day 1 here we go again.

I'm kind of a funky one, because about 5 years ago I switched from cigarettes to Nicotine lozenges and occasionally mixing the two, mostly when socializing. I have tried to get rid of my nicotine addiction countless times before and since, but it's always only semi-serious you know, the usual excuse of "now it's not a good time".

BUT I'm trying again today. I've finished Alain Carr's book a few weeks ago, but it only resulted in me picking up smokinf again along my usual nicotine pills.

I have smoked an entire pack of cigarettes and had the usual amount of nicotine lozenges as usual last night and it feels like rock bottom (again), as it resulted in a mild overdose (nausea, headache, sore throat, the whole charade) 

I'm so over and done with this, but at the same time I'm terrified that I fail and I don't trust myself and my determination. I feel like I'm lying to myself when I think I'll never smoke again, or never eat a nicotine lozenge ever again.

It's only been about 14 hours but it's one of the longest times I've been nicotine-free for the past decade. 

TL;DR: Day 1 and I don't trust myself to be able to do this.

New here and to not smoking

Hello there. I just quit today after smoking for some 30 years. I will be 43 soon and started at 13. Going cold turkey. Quit only once before about 2 years ago and 1 week in my husband and I split, the stress was tremendous and I picked it back up again. I am ready this time. I know life will be stressful and that smoking won't help it. I hope to not only find support her but help support others. Thanks for listening :)

20 yrs old, smoking for a year and a half-ish. Today is the day!

So I am a 20 year old college student. I started smoking during my freshman year, starting off with like 2 a day, and eventually oscillating between a pack every two days or a pack twice a week. I remember when I first started, if I had too many in a short amount of time I would feel nauseous (probably a sign to stop...) but I kept going anyway. That feeling eventually subsided, and now I smoke socially with my friends pretty often in between classes or when I need to take a moment to collect my thoughts while doing classwork. 

I can definitely feel some differences too, like the other day (New Englander here) it was decently cold and my SO left to walk to the train about 1.5 miles away. I stay in bed, but the next thing I know I have a message saying she forgot her wallet and the train is coming soon. I figure what the hell I should get up anyways, and get dressed to run it to her. I don't run really in general as exercise, so I had not noticed this effect yet, but it hurt so much to run that distance. So much shortness of breath and so much burning in my lungs. It was altogether unpleasant. 

That was the moment when I realized I had to stop now. So today is the day, I look forward to the ride and supporting you all as much as I can.

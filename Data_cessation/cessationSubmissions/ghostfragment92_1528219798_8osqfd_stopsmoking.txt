Today marks 3 months since I put down the pack for good

After several half-assed attempts to finally get rid of smoking once and for all, I took the plunge in early March, and haven't looked back since. It's the longest break I've had from smoking in 4 years, and I'm hoping to make it last.

It hasn't been easy for sure. A few weeks after quitting I lost my job and have been actively applying for new ones since, but it's given me ample time to reflect on my behaviors. I have a very addictive personality but I'm trying to replace the negative things like junk food, Netflix, and gaming with positive ones like regular gym time and reading.

I'm trying to think of something to do for when I hit day 100 in another week or so, anyways happy to have reached this major milestone!

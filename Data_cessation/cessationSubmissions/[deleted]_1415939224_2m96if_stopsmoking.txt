I never ask for help, but I need it now. Almost made it 2 weeks, and I failed again.

So actually I dip, but this subreddit seems far more active than the dip one. I started out on cigarettes when I was 16. I'm 25 now and I dip. Subtract  the times I quit and you'll have something more like 7 years than 9. I've quit so many times. 

I feel like such a useless piece of shit, I have no self-control, I can't trust myself. Positive affirmations are empty words. This may seem overdramatic, but I really have no belief in myself at this point. It's not just the tobacco, I just can't move forward in life, It's destroying my health. I am fucking terrified of mouth cancer but even that's not enough.

Yes, It's a coping mechanism, the thought that always snares me "You won't be happy without it." 

I really am in a negative place right now in my life, don't know how to do this, I've tried a lot of strategies, food, exercise. None of it works, because I'm depressed, I have no self control, no support network.

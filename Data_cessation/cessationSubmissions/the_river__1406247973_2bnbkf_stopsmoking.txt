4 and a half months clean. Maybe i can inspire someone else too

Just wanted to share my experience with you and perhaps help someone that has a similar mindset as i do.

I quit smoking cold turkey about 4 months ago after a failed attempt and still going strong. There have been a few urges now and then but nothing intense.

What helped me most personally was figuring out how smoking works and how it defined me as a person. As a smoker pretty much everything used to accompanied with a cig and it seemed like a pleasure but it was the nicotine illusion whispering in my head. The cig by itself doesnt offer some kind of pleasure , it's just nicotine withdrawal syndrome.You just need more to calm down the symptoms by not having some in a while , creating a never ending circle. 
It works like a drug because it is one. 

And then there is the psychological aspect. We tend to link enjoyable moments like the ones after a good meal or sex with smoking a cig making it seem satisfying when it's just the moment itself combined with the nicotine to calm down our urge to get more.

I'm pretty sure there are plenty more detailed articles about how nicotine and cigarettes work but let's say that was a tldr using my own words.

So i just didn't want to be nicotine's bitch anymore. Add up all the other gains (**cash**,physical aspect,odor etc) and you have a think going.Start now!

The craziest thing happened on lunch today

I typically go out for lunch during the week due to a long commute time I worry my food would spoil.   Anyway, today I went to the Chinese restaurant and ordered my usual, shrimp chow mein.  When the plate was laid before me, I swear I had never smelled it this way before.  It smelled delicious.  I shoveled it into my mouth and it tasted as good as it smelled.

Of course I didnt wait till it cooled so now my whole mouth is burnt, but damn that was good.  Seriously today had been going pretty rough up until lunch.  I think I will be able to make now.

I want to do this

I've been lurking for a long time on this sub. I've had a lot of false starts (like, A LOT). I usually get 24 to 36 hours and then smoke. I read the Allen Carr book and only stopped for a day. I'm really frustrated. I want to do this this time. I smoked what I plan to be my last one about 30 mins ago. I'm gonna keep reading all the great posts on this sub and stay busy. You guys a re great!

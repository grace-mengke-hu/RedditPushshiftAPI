Allen Carr, thank you.

Thank your sir, for your book. 


I just smoked my last one 20 mins ago, as you told me. I felt every naughty components going through my throat, every puff gave me a disgusting taste. I still have that bad taste in my mouth.


Earlier today I literally enjoyed a smoke, it tasted so good at the moment. Now I remember it as a taste of pile of ashes in my cheeks.  


i won't smoke anymore. I'm glad that you saved my future, i'm 23 now, been smoking for the past 5 years half a pack / a pack a day. I know some people smoke more than i did, but as you explained clearly, it makes no difference. 


I am no longer a smoker, my clothes won't smell bad anymore, i won't be mad when i forget to take my cigs to work. I'm still young, and i won't ruin my health anymore. 


I don't regret a thing being a smoke-free person from now on. I know, it's only been 20 minutes, but in my mind it feels like it was like this from the beginning, i was just putting some poison in my blood, like a bad wine making me want to puke. I realize that now, and i'm free of these temptations.


The cigarettes are drugs, the worst ones. The ones which pretend to be a relief when it is actually the opposite. fucking little hypocrits, like a slut charming you only to give you AIDS. At least with the slut, you get an orgasm (hopefully).


I will now only smoke freedom, and that's the best drug i will ever have.

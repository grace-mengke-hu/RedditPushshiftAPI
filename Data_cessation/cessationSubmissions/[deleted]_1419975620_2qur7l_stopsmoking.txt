Starting to take a serious effort to quit, what are the best methods?

I tried cold turkey once, that didn't pan out well. I have been smoking for 5 or 6 years since I was 19-ish, and I smoke about 1/3 a pack a day at most. When I'm home I never smoke, its only at work on breaks and when I'm driving.

Tomorrow I'm going grocery shopping and I want to buy whatever it is that can help me (I'm pretty determined so my mental state will be the most useful tool, but I would like *more* help), I refuse to "vape" because I'm addicted to the motions of smoking as well and I'll just get mad its not a real cigarette.

I can't take pills because I'm on Accutane, so I was thinking the patch. Any suggestions? What did you use that worked for you?

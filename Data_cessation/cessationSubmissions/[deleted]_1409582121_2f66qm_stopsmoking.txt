Third time's a charm?

Ok, here goes. Tomorrow will be the third time I've quit. I feel like I will be doing this all of my life, fighting with smoking. On and off and on and off. It has to stop. This time must work. I almost feel like getting off the cigs is not as hard as staying off the cigs. The last time I quit I made it over 150 days, just got sucked right back in. I sometimes felt like it changed the way I thought. I would tell myself, "you can have one" and "one won't kill you". But it is never just one. Been nearly a 10 year smoker with two breaks in between, usually a pack a day. And it's killing me, I'm sick of waking up in the morning wheezing, coughing and STINKING! I remember being off the smokes before and a smoker would walk by and I would think "is that what I used to smell like?" and yes it is. It is what I smell like today, yesterday and the day before that! But not tomorrow! Apologies for the wall of text, you folks were here for me before, and I'm sure you'll be there with me this time. Craving by craving, day by day, and for that I say thank you all in advance!

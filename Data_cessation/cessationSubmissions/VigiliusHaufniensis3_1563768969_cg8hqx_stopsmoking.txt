Day 11. I’m a very anxious person and I eat and smoke a lot. What can I do?

My title is maybe confusing. I’m 300 lbs right now and was smoking 10 cig per day. I stopped because of a throat pain 11 days ago and I saw it as a good start to quitting. The problem is... the true addiction I wanted to quit was food, not this one xD but I find easier to not smoke than to eat right, because we can’t just simply don’t eat....


The fact is, I’m not eating worse by no smoking, but if I eat well AND don’t smoke, idk how to get my anxiety away, that little bug that tells you to do something besides the main thing you’re doing, wishing that anxiety relief moments comes as soon as possible...

I’ve tried sports and physical activity but it’s not my thing. What do you do with this?

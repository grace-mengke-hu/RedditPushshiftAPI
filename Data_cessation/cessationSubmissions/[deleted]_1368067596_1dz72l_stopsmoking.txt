Nice to meet you.

I've been going back and forth wanting to quit for a while, but I've had enough. It's time to stop. There's no benefit to smoking and its only a bad habit. I've been smoking for about 15 years, are there any tips for getting over your initial cravings? I'm happy this sub exists and hope you all can give me the strength to quit. Thank you.

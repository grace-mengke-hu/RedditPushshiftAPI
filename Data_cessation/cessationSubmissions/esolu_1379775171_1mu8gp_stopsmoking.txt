950 cigs not smoked, what to spend it on?

[Some of you may remember I bought this with my first installment of money saved from quitting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1kck5z/i_just_bought_this_with_the_money_i_have_saved_on/)

So now I have 950 more cigarettes to spend, that's roughly $330.  I need help deciding what to spend it on.

2 Weeks, Only Now Are The Cravings Coming Strong. This is Bullshit. (rant)

14 Days. Doing so well. I understand it does literally nothing for me. I see people still have a craving after years of quitting. 2 weeks and the cravings are hitting me hard. I feel it in my heart,I feel it in my sternum.. the hollowness wanting to be filled with the smoke. Why are people making profit off of poisoning us.

More importantly, how do I fucking stop.

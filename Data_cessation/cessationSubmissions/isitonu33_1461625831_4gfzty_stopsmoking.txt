Had a cave in. Smoked 2 cigs..

This past Thursday I smoked two cigarettes while drinking and smoking marijuana. I just wanted it so bad, tired of dealing with the cravings. I didn't even enjoy it as much as I thought I would. 

Almost had 60 days but I blew it. It's been on my mind and I just had to rant. People were so proud of me for stopping. Just feel shitty. I haven't smoked any since that night. 

I just get such a strong urge to smoke when I'm driving and that is a big part of my job.

I know it was because of my lowered inhibitions, but does this mean I will always crack? Sure I was able to resist before but you bet your ass it was hard as I'm sure you all know.

Don't know how to feel but I am pretty disappointed in my self.

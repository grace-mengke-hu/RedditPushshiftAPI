We quit together, now it's just me. Help?

Hi everyone,

Throwaway because I'm referring to my wife.  I'm not worried about her finding this, but I'd like to keep our regular usernames unconnected.

So the title says it all.  We quit together. We gave each other a lot of support.   It's been a few months.  She caved and started smoking.  I'm still not smoking.  I'm kind of jealous, and feel pathetic for feeling jealous.

Help?  Advice?  Am I doomed?  Tips for being a lonely quitter?  Anyone ever been in a similar situation?  I'm scared and sad, and lonely.  I am starting to realize that recovery from addiction is a very solitary business.  There's lots of places to get support, but ultimately I am alone with this problem.

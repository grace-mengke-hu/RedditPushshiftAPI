Would appreciate some advice

Ok, throw away for reasons. I have some serious problems with depression and anxiety. I am also a self harmer. When ever I want to self harm I have a fag to calm to me down and sometimes its enough time to stop me doing it. I really don't want to rely on smoking, it seems like a terrible idea. But everyone here hates on vaping so I don't know what to do instead. Does anyone have some advice of what to try instead? Probably not but seemed worth asking.

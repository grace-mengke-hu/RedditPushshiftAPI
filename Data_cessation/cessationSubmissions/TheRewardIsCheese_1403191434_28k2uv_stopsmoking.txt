Allen Carr's 'Easy Way For Women To Stop Smoking' - is it any good?

I'm finally at a place in my life where I'm ready to quit. My 25th birthday is coming up fast and I want to be done with smoking by then. I've read a lot of great things about Allen Carr's original book and on my quest for finding his book online I discovered he wrote a separate book specifically for female smokers. Have any ladies out there read it? Should I stick to the original? Thanks in advance.

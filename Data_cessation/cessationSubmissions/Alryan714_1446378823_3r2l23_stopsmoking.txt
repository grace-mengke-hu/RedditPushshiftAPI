4.5 months in

I am 4.5 months in and the moment I am hanging out with family I could just light one up and not even can. I dont. Still haven't. But god I do want to. My uncle is one of the other few people in my family who have quit for real and he is so happy to see me not smoking. He told me there are to type of smokers who quit. People who quit and never want to smoke again in their life and than the other smokers who will quit but still want to smoke. I am the 2nd on. I still want it. I miss it. I just know better. I won't smoke. Here is to getting to 4.5 months and getting so close to my 6 month goal!

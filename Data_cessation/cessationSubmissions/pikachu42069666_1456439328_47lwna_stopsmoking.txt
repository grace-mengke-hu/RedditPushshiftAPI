Making a serious effort this time..

Hey guys, today is day one of me actually making an effort to quit smoking. I'm 20 years old and I've been smoking since I was 16, but I want to stop smoking now before it's too late. I've got so many people in my family with lung and heart issues from smoking and I don't want to be the next one. I always tell myself it's fine because I'm young, and I'll stop before anything really bad happens, but I need to do it now. Can't wait to finally be done with this nasty habit!! It's been 12 hrs since my last one and craving are hitting pretty hard since I just woke up. Trying to power through.

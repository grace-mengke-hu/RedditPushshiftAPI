Fuck Smoking

I have been "quitting" for what feels like forever. I successfully quit nicotine entirely for a month but slowly started again and now I'm back. I recently bought a nice vape so I'm actually encouraged to use it but eventually I wanna get off that too. Today is the day that I'm gonna to just start saying no again, it's as easy as that. Anyway now I'm ranting, I just wanted to say that quitting smoking is one of the shittiest experiences ever and just makes you feel so weak. This community has been such a huge help in the small progress I have made, so thank you to all of you and good luck to all you trying as well!

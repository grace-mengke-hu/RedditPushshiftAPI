I think I got addicted really really quickly

Hi reddit, need some advice here. About three weeks ago, a friend offered me a cigarette. For the next couple of days, I kept thinking about doing it again so I went & bought a pack. I ended up chainsmoking about 4 that day, then got scared & threw the rest of the pack away. For the past few weeks, it's been really hard not to smoke & I think about it every day, several times a day. Is it really possible to be addicted to quickly? Am I a genetic freak or kidding myself or what?

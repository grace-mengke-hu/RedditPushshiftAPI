My story of quitting and completely losing the craving of cigarettes

I see lots of posts here about people having trouble quitting due to relapse. I used to smoke 20 a day, which I did for just over 10 years. I quit almost 3 years ago, and I haven't had a single cigarette craving since.

Backstory; one of my friends moved in with his newish girlfriend and insisted she had to quit smoking, so her doctor prescribed a cure called Champix (Chantix in the US). When my girlfriend (who also smoked) contracted severe bronchitis a year or so later, we both went to the doctor and asked about Champix. He heartily recommended it, so we decided to both go for it.

What it does is it blocks the receptors that picks up nicotine (or something like that), so you continue to smoke like usual, but the effect becomes smaller and smaller and you don't really notice it. After about 7 days on the cure, I lost my smoking regularity (forgot to smoke). After 10 days I decided it was pointless to smoke, as I didn't get anything out of the cigarettes anymore, so I threw the rest out. After 3 months on the cure, cigarettes and the smell of them make me (mentally) nauceuos.

Now, this doesn't work for everyone. I've recommended this cure to everyone I know who smokes and wants to quit, and out of 6 people I know who tried it, one had a relapse. The real number of relapse vs success is probably higher, but if you are hell-bent on quitting, I can really recommend this cure. Definitely worth a shot if you can afford it (if it makes you quit, you'll save that money in no time though).

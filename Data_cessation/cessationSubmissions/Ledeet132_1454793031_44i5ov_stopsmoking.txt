Okey, I made a decision, but...

Hello /r/stopsmoking. Due to my poor health, obviously worsen by my smoking habit, I seriously decided to quit smoking. I just have to clear up few things and need your advice in doing so.

I've quit smoking several times for different time periods. Longest I've gone was 3-4 weeks. 

You know why I can't quit for good? EVERYONE AROUND ME SMOKES like a choo-choo trains: My whole family, their friends, my friends, my co-workers, everybody has a cig on their mind. 

Need advice!

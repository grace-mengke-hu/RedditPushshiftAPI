Depression after being quit?

I've read that the feeling of losing your best friend or having a bad break up is common after quitting. Last week, when I wrapped up two weeks of quitting, I found myself getting very depressed when my kids aren't with me. Is this normal? Right now, I'm fighting a pretty bad episode of extreme sadness and feel guilty about every bad decision I've made in life. Someone PLEASE tell me this will pass. 

EDIT: I am also taking Zyrtec D for some allergies. My depression kicked in the day after I started taking that. I asked my doctor and he told me to stop taking the Zyrtec and see if that helps.

Thanks to everyone that has replied. It makes me feel better knowing this feeling of dread and anxiety isn't permanent and will go away. It really sucks.

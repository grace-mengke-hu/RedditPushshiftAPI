On the verge of going back to smoke after 3 and a half months without it.

I started smoking when I was 17yo, and now I'm 30, and quit smoking 3 months and a half a go, but I've gained around 20 pounds, I'm not eating more than I used to, but I just keep gaining weight,  and today I started thinking about going back to smoke just because I'm feeling fat. Does anyone has a diet or tips to make your metabolism faster again? I can't stop piling up these pounds. What's the point of trying to live healthier without cigarettes in my body if I'm feeling and looking a lot unhealthier now with all this overweight?

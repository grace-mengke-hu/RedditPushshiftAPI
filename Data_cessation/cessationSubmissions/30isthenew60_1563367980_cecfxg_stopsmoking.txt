Day 1, how long do the mood swings last?

I have smoked for 14 years and honestly wish I had listened to every person who told me not to start at 17. I have recently quit another addiction and decided at the 3 week mark to quit the fags as well. I'm using patches but decided to go one step lower than I needed as I had a pack to finish. The last one was last night so this is my day 1 without a smoke at all. I'm a bit cranky but am managing to distract myself. I'm worried about mood swings when himself and the baby are in from work/school. Can anyone tell me how long mood swings will last for? 
I've tried maybe 2 or 3 times to quit and managed to not smoke for 9 months of pregnancy plus the first 6 months then it all started to creep back in. The baby is 4 this year and the other week asked if she could have a "blower" it made me feel like shit hence why I'm stopping. The smell, the cost, the heart disease make smoking not worth the bloody hassle.

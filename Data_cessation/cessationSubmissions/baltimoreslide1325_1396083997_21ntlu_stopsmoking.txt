Trying. Slipping up a lot.

Hey guys.
Smoker for about 10 years here. I wasn't a heavy smoker (2-10 per day, depending on circumstances) but always smoked in the morning, religiously.
I've been gearing up to quit for a month or two, as I've been feeling it affect my sinuses and circulation (I'm 28). 
I bit the bullet and threw out my pack 2 days ago. 6 hours later, I bought a pack. Smoked one. Threw the rest of the pack away. 
Made it a day. Went to school, bummed a smoke. Damn! 
Back on the wagon. Made it another 36 hours. Out with a friend tonight: made it 2 hours. Bummed a smoke. Then 2 more, over drinks. Shit!
I still feel like I'm in the game, even though I'm not doing so hot. 
I've actually gone weeks without a smoke at meditation retreats and school retreats and such, without a thought, but doing it in the real world is so much harder. It doesn't *feel* hard, but then I just...slip up.
I don't have any smokes now, and I'm just going to wake up tomorrow and keep on with my quit. At least I've learned how to enjoy morning coffee without a smoke, I think, so that's something. 
I'm here for solidarity and to hear others' experience. Good luck, everyone, and thanks in advance for any words of wisdom!

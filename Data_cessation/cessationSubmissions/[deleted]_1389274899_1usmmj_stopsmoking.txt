Just hit the 48 hour mark

I know it's not really that long, but it's the longest I've gone without a ciggie for a long time. I'm not going to lie - I'm experiencing pretty severe insomnia and shortness of temper at the moment but I'm trying to remind myself that it's temporary. Just wanted to say thanks to those of you who have shared your stories in this sub because they have provided inspiration for me to stick this out.

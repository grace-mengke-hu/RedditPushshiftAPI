Having problems smoking after drinking

I have been smoking for about three years. Whenever I am sober, I have the willpower to keep myself from having a cigarette. However, whenever I start smoking, the urges come back full force. Tonight is the first night that I have given back into the urges after not smoking for a month and a half. I just want to come here to see if I can get some advice that I can look at every time that I start to have these urges to walk outside and have another cigarette. Not the advice like you are wasting your money and your life, because I already know those. Just anything motivational would help.

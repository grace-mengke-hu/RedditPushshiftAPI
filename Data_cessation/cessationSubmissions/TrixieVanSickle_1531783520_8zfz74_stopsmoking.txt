Newbie here. After 31 years of smoking and many previous quit attempts here I go again...8 days smoke free.

I started smoking 31 years ago at age 14. I've quit many times over the decades (my longest quit was 2 1/2 years), only to relapse.
Now I'm on Disability on a fixed income. NYC prices are $13 a pack and I simply can't justify the cost anymore. I admit this Quit is financially driven.  I've been using lozenges, 4mg about 3 a day and am trying to wean off of them. Smoking is so ingrained in my habits but, I'm hoping this quit is for good. I'm taking it like AA. One day at a time, one cigarette at a time.

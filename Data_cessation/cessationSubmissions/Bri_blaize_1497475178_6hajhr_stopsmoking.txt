Day 10 - Cravings Have Been Intense Today

I've been trucking along the last nine days with only minor cravings.  Some more intense than others, but overall manageable.  Nothing this community, NRT (patches), and some deep breathing hasn't been able to help suppress.

Today on the other hand has been insane.  Started the day by not putting on the patch (forgot). Mix that with with some frustrations associated with a newly formed start-up and I'm really feeling it today.  I'm sure it's a reaction to the lack of nicotine this morning along with detoxing from the chemicals in the cigs.  Big shout out to those in the community that went cold turkey opposed to step down method using NRT replacements.  

Anyhow, can't seem to evade cigs from my thoughts and overall very lethargic in general.  Plowing through it but wanted to document my struggle for reflection and others.

Sorry for the rant and self loathing.  Best wishes to all and keep plowing forward.

A whole month. I feel so different.

Like, really different. I went camping last week, in the Smokies. It smelled so good. I haven't smelled things that way in years.

Food, oh man, the food. So much flavor. It's like tasting things for the first time again. It's wonderful.

If you quit for no other reason than food tastes better, thats fine. It's worth it. So worth it. Keep fighting the good fight.

Made it to a week (again)

Did over 30days using NRT, fucked up, smoked, reset, smoked after 2 days, reset, decided only to use NRT when I was determined to have a smoke.  

Working fine, hardly using my NRT apart from when I am really determined that its either that or smoke.

Disappointed I still have nicotine in my system but I havent smoked.  

I will NOT smoke with you today

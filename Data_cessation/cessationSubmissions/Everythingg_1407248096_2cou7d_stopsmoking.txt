First Step toward being smoke free

Well I'm not at day one quite yet. But it is rapidly approaching.
Yesterday I filled my prescription for Champix, and today I have started taking it. My hope is to be smoke free in less than two week. I am currently looking at 14th as the LAST day I will have smoke. 
Has anyone experienced any odd side effects while taking Champix that i should be aware of?
I just want to try an prepare myself for anything that may arise along my journey to being smoke free.
Thanks in advance for the support

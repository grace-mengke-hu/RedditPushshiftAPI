Three weeks, some updates, and our kids are watching us and learning

Three weeks. Yay. I feel amazing. My workouts are getting better and my need for substitutes such as suckers and gum is almost nonexistent. 

Also, yesterday was a great day for me since graduating college. I was asked to start the process of creating and facilitating a support group for survivors of abuse and assault. I am so excited to start up something like this and realize that it's an honor to even be the one considered to do this. 

I'm a writer. I have been asked repeatedly when I'm going to write a book. Honestly, the idea of writing a WHOLE DAMN BOOK is terrifying. But yesterday, I got approached by a friend who escaped a commune/cult in her youth (they were featured on 60 minutes in the 80s) and wants me to write the book. It's like everything has aligned and been leading me exactly where I need to be. 

And lastly, my daughter (16 1/2) told me today that she is giving up coffee. I asked why and she said "Looking at all you've been doing,I know I can do it" 

Kids see us all of the time and they pay attention. It's just nice to be seen for doing good, not bad. :) 

Happy Saturday everyone. Let's not smoke today.

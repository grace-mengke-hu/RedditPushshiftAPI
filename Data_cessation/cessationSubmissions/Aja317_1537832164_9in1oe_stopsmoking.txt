My mom, sister and I joined a support group today!

At 4pm, my mom went to pick up my nephew from creche (kindergarten? Nursery?) and met an old friend who actually runs the support group and signed all 3 of us up. 


The meeting was at 7:30pm and i spent 3 and a half hours so peeved! My sister came home at 7 and only had 30 mins to process the information  ðŸ˜‚


The meeting was awesome! There was about 20 others, and i came out being pretty hyped about quitting cigarettes. They take carbon monoxide tests at the meetings and the Irish Cancer Society gives the group an allowance so we have access to  free patches, gum, lozenges and other things to help us. Our local pharmacy also works closely with the group so they are aware and offer support too regarding types of NRT that works and doesnt work. 

The best thing is the group has a pharmasist coming in at the next meeting to explain the various NRTs and the following week Oct 8, is our quit day. Until then though, i will be making a concious effort to at least cut down as I do smoke 20 to 30 a day.


As i said, i am hyped! I am a smoker of 13 years, mom is 40+ years and younger sister is 15 years. 



Wish us luck! I will be checking in on this subreddit and let you know our progress.

Randomly quit a week ago

Hi all! I just feel like sharing my story with you.

Smoker for 10 years. I wasn't planning on quitting. On one day I stocked up on tobacco, papers & filters to get me through the holidays. The next day I woke up and spontaneously decided not to smoke. Just for a while at first and didn't tell anybody. Later that day I told my girlfriend. Now I mentioned it to some people I came into contact with. I have this experience that announcing my plans to the world makes them more difficult to achieve.

Anyway I am on day 7 now and I feel quite good. The first 2-3 days were very hard, the physical cravings were driving me nuts. After day 4 it started to get much better, now I am mostly battling triggers. A good meal. Coffee. Drinking alcohol. So far I managed to dodge all of them and I mean to continue.

Smoking has been just such an integral part of my personality. Now I am learning to redefine myself. I think the smoking was just a crutch for helping me run away from myself. The rolling of cigarettes gave me something to do and calmed me as much as smoking itself. Now I actually feel calmer but I feel like I still have a long way to go. 

I've read some stories on this sub here and relapsing seems to be quite prevalent. This is my first time quitting and I would appreciate any feedback on how to avoid relapsing and tips on what to watch out for. 

Thank you for reading and I wish pleasant holidays to you all!

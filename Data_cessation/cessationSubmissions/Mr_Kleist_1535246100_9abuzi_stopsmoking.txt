38 Days and still Phlegm (so annoying)

How long before it goes? I also have seasonal allergies, so it just feels so annoying and is strangely only relieved by drinking, eating, and of course the smoking (which I won't be taking up again). It is strange to feel so much mucus in my mouth and throat, and it feels way wetter than ever before.

The recent polar vortex and watching my clients and coworkers deal with it has me feeling grateful these days.

It's hard to believe it's been 281 days, but I'm so thankful that it gets easier. I quit by switching over to an ecig and gradually decreasing nicotine content even though I know it shouldn't work like that. If you guys are struggling this season, just know that you can beat this. Stay strong.

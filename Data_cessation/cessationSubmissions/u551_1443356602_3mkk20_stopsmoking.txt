From regular smoker to occasional one - is it doable?

I've been smoking pack a day for ten years non stop. Now I've been without a cigarette for 26 hours, and have absurdly high confidence I could quit for good this time - dont know why, I'm just certain this is the moment. Chewing nicotine gum right now but I wouldn't mind to be addicted to that to be honest.

But there are moments I simply love to smoke. While sipping a cold beer on a sunny terrace, or on lazy Sunday mornings with coffee... I don't know if I want to be 100% non-smoker. Thinking all those good moments are gone for good is hard to come to terms with. 

Has anyone here succesfully gone from regular smoker to occasional one? I'm aware that might be stupid thing to ask and very difficult to achieve, but is it even possible according to anyones personal experience?

1000 hours smoke free and...

32 years of smoking.  I hated every second of the last 2 years and one day I woke up and decided I just didn't feel like smoking anymore...and I haven't. Feels like I've smoked 12 packs today alone though, anyone else feel like they have the worst chest infection of their life after almost 2 months of not smoking?

Stop smoking to support Husband (Kind of all over the place post)

My husband want's to make some lifestyle changes which means avoid alcohol for a bit so he can get back into working out and quit smoking. We went running today and he couldn't keep up with me so I get the need for us to make some changes and reevaluating his fitness and of course smoking doesn't help!  I can go a bit without drinking around him and meeting up with non smoking friends if I want a drink and avoid that temptation to smoke.

We only smoke when we drink, which I know is an excuse but I never viewed it as a problem. I know every smoke is x amount of time off your life and not good for you but I still don't know if I am ready to give up smoking for good.
I'm sure I just feel this way because it's the first week and I know that is the hardest  but it's knowing that I can't (or I could but I will feel guilty) that's making my craving much more intense.
We did talk about this and I had thought I was 100% on board but now that we have the ball rolling I am having second thoughts. 
I guess I am just trying to get my thoughts out there and process how I can be supportive and also not crave or want to smoke.

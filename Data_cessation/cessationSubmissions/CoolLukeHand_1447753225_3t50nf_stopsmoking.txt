Stupid brain

My brain is slow and needs retraining after 20-odd years of smoking I have to make it understand that it isn't going to get that trigger any more. 
Every time I get a craving I force myself to think: 
This will pass in a minute or two
If I smoke it will not make me feel better
I hate smoking and I am no longer going to do it
I am healthier now and less likely to get very sick before my time
I don't need smoking it doesn't help me with anything
and the big one
Life is just much sweeter as a nonSmoker!!

Saying all of this like a mantra is helping and by the time I am finished I have my resolve back and the craving has passed.
I do the same when I see people outside a bar having a cigarette. Initially my brain thinks..."ohh that would be good right now.." but again I force it to really look at what these people are doing and imagine the exact same scene but in another month or two when it is cold and wet and miserable. These exact same people will be out dragging on another dirty gasper before dashing back inside. They will feel so much worse than me in the morning and they will be around Â£10 lighter in the pocket and have ruined their clothes and shoes. And all for what.. what benefit? what upside? whats the point..

I really think this mental exercise is helping me. I was lucky that my physical craving was light even after 20+ years of nearly a pack a day every day. My brain is the problem and for the first time in 20+ years I have not smoked at all in 16 days and I believe in my heart that I will never smoke again.

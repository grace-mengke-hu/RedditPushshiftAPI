About to smoke my last cigarette ever!

So I've read Allen Carr's book and I have to say it was fairly convincing. I've been smoking for nine years now, ever since I was FUCKING FOURTEEN years old. Well, I did stop for one year somewhere in between but now is different. The difference is that this time I'm going to stop for as many years as I have left, and that number is going to increase rapidly with every cigarette I'm not going to smoke. I'm looking forward to it!

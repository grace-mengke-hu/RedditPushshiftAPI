I think thisnis going to be way harder than all the other times

Ive quit on and off for years now, the longest being 2 years.

Today i have decided to again quit as i want to start training for the navy intake in january.

Problem is, my landlady smokes like a train. She wont stop any time soon. I dont need to ask her not to smoke around me as its her house and i can controll it. But the fucking smell of the smoke will drive me insane with cravings. I just know it.

Any suggestions on how to deal with this?

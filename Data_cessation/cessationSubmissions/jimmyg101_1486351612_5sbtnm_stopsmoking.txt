I hope this is it

I'd been smoking Dokha (an Arabian tobacco) for about 4 years and developed a pretty strong addiction throughout those years. Although I smoked so much (5-10 bowls per day) I tried to balance it out by staying active. I play multiple sports, gym and do long distance running but I felt if I didn't quit sooner than later I wouldn't be able to continue these activities for much longer as I was having a harder time running and got pain in my chest and heart at times. 

I've tried to quit a few times and ended up falling back into it so I'm hoping this time I can get over the hump. It's been 3 days and I can't lie, it's been tough so far. I feel physically dependent, all I can think about is when I will be ever able to smoke dokha again. I start shaking, get headaches and have the feeling of an impending doom. Fuck you dokha for controlling my life. Anyways, you can't really blame the substance. Anyone have any tips or feedback?

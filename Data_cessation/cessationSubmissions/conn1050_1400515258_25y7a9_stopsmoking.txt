Some Thoughts After A While

Smoking was a habit I picked up because a lot of my friends smoked. Some continue to smoke. My college friends and I smoked heavily, with many long half-a-pack or more nights of bar trips and patio drinking sessions. But then college ended, and I moved somewhere else for my first job. I was the only smoker in my immediate circle in the new place. 

I do have some friends in this place, however, and one night we were watching *Adaptation* with Nicolas Cage and I decided to see how long I could go without a cigarette. I placed the remaining cigarettes in the trunk of my car, which in retrospect was a poor idea, but at the time it made sense. I made it until the next night, at which point I went outside and lit up. The next day I told a coworker I was thinking about quitting, and she asked me if I had already disposed of whatever cigarettes I had left. That's important, she said, because you'll fail otherwise. So we tore up all the cigarettes from the trunk of the car and threw them away. 

That was in the first days of March 2013. I haven't smoked since that night I went and got a cigarette from my car. The physical, emotional, mental and financial benefits of quitting are innumerable. I'm a much better person than I was when I was a smoker, and I used the discipline and sense of accomplishment from quitting to fuel many of the changes which made that possible. 

As I write this, I'm on vacation with the college friends with whom I smoked so much. They still smoke. It's nasty. I was in the car with them yesterday as they each burned one with half-cracked windows. I used to do that to nonsmokers who were around me. What a disgusting habit. That noxious odor is overpowering. It follows you around and colors the perception many folks have of you in the same manner as a criminal conviction or a deep-seated personality flaw.

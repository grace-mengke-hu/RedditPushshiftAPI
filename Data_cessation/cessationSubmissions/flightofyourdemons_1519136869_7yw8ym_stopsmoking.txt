The Magic of Quitting Smoking: A Strategy for Quitting and the Importance of Hobbies

I will be one year smoke free in a matter of days. I am excited and proud to have made it this far. It hasn't been easy and I've let other vices shove their way in to compensate for the absence of my smokey friend; coffee and beer to be precise. However, I can say that the coffee and beer is under control now...more or less. 

I wanted to share a strategy that helped me, especially in the first half of the year. It involves the card game Magic The Gathering and the Save Up function of the Smoke Free App. I won't get into detail about Magic as a game, but essentially what I needed to do was purchase individual cards to make a deck of 60. The cards I needed varied in cost from approximately $2 to $120 each. I set up a list of all 60 cards in Save Up with the cheapest at the bottom and the most expensive at the top. The app tracks how much I've saved by not smoking and notifies me when I have enough to buy a card. By doing this I was able to buy the first 2 cards after only a day of not smoking. It took about 2 more days to get the next card, 3 more days for the next card, and a week for the one after that. The longer I went without smoking the longer I'd have to wait for the next card, but the reward was that much greater. 

This system of instant gratification at the beginning, during the nail-biting-bat-shit-crazy part, was extremely helpful because it gave me goals that were within reach. As time went on, and not smoking became **slightly** easier the gratification was delayed, but always soothing. 

I know that Magic The Gathering isn't everybody's jam, but hopefully you can find a way to apply this strategy to your own interests and hobbies. 

Unfortunately, during the past year I was in a tough spot, needed money, and had to sell all the cards I had bought so never finished the deck. That was about 6 months in so I felt like the quitting had happened. Happily, I was right.

Day 46

Day 46. I'm so happy and satisfied by myself.
But also a bit afraid.
Summer is approaching, and a lot of mates who I go to the beach with smoke. Smoking was a rite. I am afraid of having extremely strong cravings or also to fail, maybe when I drink a lot and I don't have conscience of what I do.

I am standing bravely against the craving of the girl I like smokingâ€¦ actually I am influencing her towards quitting. She esteems me a lot and I am sure she likes me too.

But I don't know whether my mates will esteem me or be envious of me for my result, and I do not know how much I can be influenced.

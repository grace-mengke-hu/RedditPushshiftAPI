Two years to the day, and I walk into the tobacconist at uni.

To buy a pair of cheap headphones because I forgot mine. It's crazy to think that it's been two years since I first decided enough was enough and that I was out. 
Haven't taken a single drag since. I'm the fittest I've ever been, lifting weights 4-5 times a week and very occasionally doing some cardiovascular. I recently shocked myself with 240v mains power and the subsequent check up showed a resting heart rate of 54bpm and no sign of any health issues. 
I've found other vices to spend my money on - tools and workshop equipment. I found a passion for making things that the old, lazy me would have merely pondered before walking outside and lighting up. 
Thanks for the support /r/stopsmoking. 
Good luck to all of you, and stay vigilant.

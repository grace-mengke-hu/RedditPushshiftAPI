4 months and 4 days smoke free and having irritating nasal issues

I am SO happy that I finally kicked the habit. I quit cold turkey and for the first two months and half months things were going great.

Then out of the nowhere I started having horrible nasal congestion issues. I have never had allergies before so I assumed it was just my body getting rid of the toxins. It has been difficult to breathe through my nose and I am having difficulty sleeping. I'm snoring and waking up with dry mouth because my nose is just so clogged. Went to the doctor and they gave me a steroid shot and some nasal spray. It worked for awhile and it has improved a but. Lately, just one side of my nose is clogged and it changes to the other nostril. There are moments when I am breathing fine then I will get an attack that will last for an hour. I am not tired, don't feel sick at all just dealing with this horrible congestion. Is this just allergies or something related to smoking for so long?

I just want to know if anyone has been dealing with the same thing. How long was it before your symptoms improved?

After all of this there is no way I am going back to smoking.

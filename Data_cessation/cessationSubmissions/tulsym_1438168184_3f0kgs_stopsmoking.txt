Day 6 and still going strong

I started smoking 30 years ago.  Haven't really had too many shots at quitting.  To be honest it's never really made me feel ill or anything.  No smokers cough.  Not super unfit.  Maybe because I only ever smoked low tar.  Even if I did get through a pack a day.  Or two if on a bender ;-)  Used to love that first one in the morning. 

Had two attempts before.  Once about ten years ago on zyban.  Lasted three weeks till the pills became too much.  Previous attempt about 18 months ago on patches.  Lasted three months that time

Anyway this time I'm on champix. Unsure of the USA name. Had gone through three weeks on them but was still smoking.  Went to a hypnotherapy session who asked me to bring in a craving to the session so I did.  Have been a non smoker since. To be honest found the hypnotherapy session a load of crap. I think it's just a combination of actually stopping and the pills doing their work. 

Anyway thought I'd share my new status as a non smoker.  :-)  it's going to be permanent this time

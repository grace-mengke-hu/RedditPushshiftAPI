For a Few Hours I Didn't Want One

I just realized that I woke up this morning and did not set into a cycle of convincing my brain that I don't want a cigarette. 

I mean I've started that internal argument now but for for about 2 precious hours this morning, it didn't even occur to my brain that it was missing cigarettes. 

That felt good. How's everyone else doing?

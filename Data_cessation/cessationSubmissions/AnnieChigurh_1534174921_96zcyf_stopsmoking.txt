Quitting after car accident

I was in a bad car accident last Sunday and ended up in the hospital for two days. I only left bed to go to the bathroom definitely not to go out for a smoke. I also got a minor pneumothorax, it really called attention to the fact that I was damaging my lungs by smoking when I had doctors giving me oxygen to help my lung heal.The cravings haven’t been so bad. I’m using nicotine patches some days and don’t think I could have made it through the weekend without it. 

Eight days in without having a big Quit Day, wondering when I will feel comfortable saying that I quit smoking rather than I’m quitting.

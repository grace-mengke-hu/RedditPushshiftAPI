Portable Oxygen

Hello all,  


Not sure if this is right subreddit to post this question, but my father has stage one COPD (\~45 years of smoking American Spirit) and is looking at buying an Inogen portable oxygen concentrator. Does anyone have experience with the models; if so, are there any advantages or disadvantages to each?  


Thanks in advance!

Very low energy - need help!

So I quit smoking almost two weeks ago, and for the most part I feel good. I can smell better, I'm so happy that I'm doing this, I'm not worrying constantly about my health. I'm excited to see how much money I'm saving, teeth are getting whiter etc. 

However, one of the big reasons I wanted to quit was to have more energy, and so far I have felt extremely tired since day 3. I've been sleeping at least 9 or 10 hours a night, and sometimes taking naps too. (I never used to take naps). I do have energy from a little while after I wake up and for several hours, until the fatigue hits again and I need to take a nap. 

Obviously this is a problem for me and I am getting depressed  because I am missing out on so much daylight - and worse during summer, my favorite season. 

I don't feel at all tempted to smoke because of this, but I'm getting depressed and if this continues I might end up craving cigs because this really sucks. 

Has anyone else been through this? How long did it last? What can I do to wake myself up? I keep pressing snooze on my alarms over and over and I feel so tired like I just can NOT get out of bed. 

In addition, I have extremely low motivation to accomplish the tasks that I should be during the day. Everything feels like a huge chore, even small things like paying bills, doing laundry and buying groceries. Please help!

tl;dr: I feel exhausted since I quit smoking. In need of support - did this happen to anyone else here? What can I do to wake up?

Crossed 100 hours!

I am at 107 hours! I never thought this would happen! My husband came back from a work trip today with the rest of his pack. It was calling my name, and I stood fierce and ignored it. 

I notice that each day that passes, my lungs feel more open and clear. I still find myself out of breath walking up these San Francisco hills, but my chest isn't as tight as it used to be, and I can catch my breath quicker.

I feel so much more confident at my office job knowing that I don't smell like smoke. 

Each day that passes, I feel more confident in myself. 

This subreddit has been my go-to during my usual smoke breaks. It gives me the instant distraction, and reminds me of the future I am working towards. Thank you all so much.

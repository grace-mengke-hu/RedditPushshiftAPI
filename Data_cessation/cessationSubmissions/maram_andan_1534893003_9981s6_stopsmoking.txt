2 years.

"Eda, did you quit smoking ?" : My mother used to ask me this  when I called her home in Kerala, India from Dubai. I laughed and changed subject whenever she did. That kept happening for 3 years. 

I remember the morning I got that call. Very lividly. It was at around 8 in the  morning on a Friday, the start of a weekend in Dubai. It was my dad. I took sometime to wake up and pick the call. I kind of panicked when I saw his name on the phone. An early morning call meant bad news. Little did I know it was the worst news I would ever hear over phone.

My mother had an haemorrhage. The doctor asked my dad to call their sons.  

She passed away 64 days later, and never did she gain her consiouness in the interim. I didn't get a chance to bid her goodbye.

She passed away on 11th July 2016.  On her birthday , 22nd Augus of that year, I decided to quit smoking.  And I was successful. Quite successful. I haven't touched a stick since then. 

This is my 2nd anniversary of quitting cigarettes. Thank you Amma .... I miss you a lot.

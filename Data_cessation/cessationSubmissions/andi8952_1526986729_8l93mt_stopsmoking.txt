Bought some gum

Hello all, 

So, I decided to buy some nicotine gum. Smoked again yesterday after a day studying. The "just one" first and then like 5 more within 1 1/2 hours. What an addict. 

Anyway my strategy now is to chew one 2mg Piece of gum in the morning, during lunch and when I am leaving office. Then after a couple days I ditch either the first one or last one of the day and replace it with a normal one. Hopefully that works... :) 

What do you guys think?

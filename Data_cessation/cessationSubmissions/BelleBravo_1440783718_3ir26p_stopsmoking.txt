DAE get phantom throat pains?

I've noticed some mornings I have been waking up with a slight tightness in my throat that I would get after a weekend of pretty heavy smoking. Has anyone else gotten this?

I don't know if its another way that my body is trying to trick me into smoking but so far I have been able to resist temptations and its getting a bit easier.

Now if I can only get a hold of my emotions that would be amazing.

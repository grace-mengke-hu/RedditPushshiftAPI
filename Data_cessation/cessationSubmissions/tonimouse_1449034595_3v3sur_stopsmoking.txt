Day 18

I almost died and was put on life support due to Pneumonia. The day I woke up in ICU with tubes everywhere I knew it was time. I will never touch a cigarette again!!! Have awful symptoms. But that's ok. You only have 1 life and I intend to keep mine. I am only 47 and look forward to my golden years. I am not ready to have my family say goodbye to me yet.

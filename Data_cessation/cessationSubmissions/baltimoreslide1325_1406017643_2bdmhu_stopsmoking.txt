48 hour post

Day 2 kind of sucked. I've been cut down/quit on and off over the past 3 weeks and don't remember day 2 sucking so bad (or at all), so it must just be a fluke of this time around, or something in my head. But it wasn't a fun day. 
  
It's not so bad, though: no crying, no pain. Mostly I feel unable to get going on the things I have to do. I was lazy and grumpy for most of the day, and I'm behind on stuff now. I'm trying not to stress it. There's always tomorrow, and each day I build a little more of a non-smoking work habit.  

I did go for an awesome run this morning and decide I'd buy a liveaboard sailboat with the money I save from not smoking over time (I'll save about $1800/yr I think).  
  
I know, posting a lot, but it helps. Good luck everyone!

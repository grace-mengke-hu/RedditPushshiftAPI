How do cravings feel worse for me around the 3 week mark than at the 3 day mark?

I’ve attempted to quit a few times and failed. Once, I failed at the 3-month mark. Another time, I failed at the 3-week mark. But I always get through the first few days. 

I was feeling GREAT at 2 weeks this time around. Right now I’m just past 3. I’m really determined not to smoke this time, but these cravings are awful. I had no problem drinking coffee up until now, but I think I might have to quit it for a while because it’s been giving me terrible cravings only recently. How is it that my cravings get worse, when all nicotine is out of my system?

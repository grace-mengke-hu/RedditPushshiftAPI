Damn, this is hard.

I haven't smoked nearly as long (5 years) or as much (~10/15 day) as most people here but here I am trying to give it up.
University got me started on the habit, and now that i've just completed my MSc I decided that since i have nothing to be stressed about so i no longer need to be smoking.... Jesus christ, it is a lot harder that i thought.

I really thought i could just put it down when i like. I had my last smoke just before midnight on NYE and i must say, i'm finding it incredibly difficult not to go down the shop and get a pack and just have one... I decided to go cold turkey on this shit and not bother with vapes or patches.

Honestly, i have no reason to stop smoking. I'm seeing if i can stop just because i can. I'm young, not bothered about the whole cancer thing - everyone dies, and they are just so damn good. I'm telling myself, if i can not smoke for a whole year then i can take it back up again if i want because i know i can stop. I'm an idiot right?

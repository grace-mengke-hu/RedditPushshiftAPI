WE NEED A BETTER SIDEBAR!!

I don't know about you guys, but I was VERY suprised when I first joined this community that there was no sidebar with a wiki guide to quitting smoking/dealing with cravings/issues. It seems every other serious and quality subreddit has one of these, so why don't we? Does anybody know how we would go about changing this? It would be very helpful to future quitters like ourselves.

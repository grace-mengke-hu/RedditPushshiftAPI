Long term side effects of Nicorette spray?

I've been to the doctor multiple times.  Also went to an ENT.  They cannot determine the issue and I'm curious if anyone had any long term issues with Nicorette mouth spray or lozenges.

Yes.  I use it too much.  I've used it a few years.

I wake up in the morning fine.  Around 4 or 5pm, my throat starts to burn, my voice becomes horse and my neck and shoulders ache.  It is so bad I can hardly think.  The Doc said it wasn't the spray and they claim I don't have cancer, yet I remain suspicious.

Have you had any long term issues with the spray?  I used lozenges before.  Again, too many each day.

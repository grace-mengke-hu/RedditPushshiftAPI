I don't know how to say no to my co-worker!

I have tried on many occasions to quit and it goes great until I go into work. Our relationship was built on our cig breaks and I love having a "butt" (thats what he calls it) with him. I'll go all weekend, I'll even drink and not smoke, but the second we step outside he goes "you need one?" and his pack is open infront of me and I can never say no. Not going outside with him isn't really an option because were always outside for work. Does anyone have any tips on letting a smoking buddy know that you're not their smoking buddy anymore?

Almost at the two month mark. Nicotine craving long gone, but social/habit craving getting worse

I'm approaching two months (cold turkey!) and feeling really proud of myself for not slipping up even once. I was between 1-2 packs a day for 10 years and tried quitting many times and never made it past a few days before the withdrawal kicked my ass.


This time around I've had no problems with the nicotine withdrawal or even craving it. But I really miss the habit. I miss not only having them throughout the day, but also socially, as far as drinking with friends or hanging outside chatting. Does this ever really go away? Does it gradually just disappear? Or am I gonna have to stay strong and basically fight this forever?

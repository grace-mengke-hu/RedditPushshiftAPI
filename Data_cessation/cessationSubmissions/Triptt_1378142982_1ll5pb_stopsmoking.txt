46 days in...

After almost 5 years of smoking, i've decided to quit 46 days ago.. I've thought about it a few times before, but never really tried. But then, in the middle of the summer, right when I was supposed to go on a vacation with my mates I got ill, and that chained me to bed for almost 10 days.. Then one day, while i was actually smoking, i decided to stop. I felt the sudden urge to pull my shit together so I did it.

It was cold turkey, and it wasn't really hard.. On day 3 I had like 2 cravings throughout the day, but I've kept myself busy with gym, cooking, reading articles and stuff like that. Also I've read Carr's book, but only till like page 70, because I didn't really need any help. Quitting felt very natural and I was really proud of doing that. It's probably one of the best things I've done in the whole year. 

Needless to say, money adds up, and after like 14 days, I treated myself a pair of pants and t-shirt, and it felt really great. 


But I have exams this week, and I think i failed todays. -> meaning i flunked from college. I just want to go outside and smoke a few.. I don't think this is really a craving, it's probably more of a wish to destroy myself even more.. Oh well, I had to rant a bit, and collect my badge... I need that today.

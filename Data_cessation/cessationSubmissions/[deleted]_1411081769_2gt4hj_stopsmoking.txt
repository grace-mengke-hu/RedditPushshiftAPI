7 days - I feel fucking terrible

Hey Guys,

My apologies for the brash title. I dont know whether or not its the nicotine. I stopped smoking a week ago, I've actually been feeling pretty good up until today.

I went out for a few beers on Tuesday, and my friend gave me a few pouches of Snus to prevent me from smoking (I'm aware that these are not good, although they did help completely squash my usual need to smoke while drinking)

Anyway, last night I couldn't sleep, tossing and turning. Today I feel terrible and riddled with Anxiety. Two days after the Snus use.

I'm not tempted to smoke at all (or use more snus), actually quite the opposite as I find staying tobacco free quite easy unless I'm around alcohol. I suppose I'd like advice on whether or not these feelings (anxiety, headache, crappy sleep, cant concentrate, etc) are cigarette/snus related. 

Did any of you feel this way at any point during your quitting process? Is there a smarter form of nicotine replacement I should be using? 

I know theres a million posts on this sub I could have searched to find answers, I just wanted to get this off my chest as the whole process is super fucking irritating... I wish I never picked up the dirty cocksucker of a habbit.

Just keep strong.

Two days ago I need to travel to Norway, to visit a customer, in total 4 hours from Germany to Norway.

As a non-smoker I'm OK now, with the long times in places where smoking it's forbidden, like planes or airports, but what I wasn't counting with was the 2 hours needed to go by car from the airport to the hotel after landing.

I'm natural shy but when I'm with customers or colleges from other countries I do my best to socialize and talk about whatever, so this time I try the same, but unfortunately my Norway college it's one of the most boring human beings I've ever meet, we were in the car sat in silence for almost one hour then we must wait for a ferry other 45 minutes, also in silence, all the time the only thing I could think was, if I had a cigarette at least I could go outside the car to smoke and escape of this award situation.

When we arrive to the hotel they give me a smoker room, the smell was awful but after two hours craving it simply make my cravings worst.

Somehow I handle to keep away from the cigarette machine in the reception bar and went to sleep.

Today I come to my office with the bike, it was nothing different than other times and maybe it's just my imagination but I feel like it was just a little bit more easy to do the trip and also a little bit more faster than other times.

Doesn't mater if it was real or not but it give me  a boost of moral, today i'm glad of didn't smoking in Norway, I'm happy of being a non-smoker and I try to remember that it doesn't matter how bad the craving could be at the end it will disappear.

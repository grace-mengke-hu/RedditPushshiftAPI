Meditation to conquer addictions?

Has anyone tried this? I've been doing a lot of self work this year, and cutting out addicting habits is part of that work... I've found that when I'm in a good mental place, it's much easier to quit, even something as addictive as smoking. When I'm not in a good state of mind, I tend to engage in those addictive behaviors more often in an attempt to fill a "hole" or stifle feelings.  
  


What is anyone else's experience with employing meditation to come to stronger mental health/eliminating the need for addictions?

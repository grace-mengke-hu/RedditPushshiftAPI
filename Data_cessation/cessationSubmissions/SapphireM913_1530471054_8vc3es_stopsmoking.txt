Almost 72 hours...

I quit Thursday at 2:30 in the afternoon. It is now 1:40 PM, and I'm less than an hour away from Day 3 being "complete". My therapist tweaked one thing in my head, I think the last remaining bit, and I've been with friends and working all weekend..  smoking hasn't been possible. I refuse to smoke around kids. My good friends have 2 kids and I've basically spent the weekend with them, so can't smoke there... My friend is a lvl 12/10 troll just as a human being, we're doing a combined rummage sale today and yesterday, and by us it's about the same temp as the surfayof the sun this weekend. It's a STRESSFUL weekend. He agreed, if I can survive this weekend, I never need to smoke again. And I made it. My sinuses hurt like hell. I've thought about smoking a total of 6 times. Each time I offered myself a lozenge, but didn't feel I needed it. My anxiety is fine, my irritability is surprisingly fine, though I forgot 3 decent sized things (I pride myself on my memory), so I kind of figured this is just how most normal people function. Forgetfulness is forgiveable. 

This one feels different. Y'all helped a lot, actually. I'll finish Carr's book, but today? Today I'm ok.

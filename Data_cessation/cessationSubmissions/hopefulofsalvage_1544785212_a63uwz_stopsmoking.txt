Reading Allen Carrs book is making me panic!

My quit date is the 21st.

Going through a difficult time in my life. Moved from one city to another and had to take an apartment near a highway. Had a cough some of the time but now have a chronic cough. Had a ct of the chest and then pulmonary function tests which are negative for copd. The chest physician says I need to quit else I will develop it... 

Never been so friendless, lonely and scared in my life.  Even though this is not the perfect time to quit (and is there one ever?) I need to quit now... My wife and parents don't seem to get it - they try to help but.... yes, I am go blame for my own predicament and yes I want to quit.

Had stopped for 7 months - 4 years ago. A single cigg did me in at that time - that one cigg was just a curiosity but here I am now. At that time reading Allen Carrs book made it quite easy, now I'm getting very very anxious reading the same book... 

And guess what's the most horrible thing, the thing that causes me the most guilt is? I am a doctor, a certified medical practitioner who has helped other people quit by scaring them, cajoling them, by supporting them... And I never did it myself....

Bleh seems like ive started to trade one thing for another.. advice?

I have been smoking since I was 17 now 22.. off and on, mostly socially 1 or 2 a day or up to half a pack when drinking.. I quit drinking heavily now I am smoking more than ever. Its only been 3 weeks I been smoking alot though daily and starting to feel cravings for them, what do you all suggest?

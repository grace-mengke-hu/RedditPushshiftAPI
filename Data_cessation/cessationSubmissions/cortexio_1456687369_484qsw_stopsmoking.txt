Smoking f*s with my brain

Hi there,

I smoke (cigarettes) and i'm a bit depressed because my brain is flooded with thoughts and random fantasy stories. I try to stop smoking on a regular basis but i'm starting to recognise a pattern here. When i stop smoking my mind is clear. I live in the now. The second i start smoking my brain goes fantasy mode. Most of these stories are about frustrating events in my past but i think about things i could have done differently to avoid them. I have no idea why i'm thinking so much about these things, but it seems i only do this during days when i'm smoking.

I don't think alot of other people have experienced this. If you know why this happens to me,, please let me know.

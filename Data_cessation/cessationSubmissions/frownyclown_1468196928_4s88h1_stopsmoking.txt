2 Weeks down, cravings minimal, feel better, but tired a lot...

I am so happy to have stayed 100% nicotine free for 14 days now.  I know its just the beginning of the rest of my life but 14 days is a record and also feels good.  I am starting to feel just plain normal now.  However, I am tired a lot. Not that I can't do stuff, but if I relax at all, like watch Netflix, I nearly fall asleep no matter what time it is.  At least I am going to bed early!  I just wonder if others have experienced that kind of fatigue and when it changed?

I just threw away my vape, any helps with withdrawls?

So long  story short, I am really addicted. And it has been doing more harm than it has helped when I vape/smoke nicotine. I finally overcame myself and threw it away in a random dumpster I found downtown. Any help with withdrawls, I am just trying to stop because I recently noticed how much of an asshole I am when I haven't vaped in a long time. So any tips to get through horrible withdrawls?

TL:DR Vaping sucked, got rid of it. Now withdrawls are going to start, any tips to get through it?

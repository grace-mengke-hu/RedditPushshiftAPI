I don't know what to do.

I haven't even had nicorette in weeks. I drank a jumbo texas style margarita at dinner and now I just want to go back out and buy cigarettes... in the middle of typing this my husband brought out some tequilla he found downstairs. I don't even want any, but I do want cigarettes. I feel like I am permanently messed up and I dont know what to do. I'm a mom, for fuck's sake. I can't smoke around my kid... but I also feel like I can't be a non-smoker..

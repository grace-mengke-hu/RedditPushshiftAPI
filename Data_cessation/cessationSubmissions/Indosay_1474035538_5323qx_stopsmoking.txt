It actually feels good to deny myself when the craving strikes.

I tried qutting a couple years ago.  Lasted about two weeks, but it was a daily struggle.  I kept telling myself I was quitting, I was quitting, I was quitting.  But just ended up not being able to do it and broke down one night and have been smoking ever since.  

This past weekend, I read something on this sub that really struck me.  The next day that I smoke will be the day I look back on from the hospital bed regretting that I ever picked it back up.  That was Sunday morning.  It had been a nice Sunday and I didn't want such a nice Sunday to be the day that I looked back on as the day that cut short my life.  So I just told myself I wasn't gonna smoke that Sunday.  

I've been telling myself this every day for a week and it's worked.  One big difference I've noticed in my thinking is instead of saying "I'm quitting" I've been saying "I quit."  It's not a process, it's a decision.  I'm not a smoker any more.  And honestly, every time I get a craving or my brain tries to trick me, it's been awesome to deny myself that.  To be stronger than a stupid addiction.  Yeah, it sucks or whatever, and yeah I still want to smoke, but it's not killing me.  And again, it feels so good to not be lying to myself.  I've quit, end of story.  

And besides, it's Friday, end of the work week, and it's beautiful outside.  I don't want such a nice Friday or such a nice upcoming weekend to be the weekend I look back on as the weekend that cut my life short.  Stay strong!

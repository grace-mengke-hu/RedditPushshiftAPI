28 days quit and having a really hard time.

I have stopped smoking for 28 days now. First week was ghost hard because of the nicotine withdrawal. After that it wasn't too bad, but the last couple of days have been awful.

I want to smoke so bad. I don't know why I quit anymore. I just feel really sad and depressed. If I keep feelings like I have the last couple of days I'd rather smoke.... 

Anybody else experience this 'delayed' withdrawal feelings? I really feel like buying a pack and smoke a couple tonight. The sigarettes feel like friends that I really miss... ðŸ˜”

Leaving this sub. Wanna say thanks to everyone for your support. 4 Months (125 days) Couldn't have done it without you!!! Some last words..

-Just remember it's going to be hard - but you want this

-The first couple weeks or so are going to be LONG 

-Don't fool yourself into thinking that you're okay with being a smoker

-By quitting smoking you are losing a piece of your identity. Learn not to identify yourself (to yourself and others) as a smoker

-Start looking for things to occupy your time in a positive way, preferably social activities with people who don't smoke

-Focus on your overall physical and mental health. Character building, daily physical activities, and a healthy diet

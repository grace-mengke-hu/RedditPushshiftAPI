Question about badges and keeping track of days smoke free.

Hey guys, I just had a quick question regarding badges and your quit date.
If I quit smoking at 11pm on 12/5/2014 should my badge date be Dec 5th or Dec 6th? I have it on Dec 6th so my badge shows the amount of days completed being smoke free. But it is my second day of the quit.

Does anyone know what the date should be set to?

Thanks guys :)

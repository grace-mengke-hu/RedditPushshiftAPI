Two weeks :D - I managed to hang on after returning to office. Noticing some new things...

I managed to get back to office and be around smokers without giving in to the craving. I know it is a never ending fight but I feel like I have a handle on it. 

Now that my sense of smell is returning it is shocking how strong smokers smell as they walk past me. It hits me strongly and reminds me how much I must have smelt before I quit. Wow.

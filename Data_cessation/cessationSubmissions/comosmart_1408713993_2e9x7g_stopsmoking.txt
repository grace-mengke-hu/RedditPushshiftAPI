Like a Ghost Limb

I found myself watching a show after dinner last night and suddenly I got up because I remembered I needed something, but by the time I got to the hallway, I realized, that I was on my way to the stand where I used to keep cigs...there are none there.  It was like reaching to scratch a limb I no longer have...very weird.

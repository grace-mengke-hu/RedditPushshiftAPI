"Grumpyness"

Hey there,

I decided that I want to quit smoking on sunday, and I had my last cigarette. I was fine yesterday, but starting today I am having great trouble focusing at my work (I've basically been doing nothing the past 2 hours), and I have been really passive agressive towards my loved ones.

I know that this is most likely just a phase, but it pressures me into picking up a cig immensely right now (I bet you know the feeling), so I am desperate for a piece of advice how I can make this stop. I can not afford being unproductive at work, and I do not want to hurt my family in the process. I want to regain my focus and calm my nerves. Any Ideas what I can do to achieve that without picking up a cig?

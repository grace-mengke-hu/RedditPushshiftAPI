Well done us.

Just checking in with one of my top two subreddits, the other being stopdrinking. Just had one of those moments where I'm really glad I quit when I did. Just taking deep breaths can be so satisfying. I went to the beach a few times this summer, it's so nice being able to hold your breathe easier and much longer/not get tired as quickly just in general. Anyway if you're reading this: thanks! And good job us! Or if you're new or you're struggling: you can do this! We can do this! Nothing good comes from smoking! Who the fuck wants to burn their money? It'd literally be better for your health to buy the pack and just immediately throw it in the garbage haha Anyway think I'm getting pretty rambly. But hey I did it! We did it! Great job us, let's keep being awesome.

Feeling silly (first day)

This is my first day of no nicotine. First started by cutting down on cigarettes then went to e-cig only. My last puff off of the e cig was at about 8pm last night.   
   
I can not stop thinking about smoking and I'm starting to feel really silly about it. I could use some words of encouragement and some tips.   
   
I've never really put effort into quitting before and I have the will power to quit I just need a little push to keep me in that mind set :)

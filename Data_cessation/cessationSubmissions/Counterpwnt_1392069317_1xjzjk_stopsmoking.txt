The worst part is the most ironic.

I'm almost to my 72nd hour of not smoking (will be 11:30pm tonight). I think the worst part is thinking, "Man, the rest of my life I can't smoke?" It's so bizarre to think about how the whole goal is to quit smoking entirely, yet my brain keeps saying, "Just make it through another day, then you can have one since it'll have been X days."

WhyTF does something exist that programs us to kill ourselves? I can't stop wondering that.

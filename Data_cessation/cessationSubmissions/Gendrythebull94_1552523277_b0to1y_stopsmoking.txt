I think my favorite depiction of smokers is in Family Guy

There’s an episode where Peter takes up smoking, and the whole time wherever he goes he just has a big cloud of smoke following him everywhere, even when he’s not smoking. I always felt dirty when I smoked. Not like dirty dirty, but like Peter in that episode, like I just had this foul smelling toxic cloud hanging around me that I couldn’t get rid of. 
I officially switched to an ecig a couple weeks ago, and even though I know it’s not necessarily better, it’s amazing the differences I’m already noticing. I can breathe easier. I can taste more. And my sense of smell is crazy. Smelling food cooking or someone’s perfume/cologne on the street or my office - it hits me with a nostalgia of my childhood before I picked up this shitty habit. 
I finally noticed just how bad my apartment smells. Like stale smoke has absorbed into everything. And I’m amazed at how strong cigarettes smell on other smokers now when they come in from a break. One of my old smoker buddies came into the office today, and I could smell her coming without even seeing her from 20 feet away.
For all you smokers out there who want to quit but just can’t yet, switch it up for a week and take note of the difference. It’s more motivating than anything I’ve tried before. I’ve still got a long way to go. The ecig’s a good first step, but it’s far from healthy. And I know I can get better, it’s just going to take time. 
Here’s to week 3.

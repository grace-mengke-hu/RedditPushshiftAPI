It would make me sick

I can close my eyes and feel the way it would make me nauseated. It's been long enough since I smoked that the nicotine would make me sick. 

I still want one. My brain tells me that it would make the anxiety better. It never did, though. Why would now be different?

It's going to be fine. I'm not going to smoke. The cravings will pass .

I'm just always amazed at how my addict brain will tell me lies that make me want to start back up. 

Bad brain.

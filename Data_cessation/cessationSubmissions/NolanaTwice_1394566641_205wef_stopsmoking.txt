24 hours until that little monster dies.

Roughly 48 hours without nicotine. The nicotine addiction has been kicking my ass for the past 14 years, after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking I'm having no trouble kicking the addictions ass.

I've tried to quit more times than I can count and I've always had a bad temper during the withdrawal phase. But now I'm having no trouble. When someone told me a book could help me stop I thought bull shit, but interestingly enough it did. I know I'm only 2 days out but for the first time I'm 100% confident that I'm done with nicotine forever and I don't feel like I'm losing a friend, I'm simply killing an enemy that has had me on the ropes for all of my adult life.

My psychological need to smoke has been broken, now I'm just counting down the last hours until the physical withdrawal is over with :-D

Don't know how to stop!

As the title says, i dont know how to quit smoking. I am already feeling adverse effects of smoking. I am more addicted to the ritual of buying and lighting up a cigarette. Plus the social setting of being around other smokers has put me in a bad situation. Any advice on what i should do or what can help?

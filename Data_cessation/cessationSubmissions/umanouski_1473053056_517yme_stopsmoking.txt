Weening myself.

So, for the past couple of weeks I've been weening myself off smokes. I went from about 1 and 1/2 packs to 1 pack. Not so hard...but now I'm limiting myself to 3/4 a pack, and now I'm starting to crave them more.  So instead of smoking, I've been outside for over an hour chewing sunflower seeds and the craving has been going away.  Next week, I'm going to go for only half a pack, then the week after, a quarter. Then after that last pack is gone...done. Any advice?  Has anyone else tried this method?

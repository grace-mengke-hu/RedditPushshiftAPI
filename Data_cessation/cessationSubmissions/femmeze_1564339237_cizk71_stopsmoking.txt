Day 2 is killing me

I didn't think this would be so hard. I guess I'm just looking for some motivation or advice. I just found this subreddit today and I'm very thankful.

Vaped/smoked cigs pretty consistently for about 2 years. Yesterday something clicked with me and I knew that I had to be done. I gave my juul away and I've been trying to just deal with the cravings. Today I feel like I'm in a blur. I cannot focus for shit, and I can't stop thinking about smoking. How do you surpass these cravings? I've thought about trying the gum or something to help, but I don't know much about it and its pretty expensive. 

I never truly realized how much I let nicotine control me for so long.

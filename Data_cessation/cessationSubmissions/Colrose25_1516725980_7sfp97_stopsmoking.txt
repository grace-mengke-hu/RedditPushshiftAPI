It’s bizarre

I feel like this is a totally bizarre thought,. I’m looking into the near future thinking how am I going to enjoy that without smoking?? We go camping a lot. Just thinking about sitting around a campfire without a cigarette makes me anxious. How will I make  it through a concert without smoking?!? This is bizarre right?

2 1/2 weeks in, most of the time I don’t think about smoking. I hardly have cravings. When I do they are quick (a few seconds) but very intense.

It’s strange how in those 3 seconds, it can feel so normal to think I would pick back up a cig, but when the craving passes, I can’t believe I would even think for a moment of taking another puff.

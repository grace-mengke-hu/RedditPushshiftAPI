Can't quit smoking if you're a single parent of 3....

Why does if feel like my family is falling apart if I can't get myself together? I'm the "Capitan" of this ship and  3 days without a single cigarette, everything is falling apart. There has to be a easier way to quit smoking and not go through the side effects that come from quiting smoking...

The first week!

I have been smoke-free for a week.  My mom is sick in the Hospital, I found out 20 minutes before I had planned on smoking my last cigarette, but I still stuck to it.  I recognized that it's painful seeing her like this, and it makes me want to smoke, but that smoking will not make anyone feel better!  I resisted the urge and recognize that it is possible to get through tough times without those filthy fucking things!

Thanks to everyone on here for that bit of inspiration.  Love you Mom.

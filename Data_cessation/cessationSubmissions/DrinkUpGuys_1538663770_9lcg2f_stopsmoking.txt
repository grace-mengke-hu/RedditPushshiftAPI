In grad school, planning to quit after I pass my major exams. Any preparation advice?

My doctor agreed (more like she supported me) that waiting until I pass my comprehension exams in March is a fine timeline for me to start quitting smoking. 

I've smoked for almost 15 years. It's much less of a reactive craving, and very much just something I really enjoy. It's the most consistent, reliable thing in my life. 

What would y'all have done/did you to to start mentally preparing to quit smoking?

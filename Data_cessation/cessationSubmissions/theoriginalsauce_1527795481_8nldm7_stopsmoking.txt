FENTON!

My two year old let the new dog, Dobby, outside today and I had to chase him down.

I made it a block after I had to quit running after him because I just couldn’t breath. All the while I’m thinking of the YouTube video Fenton.

Today is the day I quit smoking. (Now  to remember my actual password so I can ask the mods to update my tag)

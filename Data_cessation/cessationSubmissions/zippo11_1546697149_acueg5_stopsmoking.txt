Stopped smoking New Year’s Eve.. sleepiness?

So I smoked for 2-3 years 10-15 a day and then quit for 2-3 years and then started smoking once or twice while I was drinking, then once in the evening if I got stressed or whatever and then it turned into a couple after 8pm and then 6pm and then turned into a 10 a day habit for about 2 months but I quit NYE and luckily it’s been easy, every time I get a craving I just focus on my breathing and that relaxes me abs the craving goes within seconds 

But for the past 2-3 days around 1pm-3pm I’ll just get extremely tired? I workout mostly everyday abd I try be as active and self disciplined as possible but this tiredness is just making it really hard to not have a afternoon nap which makes it harder to sleep at night and I like to get stuff done during the day so sleeping doesn’t help, literally laying in bed now fighting not to close my eyes and sleep 

Did anyone else suffer from afternoon tiredness while quitting?

Just spent 40 minutes getting the computer cleaned out

This is from a customer who is a heavy smoker and smokes around his computer.  [Here are the pics](http://imgur.com/a/YUStK) of the inside before I spent 40 minutes working on, getting it looking new again.  

I was craving this morning before this came in, nice reminder of what we are doing to ourselves when we smoke.

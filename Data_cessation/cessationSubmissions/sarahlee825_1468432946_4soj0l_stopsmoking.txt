Problem with patches and lozenges, seeking advice!

I quit smoking 2 days ago with my husband. He's going cold turkey and I am trying with stop smoking aides. The patch has worked in the past but this time around I wanted to try a different avenue because I put a patch on when I first wake up but then because of my baby I don't get to shower until around 10 am and it falls off! Also don't like putting it in a different spot every time or the sticky spots it leaves on my skin. I decided to give the lozenges a try and by my second one (2 hours after my first) I was so sick to my stomach I had to spit it out after 10 min! 

My questions are, does it get better? Should I move down to the 2mg? Is the gum any better? I'm just worried about cold turkey and having the strength to keep it up! I'll be 35 in a month and a half and that was my goal, must be quit by 35!!

Thanks for any help/advice.

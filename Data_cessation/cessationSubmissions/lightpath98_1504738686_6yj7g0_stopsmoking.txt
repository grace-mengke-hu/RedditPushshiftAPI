Day 1 , for a better version of me

Fk smoking , i dont even enjoy it , after taking a deep look into myself i realised That i started smoked to seek the approval of others and i tho That it could help with my brain fog but instead it actually made it worse...This Is not me.. This Is not who I am .. I'm out. (Just threw a whole pack along with the lighter in the trash where it belongs)

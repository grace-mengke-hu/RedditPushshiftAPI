I don't think i've ever had a craving so bad

I've been off weeks smoking on the weekends while drinking for a few months now...no slip ups during the last few weeks (besides the weekends themselves!). Pretty proud of that

I feel like my skin is screaming at me and my chest hurts like I'm thirsty but can't find water. I took a walk to try to bum a cigarette, got a block away from the pharmacy where I was going to buy a pack and managed to walk back to my office and sit back down and start typing. I haven't had a craving like this in months i think. Ugh!

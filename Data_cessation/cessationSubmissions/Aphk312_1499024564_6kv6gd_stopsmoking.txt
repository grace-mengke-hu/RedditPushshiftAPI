I Can't stop crying.

Almost 3 days in and I can't do this. I can't stop crying. I am going cold turkey I hate this please someone make it stop. I feel so lost and I miss it so much I don't even remember why I wanted to quit. The cravings never stop. I can't. I quit drinking. I quit drugging. When I quit smoking I will have nothing left. I don't do any of the stuff I used to enjoy. I work, I take care of my kids, and thats it.  I miss fun. God life used to be fun. Please tell me it will get better.

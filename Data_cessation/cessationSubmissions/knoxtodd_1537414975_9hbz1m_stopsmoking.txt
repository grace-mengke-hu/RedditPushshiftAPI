Day 1 tomorrow

Hi all,

First time poster
8th time quitter

24 y/o male, 6 years on the nicotine

I say that because it’s been about 3 years smoking, 3 years vaping.

Anyways, this is the first time I’ve prepared this much. I made my quit plan, told my loved ones, and feel more confident. 

If y’all have any personal tips to fight the cravings, oh boy I’d appreciate it.

Let’s do this!

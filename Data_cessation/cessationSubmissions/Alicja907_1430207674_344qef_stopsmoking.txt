Scared I'm going to start smoking again...

A little less than a year ago, my mother passed away. She was my only close relative, kind of my rock and one of just a few people I was close to, and I haven't taken it very well. While I'm doing great in my quit, the closer it gets to the anniversary the more stressed I get. Before I quit I used cigarettes to deal with negative emotions. To make it worse, smoking was one of the things my mother and I did together a lot before she died.

I'm around a *lot* of temptation at my work; the majority of people I interact with every day are smokers and my job puts me in almost constant contact with tobacco products. I'm scared that as it gets closer I won't be able to keep myself from buying a pack, or asking someone for one. Possibly justifying it as 'remembering mom', or thinking 'just one won't make me start smoking again'.

Someone tell me otherwise.

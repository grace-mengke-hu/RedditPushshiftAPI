Looking for advice. Trying to get over a personal hurdle.

So, Ive been thinkning pretty frequently about quitting for a couple of years. Ive been smoking for ten years now and I think Im getting close to being ready to leave it behind. 

Though, Ive reached a problem. While Im entirely certain the chemical dependency is there and its an uncomfortable obstacle, the thing thats prevented me from quitting is that smoking has always been a tool to get peace of mind for me. 

You can depart from most social situations and decompress without anybody questioning you most of the time. Its a convenient excuse to go do absolutely nothing for a good ten minutes with a good chance of being left alone and Ive always really enjoyed that. Plus its also been a nice vector for meeting people and I have met some of the most important people in my life because of these breaks (and id like to emphasise the breaks part because it wasnt necessarily the cigarettes).

How can i get past this? Its really a double edged sword. Have any of you had this issue and found another way to have that convenience? Is this just the effects of long term addiction and im just trying to rationalize things? I dont feel like I am because Ive always been the kind of person thats benefited from breaks like this.

I really hope this doesnt sound like a dumb question. Im sure i could kick the habit if I could just find a way to deal with this.

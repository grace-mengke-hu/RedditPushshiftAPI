Experience of 2 weeks...

So here I am, 2 weeks in! There were some looong days of eating carrot sticks and 'smoking' a  drinking straw that felt painfully slow. And yet, when I look back on the 2 weeks as a whole, it passed by with amazing normalcy, except for one dark-day-of-the-soul when I felt like I was completely falling apart. This was around day 10. I think it was the nicotine monster having a dying fit of a temper tantrum in my brain. I cried, I fretted, over silly nothings.

This sub has helped immensely. It led me to the Allen Carr book which successfully brainwashed me against being hooked on nicotine. It helped me reframe my cravings for a cigarette as the 'Nicotine Monster' suffering in distress and getting weaker. It helped me feel that my pangs for a cigarette were evidence of victory in my battle. 

Thanks to all on this sub... you guys are great and I read every day even if I don't post. It keeps me sure of my victory!

Do cravings increase when you do not get enough rest?

Yesterday was probably the most frustrating day since my quit. The night before, I barely got 4 hours of sleep, woke up feeling blue and stayed blue the rest of the day. I pushed myself out of the house, went around did stuff I'd been putting off for a while, got back home still feeling miserable. I stopped trying to do anything productive, watched a couple of movies and went to sleep early. 

Up again this morning and I'm like a juggernaut. I've been studying since morning without being irritable. I haven't had any cravings at all since morning. 

Still, just thinking how close I was yesterday to breaking the streak has me worried.

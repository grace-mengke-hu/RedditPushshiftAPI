Nearly caved today...but didn't! ðŸ˜ƒ

No extra stress, nothing out of the ordinary but when I finished work today I had the strongest craving. Kept thinking, just one to see how disgusting it is now, just one to prove I'm over it, one won't hurt. I ended up shouting at myself as I was driving home, other drivers must have thought I was nuts! I kept telling myself how stupid I was being to even think that I could have 'just one', how far I've come just to throw the towel in now and how selfish I was being. My kids are so proud of me having quit and I refuse to let them or myself down. 

So nearly caved today but still going strong and quite proud that I talked myself out of it. Have taken a lot from this sub and I do believe it's all the posts and advice that I've read on here that's played a huge part in me staying clean.

Is it my imagination... as I psych myself up for a quit.. my FINAL one on Monday... smokes, my last cigars.. all taste like CRAP!

Maybe I've watched and chatted and forumed so much, I've made smoking seem so offensive to myself, the taste, the mess... blah blah ... I'm almost considering just pulling the plug early!? And FYI I'm going to stop drinking too, otherwise I feel I don't have a snowballs chance... Am I imagining things or what? And I fear I'm only going to last half an hour... Wow this is hard!

22 days woohoo!

Hey guys! After four years of smoking I'm 22 days smoke free. I got stupid wasted the night before I quit and woke up with a horrible hang over and haven't smoked or drank since. I woke up that morning and kicked most of my bad habits. Also I have an appointment to apply to school, after taking 3 years off. I feel like I'm finally putting my ducks in a row and I'm very proud of myself. And of all of you :) keep it up everyone!

17 days smoke free

I feel odd. A vacuum like something is missing. I used to use smoking as a way of escaping conversations a lot. Now I just go to the toilet a lot more. I miss the alibi. I don't miss the actual smoking because I moved to half cigarettes a while back. But I miss standing outside and talking to people.

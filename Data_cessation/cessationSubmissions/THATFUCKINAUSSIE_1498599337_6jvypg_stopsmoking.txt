2.5 months down, never felt better.

Just sharing because after 12 years of smoking it's a big bloody deal. I'm richer (cost per packet in Australia is $35+), healthier, happier, and better smelling. The people around me are no longer repulsed, and if it's cold I can just go ahead and stay inside.

Best decision I've ever made. To anyone looking to do the same: DO IT! No ragrets. Hit me up by PM if you need to talk.

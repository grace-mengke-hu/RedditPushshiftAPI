New here. Question about ADHD medication and cravings

I'm 20 and currently quitting for the 3rd time. It's been about a week since I've smoked my last cigarette. I'm in college and regularly smoke a pack every 24hrs, if not more. I live in a fraternity house and everybody smokes, so it's a harsh environment to maintain a quitting attitude. What I have noticed, however, is that my main cravings are a result of the medication I take. I have ADHD and take 70mg Vyvanse daily, which for some reason really *really* makes me want to light up. Toward the end of the day when the medication wears off, I don't even think about smoking anymore. Why is this? Have any quitters out there had a similar problem? How did you deal with it?

Together, we've gone 11,664,968 days smoke free according to BadgeBot: lowballing the numbers, that's $34 million dollars saved collectively.

I know that we're not all in this for the money aspect, but I just did some quick calculations: assuming a half-pack a day for each person in here and a $6 pack of smokes, we've saved $34,994,904. That's like 4 million good beers at the bar. Or 10,000 awesome vacations. Or a few hundred nice cars.  

That's a shit load of money. Nice job, y'all.  

(I know there are people who set badges and fell back into the habit without resetting, but that's part of the reason I went low on the smokes per day)

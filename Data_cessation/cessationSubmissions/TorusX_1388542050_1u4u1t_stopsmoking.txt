A month in and i need some encouraging advice

So my last cigarette was 1 month, 1 day and 23 hours ago. I've also quit smoking weed in a couple day s before the cigs due to some shitty anxiety attacks. (i have been using an e-cig/nicorette which I do want to try and stop soon as well.) Anyway, I haven't really been coughing anything up but I've been having this weird feeling when I breathe which i assume is the tar and phlegm breaking down in there. But it still feels kinda freaky. To top things off, i have a pulled chest muscle that started this whole sober streak ( i ended up feeling it one day at work, smoked weed and started freaking out thinking i was having a heart attack.) I have been to On-care 3 times and my actual Physician , 2 EKG's and blood work and everything was fine. Still got mild anxiety going for me though (no attacks though since i quit smoking weed) just kind of worried waiting for my chest to heal because it really can feel like heart attack symptoms lol. I know this kind of went all over the place and i apologize. Just like the title says and i'm not sure where else to turn. thanks

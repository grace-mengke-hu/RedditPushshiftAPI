Relapsed after 2 days and a half of quitting.

Saints must sleep and even prophets must play

Yes I played a little bit.

Around 1 o’clock P.M. I fetched a quarter smoked old cigarette from my old ash tray and grabbed my lighter. I sat on my room’s floor and placed them in front of me. The ashtray in the middle, on the right of it the lighter and on the left of it the cigarette. Kept placing it in my mouth and releasing, until I finally lighted it up and smoked it. It finished fairly fast. Ended fairly fast. A bit of pleasure, a bit of high and instant gratification. Cruel experience.

Any comments on this relapse?

8 hours so far...

So this morning I had two cigarettes left in my pack. I smoked them on my drive to work. Most days at work I have co workers who I smoke with during our daily breaks, but all of them are on holidays right now. 

So, I thought why not try to stop while I have the oppourtunity to do so without the daily social pressure. I have made it through both coffee breaks and my lunch break without caving and buying a pack. Actually, when I debated with myself on buying a pack I just could not will myself to do it.

I feel strange right now and I can't explain. I have no urge to smoke right now, but I'm very afraid I will give in on my drive home. I keep repeating "Look, it's already been eight hours, why not try to make it through the entire day. Can't be that hard." I'm kind of terrified to quit, and sort of want to cry, but I also know I can't afford it and I've been thinking a lot about quitting lately. 

Anyway, sorry, I just needed to ramble about it for a bit. I'm dating a guy who doesn't smoke, I messaged him about it earlier, but as a non smoker, he doesn't understand. So I thought maybe I would ramble to some people who understand.

Just quit after 35 years!

I have quit before but always started again - once after a year and a half. I started at age 16 and had heavy-smoking parents and a chimney-like grandma. 

What made me get serious this time was hiking and feeling that my lungs were in a vise...all those years catching up in a scary concrete way. I have two children who have also begged me to quit.

I am 5 days in. Wish me luck!

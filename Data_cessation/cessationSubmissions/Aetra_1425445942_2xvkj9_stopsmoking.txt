Couldn't keep water down on Champix (Chantix). Wanting to try Zyban but not sure.

I tried Champix back in 2013 and was so nauseous all the time that I couldn't keep anything, including water, down. I tried taking it with food, without food, even with a prescription anti-nausea medication and it made no difference. I was basically living on the floor of my bathroom because I'd throw up at the drop of a hat with nothing setting it off. Had nothing messing with my hormones either (no baby, no hormonal birth control) so it wasn't a morning sickness type deal.

I'm wanting to try Zyban since its a different type of drug to Champix, but I was wondering if anyone who had an adverse reaction to Champix had tried it? If so, what was your experience?

Zyban is basically my last resort short of plain old will power. Oral NRTs make me sick no matter the strength (inhaler, lozenges, gum, etc.), and I get chemical burns from the patches despite not being allergic to adhesives.

(Picking myself up) *Trying again*

After talking a lot of good shit about how I was going to stop smoking and what not I ended my streak of 7 days this month. I've been smoking like a chimney since.

Now after re-evaluating myself I want to give it one last shot.

I have one last cig in the box and plan on enjoying it today for we will never meet again. **Hopefully**

5 days smoke free

I am on day 5. Yesterday was a stressful day so I really wanted a cigarette but I got through. I thought about how disappointed I would be with myself if I had one. And that one cigarette would lead to more. The Smokefree app has been super helpful for me. I started by making a page in my journal of reasons to quit/reasons to continue smoking. I made a page to track the money I am saving by not smoking. I also wrote down items I could gift myself with the money I save. I changed the home screen on my phone to a picture of a smokers lung. Aromatherapy with essential oils is helpful too.

Quit smoking...Now i need some other advice form you ex-smokers / "long time" quitters.

So! The problem im having is that since i gave up the cancersticks i put on about 6 kg in pure belly fat almost. I used to be reasonably skinny now i have a small football for a stomach ( well not that much but not flat anyway) im male 23 and im about 178 cm (5.8ft) and weigh about 70-71(153 pounds) kg. I used to be around 64-5 as a smoker and i liked that weight. I wanna get rod off the extra fat and decrease my appetite.
I find my self craving more food than i used to and like always wanting a snack or something. I dont know if any of you has had the same experiences but i just wanted to know if you have  any tips/something that helped you "replace the replacement for cigg cravings" i mean i replacec iggarettes with snacks food in the beginning and now im still eating as much even tough i dont have any cravings for cigarettes anymore.

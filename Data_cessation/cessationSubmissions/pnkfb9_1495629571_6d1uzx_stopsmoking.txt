each day without smoking is easier!

Yep guys! This is one of the best feelings ever! I thought that I couldn't ever do something like stop smoking, but it seems the opposite now! 

As per the title, yes I saw that after the first week that was clearly hellish (mostly I've found that the real problem was find out how to fill the time that was previously filled by a cig rather than the cigarette itself), now I feel that each day I crave really less than the past day. Also, I see that my anxiety is dimishing as the time pass.... hope to continue on this healthy path! We can do it guys! Day 10/11 here!(don't remember exactly if 10 or 11 eheh)

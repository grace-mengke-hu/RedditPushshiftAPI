I've just finished my last cigarette.

I posted a week or so ago, saying I was quitting on my 24th birthday. I've just come home from a night having some birthday drinks with some close friends.

I've just smoked my last cigarette before bed, and tomorrow I will be waking up and not having my morning smoke. I am truly done with it.

I know the next few days will be hard, but I'm excited. I turned 24 today and I want to live as long as possible. Farewell smokes, it was fun whilst it lasted.

I'll be posting here a lot I'm sure, for moral support. Goodnight!

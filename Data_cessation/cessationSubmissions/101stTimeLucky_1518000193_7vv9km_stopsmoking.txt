[Day 2] Triggers! They're everywhere.

Finished eating. Urge.

Time to spare between errands. Urge.

That little voice saying nobody would know, you'd be no worse off than you were yesterday.

I think listing triggers is a good way to identify and understand them so I can resist them. I may add more as they come up today.

What are yours?

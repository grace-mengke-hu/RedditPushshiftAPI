How do you deal with stress smoking?

Hi all,

I have been thinking about quitting for over a year now. I usually smoke about 5-10 cigarettes a day (sometimes as high as 15, if I'm stressed enough), and have been smoking for about five years. I managed to make it two days and then immediately relapsed. 

In the past, I've been able to cope with cravings based on location. I usually smoke on campus (I'm a Master's student) and can usually control myself when I get a craving. My major problem is that I smoke to deal with emotional stress. For example: today, just after passing the 48 hour mark, I got into a fight with my partner. She said that I was being too negative (complaining about contracting acute bronchitis, and this class/subject that I've always sort of disliked) and didn't want to be around me. I don't know why I got so upset, but I did, and bought another pack. I've smoked four cigarettes today as a result. I feel ashamed and useless and like I don't have control over my self. 

How do I cope with stress smoking? I've made it as far as a month without smoking but always collapse when confronted with emotional stress. Am I just being a pansy? 

Any help at all is much appreciated. I need to do this for future-me, so I NEED to be able to overcome stress smoking.

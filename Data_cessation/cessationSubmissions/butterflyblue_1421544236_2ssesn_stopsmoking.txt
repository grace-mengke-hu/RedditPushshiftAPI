We quit! but my cravings have been killer today!

My husband and I are coming up on our first week smoke free.  I'm having a really hard day.  Since I woke up I've been craving...I've chewed gum, I've drank water, I've taken a walk, I've cleaned, I've eaten fruit, I've meditated and I've tried drowning myself in crafts but and I can shake this.  

The addict in me is saying one wont hurt...just go buy one, feed the beast and you will feel better. Until I'm done... then I'll feel like a fucking failure :(

Finally quitting. Please share tips and advice.

I have finally decided to quit smoking. I stopped fapping for New Years and have been strong. It occured to me that if I can quit that, I can quit anything, and smoking needs to be priority number one. I am afraid though. If anyone has any little tips that helped them stay strong and vigilant please share them with me. I would appreciate any ideas.

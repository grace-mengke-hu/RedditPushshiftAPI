20 hours in and I broke

First post here, literally JUST found this subreddit. Im 19m and struggling with some bad depression, even worse when I come home from college. I feel borderline suicidal if I dont smoke, but i know its killing me. Only hoping for some kind words if possible, as my parents are lobbying hard every time I smell of tobbaco for me to quit, guilting me and making me feel even worse. Any advice in lessening the cravings a bit?

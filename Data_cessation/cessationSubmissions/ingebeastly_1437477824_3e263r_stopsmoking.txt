Haven't smoked in 2 weeks, how to handle anxiety?

So it's been 2 weeks and despite working in a city with a lot of smokers I've managed to stay strong for now. But I work 40 hours a week, with a 3 hour commute everyday and lately I've been feeling more and more down everyday. Any suggestions how to fight these feelings without tobacco?

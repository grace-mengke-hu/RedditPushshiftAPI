Day 4... Not having a good time...

When did the uneasy feeling that was just beneath the surface subside? I don't know how describe it. It feels like I might lose my temper at someone or cry or just scream at the top of lungs at no one. 

I'm just really feeling like a damn pressure cooker or like a cartoon version of a thermometer that's about to explode.

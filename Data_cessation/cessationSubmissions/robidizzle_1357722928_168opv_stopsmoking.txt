3 weeks in--my experience and what you could expect

So as of a couple hours ago, its officially been 3 weeks since my last cigarette. Overall I just want to thank you guys for giving me the inspiration to quit, I've tried a bunch of times before but this time was definitely the easiest and longest lasting.

What changes I've noticed about myself;
Physically, I have a much stronger/ more frequent erections and can breath in/out deeper. However, I've spent the last week having a very serious cough. A lot of black mucus has been coughed out of my lungs/trachea and after each one I feel myself becoming more healthy (its a very weird feeling, and people tend to think I'm sick.) Oh, and now I can actually smell smoke on other people... I guess that makes me an official non-smoker :)

Mentally I am a lot happier, for various reasons but mostly pride. I also have a lot more energy and much more self control. I just have to resist the urge of being "that-guy who just quit yet keeps trying to convince all his friends they should quit all the time." I hate that guy.

Anyways just wanted to fill ya guys in, good luck and remember you have the power to quit, you just have to unleash that power whenever you have urges.

Do tell me if these symptoms are common

Today is my 8th day cold turkey and I have a cold since like the past 6-7 days, also more phlegm is generated there's a slight chance its due to the weather(it's rainy season here) but its highly unlikely. Also I started gym so maybe its due to that. I think its quite common, I know its nothing to worry about I'm just curious.

Expecting a SO to Quit - what am I dealing with?

Has anyone dealt with (or been) a smoker that has promised to quit to the significant other?  

My partner promised me he would quit smoking, but has not show any progress, initiative, or desire to quit.  It's been about 6 months since his "quitting date", but he hasn't slowed a bit.  He has been smoking for roughly 10 years.  I'm wondering, what kind of event is he waiting for to trigger his desire to quit?  Are there any events that make you want to quit?  We both have family members who have died well before their time from lung cancer, I don''t know what else he could need to experience to help him realize what he is doing.

Is there anything I can do to help him?  Whenever I mention it he gets extremely angry...  but the thought of him dying 30 years before me is destroying me.

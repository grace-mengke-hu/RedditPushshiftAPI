I can't wrap my brain around this struggle.

I have smoked for a year solid. I smoked off and on socially in high school and college but never steadily. After my divorce last year I picked it up as stress relief. But now, I hate it with a passion but keep giving in to the craving. I feel lost and scared. I don't want this to be a part of my life but I just can't seem to quit.

Since I was 14

And I'm turning 19 on Saturday. That's how long I've been smoking. Both of my parents smoke. My mom's looking at COPD and still can't quit. I used to get sick when I was a kid and stayed at nonsmoker's houses for a weekend, I'd get withdrawal and I'd be moody as shit. I don't even know how I picked up the habit myself but now I smoke just as much, if not more than, my 6'4" 150lb manly boyfriend. Shameful considering I'm 5'3" and 128. That particular aspect makes me think about quitting because it just puts it into perspective.

I've beat an addiction to percs before, so I suppose this shouldn't be too hard... except I know my boyfriend won't quit with me. And I've been reading up on quitting lately, it seems a lot of people gain weight. This is something that isn't okay at all with me. I realize for some people it's likely from using the candy method, and I have the sort of metabolism that gains weight from thinking about food, so about how necessary is replacing the action? 

Tl;dr: I've been smoking for five years. I smoke like a man. I want to quit but really don't want to gain weight or eat a lot of candy. Please share with me your knowledge.

I survived the weekend! 1 week down!

After 16 long years of smoking a pack a day or more, i finally decided that i'm done with cigs. Tired of coughing up lung butter, running out of breath easy, smelling like an ashtray, being the only person i know who still smokes...... countless other reasons to quit. I am using a vape pen with the lowest nicotine % in the e-juice. Once i hit 2 weeks i'll be switching to 0mg nicotine e-juice, and two weeks after that i'll be saying goodbye to the vape pen too. I'm already noticing a big difference just 1 week in, and i'm really looking forward to seeing my family in 2 months without the stinky grim reaper following me around! Just wanted to share that. Thanks r/stopsmoking for your support!

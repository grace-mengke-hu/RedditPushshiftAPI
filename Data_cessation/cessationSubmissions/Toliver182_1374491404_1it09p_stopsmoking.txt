Oral Fixation-- advice?

Hi All

I have tried almost all NRT's inhaler, gum, sprays.

I'm now trying patches for the first time.

previously with the inhaler, gum and sprays i was still in charge of administering my nicotine.

The patches i am not, i feel this is why it will work for me.

however i still feel like i need to do something with my hands & mouth..

any advice ?

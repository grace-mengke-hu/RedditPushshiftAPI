Standing at the bus stop....

.....and some smokers were looking for a dry spot to stand (it's raining) and they come next to me. I'm on day 2 and it was tempting to ask them for a cigarette, but I told myself that I'm a non-smoker. And somehow I survived!! Also, they lit up a joint (marijuana cigarette). That was tempting too, as I also smoke weed sometimes, but that is sooooo much easier to resist, as I have to go to work and drive heavy machinery. 

I have to remember that as much as I want to shout out to the world that quitting smoking is better for everyone, that I have to respect the right for people to make their own decisions.

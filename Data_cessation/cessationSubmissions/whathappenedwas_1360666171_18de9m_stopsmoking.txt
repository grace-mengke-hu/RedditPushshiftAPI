I DID IT!!

I know it's a few days after my real cake day, but I just want to share my mild disbelief with you all - it's been over a year since I quit. It went by so fucking fast, and even though I didn't think I could do it, I distinctly remember telling myself that in a year, I would be so happy with myself if I did. AND I DID. So peace the fuck out cigarettes; I hope you burn, sequestered and alone, in some hell that doesn't produce second-hand smoke for me to inhale.

A YEAR, YO.

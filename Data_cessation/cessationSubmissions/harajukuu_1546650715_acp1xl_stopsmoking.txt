Reasons why I hated being a smoker.

It’s the beginning of Day 4 now (been a heavy smoker for 8 years) and I’m having the worst flu. It’s also the weekend, so I’m feeling kind of restless. Thought writing a list could help keep my mind off things, hopefully you guys could relate to some of these too. 

1. I hate having to lie to colleagues about where I’m going when I’m sneaking out for a smoke. “Oh I’m going down to Starbucks” “oh I need to to make a call” Sometimes I even pretend to be on the phone with my iPhone held up to my ear as I’m walking back to the office just to pre-empt any questions.

2. I hate feeling self conscious about whether people can smell me and find out that I smoke. This results in a huge waste of time where I have to put perfume, wash my hands with soap, rinse my mouth after every cigarette.

3. I hate the panic I get when I know I’m running out of ciggs soon, be it when I wake up, when I’m on my way to work, etc.

4. I hate having to always worry about WHEN I get to smoke. Every place I go I look around for exits/open areas where I can smoke, every airport I check beforehand whether there are smoking areas, worrying about long distance flights and feeling like shit. I remember once I was at JFK and they didn’t have any smoking areas after your pass security, so I actually exited security again just to smoke and nearly missed my flight trying to get back in.

5. I hate making my boyfriend disappointed. He absolutely hates that I smoke. He also has sinus problems and his allergies really flare up whenever I smoke. I also hate it when he tells me that I stink of smoke.

6. I hate it when non-smokers have to wait for me while I finish my cigarette, and I have to keep trying to avoid blowing the smoke into their face. And if it does, the look of disgust on their faces.

Don't miss that smoker's cough.

I'm currently sitting in work hearing my next-room-neighbour absolutely coughing her guts up after having a ciggie break. It's little things like that that remind me why I wanted to stop smoking and I'm so bloody glad that I did.

Keep strong everyone! Although it can be tough to begin with, it is so totally worth it! :)

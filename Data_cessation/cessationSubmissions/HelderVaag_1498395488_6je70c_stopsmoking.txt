The choice

I have quit at least 20 times before this time and I realized one thing: I did not fully commit to not smoking before. I realized that I always figured if I would go through a really hard time, I could always just go and buy some cigarettes again. This time I am saying 'no'. Even when it gets hard, when I am drunk and surrounded by smokers, when I had a difficult day at work, I am not going to buy that pack. In the end, I will find myself wishing I did not do it. It never ends with one anyways: It always ends finding myself smoking at 7 am in my bathrobe while this shit is making me sick. Therefore I am making the choice: I am going to be a non-smoker, whatever happens. 

This is my first Reddit post ever and I am in need of some support :). To all the quitters out there: stay strong. You don't need it in the end.

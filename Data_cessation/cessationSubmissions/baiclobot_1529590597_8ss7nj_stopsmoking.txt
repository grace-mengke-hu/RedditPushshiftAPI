Day 4 - I slipped up last night but I’m still powering through.

I didn’t smoke a cig but my husband smokes weed regularly. (Legal medically in our state) well he occasionally puts loose leaf tobacco in the bottom of his hits. I don’t know why and I never imagined I would be tempted because I always thought it seemed kinda gross?? 
Well last night I smoked a bowl of tobacco and it was really awful. I definitely felt the nicotine but it really wasn’t worth it. 

I woke up this morning feeling better than I have all week so that’s been awesome. There was a good 12 hours between my slip and waking up this morning so I like to think that maybe that small hiccup didn’t put quite as big of a dent in my quit as I worried it would. 
Not one single puff ever again and I really feel good about that. 
I’m also kinda loving all the extra time I’m spending with my little man now that I’m not stepping outside for 15/20 minutes every hour and a half.

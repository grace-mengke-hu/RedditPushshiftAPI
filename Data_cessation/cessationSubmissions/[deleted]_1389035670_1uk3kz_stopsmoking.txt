I've decided it's time to quit. Any pro tips for cold turkey?

Like the title says, I'm going cold turkey. I can't cut back or use anything else like gum, patches, or e-cigs. I need to quit cold or it's just not gonna happen. I've downloaded an app to hopefully keep me on track. So any words of wisdom are very much appreciated.

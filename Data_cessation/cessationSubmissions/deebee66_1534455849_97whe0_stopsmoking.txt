A Puff Away From A Pack ADay

That's my mantra.

After 30 years smoking I had tried everything from cold turkey to acupuncture to patches to gum with no luck. The bottom line was when I quit all I could think about was smoking and the thoughts too over my life until I had a smoke. I finally went to a doctor who prescribed Champix. 


Champix made the difference,but it still wasn't easy. You get a starter pack with increasing dosages. First two times I pissed around and didn't follow the program. Third time around it took. The thing it does is back out the effects of nicotine. You can smoke as much as you want, BUT IT HAS NO EFFECT! It's like puffing air. After a while you're standing there going "why do I do this?", and there is no answer. At that point I made it over the finish line.

The stuff was hard on my stomach, had to adjust dosages accordingly. Gave me amazing dreams, sorry they stopped....

That's my story, maybe it will help someone out there.

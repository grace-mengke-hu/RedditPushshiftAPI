3 Weeks! I can definitely say that I am free of Nicotine! :)

Hi Quitters,

I DID IT. I am free of nicotine.

This is the longest I have been without a cigarette since I started to smoke. I thought I would never be able to quit smoking and I thought I was trapped for life with this addiction.

I have been thinking about quitting for years and I found the inspiration I needed here in this subreddit. Someone mentioned Allen Carr's book and I read it. It helped me tremendously.

I had no pangs, no withdraw symptoms. I could say that so far it has been easy.

I have been through almost every trigger situation: Drinking, Coffee, Out with friends, etc..  Most of those situations I didn't even think about cigarettes.

Sometimes I still think about cigarettes but usually only when I am on this subreddit or when I see a friend or someone smoking. If that is a craving it goes away pretty quickly. 

I FEEL GREAT. I feel more energy. I breath much better and I am healthier than ever.

I have also lost weight and I haven't compensated the addiction with something else. It is unbelievable. 

My guard is up. There is no "it is just one puff or one cigarette" thing. That is my mantra!

Guys, if I did it, you can do it as well!

GOOD LUCK and thanks for your support so far!

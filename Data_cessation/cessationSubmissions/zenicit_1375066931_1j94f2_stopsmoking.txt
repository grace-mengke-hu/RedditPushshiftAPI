Help me figure out how to deal with the loss of the secondary benefits of smoking

I've been smoking for about 12 years now and want to quit.  I'm not digging that I breathe so hard when I work out or that I smell bad or that it sucks up my money, but it does give me an excuse to leave the room when I'm about to lose my temper. It also allows me to meet people.  I'm sure there are other "benefits" that the addiction has given me that I have not had to develop in a healthy way because of it.  Any words of wisdom (or, failing that, artfully convincing BS?)

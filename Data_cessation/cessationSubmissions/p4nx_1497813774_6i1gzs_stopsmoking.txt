No smoker since 6 years - recently thinking again about lighting one up

Greetings,

stopped smoking roughly 6 years ago and never had a problem since. But a few weeks ago I found my good old Zippo lighter and started carrying it around.

I asked myself why not try one again? I think I would've already bought a pack if there weren't the disgusting images on the front

Thoughts about this?

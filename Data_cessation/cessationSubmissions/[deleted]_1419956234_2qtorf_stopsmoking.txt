Quit Yesterday. Is the gum a good route

I bought the gum yesterday?  From your guys experience is cold turkey the way to go, or can you have success with the gum.

33 years old, smoking since college.  I have been doing Yoga for the past three months which has helped me ween down, and make the change to quit.

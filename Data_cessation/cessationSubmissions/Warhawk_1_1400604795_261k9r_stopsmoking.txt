2 Weeks, Gunk in lungs when running?

So I've been hacking up gunk over the past few days and I don't particularly mind that. What is annoying though, is that when I go running, I can feel the gunk sitting at the bottom of my lungs and being annoying and making it so that I have a "about to throw up feeling".

Anything that can accelerate the clearing process from my lungs? Somewhere in the threads,somone suggested ginger, which has worked to a minor degree for me. Any other suggestions?

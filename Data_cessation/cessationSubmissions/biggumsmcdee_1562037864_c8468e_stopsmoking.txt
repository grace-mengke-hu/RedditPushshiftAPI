feeling better!

Stopped a couple of weeks ago, still had a couple of late night ciggies when I couldn't sleep but most days have been completely smoke free.  


Using  patches this time, as I still have to go to work (last time stopped cold turkey I was on holidays)... yesterday made the error of thinking I could step down to half a patch instead of a full one, a most unproductive self loathing day!

Feeling fit, can lift my dumbells over my head 10 times now, could only do it 4 times last week! 

&amp;#x200B;

Saved some money, don't stink. woohoo.

I`m living in Japan, smoking here is almost as common as breathing. I feel like the former is becoming the latter for me.

This is my first post on reddit.  I'm writing this to distract myself.  I'm having some serious 禁断症状 (kindanshoujou - withdrawal symptoms) and I want to smash something.  

I'm constantly hacking up some nasty gunk from my lungs.  This is possibly the worst part about smoking that I've experienced so far.  I can't stand how awful my lungs have become.  I imagine they're pretty black by now, even though I've only been smoking for about 5 years.  

I want to start working out more.  There was a time, back a few months ago, where I was doing muscle training with my friend. However I wasn't doing much cardio training.  I can't run more than a few minutes (if even that) without feeling like my lungs are going to burst.  I get winded from things that I shouldn't be.  Having sex is like running a marathon and it really affects my performance.  I'm dead exhausted at work where I teach young children and have to move around a lot.

Does heavy breathing from cardio exercise help to clean out the lungs?  

This is just a personal note, but Japan is probably the worst place I could have chosen to stop smoking because it's everywhere.

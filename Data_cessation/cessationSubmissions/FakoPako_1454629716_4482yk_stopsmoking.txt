Had a doctor's appointment today

Finally. It was hard to get it scheduled but I finally got it. Went to a doc to start the "check up" procedure. I spoke with the doc and told her I quit smoking, etc...I told her that I feel this poking feeling in my left lung/heart sometimes. They did EKG and everything came back good. Now, I have scheduled appointments for blood work, heart stress test and lung xray for cancer. Apparently, none of the insurance companies will pay for lung xray so that's out of the pocket. It's ok. I just want to get it done to make sure everything is good. I am eager to see how black my lungs are. 

I will keep you guys posted!

Hey! Day 35 tomorrow! Boom!

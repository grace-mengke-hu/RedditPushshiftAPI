Hey guys! I'm joining the Club if you don't mind!

Smoked my last cigarette yesterday before going to sleep. Now I'm on my way to work. When I'm there, it's two cigarettes I didn't smoke. Still feeling good but also a little afraid of what my mind will do to me the rest of the day.

Edit: Wow. Just wow. Thank you all for the warm welcome! I was busy all day and now I'm drowning in replies. This means a lot to me! 
I'm still motivated to do this and for now it seems easy due to your support. I love you guys!

Three Weeks! I'm still miserable though!

so here's to celebrate 3 weeks of being a non-smoker. 
body-wise, I feel awesome. I live on the 3rd floor with no elevator, and I can run up the stairs. Flowers smell. Food Tastes. I don't cough and don't have migranes!

mind-wise, I feel like crap. It's not because I "can't" smoke - I don't even want to at this point, It's a general fatigue and depression. I sent an email to my pdoc, hopefully she'll have some insight into this matter.

So - Do it. Stop. It's worth it. Any mental crap I'm going through right now is worth it because I'm learning to accept misery and anxiety as normal parts of life, instead of being so afraid of them. It's a learning process but I cherish every moment.

I hope to be back later this week with better news!

I feel great

I made it through a day that I would have normally smoked twice. (Before and after work.) I find that when I'm in the car there is nothing better to do, so I light one up. I put a stash of Werther's in my car, and sucking on that made me forget about it.
I find myself stressed and anxious, and for some reason my brain wants me to think that if I smoke it will go away. Today, when I was at work I felt calm and relaxed. Usually all I think about during the day is how much homework I need to get done when I get home. Today it didn't even cross my mind, I felt so good about not smoking.
Making that one choice to not smoke before work led to me making good choices the rest of the day. I drank water instead of buying a pop. I had energy the whole day, and I had no urge to smoke when I got out of work. When I got home, I worked out, and cleaned the house. I'm focusing on my homework better (reddit is distracting me however). I also actually want to go to bed as soon as I can, instead of wasting time on the computer until midnight like I usually do.
I just started (or stopped) but so far I am liking how it's turning out. Thanks for all the encouragement.

Question from a former smoker.

Howdy folks,

Let me preface this by saying that I am not addicted to nicotine, but I did smoke for a couple of weeks before stopping for various reasons.

If I had to guess, now would probably be about 3 weeks since my last cigarette and my decision to give it up. I'm also 17, if that means anything.

The thing is, sometimes when I'm just doing something random like gaming or reading, not even thinking about anything or anyone related to smoking, I'll suddenly taste or smell the type of cigarettes I used to smoke. It doesn't really make me want to go smoke, it just makes me wonder why in the world that happened.

My question is, is this normal? And if it is, is there a known cause for it? My best guess would be my brain playing tricks on me.

Thanks for any help.

Fifteen Months Quit - What Gains?

It's fifteen months since I finally gave up smoking and I feel I've put the demon sticks behind me. Obvious gains - reduced spend and hopefully a longer life, if I'm lucky. I didn't really grow a new set of tastebuds or see any change in complexion. I did for a while over-eat a little and drink more wine and have had to deal with this side affect and feel that in the main that's now under control. I get more coughs, which is a surprise, but perhaps fewer colds. 

My question - I may have increased my chances for longevity, but have I reversed any or some of the damage already done?

Anyone with good knowledge care to share their wisdom in a line or two?

Many thanks

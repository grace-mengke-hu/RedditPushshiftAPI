Quitting for the first time and hopefully the last!

Hi everyone! I heard about this subreddit and wanted to share. I've been a smoker for about a decade now (since I was 15, now 24) and felt it was time. I noticed my smoking habit has picked up quite a bit in this past year going from two-three packs a week to now a pack a day. Any tips or tricks to stop all together? I bought a vape to ease the transition a bit more but that's about it so far.

This is it.

How many times have I told myself that? I've been reading posts on here for awhile and it's funny how my feelings change about this subreddit... like when I'm on a good streak I find these posts super encouraging, like I'm part of a community of determined people, but if I slip up then every post I see on my feed just makes me feel jealous, guilty and like an outsider. Well I've decided maybe if I stop lurking and make this post, maybe I'll really be a part of it! I just broke up with my boyfriend this weekend, needless to say it's been a pretty hard time and my smoking has definitely increased.... but I've had to move into my grandma's (bf and I were living together) and I've been trying to hide it from her. I feel absolutely awful about it, she's been helping me through this difficult time and I've been lying to her! I actually met my boyfriend outside of a bar while I was having a smoke, and we've both tried quitting before, but when one of us slipped up so did the other... I think it's time to quit smoking now that I've quit him, I'm trying to look at it as a fresh start even though it hurts like hell. Anyways, a homeless man just asked me for a cigarette while I was waiting for the bus, and I gave him the rest of my pack. It felt good. I don't want this to be another failed attempt, it's time for me to start healing, both emotionally and physically! This is it. Wish me luck!

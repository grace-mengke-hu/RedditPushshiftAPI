Day 2 and I'm Ready to Fight Everything - Rant

I've been a smoker for the last ten years. I would quit whenever I was pregnant, but would start back smoking after I stopped breastfeeding. I'm quitting now because I'm sick of waking up coughing and hacking up a lung every morning. The problem is, I'm on day 2 of no cigarettes (I quit cold turkey) and I'm ready to fight everything in this house.

So far I haven't gone off on anyone, but here are some of the things that have enraged me to the point of crying today.

Dog getting on the sofa.

Kids being loud.

Kids wanting lunch.

Husband breathing loudly.

Husband talking about his video game lore.

My sims not learning their skills fast enough.

My mailman being late.

It's ridiculous, and I don't remember it being this hard when I quit before.

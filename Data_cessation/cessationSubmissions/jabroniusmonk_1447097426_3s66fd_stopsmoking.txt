26 Days. Feeling really uncomfortable still. Anxiety and mild depression.

I am very proud that I have been quit for nearly 4 weeks now, cold turkey, and I keep waiting for comfort to come.  I am still having trouble with insomnia, loss of appetite, anxiety, and more recently this week, feeling depressed.  I have no cravings though.

I am starting to lose hope that just waiting it out is going to change how I am feeling right now.  I'm already 26 days in, shouldn't things start to settle down a bit?  Did any of you feel like this at around this point in your quit?

Edit: cold turkey.

Just want to check in and provide some encouragement

First and foremost - I was a guy that could 'never' quit.  I won't spell it out, but to be short, every reason you are giving yourself, was mine as well.

On the verge of 5 months, things are starting to be 'normal', so far back that I forgot what 'normal' was (I started regularly my freshman year in college).    I'm turning into who I was supposed to be without nicotine.

It is worth it - give yourself time, you will realize how much of an addict you were once your rational side starts taking over.

Join me in not smoking today.

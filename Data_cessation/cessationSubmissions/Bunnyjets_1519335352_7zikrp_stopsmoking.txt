I've secretly quit. These are the reasons why

I decided to secretly quit smoking. I've quit (for more than month) 3 times. 8 months being my longest quit stint. I'm 25 now, and I started at 15.. so I've smoked for 10 years, and its cost me approximately $28,000.



I've decided not to tell a soul, not even my boyfriend (it'll be interesting to see how long it takes him to notice) because of a few different reasons



1) I only have high expectations from myself. I know that I do not do well under pressure, and I don't need the extra weight of expectations edging me off the wagon.


2) although I have had a hard time connecting with myself spiritually in the past, this, very naturally, feels spiritual to me on a deep level. I feel the opportunity to be leader and advocate for myself, and I know it will be that much harder to cave in due to the intimacy of having my own back for once and not relying on others. Which brings me to #3


3) each time I have quit before, I have spoken loudly and proudly about my plans, and I have found that at the beginning, the ones whos opinions mean the most to me, are your my personal cheerleaders. However, after a week or so, their support diminishes as life moves on. I end up having to force the topic of how far I've made it instead of them acknowledge and validate my difficult endeavor on their own. And I now realise it is not their job to coddle me through this. This is between me, myself, and I. I am my caretaker. I am my own nurturer. 



I come to Reddit to tell my secret, because I do want to speak about my newfound confidence on quitting with like-minded people, just not with anyone who knows who I am. 



Thank you. Any advice is absolutely welcome.

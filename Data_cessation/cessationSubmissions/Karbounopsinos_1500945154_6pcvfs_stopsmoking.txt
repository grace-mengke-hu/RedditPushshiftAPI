Today is the day. Your support is very much appreciated.

I've "tried" to quit and have failed many times. Most of them I've relapsed within the next 24h of my "decision". In fact, I've failed and played this absurd game so many times that I can hardly believe on my purpose. But I'm sick of lying and disappointing myself, burning money and turning lifetime into ashes; I really want to live free from this toxic madness, so I'm starting right NOW by not smoking today.

Wish me strength!

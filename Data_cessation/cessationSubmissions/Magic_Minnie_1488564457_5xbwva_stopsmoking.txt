Two weeks cold turkey! *high five*

Whoop whoop!! I almost made it to a year the last time I quit. Quite a way to go until then and beyond, but super chuffed with two weeks cold turkey and barely any cravings. It's like a switch has gone off on my head and my brain no longer wants anything to do with cigarettes. Long may it last!! If I can do it, ANYONE CAN! (Have smoked for 25 years ðŸ˜ž) Good luck folks!

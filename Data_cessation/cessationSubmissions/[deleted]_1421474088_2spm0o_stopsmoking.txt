I've been a nonsmoker for 2 weeks so far -- I noticed in the past week that I need MUCH less sleep than I did before! This is a huge benefit for those looking to get as much productivity out of their day as possible!

Yep! My sleeping schedule is still a bit chaotic, but I notice I need no more than 4-5 hours of sleep now. 

I went to bed like 2 nights ago at 3:30 AM and woke up at 6:50 AM NATURALLY. That's 3 hours and 20 minutes of sleep. It's been this way for the past week. Whenever I go to sleep I can expect to wake up naturally within approximately 4 to 5 hours. Back in my smoking days, if I were to go to bed at 3:30 AM, I'd probably wake up naturally at around 10AM-12PM 


This. Is. MASSIVE.

Not only am I not wasting hours of my day by taking a ton of smoke breaks.. but I'm also ADDING hours of productivity via not needing so much sleep. 

This benefit alone makes it all worth it. Staying up a bit later than usual isn't as anxiety provoking now because I know I'll be up in only a few short hours after I crash. 

Anyways, hope that inspires some people out there to take the leap and quit smoking. Peace!

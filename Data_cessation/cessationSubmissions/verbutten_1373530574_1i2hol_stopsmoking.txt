Thought on 200 days

I couldn't have come this far without this sub-- the badge, the support, the openness have all been so important. Thank you, everybody, I hope to provide support as well.

And now a quick PSA-- I've been wavering lately. I haven't broken NOPE (not one puff ever), but I've come close, especially since day 130 or so. 

So here's a cautionary message to the amazing numbers of people I see creeping up into the hundreds of days: just keep an eye on yourself, and remember that the 'one day at a time' mentality isn't a chore you can let slide at 4months quit, but is actually a *liberating* point of view you can carry with you for decades of better health and better life. At least that's how I've come to view it.

So congratulations to all you punk quitters out there, and let's all help each other more :-)

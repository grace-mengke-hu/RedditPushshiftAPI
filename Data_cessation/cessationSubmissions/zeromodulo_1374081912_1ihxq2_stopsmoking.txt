I recently got some free Nicoderm CQ patches from a quitting smoking program in my state, and they're working!

I just started using them yesterday, and haven't even wanted a cigarette since. They really work!

You might think it's still nicotine which is bad, but, I look at it this way... by the time I've used all of my patches, all the tar and smoke will be out of my lungs, and if I were to have a cigarette, I'd probably cough and hack and find them incredibly disgusting.

I got them for free from a quit smoking hotline in the state of Utah. Your state might provide some too, I think it's worth looking into. They're usually 40 something dollars, but I got mine completely free!

They also come in steps, e.g. step 1 has 21mg of nicotine, step 2 has 14mg of nicotine, etc. So you can slowly ween yourself off of it.

I had overheard someone say they went on the patch and it worked for them, and they have been a non-smoker for over a year.

Just wanted to share the good news, and maybe they have quitting smoking programs in other states too, it's definitely worth looking into!

Two months, and One Week

Thank you!
Reddit is the first place I have felt truly supported in my quest to quit. My SO is very supportive. Not being a smoker there are certain things she (thankfully) doesn't understand.  The support of this community gave my the courage to check out /r/Leaves.  I am now completely sober for 7 days.  I seriously doubted I would ever be able to post something like this.  
Thank you!

For those just starting your journey.  It will be a challenge, plan for how you will overcome the rough moments; meditation, breathing exercises, lots of water.  Remember failure to plan is planing to fail.  You can make it, just think about how you will.

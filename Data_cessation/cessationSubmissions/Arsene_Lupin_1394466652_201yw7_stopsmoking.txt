I only smoke[ed] a maximum of 2 cigarets a night right before bed? This is my 2nd day off and it is not easy.

So, I have a habit of smoking 1 or 2 cigarets after a long day at night before I go to bed. I have tried to quit it before but the habit was too strong. I finally decided to kick it off and this is my second day without. My withdrawal symptoms are not too strong but annoying. They are
1. Light sleeping
2. Weird feeling as though my nervous system is affected (not sure how to describe it) 

Any advice? should I buy a nicotine gum or a E-cig just in case it gets worse?


Thanks

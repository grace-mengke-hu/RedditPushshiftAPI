Just smoked my last smoke. Im gonna do it.

It's 3am and Iv'e been tossing and turning in bed all night just thinking. I want to better myself, I want to start working out I want to feel good and have a more positive attitude about life. I want to be successful and have a lot of money. I think cigarettes were getting in the way of all of this.

I'm 20 years old, and Iv'e been smoking since I was 14. I can remember the day like it was yesterday; me and my friend were behind a school hanging out. I didn't smoke cigarettes, I was against it and never wanted to try until I caved in that day. He said just take a drag. It was a camel crush menthol and as soon as I took the drag I fell in love. The head rush was amazing and I haven't kicked the habit, until now.

I cut all the substances out of my life, I'm currently almost a year without drinking alcohol, and about 8 months of no weed. I was never really "addicted" to any drugs but I've done a lot of them, serious ones and always managed to kick them to the curve. I haven't done a single drug besides weed since the summer of 2015. I went through a stage of drinking heavily and literally just stopped. I know I can do this. Tomorrow morning I'm waking up early and starting my new life. Gonna eat breakfest, go for a run, do some work outs in my room, play some video games and go to work and talk to the guy I work with that's been nagging me to quit cigarettes to start going to the gym with him. I got a plan. Iv'e never even tried to attempt to quit but I know how I can get without having a cigarette but I am DONE, no matter what. I'd say wish me luck, but there is no luck needed. This is life or death, literally. It's all on me.

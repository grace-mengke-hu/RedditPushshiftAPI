Most consistent, affordable patches

Can anyone recommend patches that might be cheaper than Nicoderm or the Equate brand patches Walmart has? I've been using the Equate patches and they're consistent, I'm now at 18 days of 7mg after 6 weeks of 14mg and don't really have an urge to smoke, but I also want to take the time to wean myself off the patches. I'd like to find something that can be purchased as a monthly supply rather than paying $30 every two weeks, since that's not much less than what I was spending while smoking, but I'm also planning to continue the patches for at least another 4 weeks, if not longer, because I enjoy the weird dreams that they give me.

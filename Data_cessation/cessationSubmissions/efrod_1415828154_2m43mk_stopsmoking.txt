On day 4, battling those pesky cravings

Hello all. I've been smoking for about ten years, sometimes pretty heavy, but recently about 5-7 cigs a day. I quit drinking about a year ago through AA, so I come to this with some understanding of my addictive mind and some tools from sobriety that I want to use to pursue full on health.

Earlier this year I knew that I was powerless over how much I smoke, even if I stopped for a week. I would have a couple after that week off, and then it would get back up into my normal range. I haven't had any real negatives, just soreness in my chest when I smoke a lot. I'm tired of that, and I just want to get my life in order now that I can.

I didn't stop earlier because I'm unemployed and being home makes it easy to go out and grab a smoke. I also thought that my sobriety was first in my life, so I didn't want to rock the boat by smoking. Well, now my sobriety is giving me strength to kick this thing. I am here to be accountable and to ensure that I take advantage of all the resources I have to move past my smoking addiction.

Thank you all, I look forward to this new journey with all of you.

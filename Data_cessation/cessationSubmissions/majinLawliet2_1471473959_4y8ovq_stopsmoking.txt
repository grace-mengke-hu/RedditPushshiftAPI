2 weeks today!

Hi everyone!

I just found this community and it's so awesome! 

It's been 2 weeks today since I quit cigarettes. Occasional weed use though (once a week). It feels good but sometimes the craving for cigarettes is too high. Lasts for about 10-15 minutes. I distracted myself with great difficulty earliest but I notice it's getting easier. 

However, I feel it's become difficult for me to focus without the cigarettes. I know it's all in the mind, but any help on how to focus without the cigs would be appreciated. 

Thank you and let's support each other, together!

Day one

Just had my last cigarette. I've tried so many times but this time I'm serious. Every time I stop at the store my son asks if we're stopping for smokes. He's only six and I felt embarrassed every single time. I made excuses of why we needed to stop, but in reality it was for cigarettes. Well I'm done, I want to be there when he's older. I want to be able to run around with him and not get winded. Here's to day one!

Friends who smoke

Hi everyone,

it's my first post here, I'm on my sixth day now and still have some cravings once in a while, after meals and when I'm bored, but nothing terrible.

I haven't been seeing anyone who smokes since I quit (except people at bus stops, but that doesn't count) and my best friend keeps asking when I'm going to go out with her for a drink. I'm scared because she smokes A LOT, like a cigarette every 15 minutes when she's drinking (I don't drink), just thinking about it makes me cringe. What do you think? Should I test my resistance or should I keep my distances for a while?

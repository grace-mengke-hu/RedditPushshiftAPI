9 days and feeling on deaths doorstep

The nonstop coughing has subsided quite a bit, but the fever-like feeling is the worst. No actual temp rise, but I have chills all over and break out sweating all the time. Also starting to get a debilitating headache. 

Still holding strong on desire to stay quit forever. If I can just make it through this flu like feeling I know I will feel so much better.

Suggestions to help new quitters sleep?

I made a post a few days ago, stumbled and stopped quitting again today/last night.  I've actually gone something like 16 hours and don't even want one at all and have yet to feel any withdrawl.  Awesome.

That said, from past experience, I do know that sleeping is a problem for me when I first quit.  Any ideas on how to help one get past that? Any good teas/herbs/foods?

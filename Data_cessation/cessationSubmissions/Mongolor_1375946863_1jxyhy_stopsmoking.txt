36yrs of life, 21 of them a Smoker.

Now I am a year into freedom from the beast and I am never turning back.  I forgot what it was like to smell, to taste, to be able to walk up stairs without panting.

I don't remember the last morning I spent coughing up phlegm in the shower.  No major sinus infections - and the one time I got sick I was healthy a week earlier then I would have been for the last decade.

I still get a craving, no shit. A two decade plus habit doesn't just disappear; just last night I had an edge in my mind, I know what I used to do for it.  I just had to remember that it didn't help to smoke.  It helped to take a break, to not do what I was doing for 10 - 15min.  The smoking was a parasite on my sanity, not the provider of it, or even a crutch.  It's a fucking parasite, and I finally shoot it off - let it wither and die.

I made it a year - I can make it forever.

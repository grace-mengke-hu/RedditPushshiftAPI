day 4 after stopping smoking. Even though I still use snus like I always have, I'm still feeling pretty fucking anxious and restless. Welp... What the hell?

Read le topic.

I snus, couldn't muster up the toughness to quit both at the same time, so cigarettes had to go first because let's face it, it's the lesser of the two evils.

But man. I did not expect to be this anxious and restless. How could this be? Is there something in cigarettes that are not in snus? MAOIs? some other shit? Am I fucked?

I have had troubles with anxiety and what not before. But I have been feeling pretty good this last half year or so and that's why I figured that I would try and stop my destructive habits. Quit coffee over a month ago, and that was not smooth either. Basically was dead tired and depressed for 3 weeks straight.

Scared that it will come back and bite me in the ass and return to my anxious ways 24/7. That's at least what the cigarette deprived brain is trying to tell me.

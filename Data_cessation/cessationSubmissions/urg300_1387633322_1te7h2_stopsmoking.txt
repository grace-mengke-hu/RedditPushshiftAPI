24hrs in: The Craving

Not for nicotine... but food. Holy hell! I feel like I've eaten everything in my house. 

The good news though? I really don't want a cigarette right now, and my coffee is extra amazing. A few years ago I made it roughly 20 days. I'm determined to quit this time.

Nobody told me about the damn headache though. Stupid nicotine withdraw.  


**36Hr Update**: Yikes! I'm not sure if it's the absent nicotine... but I had a dream that Burt Reynolds was in a porno with a tranny named Cherri Mongrove. WHAT THE HELL BRAIN!??!

Thanks for the support folks! This is gonna be fun...

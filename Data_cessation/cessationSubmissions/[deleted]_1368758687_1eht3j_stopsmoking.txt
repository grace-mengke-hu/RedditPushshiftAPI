For people who have used the patch, anything I should expect that was not covered in the nicodermCQs FAQ?

Tomorrow I will be using my first patch in effort to stop smoking. Is there anything that you experienced that I should be aware of? I heard of nicotine dreams, and that I could give myself a heart attack by smoking while on the patch. Just wondering about patch users experiences.

Attempting to quit dip again, but no cravings this time?

Hey guys. First of all I'm aware there is a subreddit to help you stop dipping, but it's not very active so I decided to ask my question here. 

So I'm a 20 year old guy who's dipped for close to 2 years (smoked for 1 year before that) For a while, I've intermittently tried to kick my bad habit, but always caved within 48 hours. I just couldn't function without it - foggy mind, headaches, anger, etc. And the cravings are the worst part. I literally couldn't stop thinking about dip!

So at the time I'm writing this it's been a little over 36 hours since I last had any nicotine. Got wasted friday night and spent all of yesterday hungover, and I felt too shitty to consider putting a lip in. Haven't had one today either - and here's the strange thing. The fog, anxiety, and overall shitty feelings I get when I try to quit, well, I'm not feeling like that yet. The only thing I've noticed so far is a general lack of energy. I don't even have any cravings!

So I guess what I'm trying to find out is if this is normal - I know subsequent attempts are more successful than initial ones, but I didn't expect to not have ANY cravings. Frankly it's weird and I'm a little worried. Is there something wrong with me?

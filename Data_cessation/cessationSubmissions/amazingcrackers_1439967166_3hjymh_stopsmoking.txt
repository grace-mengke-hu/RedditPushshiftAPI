Yesterday a was crying because I was so scared, but today I'm confident! I quit!

Post of yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3hf93u/i_wanted_to_quit_smoking_today_but_now_im_crying/

Last night my best friend visited me, and together with you all she supported me in my decision. Today is the day I stop, it's MY life and I want to have control, not be controlled by a stupid monster in my lungs.

I'm so happy this subreddit exists!

EDIT: So the title has to be 'I' instead of 'a' of course.

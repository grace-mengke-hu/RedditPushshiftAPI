I had an awful sleep last night

One of my New Year's resolutions was to quit smoking, as I imagine is the same for many of us here. I was doing well, although I was out in town drinking with my friends on NYE I avoided having a cig all night, and all the next day. However, when it came to sleeping on the 1st Jan, all I could think about was nicotine. So I caved and rolled myself a cig, resetting the day of progress I had made.

The next day was worse, I managed to convince myself to have 2 cigarettes at night. Then another 2 on the 3rd Jan. This became 3 before I slept on the 4th - I could feel my old habits creeping back, even though I was managing to avoid smoking during the daytime.

So yesterday came around, I was getting cravings as per usual, but during the day I managed to resist them. I went up to my friends house for a jam (they smoke inside) and my cravings were at their strongest. I decided I had to leave and go home; all the way home I was arguing with myself whether I should have a cig. A quote I remember hearing a long time on procrastination came to my head; **"If not now, when?"** Every time I smoked before I went to sleep I was resetting the amount of time it would take for me to get over this stupid addiction, and if I was to fully beat it, I had to stop NOW.

So last night came around, I was led in bed, I couldn't sleep for hours past my usual bedtime. All I could think about is going downstairs and rolling a cig for myself. But instead I opened this sub on my phone and read some of the success stories from people. Eventually I fell asleep without having a cig - **for the first time I've made it to day 2!**

Big thanks to everyone here, although I haven't commented before, reading your stories helped me through my cravings so much. We can beat smoking!

Anyone Know Where I Can Get Free Nicotine Patches in NC?

So I'm taking the step to quitting smoking, and I've had success in the past with NRT patches to stave off the harsher effects of withdrawal (I get severe migraines that prevent me from functioning for at least two or three days. Am sole income for family, so can't afford to miss work). However, money is tight, and I don't know if there are any places in NC where I can get patches for cheap or free. I know other states have programs set up, but it doesn't look like NC currently has something like this (although apparently they did in the past).

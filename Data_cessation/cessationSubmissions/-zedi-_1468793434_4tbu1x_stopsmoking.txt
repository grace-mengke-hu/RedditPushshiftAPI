First milestone - 1 week

I'm really happy to have made it a week and am looking forward to many more to come :)

This time it's been different for me because I've been addressing the mental / psychological side of it instead. At least for me, the issue is not about physical dependence, it's about a reward association that kicks in when I want to give myself a reward for doing something good, or a reward for coping with some stress.

This time I'm getting it clear in my mind that cigarettes are not a reward, they're toxic. They don't reduce stress, they increase it. I'm also removing triggers like being around smoking, asking my partner not to smoke around me, not drinking regularly (or hopefully at all), and importantly I'm being honest about my ability to control it and no longer telling myself that a couple cigarettes on the weekend at a social gathering is ok. Or that I can just stop the next day. I'm changing all that and thinking about it the right way. That's it's a terrible habit and isn't helping me in any way, and it's had more control over me than I have of it, so it's got to go.

I'd like to recommend daily reading this subreddit, encouraging others (also definitely help yourself), and also utilizing a good hypnosis mp3. Although I haven't read many people talk about them here, I've found it helped make the transition to non-smoker a little easier for me. Maybe that's because I see the challenge as mental / psychological one, more than physical.

That's it. Thanks for all the help /r/stopsmoking/

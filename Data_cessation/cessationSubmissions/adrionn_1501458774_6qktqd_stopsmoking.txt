Any other fairly newly recovering alcoholics/drug addicts who are quitting/have quit?

I have been telling myself that as long as I don't drink smoking is okay.  Also everyone smokes at meetings!  Has anyone successfully quit with less than a year of sobriety?  I am coughing up all sorts of weird stuff and just don't think I can do this anymore.  Any success stories?

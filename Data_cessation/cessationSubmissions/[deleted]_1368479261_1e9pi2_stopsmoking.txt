Eight days...

After 6 months of trying and failing continually, I finally made it to one week and a day, my longest in 12 years. Feeling pretty good, and I'm going to try not to "reward" myself with a drag off a buddy's smoke for the next 6 days, and hopefully get back that feeling of being young long enough to have the willpower to stop thinking about it fewer than every six seconds.

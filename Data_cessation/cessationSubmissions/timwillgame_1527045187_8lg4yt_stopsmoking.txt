50 Days!

Been lurking around this sub since I started, and wanted to say thank you to every member of this community. I wouldn’t have been able to make it this far but without reading the posts on here every day. I know that from past experience!

I am now proud to call myself a non-smoker, and can’t imagine ever going back to cigarettes. They controlled all of my routine for 6 years and to be back in control is fantastic. 

No matter where you are in your smoke free journey, we can all do it! I am proud of all of us :)

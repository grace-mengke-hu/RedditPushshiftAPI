The cravings! So bad!

I managed to make it through my morning routine without breaking down and buying a pack. The cravings are so bad. It's been 20 minutes and won't stop. I have only been smoke free for 10 hours and 36 minutes. I was literally asleep for most of it so that basically doesn't count haha. I smoked my last cigarette last night at 11:50 pm. I threw away the pack, all ashtrays, and lighters I could find. Struggling right now.

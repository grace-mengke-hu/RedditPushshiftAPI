[Club 31] for smoke-free holidays

I love how the idea of a smoke-free December is the opposite of "Well, I know I'm going to smoke over the holidays, so I'll just wait and quit in January". There's never a better time than immediately, it will never be any easier than it is now, and there will always be an excuse to keep smoking if you let there be.

I quit about a month ago, the latest of many, many quit attempts. This time I'm doing it right - cold turkey, became a gym addict, and am generally focusing on whatever it takes to be a healthier, happier person. I have the fear in the back of my mind that when I start going out more with old friends over the holidays, I'll end up right back where I started again.

So, I was really happy to see this Club 31 thing. My partner said, "but didn't you already quit smoking? aren't you planning on a smoke-free December anyway?' And yes, I did and I am, but any extra reminder to stay vigilant and keep my resolve is important, especially since I have a history of slipping up while drinking and going on a smoking rampage for a few weeks before I quit again.

Good luck everyone!

I went in a smoking bar and didn’t smoke!

I used to be a regular smoker. A pack a day and drinking and smoking went hand in hand. I’d started smoking at 18 and quit for the first time at 35 by going cold turkey and hating it. I then started smoking again at 41 and have smoked for the last few years. I tried to quit last April/May using Champix and I’d had a horrible experience with it. 

Two weeks ago I was talking to someone about smoking and she told me that she had stopped smoking using the Jason Vale Stop Smoking in two hours app. As she told me about it I didn’t believe it but she was obstinate that she used to smoke over a pack a day, identified as a life long smoker and never thought she could quit, but this had worked for her. 

Last Wednesday I downloaded and started the app with a fair degree of skepticism. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The process of becoming a non-smoker again hasn’t been hard, I haven’t had any physical withdrawal symptoms like I had last time I tried to quit. 

And last night I went into my local bar, which is a smoking bar and didn’t smoke. In fact, after a momentary panic that I didn’t have cigarettes after sitting down, the thought quickly faded and then I just didn’t think about it. I had three drinks with a friend, stayed for an hour and then went home. 

For the first time it doesn’t feel like I’m “giving up something I like”, or “missing out”. I highly recommend the app and it was free in Germany to download. 

I’m really positive about not smoking anymore. I actually feel that I can do it and stay a non smoker this time.

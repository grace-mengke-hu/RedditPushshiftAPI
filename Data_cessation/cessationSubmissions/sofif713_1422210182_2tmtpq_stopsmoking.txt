"Just one won't hurt..."

The thoughts had completely banished and now they are back. At first I thought it was the holidays, giving me some new triggers and inducing some new cravings. But the holidays passed and the thoughts remain. I keep thinking about having "just one.." and how maybe if I ever went back to smoking, I'd be able to keep at one or two a day. 

I haven't caved and I mostly know these thoughts aren't true. But it would be nice to go back to not having them :/

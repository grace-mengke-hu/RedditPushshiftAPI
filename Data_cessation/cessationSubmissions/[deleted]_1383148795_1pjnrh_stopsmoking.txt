Had a few puffs of cigarette at a party, after that I kinda looked at it in confusion.

In combination to talking to some girls and having a great time at a party, I decided to bum a cigarette off of them. I think this was my 6th mixed liquor drink in and, I check it up the decision to being drunk.

I had a few puffs, then I looked at the cigarette in confusion. 
"Why am I not feeling good anymore?"
It then hit my like a sack of brick. It is just my bastard brain playing tricks on my due to 6 years of dealing with this stuff. For the next minute I kinda stared in awe of how deceiving this thing is.

I showed it to my friend in which he slapped it out of my hand and stomped it on the ground. He also regressed back to smoking real cigs one in a while but he is on the e cig, so he is still deluded he can control it.

I smiled when it was all over. I am thankful for the friends I have and make sure they have your back when you quit smoking.


Stay away from tobacco, we have the curse of knowledge of smoking that damn weed. Our bastard brains think we can handle it again, but our bodies tell us the truth. Make sure to listen.

This was 3 days ago. 286 days in, a moment of weakness, but still going strong.

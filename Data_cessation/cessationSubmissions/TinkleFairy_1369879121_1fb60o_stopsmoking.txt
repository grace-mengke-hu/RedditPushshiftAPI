Terrible day at work and then I realized...

that I have finally earned my happy star. I have been smoke-free for 365 days! :D My bad day at work seems completely insignificant. 

My boyfriend and I quit together cold turkey last year. It was horrible at first, but completely worth it. I am still amazed that I go days, even weeks without thinking about smoking now.

We have kept [a chart](http://i.imgur.com/VWN8J7A.jpg) on our kitchen whiteboard which we have updated every day to keep track since we started. We later realized that there were much cooler apps for tracking quitting progress, but the chart did its job in motivating us.

I wanted to thank this community for being so supportive. The first few weeks after quitting were the hardest for me and I was on here every morning reading all of your posts of advice, motivation and encouragement.

It honestly doesn't matter what day you are on of quitting, every day that you don't smoke is a good day. Always keep that in mind.

Love and hugs to everyone here.

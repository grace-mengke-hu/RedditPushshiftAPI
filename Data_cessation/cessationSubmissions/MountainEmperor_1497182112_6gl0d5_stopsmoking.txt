Day 6 without a cigarette - Slowly becoming a Misanthrope

I really want to quit and i have no craving at all but the last 2 days i somehow feel that i hate every single person. People make me angry but i don't know why. I was a somewhat funny guy before quitting. 

I read about mood swings and depression due to the lack of nicotine. Had anyone of you a similar experience? I really dont like myself that way.

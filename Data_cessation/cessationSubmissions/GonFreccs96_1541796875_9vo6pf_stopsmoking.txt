6 days without smoking and going strong this time! (I hope)

I posted here a couple of weeks back about changing to vape instead of leaving the cigarette but I kept on smoking. 6 days ago I made a bet against a friend that whomever smokes 1st will have to pay 1000$ (Mexican pesos) to the other. Neither one of us has smoked since and, tbh, I feel pretty confident on the non-smoke bet. I don’t have cravings, my sense of smell is better than it was a week ago, I feel with lots of energy and overall I feel better. I’ve been smoking heavily for a while now, a pack a day. Not doing it feels very cool. Hang on!

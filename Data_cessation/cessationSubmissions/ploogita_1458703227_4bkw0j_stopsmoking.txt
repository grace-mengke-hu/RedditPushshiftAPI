Relapsed on my 31st day of going cold turkey..

Super disappointed. I was stressed, and my bf and I had a fight. I went straight to my friends. One of which who still smokes. She offered me one and I couldn’t resist. Regretted it right after I finished it. Thankfully, my bf understood. He doesn't smoke never had, but he understands how difficult it is to quit.


Piece of advice to anyone who’s just starting out. RESIST THAT ONE CIG.

Imagine if.....

It's amazing how much clearer I can think now that I've been smoke and nicotine free for just over a week. The poison is completely out of my system and it's like a dense fog has lifted off of my brain. I can feel synapses that haven't been used in years firing up again processing new information, seeing new things,  and retaining information much better than they did just last week and it got me thinking....what happens if we unlock 100% of our human potential? 

Smoking is just one thing that we use to poison ourselves. There are 4000 additive chemicals in cigarettes meant to increase our addiction to nicotine so that was definitely a big one. But our food is also laced with hormones and chemicals and so is our water. Most Americans are on some kind of pharmaceutical medication that probably didn't even exist a decade ago. We are all drugged out of our minds. Even the non-smoking "drug free" model citizen still drinks coffee and eat processed foods that our ancestors wouldn't even recognize as anything edible. What happens if we go back to out roots? What happens if you try to clear yourself from all these things? What happens if you break free from the shackles meant to subjugate an entire population whether for capitalist consumerism or even more nefarious reasons? What happens if you become a free range wild homosapien instead of a farm raised domesticated cog in a machine? 
I want to find out. This is getting to be a lot bigger than quitting smoking for me.

It stops now, but I'm not sure how I'll cope.

I've been smoking for 4 or so years now, the past year being the most intense amount I smoke per day.

Recently I've felt that I'm just wasting my time, money and health smoking and realising that I don't even need to smoke, and it brings me no benefit whatsoever.

Was just wondering if anyone has any tips to make sure I don't go too crazy, I'm going cold turkey, none of those patches or e-cigs.

Could anyone lend some of their experiences or knowledge?

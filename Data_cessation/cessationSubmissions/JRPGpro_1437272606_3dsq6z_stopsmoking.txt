Nicotine Lozenges to quit.

I'm underaged and started smoking to help with stress (shitty family stuff) and I know I need to quit. I was able to get my hand on some nicorette mini mint lozenges though. Which seemed to do a little to help at first. But holy moly do they taste like balls. Am I doing this wrong? Should I not actually have them on my tongue or anything? I never really looked at the instructions that came with them :/

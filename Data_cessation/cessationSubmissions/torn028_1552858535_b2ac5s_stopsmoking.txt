Day 4.

Today I hate quitting smoking. I have four days and three hours and change under my belt.
I want to rip the heads off everyone who tells me how well I’m doing. I want to run down the street until I find someone with a cigarette and give them my entire purse for it.
But I’m going to stay strong. I can do this.
Not another puff, no matter what.

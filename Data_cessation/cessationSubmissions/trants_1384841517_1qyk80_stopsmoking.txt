21 Years and finally quitting

I took the Chantix for a week then just stopped. 
Had some fun dreams- nothing too bad. Today is 21 days smoke free.
I even went out and got hammered and didnt smoke. Always the weak time for anyone i would say. 
Officially I have save $10x21days (pack and half a day about) $210 from not smoking. The Chantix cost me $120 so its already paid for itself. 


Here goes another week... and hopefully the rest of my life smoke free

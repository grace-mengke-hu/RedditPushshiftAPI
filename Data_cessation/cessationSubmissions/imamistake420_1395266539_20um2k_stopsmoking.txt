No title, just a short, stupid little rant.

I want to have a smoke.

I know I'm not going to have one, and I'm not having a craving, but I really just want one, just to have.  You know what I mean?

I'm really surprising myself by quitting cold turkey without any bad cravings or relapses, so I know it's not gonna happen.  But I sometimes just miss smoking.  I hardly take breaks at work anymore and I don't hang around with the smokers or non-smokers so it's kind of like joining a new club where you don't know where you fit in.  Smoking was always great for socializing.

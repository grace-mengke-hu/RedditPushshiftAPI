Day 4 and I feel like I've been hit by a bus... any insight/help/similar experiences?

I feel absolutely zapped.  Going the few feet to the kitchen is taxing.  I'm exhausted, my body feels like there is a gigantic weight on it... even using the computer is draining.  

Anyone experience anything similar?  Is it normal?  I'm trying valiantly not to justify this as a need for a cigarette but holy hell if I could muster up the energy to be infuriated, I would be...  but apathy/lethargy is about what I can give.

Blah.

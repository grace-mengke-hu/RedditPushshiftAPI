Fighting the urge to smoke but bowing down to anger and depression

Just need to rant a bit. I've been fairly good fighting the urge to smoke even though my boyfriend continues to smoke. I've been kind of depressed. I feel like I'm in a funk and I'm pretty aimless a lot of the time because I used to fill up empty moments with smoking. Last night, I was in bed with my boyfriend talking about how proud I was that I still had a pack with four or five smokes but that I hadn't treated actually smoking them as an even remotely viable option this whole time. And then he revealed that, no, I did not have four or five smokes because he'd smoked them. He'd smoked my talisman of strength (I've always been an idolator) and I wanted to punch him in his stupid fucking square head and call him a weak ass bitch. He said he would replace him and I told him that I wasn't going to be the one to give him an excuse to buy another pack. Ugh, I can't wait until this whole quitting business is on my periphery and not in my face all the time. Whatever, I'm choosing not to smoke today.

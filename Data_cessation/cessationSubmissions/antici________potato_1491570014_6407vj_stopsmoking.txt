Anyone with ADHD/ADD here that has experience with quitting?

TL;DR: Have ADD. Anxiety and headaches are keeping me from going long without cigarettes. 

Studies show that those with ADHD/ADD are more likely to smoke and are much less likely to quit smoking. I want to know the perspective of someone with the diagnoses, while medicated or not, and see if there are any tips that might make it easier to quit. 

Background: I'm 23, diagnosed with ADD at 19, and have been smoking for 2 years. Like many others with ADHD, i have anxiety. I used to be prescribed xanax for that but got off of it and for the last 4 years I've been taking Vyvanse daily for my ADD. 

These days I'm smoking a pack about every other day. I've tried quitting but haven't even made it to the 48 hour mark. A few things have kept me from quitting. If i make it far enough, the cravings hit hard (as expected). I don't enjoy smoking but my brain gets hooked on thinking how good a cigarette would feel after a while without one.

The 2nd reason is the anxiety. This makes me not even able to go 4 hours without one and even makes me smoke more when i tell myself I'm going to quit. I have been able to control the every day anxiety that comes with life and haven't had an anxiety attack in a while. I'd say i handle the anxiety quite well, until it comes to quitting. When i tell myself "this is the last one for real" i end up even more anxious and feeling like i need a cigarette within 30 minutes. A lot of the times I panic thinking that I won't be able to handle the withdrawal and that it'll negatively affect my work. 

My final reason, which i think is the main reason I'm having trouble quitting, is that going just 4+ hours without a cigarette causes me to have a really bad headache that i haven't figured out how to get rid of without nicotine. I hear day 2-3 or whatever is the hardest and no one who I've talked to experiences headaches when they go without nicotine. 

Any help would be appreciated.

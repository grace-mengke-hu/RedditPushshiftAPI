Day one!

Blah blah blah accountability. I was a pack a day smoker for nearly four or five years, and have tried to quit multiple times. This time I decided to treat my smoking addiction like the other problems I've beaten (self-harm, eating disorders, etc.), and write down a schedule and everything. 

In the past month I've gone from a pack a day to one or two a day, simply by increasing the time I waited between cigarettes by 15 minutes a day. Yesterday I decided I've had enough, finished my pack, and here I am. 

I've also been sick for the past week and a half, so that has helped too. I feel awful from being sick, and I know that the smoking was only keeping me sick. 

I'm bitchy and miserable and everything is making me rage/cry, but it'll be worth it.

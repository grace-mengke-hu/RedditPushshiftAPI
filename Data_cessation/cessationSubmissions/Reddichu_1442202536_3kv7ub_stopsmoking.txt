What's up with these cravings at 4 months?! I've been doing so well.

So I've been getting hit with these weird cravings, like I miss the idea of smoking. The cravings are NO WHERE near as bad as when I first quit, but I went to the gas station today and was like, "Huh, wouldn't it be fun if I bought a pack?" I went out drinking with a few friends tonight, and I wanted to smoke. Like I said, it's no where near as bad as when I first quit.. I used to be almost physically pained when friends would smoke around me.. Now it's just a fleeting thought.

It's just weird. I haven't thought about smoking in a while and suddenly I'm getting hit with cravings. Quitting is weird. :P

Why does the fact that nicotine is not in your body after 3 days supposed to matter, as far as addiction?

Alcohol, heroin and cocaine clear even faster.

It's probably good nicotine takes a while. The withdrawls might be worse.

Anyway, this is a good timetable link for early quitters. My gums continue to feel so much better. They have for a few days. That alone is worth the effort.

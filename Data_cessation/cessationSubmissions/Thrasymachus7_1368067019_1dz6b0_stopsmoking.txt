Almost 11 days without nicotine!

In 3 hours it'll be 11 full days for me. I've told myself so many times before that I would quit, but before the day was over I had bought another pack. I finally knuckled down one morning when I woke up needing to buy another pack, and said "Never again." I quit cold turkey. I even bought nicotine gum, just in case, but ended up never using it.

I hear day 3 is when the average smoker has the highest number of cravings, but day 1 was the hardest for me. Since then it has all been getting easier. I started running again, bought a yoga mat so I could practice at home, as well as installing other fitness training apps on my phone, and I have started eating healthier. I just weighed myself and have actually dropped a little weight.

I started a new job today. Over half the employees there smoke. When break time rolled around the guy training me turned and asked if I smoke - I could tell that he did, because I had smelled it on him earlier. I was so thrilled to be able to truthfully say "No." 

A part of me thought I would never quit, but I'm so glad I did, and I wish everyone else out there the best of luck with their endeavors. To those who have already quit: congrats, and keep up the good work!

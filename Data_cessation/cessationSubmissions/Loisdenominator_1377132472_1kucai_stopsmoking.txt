Celebrating milestones - how often is too often and how often is not enough?

Oh look, I've reached 2 months, or would that be tomorrow, since June had 30 days and July had 30? I digress!

I'm at the stage where I feel my next big milestone (after 3 weeks, which was huge for me) is 3 months. Right now I'm like "no big deal, I quit smoking". Of course I'm happy and proud of these 60 days, but I worry that the time between 3 weeks and 3 months is very long to not underscore it along the way. Which I just have, with this post, which is a long set up to ask you...

How often do you feel it's appropriate to mark those milestones? To celebrate? To somehow pat yourself on the back for a job well done?

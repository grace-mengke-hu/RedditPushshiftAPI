Today was really tough.

I started college last month and honestly, I picked the worst time to quit. I'm surrounded by cigarettes all the time. All my friends smoke. All. The. Time. I stick to my vape and try to ride it out, but honestly, it hurts. It hurts to know I'll never take a drag again. 

I know my mind is playing games. It's romanticizing it. When I was smoking, I wanted to quit. I didn't even enjoy it, and every single time i smoked I felt guilty. But I have an addicted mind, and it wants the drug. I'm fighting with my own brain. Half of it wants to say "fuck it" and throw it all away, but the other half is staying strong because it knows it's not rational to start again. 

5 days. I can do it. It's all about getting rid of the habit. If I don't smoke long enough, my mind will forget how it was like to smoke, it won't crave it anymore. I can do it. We all can. It's a breakup, and only time will heal.

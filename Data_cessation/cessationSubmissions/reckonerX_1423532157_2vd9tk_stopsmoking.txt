My badge needed updating... fell off the wagon about a year ago, time to do this again. Day 1.

I just found out one of my best friends has cancer and has to get his eye removed. I was devastated, and I was angry, and I had one of those epiphany moments of, "Oh fuck, why is it fair that he gets cancer living healthy and I'm sitting here BEGGING for it by chain smoking?"

Ripped up my last cigarettes last night. Now for the hard part: Day 1.

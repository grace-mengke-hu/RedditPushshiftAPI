So I hit one year. Then I cracked...

I'm heading home from the work Christmas outing. A few beverages were taken, it was somewhat enjoyable. And I decided, for whatever reason, that I needed a cigarette.

I had two - each a rollup cadged off a workmate. Even when I was walking outside to have the first one, I felt my heart pounding. I knew I should not be doing this.

I have to say, I enjoyed the first one a lot. Far more than I expected. As if I'd never quit in the first place. 

But now I feel like shit. I'm back at zero. The worst of it is, my girlfriend was instrumental in getting me to quit. She hated that I was killing myself for a needless habit. And now I have a choice - tell her, and disappoint her massively, or lie through my teeth, and maybe celebrate two years clean, when really it's just one year.

If any of you are ever considering having that one you feel you've earned, that one that will do no harm in the long run, I can tell you with no shred of doubt that it is not worth it. Don't join me back on that zero.

Have a merry Christmas.

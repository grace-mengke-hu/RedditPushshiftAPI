I WELCOME the withdrawals !

Good Day!

I had no plans, no expectations, no motives, no thoughts of quitting and then one morning I woke up and went out to the patio to have my coffee and cigarette, and for some reason when I lit up I didn't want to  inhale. I don't  know what came over me but I just  looked at my cigarette and said "I AM DONE".....I haven't smoked since.

I WELCOME the withdrawals. It reminds me that my body is recuperating, getting healthier and happier. i feel like I have been "reborn" to some degree. I see the world through different eyes........my "own". My visions are clear and not distorted. The only enjoyment a smoker gets from a cigarette is TEMPORARY relief from the DISCOMFORTS created by the previous cigarette. Withdrawals are a state of mind called "Restlessness".....so I stay productive, eat whatever I crave, which is usually healthy foods, Sleep when I am tired, even if it's not my usual bedtime and I smile a lot during the day.....We ALL have a choice......turn your fears, discomforts, worries, anxieties and daily stress around and take ownership. You deserve to be HEALTHY AND HAPPY....everything and everyone else comes secondary. The more you love yourself, the more you will expose that love to others.....its a wonderful cycle.'

Miles of Smiles..

Still Get the Dreams

This morning's was interesting.  With some people, talking, and then I notice I'm smoking a cigarette, I explain to a person, that actually I quit, and this is just some non-sense.  Then I check my bag and see there's an open soft pack with 3 or 4 smokes missing.  I don't remember where the smokes came from or if I smoked the others.  I was very matter-of-fact about the situation and just thought I must've drank a lot of something.  Didn't scold myself or feel bad.  I came out of the dream intact with all my resolve.  Trippy!

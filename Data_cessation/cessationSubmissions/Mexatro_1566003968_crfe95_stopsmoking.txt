start again.

i haven't smoked like 3 months. I wasn't a hard smoker thing, i smoked because of anxiety and anger issues. And yes it helped me  a little. Come to think its harms, i wasn't smoking too much, so there was not much harm i guess. I also do sports, and am in a really good shape. (i got awful stamina but not because of that) Whatever I'll start again, because i have very stressful life and i lost control very easily.

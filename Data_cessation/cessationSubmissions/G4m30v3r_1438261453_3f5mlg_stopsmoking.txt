Day 20, Had my first dream (That I can recall) about smoking

with was that about? I’m still pretty low on the cravings side, however I do think in my mind occasionally, that I can sneak bum a smoke from someone and just one won’t hurt. I have kept my resolve though and have not smoked, even through some semi drunk times!
  
Anyway about the dream, I dreamt that I was in NYC and I had roommates due to overbooking of apartments, and the landlord didn’t want the one set of people living there. I stole a fe cigarettes from the landlord’s pockets. Afterwards, we were going to a restaurant for fried fish and saw the whole town was on fire. we started rescuing the people in a gym but some of them didn’t want to leave.  I think there’s some crazy correlation to all that (except maybe NYC and fish)

Smoked half a cig on Halloween.

I haven't had a drag in months, but on Halloween I was extremely drunk and we ended the night by having a fire in my buddies backyard. Everyone around me was smoking and I decided to take a drag off one, then had half of one. I feel kind of bad, but at the same time I realized that I haven't had the urge to smoke at all since then, which is a really good feeling. What do you guys think?

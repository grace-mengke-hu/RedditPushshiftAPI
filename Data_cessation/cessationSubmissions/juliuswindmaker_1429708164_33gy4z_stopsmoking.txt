Wow, a craving took me by surprise, but I resisted!

So, almost four months down, and I guess I'm not totally out of the woods yet. I got hit with what felt like a strong craving last night when I was going for a walk. 

Honestly though, I think I was just really tired, dehydrated, and probably low on electrolytes since I had gone for a long run earlier.

I think an important part of the quitting process is cultivating the ability to distinguish what the bodies is actually craving, when we think we want a cigarette.

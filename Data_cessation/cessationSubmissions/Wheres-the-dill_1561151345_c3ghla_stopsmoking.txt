4 Weeks today and having strong cravings.

Hello everyone! I quit smoking 4 weeks ago (successfully up to this point) with the Allen Carr method. But I think I might have done something wrong... I must still have some desires to smoke because I am still having strong cravings. Not only that but feel a little like a failure for not getting the described effect the book said I would. Has anybody any experience with this who can offer advice?

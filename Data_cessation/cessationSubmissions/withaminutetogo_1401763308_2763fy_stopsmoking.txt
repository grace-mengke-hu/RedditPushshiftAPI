Day 2 (on patches) - feeling great, but some problems with itchy skin and aching muscles

Hi all

Day 2 here and I feel fantastic. Already breathing *so* much easier, and getting a ton of feeling / circulation back in my feet and legs, which had always been numb from smoking.

Just one issue, and maybe it is to do with the patches. I am getting *really* itchy skin, and also some muscle ache - especially in my legs. Nothing so serious that even tempts me to put disgusting, filthy smoke back into my body. But it's not the most normal feeling.

So I am wondering ... is this to do with the circulation coming back, and will it pass? Also, is there any way I can take the edge off of this? Self-massage seems to offer some temporary relief.

Any advice or experience from others most appreciated.

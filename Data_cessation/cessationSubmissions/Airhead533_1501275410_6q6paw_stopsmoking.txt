Sleep eludes me.

I've passed 3 weeks and I am still having trouble getting a full night sleep. I sleep usually about 3 - 4 hours and then sometimes nap in the evening before I go to work. Is this common cause it's really dragging the days along. My brother said he had something similar when he quit and that it doesn't really go back to normal until after 2 or 3 months. Cravings come few and far between but my workdays are brutal with little sleep every day.

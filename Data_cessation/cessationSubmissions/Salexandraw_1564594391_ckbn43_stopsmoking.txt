Advice for quitting nicotine from vape?

6 years ago I switched to a vape after smoking about a pack+ a day for 6 years. I've been addicted to nicotine for over 12 years. The vape has felt a lot less damaging to my lungs and skin, but I think the nicotine may still be zapping my energy and adversely affecting my executive functioning. My vape and I are attached at the hip, I even have a work from home job that allows me to vape at all times. I'm intaking nicotine all day every day, every 3-5 minutes, really.

I'm pretty terrified of quitting- it's very much a security blanket that's always by my side. (I'm a life-long comfort-item addict... was a late thumbsucker and I still have my childhood teddy and blanket in the house as a married person in their 30s O\_O). That said, I'd really like to give it up. I want to experience what my body and brain feel like not dependent on a substance. 

It's a combination of the nicotine and the action of inhaling/throat hit, so gum has been a bust. Any tips?

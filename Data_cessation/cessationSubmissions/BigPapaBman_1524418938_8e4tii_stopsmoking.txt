New here

So I'm new here but looking for support. I have been smoking for over a decade and am starting to see how deeply rooted I've made it in my life. I always seem to convince myself to smoke in less than 24 hours of a break. I started using a vape to help the quit process and am now  only smoking at home in the evenings. Anything is appreciated.

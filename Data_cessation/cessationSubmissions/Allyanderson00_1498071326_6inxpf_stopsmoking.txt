Can you motivate me please?

Smoked for 15 years or so then quit for 10. Then stupidly I started again 2 years ago and hate it. I was aiming to quit tomorrow (22 June) but can't face it so am now aiming for this coming Monday (26th June). 

I know what to do, I've read Allen Carr many times and have quit for a few weeks here and there but this time feels different, I do feel ready but my head doesn't feel ready if that makes sense, the feeling of fear and dread that I can't handle the cravings and that I'll cave by lunchtime is scaring the shit out of me. 

So can I ask you all to help and provide me with the motivation I need to quit for good this time. 

Fuck nicotine and fuck smoking. 

Thanks folks

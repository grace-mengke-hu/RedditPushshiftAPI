1 month today, still super pissed

Today makes my one month mark. It’s so up and down y’all. One day I’m trying to talk my little sis (she’s quitting too and still is very early) out of going get a pack and the next, I’m here, needing my own pep talk I guess. I just don’t understand how I can have these just angry feelings. Still. I keep waiting and hoping to just be normal. I just wnt to scream. I just feel like my will power is just fading. Like faster by the days. I just keep telling myself, it’s been 31 days. Don’t do it. And I don’t think I will. I just wnt to not wnt it. I wnt to not get so mad about dumb shit just to look for an excuse to smoke. I don’t wnt my brain to keep trying to rationalize why I “need” a cigarette. I don’t wnt to smoke. But I do wnt to. 😡😢

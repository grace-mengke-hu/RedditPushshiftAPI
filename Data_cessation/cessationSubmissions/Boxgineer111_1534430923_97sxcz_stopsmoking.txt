I guess I am showing progress

Hi people. Today, I relapsed. I lit a cigarette. I was over the 45 days mark though. So, it just felt so foul and I really couldn't smoke much. Just took like 3-4 puffs and I threw it away. I know the danger involved with this mindset but I think I genuinely stopped smoking. It's over now, I am free.

I quit daily smoking over a year ago, but still smoke 'socially' Help, please!

Dear people of Reddit,

I was a smoker for almost 9 years and just over a year ago I decided to go cold turkey and quit completely, as well as quit drinking. I never smoked at home so quitting wasn't too much of an issue as I locked myself in at home for a while. But due to the fact I never smoked at home, after a while I found myself letting the odd cigarette slide whilst out with friends or on my break at work. I've since found myself smoking at least 5/6 on nights out every few weeks or so and can feel it starting to affect my health again.

What can I do to snap out of my acceptance of smoking socially or increase my willpower in order to not do so? I find it most difficult whilst at gigs where it's just 'the thing' to head outside and have a break/smoke and often find that I smoke for lack of having anything else to do.

Many thanks!

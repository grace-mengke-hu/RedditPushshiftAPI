1000 days

It's 998 days today, 1000 just around the corner but I just noticed and am sure I'll forget, so figured I'd pop in. 

I smoked for 17 years. Quitting was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but this community gave me the support and push I needed. I will never forget that. I have been 100% nicotine free since I cut cold turkey 998 days ago, and if I can do it, you can too. It's more than just saying you are going to quit, sometimes you need that extra push. For me, there was a redditor who said something that pushed me over the edge.

&gt;Chuck the gum out, and toughen up. It's really not that hard, its almost imperceptible and you'll be absolutely fine if you're determined. :) Good luck.

And so I did. And it worked. I just convinced myself I don't smoke anymore, and then I didn't. It just wasn't an option. I was a total asshole for a month or so, but what else is new.

Good luck to all of you! Stay strong! You can do it too!

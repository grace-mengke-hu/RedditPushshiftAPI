Nice try, big tobacco.

Day 4.  REAAALLY been craving and I was seriously tempted tonight; on Friday nights my son goes to his dad's house, and my husband got the baby down and I knew I needed to run to Target for some things.  I was so thinking about swinging in the 7/11 for a pack.  And then I checked the mail, and there were coupons for American Spirit packs for $2.  LOL.  It was just too funny, it felt like a sabotage and somehow, don't ask me how made it easier to resist.   Didn't get me this time!

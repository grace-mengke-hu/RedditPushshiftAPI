Concerned about a friend

Hey everyone. 

I've been watching my friend get worse health wise over the couple years. He and I are , however, I refrain from smoking cigarettes. 

He consumes about 1 pack or more per week. 

I've raised my concern about his consumption before, but he completely passes it off. His family also does not know he smokes. 

Can someone suggest to me how I can get my friend to take the first steps to stop smoking? Or will he have to realize his addiction himself?

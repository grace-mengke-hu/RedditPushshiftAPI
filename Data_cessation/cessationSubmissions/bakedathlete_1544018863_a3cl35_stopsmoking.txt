One month and no words for how good I feel!

I stopped smoking because I went on vacation and was spending time with a friend who has COPD, couldn’t exactly smoke around him! I took it as a chance to quit cold turkey without an option of walking to the store to buy a new pack. 

I get little feelings of “oh, that would be nice right now” when I see it in movies/TV or during the times of day I would usually smoke. I always looked forward to one after my evening shift at work and that’s when it hits me the most, but barely. 

I can walk miles without needing to gasp for air, my teeth are whiter, and my nails have finally returned to their normal appearance. They were so cracked and starting to turn yellow so that’s a big plus for me. I feel so much healthier mentally. It’s a big confidence boost to know I’m getting through it. 

It’s even the little things like not having to juggle my coffee and dog’s leash while worrying I’ll drop my cig. Not having to stand out in the rain or cold because I *need* it. Not having to walk in fresh air for 20 minutes and spray myself down before I go to work. And not feeling like I’m ruining my health for a vice I don’t really need. 

This community has helped a lot- reading y’alls stories and advice has kept me going. I appreciate you all!

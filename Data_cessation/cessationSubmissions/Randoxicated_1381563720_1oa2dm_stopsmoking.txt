365 days without a cigarette!

Stick with it, it gets better. The physical need goes away, chest no longer hurts, everything smells great, I no longer worry about smelling like smoke, I can breathe deep, and I don't have to run out to the gas station at midnight to make sure I have a pack for the next day.

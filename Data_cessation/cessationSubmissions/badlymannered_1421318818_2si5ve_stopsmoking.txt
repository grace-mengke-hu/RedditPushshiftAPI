In the Danger Zone

I am 33, I started smoking, stupidly, about 3 years ago. I've made, in the last month, a concerted effort to seriously ditch the habit, because I hate it. In the last month I have caved twice, so I've smoked 2 packs of cigarettes, but I am smoke free for 5 days as of right now. 

Thing is ... tonight I have just arrived back at my place after a fun night out, I've had a drink or two, I have an open bottle of wine sitting in front of me and I have a strong desire to go to the store to buy a pack of cigarettes.  Oh yeah, just say that word 'cigarette'... inhale, exhale, smoke goes in, smoke goes out, bit of a buzz, feelin good. ARRGGGGH!!! 

I'm just repeating the mantra that it won't make me feel better, it'll make me feel worse. One second after the first drag and I'll hate myself. How do you get through these difficult periods when you've had a few drinks and want a smoke??? HELP!!!

Feeling sick during first couple weeks?


Thanks in advance for reading and for all the motivation and encouragement thus far. I’m in week 2 of quitting nicotine (smoked for ~4.5 yrs, vaped for 1.5, cold turkey last Monday 6/17). 

I feel terrible. I’m exhausted. I’ve slept 12 hours the past 3 nights... no extenuating reasons for that. I am sweating all the time. I just feel awful and ill. 

Anyone else experience this and if yes any idea how long it will last?

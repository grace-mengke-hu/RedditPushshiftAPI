4 days in 🚭👏🏻

I'm 29 and have smoked since I was 13-14...I've attempted to quit about 6 times in 15 years and I did well into 3-6 months before returning. Quitting cold turkey is hard, but I've never been more determined. I love smoking like everyone but at this point it's just done nothing for me. I smoked and convinced myself that it helped with anxiety. It doesn't, because I've made sure to tell myself over the last 4 days to just keep breathing and come through...and that works just as well. My goal is today, and my hopes is getting to the next month. Then a year. I don't want to smoke anymore. Any tips? Thanks :) Chris

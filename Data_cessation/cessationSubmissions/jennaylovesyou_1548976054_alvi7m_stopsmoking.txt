I doubt I'll ever manage to quit.

Once I stopped for ~6 months after reading Allen Carr's EASYWAY. Then I stupidly started again during a night out.

The longest time I've managed to quit since then was for 3 weeks, after readinf Allen Carr's 'EASYWAY to Stop Smoking Permanently (a longer, updated version).

I' ve since listened to his audiobooks, read EASYWAY to stop smoking for women, downloaded his free app...

I impulsively make an attempt about 3 times a week, and I never last longer than 3 days. I get rid of all the cigarettes, and regularly break down and buy new ones.
I'm feeling pretty lost - I think the biggest issue is my stressful job (12h shifts working with paraplegics, 5x a week).

I don't know what to do anymore. Does anyone have any advice?

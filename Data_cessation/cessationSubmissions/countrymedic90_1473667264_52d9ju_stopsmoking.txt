This is my final time quitting. I refuse to go back because cigarettes are the reason I needed another back surgery.

I smoked my last cigarette August 15th and honestly I've only had one or two cravings. I had a spinal fusion August 23rd of 2014 and I should have listened to my doctor then when he said if I continued to smoke my fusion may not heal fully. Well I just had my fusion completely redone on August 23rd of this year because my stupid self didn't listen. So this is it. I'm almost at 1 month & I feel great (minus recovering from surgery).

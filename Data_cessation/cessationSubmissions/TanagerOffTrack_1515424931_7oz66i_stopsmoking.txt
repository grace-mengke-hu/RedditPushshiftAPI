My gum debate

Current smoker. I quit from February '17 to July '17. Thought I had it but now I'm back to my pack a day, pretty much. 

Last time I went cold turkey off the nicotine. I drank a ton of water and I chewed Orbit Bubblemint all damn day. 

Well, my dad passed some nicotine gum off to me, but I don't think it's going to help much. I think it will just continue the addiction and make it harder in the long run? 

Any input from others appreciated. 

PS my dad smoked for decades and despite quitting ciggs he's chewed the gum for over a decade. I've got 15 years of smoking (half my damn life, yuk) and I'm pretty sure my dad smoked for at least 30 years.

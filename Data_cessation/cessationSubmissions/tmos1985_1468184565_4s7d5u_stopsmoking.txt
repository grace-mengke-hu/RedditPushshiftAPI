Back to square one

Quit cold turkey couple of weeks ago. Everything was going great until Thursday. Had a rare day off work  during the week so went to town in the morning to have a look for new sneakers. For some reason I ended up buying cigarettes and since Thursday I have smoked 40. My last one was at 6pm today. Back to square one :-(

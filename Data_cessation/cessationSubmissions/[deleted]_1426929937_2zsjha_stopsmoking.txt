At the same number of days as my last quit

Just wanted to remind myself and others the importance of not becoming too complacent was around this stage on my first quit i was so proud of my achievemebt i thought to congratulate myself with one cig at a party, that complacency made me smoke for another 2 years full on ihope someone benefits from this as much as i have been benefited from all of your experiences

Quit one year ago. This sub helped me during the hard times. Thank you!

Smoked 60 cigs a day, had smokers cough, blood included. Broke 2 ribs during a coughing fit. 


That was one year ago.^


-The cough went away almost instantly, within a week after quiting. 

-Withdrawal symptoms kicked in after 3 days or so including some weird ones, like seeing green when i woke up.

-During the hard times i came to this sub and read the replies other people made to those that were having a hard time too. This gave me a boost to go on. Things like "keep going dude, it will go over" really have a positive impact.

-2 months in and i can't stand other people smoking. It stinks and takes my breath away.

-Things don't go brown anymore. By now i would take of the curtains for their "yearly" wash and be disgusted by how brown they looked from the nicotine and tar.

-Everything smells better too.

-I didn't save any money however. I eat twice as much as before and food is expensive in Belgium. I went from 105kg to 145kg. (231lbs to 320lbs)

-The only withdrawal I have today is that I often wake up pretending I'm pulling from a cigarette, with index and middle finger at my mouth as if there is a cig in between them.

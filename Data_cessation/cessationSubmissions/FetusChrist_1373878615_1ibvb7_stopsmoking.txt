3 days in. Girlfriend and family on board. Feeling great.

I've been a pack and a half a day for over a decade and this attempt is feeling the best so far, so I kinda just wanna get this out there and put my thoughts down to people who get it. 

I've always been very quiet about my attempts to quit in the past. Told myself the extra pressure of letting people down would add to the stress, but really I was worried they would look down on me if I failed.

This time I let everybody know and the response has been great, almost brings a tear to my eye knowing how much everyone cares. Seriously, everyone in my life has been running blocking on stress, the smokers are staying far away and febreezing before they come around me and I'm left with literally no excuse other than pure addiction to pick up another cigarette.

Girlfriend's in heaven, my nickyfits have been replaced by a very overactive libido and through those exercises and other physical distractions I'm already seeing an improvement in endurance. And that's just from not being dragged down by the cigarette I had a half an hour ago. I can't wait to see what happens when my lungs really have a chance to recover.

OK. Enough drunk ranting, I'm just really excited about finally being rid of those things.

On patches and a spray but still keep relapsing! :(

Ive been on the highest dosage of 16 hour patches for 3 weeks now along with a Nicorette spray yet can't get away from the fact that I always need a cig first thing! It's driving me insane. I just want to be done with nicotine but I feel like the addiction is stronger than I am.

This subreddit is just amazing.

I made a post not too long ago and didn't give it a second look. I logged back in today and found out that it got a lot of attention. Do you know why I logged back in? I was feeling the urge. Thank you, /r/stopsmoking for having my back. I read through the posts and it was motivating to keep up quitting. The urges just disappeared after reading your responses. You've given me encouragement by letting me know I'm not alone in this struggle. I hope that we can all be a bit more responsive to each and every post.. because knowing someone is going through what you're going through, really, really helps to keep one in line with what they believe is the right thing to do- stop smoking, and not give in to the random, spontaneous, unpredictable, urges.

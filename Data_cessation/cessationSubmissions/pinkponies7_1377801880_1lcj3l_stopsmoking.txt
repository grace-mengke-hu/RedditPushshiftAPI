New here! Just began my quitting journey a few days ago.

I am a 24/f and I have smoked about a half pack a day for the past 7 years, and smoked on and off for about 3 years before that. I tried quitting about 4 times so far. Once cold turkey, Once on chantix, and twice on patches. This time, I am again using Chantix because the first time I was like 20 and I think since I am more mature/genuinely wanting to stop, I am more likely to. I began Chantix last Saturday and I plan on totally quitting this weekend. I believe my chances of success will be better because 2 years ago I started a healthier lifestyle and exercise more, drink less. I also am moving into a new (smoke-free) apartment this weekend whereas I currently live with my parents (my father smokes). 

So far, I haven't had many side effects with Chantix. Just weird dreams in which my dog talks to me (but thats awesome and I wish it was real life) and where I have sexy time with Henry VIII (I just started to watch the Tudors). No nausea, not sleepyness all day. But I definitely have a bigger appetite and am easily agitated.

Anyways, I guess I just am posting and coming here for support. Most people I hang out with don't smoke and are like "just stop doing it, it can't be there hard." 
Also, I wanted to know if anyone used Chantix in conjunction with any other cessation-type? I don't know if that's even something people do, I just really want to quit this time and need all the help I can get!

If anyone wants to share helpful tips about Chantix, or quitting in general, its always welcome with me! good luck everyone!

One month, furthest I've ever made it!

Hello all! Allow me to share my story. I picked up smoking 3 years ago when I was 16. I would smoke about 6 or 7 a day but would go through a pack a day on weekends. I finally made decision to quit with patches 30 days ago. It's been tough at times but overall am doing well. I'm a bit nervous to go back to school in the fall because I feel the stress of school work might get to me. Despite these nerves I would say I am quite confident that I will not smoke again. Yay!!

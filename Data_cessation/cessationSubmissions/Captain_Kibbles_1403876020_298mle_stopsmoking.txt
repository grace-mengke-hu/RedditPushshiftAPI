24 Hours without a cigarette, is now the right time to quit? (Details inside)

I went through a breakup about 4 weeks ago and honestly I'm feeling pretty good right now about it, but there are times were I feel really upset and nervous and smoking a cigarette just calms me down.  

Over the last few weeks I've been trying to cut back and I had most managed to make most weekdays with only 4-6 cigs, but the weekends when I felt alone I could smoke a pack a day.  To help cut back during the weekdays I go to the gym and cycle to keep me distracted and prevent myself from smoking and thinking about the breakup.

I'm only so hesitant to quit at this exact moment due to cigarettes being a nice relaxer for me during stressful times over the last three years.

I was wondering if there was anyone else that decided to quit during a stressful time in their life as well and what you did to curb the cravings.

Thanks in advance

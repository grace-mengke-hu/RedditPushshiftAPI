Craving nicotine without ever consuming any.

So I've been craving a Juul for a while and have never "vaped" one. I've been offered it many times but i have not hit it at all but for some reason I started craving one all of the sudden. These cravings have also been consistent so i know its not a one time thing. My sister had the same thing happen to her and because of it she started smoking cigarettes. I was wondering how to not even start with that stuff and avoid it completely. I'm also sixteen which sadly means i have super super easy access to a Juul. Any help would be appreciated.

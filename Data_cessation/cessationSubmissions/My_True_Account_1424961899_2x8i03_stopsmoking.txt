Sometimes I truly enjoy smoking.

I think that the worst part is that I enjoy my stupid little routines that I've developed. My favorite part of it all is on Friday nights after work, I come home and drink a few beers in my backyard and smoke. Or after I come back from the gym. These are the times that I truly enjoy it. All the other times I smoke, I tell myself that I need to quit and that's when I'm most motivated. "After this pack, I'm done!" Then Friday rolls around, and I'm a weak SOB that justifies that I "earned it," then goes running out to go get a pack. I think if I could get that under control, it'll be a lot easier.

What were your favorite routines and how did you break from it?

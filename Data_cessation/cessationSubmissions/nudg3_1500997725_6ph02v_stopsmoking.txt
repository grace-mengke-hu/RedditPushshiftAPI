16 days in and I'm dying for a smoke.

I felt great the last few days as far as cravings go. Last night (overnight) at work I was running around like a mad man and by the time it was 5am I thought I was going to call all my employees to the back room to strangle them out of pure stress relief. Is there a time when you won't crave anymore?

Two weeks, no cigarettes, alcohol or caffine. But plenty of weed.

I actually quit alcohol 6 weeks ago. That wasn't difficult. It is a major trigger for me with cigarettes, so I knew in order for me to be successful, it was necessary.
I also gave up caffine 2 weeks weeks ago. The main reason for that was that I get all my caffine from Cola. I am already overweight and I can't afford to gain any more. So i gave up soda and caffine. 
Overall the first three days were very difficult. Constant cravings along with headaches. I almost gave in several times, but I battled through it. Nicotine losenges helped tremendously. 
After three days it gradually started to get better, although I did start coughing a lot more. My lungs were clearing out. The second week is when I started feeling better. Better physically and mentally. Just more upbeat, more awake, more alert more positive.  I am so happy I've gottern this far and I am looking forward to a cigarette/alcohol/caffine free summer.  God willing.
I am still have one vice, that is weed. I smoke it daily, I think it is helping me get through this. And I don't have any desire to quit it right now. If science ever proves that it is harmful to your health, maybe then I'll consider quitting that as well. But for now I'm concentrating on the cigarettes, alcohol and Caffine.
For anyone out there who is on the fence about quitting smoking, just go for it, get through that first week, and you will do just fine.

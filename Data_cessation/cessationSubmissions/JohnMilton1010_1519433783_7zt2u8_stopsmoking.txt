Weaning off nicotine

I have been a constant juul smoker for two years (ripping it all throughout the day pretty much every day) and I finally decided to quit 5 days ago. I donâ€™t want to be reliant on nicotine anymore. I tried going cold turkey for two days, but given that I was loading my system with such high concentrations of nicotine so often, withdrawal was not pretty. I then opted for a much better plan: weaning off the juul gradually by switching lower and lower mgs of nicotine in a vape. However, I am unsure as to how much time I should give myself to adjust to each different amount of nicotine before I go on to the next. Juul has 59 mg/ml of nicotine, and I am currently using a vape with 35 mgs (for three days so far). How long should I use this concentration before I go on to the next? Any advice would be very helpful and much appreciated. Thanks a lot

I WANT a cigarette

its 5-6 days since i quit smoking.  Took a break from drinking too, since it normally leads me to smoking.  Last time i did this i went back to smoking after a heavy night of drinking.

Long story short, decided to "strengthen" my impulses, went and got a small bottle of Fireball, and finish it.  This was last night.  Want a smoke real bad... I WANT A CIGARETTE!!  I WANT!  Want??

And just like that, I laughed to myself and realize the last time i try to quit, i said " I NEED A CIGARETTE!  I NEED ONE NOW!!"  Now my cravings are down to "WANT"

I don't need a cigarette anymore, but i do WANT one, and thats a victory.  Hopefully by the end of this month, " I feel like i might need a smoke"

I successfully stop myself from smoking by realizing I NEED was changed to I WANT in my own head.

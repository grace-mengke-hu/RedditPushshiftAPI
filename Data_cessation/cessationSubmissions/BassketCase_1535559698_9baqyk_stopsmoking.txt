230 days without smoking, but all of sudden I'm craving it again. Is that even possible after such a long time?

I feel like I "need it" again. My brain is telling me I did good for 230 days, but now I can reward myself with a pack of cigs... Also, I feel really stressed right now, that's might also be a factor. And my brain is like "You could stop smoking any time again, you already proved it, so it isn't a big deal if you smoke a bit again. You can quit any time."

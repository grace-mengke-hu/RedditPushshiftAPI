Nearing my 70th day and I hate this.

Hello fellow quitters,

If I'm going to be honest, I'm pissed off. I'm near completing my 10th week completely smoke free and lately I've been thinking to myself, "What the f*ck for?".

Since I've quit smoking I've noticed changes in my body. To list a couple of the positives:

- My lung capacity has significantly increased.
- I am able to be physically active for longer periods of time.

Not that it was a problem to begin with, I was never short of breath and my physical activity was never a problem. So the list of negatives far worse:

- The first thing is everything tastes different.
- My anxiety is out of control.
- I'm in a lot of pain all the time.
- I still want to smoke because I'm often bored and would have in those instances over the past 10 years. 

Why are these problems? 

None of my favourite foods taste nearly as good anymore. In fact, many of them I don't even like anymore. I haven't even found new ones to like. I have existential depression and as a result often have anxiety attacks. Normal anxiety medication never really worked but smoking helped because not only did it relax me but it also gave me a sense of control. Furthermore, I can feel a lot of pain that I assumed had been numbed from damaged nerve endings that have now been repaired.

Worst of all I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.  My quality of life hasn't improved, affording cigarettes was never an issue. If it's not cigarettes i'l piss away $700/month on something else. I know many of you will probably say, "Your future you will thank you" but by some freak chance my grandfather smoked for 78 years and died at 93 of natural causes. So who really knows, right?

I guess I wrote this long *ss post because I'm literally asking you quitters out there, if any of you have been in my shoes then why did you quit?

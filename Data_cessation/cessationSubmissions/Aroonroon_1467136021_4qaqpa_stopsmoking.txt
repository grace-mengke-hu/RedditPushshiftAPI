Is there any point in cutting down, scientifically?

Or is smoking 4 cigarettes a day equal to smoking 20? How does the nicotine work? I realize that all smoking is extremely bad for your health. I've been smoking 10-15 per day for a long time, but after a failed attempt to quit I've now reduced it to around 4-5. I'd like to think that this has _some_ positive effect on my health. But when I try to find information about this, all I ever find is people pointing out that all smoking is unhealthy. I know that, but come on! Surely 5 cigarettes per day is better than two packages?

[I read a norweigan study of light smokers,](http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/5/315.full) but didn't quite grasp it. As far as I can tell it just tells you that smoking is bad for you in any amount. 

I can't find any info on the health-benefits of cutting down even if it's a radical amount. It sucks, because I felt kind of proud of being able to cut down and keep it down. Do you know anything about this that I don't?

Any graduate students out there attempting to quit?

I am currently in graduate school. I successfully made it 10 days, however I broke down today and bought a pack. My family doesn't know I smoke, so I cannot use them for guidance and encouragement and my social life at this point is nonexistent. It would be great to hear some success stories (or people that are currently trying) from some grad students. I will try again tomorrow and hopefully I can make it through!

Two years since my last cigarette, and suddenly having immense cravings.

It's been two years since my last lapse in willpower. I started smoking really early. I quit cold turkey when I realized I couldn't sing as well any more, but had a couple of lapses.  Now it's been two years since I smoked. 
Back when I smoked I would go on long walks at night while smoking. I stopped walking at night when I quit. Recently, I've been trying to stay healthy, and since I've always preferred to walk at night, I've been doing that every night. 
While I've been walking, I'll constantly want something in my hand to smoke. And now I've noticed that I've just been wanting the smell and taste. Should I stop walking, or do you think it'll pass?

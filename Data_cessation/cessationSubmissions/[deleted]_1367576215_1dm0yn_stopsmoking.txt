How can I go about a "quitting day"?

I've seen this mentioned here before. I don't want to quit smoking at all but I know I should. My problem is that I don't know where to start stopping.

 I've switched to American Spirits lately simply because they have no additives and are more mellow than say Marlboro thinking this would make it easier to quit. I say, "Huh, don't even need one right now", then proceed to light one up anyway. 

I get hostile when I try to quit and work in a place that depends on my good mood to earn more money (I'm tipped and I up-sell). 

I've stopped energy drinks and soda to replace with water, to which I feel much better. It's about time I get a quitting day and say [FUCK YOU CIGARETTES, YOU CAN SUCK MY DICK!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ewuxMT0e1qjr671o1_500.jpg)

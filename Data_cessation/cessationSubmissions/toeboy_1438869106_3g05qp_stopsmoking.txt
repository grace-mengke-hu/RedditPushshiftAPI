over a week later...

and i've reached the point where i don't even care if i have a cigarette or not. 

this is really nice. coffee actually works for me again. when i smoke teh pot, i stay high longer, and it's not groggy and tired all the time. i have energy to get up and be active. and i can TASTE THINGS SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

for anyone that is struggling with the first week, trust me. it's worth it. wait til the nicotine is out of your system completely, and your favorite meals will be even better, and smokers smell...dirty almost. not that they are, but they seem so. 

keep it up! it can only get better from here!

1 week smoke free. At a concert where I dont know anyone and only kinda speak the language. Everyone is smoking.

No other reason to post other than to get some validation and solidarity. This is fucking hard. I've been traveling for 7 months in central/South America and cigarettes have been so cheap and it's been so easy to justify smoking because I'm on vacation, right? I've been at ~15 cigarettes a day for the last 4 months which is a lot more than I've ever smoked before. It doesn't help that a pack costs about $2 here.. 

Any tricks to beat the cravings? I've got candy and beer and social media at my disposal.

I passed the test of not smoking while drinking. You can do it too!

So I am about 4 days into quitting. Everyone has warned me about how they were good with quitting until they had some booze and then it was all downhill from there. Well I experienced that in full force tonight. I was around friends who all chain smoke, and i had quite a few drinks. I wanted a smoke SO bad but I kept telling myself to just make it through this one one night. Well time went on and I am home safe sound and still cigarette free. God damn, I haven't been tempted like that in a long time. My message to everyone freshly into quitting is this, no matter what, stay strong, and you can do this.

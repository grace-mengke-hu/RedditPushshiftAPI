A cautionary tale..

Well, much as I wish I was celebrating a year badge or the like, I'm not.. this is a new account for me but previously I was nicotine free for years.

Then - and there's no excuse - a rather bad breakup and I don't know what.. but one of my friends smokes and I grabbed a cig one night.. then went a week without smoking and got the stupid idea that I can "handle it" and only smoke once in a while.

You can guess the rest.  Once or twice a week became several times a week.  Then feeling bad for bumming so bought friend a pack and of course smoked half of it.  Now, here I am, buying packs regularly.  I'm about a half dozen packs in at this point.

There's no greater expression about addiction than "one is too many, a thousand is not enough."

I hate it.  I hate being that stupid rat again, destroying my body to answer the needs of my addiction.  Pressing that lever again and again all the while resenting it, worrying I'll get cancer.

I keep thinking "tomorrow" but we know how that works.  So I guess I'll be hanging out here more often moving forward.  I hope to get that badge and to let those numbers soar into the rest of my life time.

Thanks and best to all of you in setting yourself free.

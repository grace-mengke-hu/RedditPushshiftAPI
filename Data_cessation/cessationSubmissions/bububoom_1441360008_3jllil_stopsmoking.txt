obligatory 200 day rant

Awww yeeah.

Actually these days something has changed in me and I started to view smoking as kinda pleasure habit again.

I remember how it was fun to smoke but I am somehow sure I will not start again. I feel very like "I know its gonna be good but after that I will feel awful about breaking my own rules".

I believe the real struggle begins only now when I can involunterely grab a pack some day to remember good old days.

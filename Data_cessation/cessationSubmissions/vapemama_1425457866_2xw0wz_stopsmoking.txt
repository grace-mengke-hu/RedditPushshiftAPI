Feeling very sad..

I quit smoking almost 2 months ago and I dont have cravings any more. I usually dont post on here because I havent craved since quitting, and I just want to be here for support of my fellow non smokers. However, today I am feeling sad. Sad that I smoked for so long and scared to death of what consequences will come with that. I smoked more than a pack a day for 8 years. I can say that I will never smoke again with confidence, but Im wondering if that will be enough....My brother in laws mother passed away today. 5 weeks ago she saw the doctors because she was having neck pain and a cough that would not go away. They discovered that she had stage 4 lung cancer. She smoked for sometime, but quit 30 years ago. I am so sad that this happened. How can someone be smoke free for 30 years and still die from lung cancer..how can someone be fine one minute and then get eaten away by cancer in just five short weeks. I am scared for my health. I am scared for my future. I am scared for my children. I cant shake this feeling that I completely ruined my life by smoking for so long..

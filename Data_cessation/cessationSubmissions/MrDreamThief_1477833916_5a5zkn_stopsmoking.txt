Gaining weight

I've always been slender. I've averaged 165 pounds on my 6-foot tall body. It's been over two weeks and I'm over 172 pounds now. I don't want to end up like my parents who were both well over 250 pounds. I'll take solid advice. I don't want to start smoking again but I don't know where the weight is coming from. I don't think I'm eating more.

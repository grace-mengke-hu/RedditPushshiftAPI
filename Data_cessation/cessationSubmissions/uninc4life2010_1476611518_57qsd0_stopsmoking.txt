Major victory tonight!

So I am currently on day 5 since I decided to quit, and I have been dealing with some serious cravings lately.  I went to a bar tonight with my buddies and we had drinks on the back patio.  One of my buddies is a smoker and smoked about half of a pack out there.  We also talked with a couple of guys, both of whom were smoking.  I'll admit, it was very difficult to sit there an not ask for a cigarette.  I kept having to ignore the voice in my head that was telling me to "just have one" throughout the entire night.  Overall, I'm pretty proud of myself that I was able to exercise the self-control necessary to stay on track, thought I do have to admit that it wasn't easy.

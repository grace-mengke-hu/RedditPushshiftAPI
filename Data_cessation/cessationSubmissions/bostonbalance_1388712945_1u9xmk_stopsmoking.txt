we will see what happens

I am 20 years old. I have been smoking cigarettes on and off for the past three years. i have also been smoking pot for the past four years. i have been drinking for the past four years. recently (past 6 months) i have been cutting back on the drinking. maybe one or two on the weekdays. have a little fun on the weekends. i have been trying to cut back on everything for the past couple months. i have just decided to stop smoking cigarettes. i have attempted this before but it hasn't worked out. now i am serious. in turn i want to record my progress. a personal timeline for my self. i feel if other people are reading i will be more willing to keep going. 

i will be happy to answer any questions. talking is helpful.

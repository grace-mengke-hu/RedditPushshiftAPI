Advice for my first time going out drinking since quitting.

I quit smoking 8 days ago, and haven't been drinking since. Tonight i'm going out with some friends (some smoke, some don't). From previous attempts I know it's very hard to resist the urges when drinking. Do you guys have some advice for me? Or do I just have to suck it up?

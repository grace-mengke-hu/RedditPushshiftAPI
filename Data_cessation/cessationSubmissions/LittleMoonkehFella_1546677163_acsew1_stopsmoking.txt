Binge smoking at work. How to fill in time on lunch breaks?

I plan on quitting smoking. My main issue has *always* been my breaks at work. I’ll smoke one on my ten, three on my half, and another on my last ten minute break. I smoke right before work, and as soon as I walk out the door.

I suspect it’s either a stress thing, or a boredom thing. I don’t know how to fill my breaks at work. Sure I can look at my phone, but there’s only so much reddit you can handle before you go crazy.

Do any of you have any advice? A fidget spinner? Anything. 

I don’t generally smoke a lot at home. Maybe only one or two at night. Work has always been the issue, and now I’m completely and utterly hooked.

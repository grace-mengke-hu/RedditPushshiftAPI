Quitting Juul

Hey y’all, 
I feel like an idiot for even being in this position in the first place. I have always been very into health and fitness so the fact I ended up addicted to juul just leaves me totally disappointed in myself. I started 2 years ago when I was a freshman in college, I was stressed out and would go to parties and people would ask if I wanted a hit, and before I knew it I went out and bought a juul of my own. Just about everyone in my hall at the dorms had one so it was just accepted as normal. I quit for a couple months last summer but picked it up again when the school year started back up. Now I’m going to be a junior in less than a month, I’m training for the Army 10 miler, and I overall just feel like crap. I juul any chance I get from the moment I get up until I go to bed, usually going through about a pod a day which is just ridiculous and expensive. I have bigger fitness goals now and this just isn’t conducive to them, I’m tired of feeling tired and relying on this to pick me up when I get stressed out. I’ve been trying to get myself to just quit for a couple months now, but every time I’d get to my last pod in a pack I’d get cold feet and not follow through. But I’m doing this for real today and it’s going to be permanent. I hope I can get some support and maybe hear from others who have also quit juul.

One week and going strong. Couldn't do it without my wife.

I quit one week ago along with my wife. She is using nicorette gum and i am using patches and wellbutrin. I had tried cold turkey in the past and just couldn't do it. I tried chantix and couldn't stand the side effects. I visited with my DR and he suggested trying wellbutrin. It may not be for everyone but it helps a lot with the cravings. There is no magic pill to make quitting easier but I am happy with my technique. If you can go cold turkey more power to you. I know i will always want to smoke. My mother quit 30 years ago and she told me she still thinks about it from time to time. It requires motivation to quit and a desire to free yourself from addiction. Good luck all!

Flashback cravings

Ive been off cigarettes for 14 months now and off nicotine (vaping) for roughly 9 months. Other than literally 3 puffs of one cigarette back in February I honestly havent had any cheat days at all. I can honestly say thats the longest Ive been quit since the first day I started smoking back in 2002-03. I have to say I am quite proud of that. 
In the mean time I decided to try out the keto diet with more than amazing results. Since September Im down roughly 35lbs and Ive been feeling better than ever. My thinking and brain power has increased drastically and I noticed that thoughts of smoking were literally less than 1 thought per day on average. 
Now, here comes the tricky part for me. About 3 weeks ago I decided to book a vacation to somewhere tropical since where I live gets very cold and I havent had a proper vacation in years. Out of all the places I decided to visit Mexico since it was a reasonably priced and it was a direct flight. The bad news is that on the resort you can pretty much smoke anywhere a person wishes (minus the rooms and restaurants). I see people smoking on the beach, by the pools, by the building entrance, sidewalks, you name it. Gets annoying. However, with that Ive had some major issues debating whether or not quitting smoking was worth it. I dont know how else to describe it. Cigarettes are so cheap here that it almost makes me want to light up. I havent and I doubt I will but the thoughts are so strong that its worrying me. My anger issues are through the roof and I am honestly feeling lost and confused and I dont know where to turn or what to do. Has anyone experienced this before? Does anyone have coping mechanisms or knows why this is happening. Any help would be HIGHLY appreciated since this is a very tough time for me. 
I thank eberyone in advance for weighing in.

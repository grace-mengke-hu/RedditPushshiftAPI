Having a serious crisis.

So, I quit smoking almost three years ago, shortly after I met my now fiancee. He made it clear he would not be with a smoker, and I had wanted to quit anyway, so I went cold turkey and apart from a few drinking-related screw ups, I was fine (vaping helped a lot).

HOWEVER.

About 5 months ago I started a very stressful internship. I coped for a while, but about 10 weeks ago I had a really shit week, etc etc and cracked. I decided not to tell my SO, partly because I was ashamed and felt like a failure, and also because it gave me kind of more reason not to let myself fall back on to cigarettes. 

I gave up again that weekend, but come Monday I was smoking again. This happened every week or so, then a new guy started who smokes. Now that I have a smoking buddy, I'm finding it really hard again. Even vaping isn't helping. I only smoke when I'm at work, but I need some serious help stopping completely, because my finacee STILL doesn't know, and I HATE keeping this from him (but it would break his heart to find out, and also I would feel even worse). That means I have zero support at home, and I work in a job where the only breaks I get are smoke breaks. It's fucking hard as shit and I'm failing. I refuse to start my marriage off on a lie, and I do not want to be a smoker any more. 

I'm not sure if this is a rant or what I expect from this but I need to vent, I need some support, and if anyone has any ideas that would be great. The guy in work is also trying to quit, but the second he fails, I do too. It's tough!

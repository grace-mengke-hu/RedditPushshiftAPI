Any one quit for several months and notice an improvement in general anxiety / depression / energy levels?

I've quit several times now, but every time I reach a month or so, I get super depressed and feel like it isn't helping whatsoever so I rationalize for a bit and then end up smoking again. 

Is it normal to feel depressed around this time? Does it take several months to get back to a healthy psychological state? 

All testimonies welcomed and appreciated!!

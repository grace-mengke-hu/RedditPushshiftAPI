[Question] Withdrawal Syndrome?

Hey guys. I was smoking since 12. I'm 24 now. I really want to start in fully quitting smoking. During 2014, I was able to stop for a year. But temptation got the best of me. Now I'm attempting to stop again. However, one of the biggest factors of going back to smoking was the Withdrawal Syndrome. If I would not smoke for lets say around 2-3 days, my whole chest muscles would hurt. Like its being crushed or twisted. I remember that because of the pain, I was unable to come to work for a day or two. Anyone got any advice on what to take or what to do whenever experiencing these relapses? Thanks!

6 Months today, need some advice

Hey guys, i decided last year to quit smoking after 5 years, i though it would be a bit to cliche to do it for a new years resolution so i quit the week before new years.. those few days did not make a happy holiday :P

6 months down the line i have no shortness of breath, i can breathe probably, and i don't smell all the time.

I need some advice with friends who smoke. I have a lot of friends who social smoke and i love hanging around with them but when i do the smell of there cigarettes is so tempting, i haven't touched one yet but i feel it might happen at some point and i will fall into the old bad routine. I want to know if it ever gets any easier to deal with, or will i just have to rely on my willpower?

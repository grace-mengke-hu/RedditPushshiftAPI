ONE YEAR!!!

It has been one year now, and it went by so fast! I'm really, really proud of myself.

I can't even begin to say how much better I feel now than I did a year ago. I don't have cravings anymore unless I'm drinking, but drinking me is still wise enough to say no.

For those who are thinking about quitting: DO IT. You will look back on it as one of the best decisions of YOUR LIFE. Your health will improve, your breathing will improve, your dating pool will widen and you'll feel so accomplished. Just do it. You might fail (I did, many times) but just keep picking yourself back up and try different things until something works!

For those of you newly quit: CONGRATS! Above anything else remember that you are stronger than a substance. If quitting is something that you really want, you can do it. Just a few weeks of bad cravings and then you'll have YOUR WHOLE LIFE ahead of you! This moment will pass and you will feel better.

Also, AMA!

Keep it up, y'all!!

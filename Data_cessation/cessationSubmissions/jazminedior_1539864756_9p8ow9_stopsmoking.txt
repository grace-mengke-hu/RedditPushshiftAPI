Setbacks keeps setting me back

I’m not a heavy smoker. When I first started maybe 10 years ago, it was mostly social. Then I used cigarettes as a coping mechanism. Stressful day? Smoke. Hit with a wave of anxiety and depression? Chain smoke. I hate the way it makes me feel. I get the worst nicotine headaches. My head starts pounding and I want to vomit. I hate the way it makes me smell. I started packing a “smell” kit to help. When I would sneak cigs, I’d throw them in a water bottle because I had no where else to hide the butts, but when I took out the trash I was confronted with a golden brown bottle of nicotine, tar, and chemicals. I couldn’t believe i was smoking them. I knew it was bad. My skin would look dull after a day of chain smoking. But I couldn’t help it. So I decided to quit October 1st. Five days later I found out my boyfriend was seeing other women behind my back. So I ran back to cigarettes. And of course I can’t throw them out because I spent almost $9 and that’s a waste of money!!! But I so badly want to quit. I like myself so much better when I don’t smoke. I don’t have to sneak around. I have more clarity and energy. But the smallest inconveniences trigger this helpless side of me that relies on cigarettes to cope. I want to quit. I’m going to quit. But i need better tools in place to make this stick.

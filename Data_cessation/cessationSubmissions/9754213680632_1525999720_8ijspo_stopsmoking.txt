Weird dreams about smoking

So, it's been 2 months since I last had a cigarette. It feels fucking amazing. 

One thing I noticed recently, and this has only started after I quit, is that I constantly have dreams where I'm smoking. Dreams where someone will offer me a cigarette, dreams where I randomly pull a cigarette out of thin air, etc. I'm interested in why, because I had similar dreams about alcohol when I first became teetotal a few years ago. It sucks because I wake up and get upset because I think I've caved and had a cigarette and ruined my attempt to quit. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

9 months, 7 months, 3 months.... ALL it takes is 1 moment to make it zero.

I don't even trust myself anymore. All it takes is ONE MOMENT of being a human being making a mistake for 1 minute and 7 months become 0 days again..

Honestly I'm only at 14 days right now but so many times I've made it to 5-7 months and I'm totally convinced on 99.99% of those days that I do not ever want to smoke.  Then comes that 0.01% moment and I've ruined my 7 months. So honestly, I don't even believe I will be free at 7 months this time.

Does anyone have experience with this? Like, has anyone repeatedly ruined a DECENT QUIT (months)?  For me it seems it's 5-7 months is my record, I've ruined about 4 quits in the span of 5 years reaching 5-7 months.


And has anyone finally broke their plateau and are now years smoke free? When did you finally come to the realization. "Okay. This time I have X months free and it's just different this time. I have ZERO fondness for enjoying a smoke".

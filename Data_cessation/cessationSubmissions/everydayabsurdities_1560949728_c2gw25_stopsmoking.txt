Cold/flu after quitting

It's been about 9 days since I quit and the first week was quite easy since I had a very bad cold anyway. It's gotten a bit better but I'm still left with a stuffy nose and a cough that feels like a lot of mucus wants to come out. My throat also feels quite tight and i'm unsure if that's my obsessiveness or actually physical. Have you experienced these "quitter's flu" - like symptoms, too? I really want to actually experience the easier breathing, haha.

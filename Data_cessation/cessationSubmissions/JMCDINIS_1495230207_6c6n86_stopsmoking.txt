My second time here

Hey. I'm 17, I've smoked for a year and it's my second time here. I first came around 3/4 months ago, I stopped for [not even] a week and I couldn't fight it any longer.

Now I want to stop again. And I finished my pack today at 5 pm and it's 10.30 pm and I'm already thinking just one more.

I just had dinner, so it's even harder after a meal. It's not even a quarter of a day and I'm already thinking of just keeping smoking.

I know a lot of way longer time smokers stopped, and it was even harder for them. But I am a person with weak power of will and I know I am not this strong.

The positive side of stopping is that I'm trying to gain weight, I've been eating more and going to the gym, and when I don't smoke I tend to eat more. So, I got that going. In my school breaks, I usually don't eat anything, sometimes in the middle of the class I grab a bite or something, but I find myself starving in the middle of the morning. But I forget to est because as soon as I leave class, I just want to smoke.

And this will be the hardest part. My friends and I all gather up during breaks and some of them smoke. It will be really hard to go there every break, to the spot where I used to smoke, with the people I used to smoke with, who will be smoking. But I might be eating, so I'll be kind of entertained and hope it won't make me want to smoke.

This post did not have any point, I just wanted to share something to help out my craving. Sorry if you read it all hoping for something,  but I'll be doing it this a lot, I really helps.

4 days in.... this is soooooooo hard!!! did I mention I loved smoking

Hi there. Well, this is my first time ever on a online forum but I'm at my witts end so trying anything. I have been a smoker for more than 25 years and to be honest...I loved smoking. I also knew I have to quit...not only for me but for my family. Smoking costs too much money which we don't have and I have a beautiful little girl who just turned 3 and has figured out how to open the front door. I almost got busted a few times. I don't ever want her to see me smoke and I want to live to see her grow up and become the incredible human I know she will be. I quit while I was pregnant and nursing...which was so hard but then I wasn't nursing anymore, my cat of 15 years died and I was back at work and well, you know how it goes...just one.... Right now I am getting ready for bed and I swear the craving has lasted 3 hours....I can't stop thinking about having a puff so I downloaded a quit smoking app and this is my challenge ...find a site and connect with people. So here I am, trying to connect.  I am on the patch so am so perplexed that the cravings are so strong.  I don't ever remember them being this bad...perhaps it was because I was pregnant...I don't know.  Sorry for the rant. Never done this before. Good luck to everyone and thanks for reading my struggle.

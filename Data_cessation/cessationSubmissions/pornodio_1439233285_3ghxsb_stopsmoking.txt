any hardcore smokers here? (+40cigs) been quitting almost everyday for 8 months

Everytime I just started again harder and harder. I reached the point of cutting cigarettes in half on the filter (I was always used to smoke hand-rolled cigs, with small filter, but when I quit and had a craving used to buy the normal ones and had to cut the filter to make them feel normal to me, I eventualy got hooked to those).

I need to quit really bad, I quit again today but my hopes are really low after all the failures. Yesterday I managed to resist 24 hours with bad cravings on the final 3 hours when a colleague offered me one and felt like a snake getting hypnotized.

I need to quit really bad for what's happening to my body. My hair have thinned so damn fast even if I don't have bad balding genes. My skin got ruined in the last year it's like I gained 4 years (I'm 29 and look at least 34). All the stress of working abroad in a foreign country and being alone gave me a hard time quitting smoking. 

I've also realized I've been using cigs to hide my emotions, all my life. I've smoked for 10 years.

Thanks for the time

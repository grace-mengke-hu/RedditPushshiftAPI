Quitting is not impossible!

Hey guys, even though I don't smoke at all anymore I want you guys to know quitting is possible, and after a few weeks you'll have completely forgotten about smoking. I used to smoke whenever I went to parties but after I moved away I got depressed and started smoking alot more. After a few weeks I decided to quit smoking to pursue fitness, I've been clean of smoking since end March and in the time and money I've saved from it I went from a really skinny guy to a decently fit and muscular guy. Change is possible. You just have to replace your bad habits with good ones!

Okay, I need a buttload of help with this. I'm really sucking. Please help me save my life. I think I need a plan.

I've barely gone a full 24 waking hours (not including sleep) where I havn't caved.

I really want to quit smoking, of course I don't want to die in an horrific way, and I want my bank account to be healthier too. But I can't seem to do it, I don't know why. My will power is fucking terrible, and I really need help.

I'm trying to go cold turkey and failing absolutely miserably.

Here are the things I am struggling with (and I'm sure there are more reasons that I havn't realised yet)

* I'm at home in the same environment all the time, the environment I've been in as a smoker for years. I have a physical disability which means I am bedbound at times, homebound the rest of the time. I cannot leave this environment, I cannot go for a walk to keep myself busy, all activities I had to busy myself were also accompanied by smoking - reading, playing video games, watching TV.

* The reasons I have for quitting smoking don't seem to be strong enough, although I know they *are* and *should be*.. they seem like nothing when I'm craving, they don't help with the willpower. It's torture. 

* People have said things to me like 'Did you enjoy your first cigarette?' like it will give me some kind of revelation - problem is, yes I *did* enjoy my first cigarette. That's why I carried on. I didn't feel sick, I didn't cough. Thinking back to my first cigarette doesn't help yet everyone I try to talk to brings this up for some reason.

* God, I honestly just fucking suck at this and I hate myself at the moment. 3 days. I just want to be able to go 3 fucking days without one. I DO want to quit but it doesn't seem enough, my willpower is awful, but I want this. 

I don't want to get sick. I want more money. My partner is a non-smoker. I don't live with them, but do live with other people who have cigarettes always available and who are dreadfully unsupportive - or at least apathetic to my plight. Talking to them about wanting to quit has not helped one bit, they don't care what I want. I have no where else to go or live. My carer is onboard with me quitting but doesn't know how to help.

What the fuck can I do to get my ass into gear? Just get over that first initial hurdle. I posted a thread asking about the 'cravings never going away' and loads of people replied, and definitely calmed my fears with that. *I'm not worried about that anymore*, I can handle any subtle, rare wantings in the future. I know that. I am able to ignore the odd craving - I've battled against a few in just the few days I've attempted this, but eventually it gets exhausting and I give in just to end the constant, constant wanting and thinking about it. I know it wont be like that for the rest of my life but I just need the strength to start getting there first, and I can't seem to find it?

Sleeping through it (or trying to) doesn't seem to help, because the moment I wake up it's there and I can't nap for long.

Fuck, whats wrong with me. Can someone help me with a plan? Why is my willpower this bad? Why am I failing so miserably? I really hate myself right now. I'm also hating the person who gave me my first cigarette. I hate that I didn't keep saying no to them. I hate the fact that I wanted them to think I was 'cool'. Just a stupid, petty stupid reason of mine and I got myself into this mess years later. I wish I didn't enjoy that first cigarette. I'm a complete failure.

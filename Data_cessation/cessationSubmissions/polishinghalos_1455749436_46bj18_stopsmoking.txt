It's about time for me to quit smoking.

I started while in the ARMY, and I gotta say I love it, I enjoy sitting outside in the warm sun and smoking and just relaxing in a chair. But I gotta say I have a fear of getting cancer and of course emphysema. What's the best way to quit? I smoke smooths and i'm looking for a taste similar or something to keep my mind off it. Any ideas? I need some support here.

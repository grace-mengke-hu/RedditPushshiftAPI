Today's the day I stop. Today's the day I quit.

I'm new to this subreddit and such, but I wanted to just let you guys hear why I'm quitting. I'm 21. I'm at a point in life I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing with my life. But I'm trying to figure it out. My biggest issue with my entire self being is...I have no will power. I won't save up money for something. I won't change anything unless I absolutely have to. I just live today to the next. That's not what I want. I want to move out of this city, I want to go somewhere big. I want to travel. Im not quitting because of how harmful cigarettes are for me, im quitting because I want to be the one in control of my life. I want to make my choices. I want to experience love, and pain. I want to enjoy life. And if I can quit cigarettes, I think I'll have the willpower to do anything. The toughest part is going to be these next three days. It'll be tough. But I want to not have a single one.

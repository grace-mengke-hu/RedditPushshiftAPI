Finally quitting as of now, 8 years in the making

After 8 years of 2 packs a day and smaller amounts before that, I'm done. Just moved to a new apartment today and tommorow will start a month of sobriety to aid in the quitting of smoking (drinking while quitting smokes is hard). Going to sleep now and will wake up a non-smoker. Wish me luck!

quitting vaping

Used to Smoked Newport Menthols for 6 years then quit cigs and I've been vaping for 3 years. Recently decided to quit vaping because it was getting hard to breathe. I use to chain vape quite a lot. Started at 18mg to 12 to 6, now I've been vaping 3mg for a little over a year.



I read somewhere online that it takes 2 weeks for the cravings of nicotine to stop. I'm now 3 weeks in (22 days) and the cravings are still there.  Chewing gum helps a lot!!! I'm wondering how long before I stop getting cravings without having to chew gum till my jaws are strained?

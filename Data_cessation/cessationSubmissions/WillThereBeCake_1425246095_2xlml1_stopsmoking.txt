New round of attacks

The opening salvo was the ruffest, toughest, head-to-head, take no prisoners, accept no defeat, battle of this war. Later the enemy used guerrilla warfare, striking unexpectedly, then retreating as quickly as it came. Then came a lull. The battlefield became relatively quiet. The rare attack was from a dying opponent, while the field itself began to recover.

Several weeks later, and out of the blue came sudden, harsh frontal assaults; so unexpected and viscous that they briefly affected morale, murmurs of surrender were whispered within the camp. 

The stronger members shouted "No, Fight On, we have all but won, Stand True!". If the onslaughts lasted longer than they did even those battle weary champions might not retain the power to resist. But so far they quiet the rest, again maintaining the combined strength to win ... one.more.day.

The ~~battle~~ ~~continues~~ war rages on . . .

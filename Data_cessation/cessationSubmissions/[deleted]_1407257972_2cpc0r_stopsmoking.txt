I want to smoke..but I don't want a cigarette

Is that weird? I mean, I have survived all my usual triggers as of now.
1. Waking up.
2. Coffee.
3. After a work out.
4. After an awesome meal.
5. Getting pissed off at a video game.
6. Work.

Cigarettes are also easy for me to get, my brother/mother/sister all smoke so all I would need is to bum one. And while I have these HUGE cravings, it's not for an actual cigarette but just to smoke..I don't get it.

Day 6 and this sucks!

I quit on a whim somewhat.  I smoked three packs in one evening, and could barely smoke the next day and decided to give my lungs a break.  That first day was pretty easy, I only smoked twice and both I had to force down.  The next day I decided to see if I could keep up, and have been staying strong since!  
I've never experienced something that feels simultaneously awesome and horrible.  My body feels better, I can already smell better, but jesus do I want to smoke 24/7.  I still think smoking rules.  I'm going to miss it, but I know I can't ever let myself fall into that habit again.  It's a money pit.  

This is my first real attempt at quitting.  I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to do it, but I think I can.  I have one question though (and I already know the answer).  IF I cave and just smoke one- would that "reset" or elongate my withdrawal?

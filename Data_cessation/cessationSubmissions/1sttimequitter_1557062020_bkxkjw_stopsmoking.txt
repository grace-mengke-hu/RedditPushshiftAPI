Quit again

I quit for 2 weeks using vaping, it was hard but I was getting by and the vaping was helping. Then, I started a new job and ended up having 1 when I got home the first day, which turned into 3 the next morning and about 1-2/day until Friday, Saturday I binged and had 6. Today I started off with 3 with my coffee. I am disgusted and ashamed of myself. I've been reading through this sub and my quit smoking app, I've made a list of reasons to not smoke and I quit again as of half hour ago.

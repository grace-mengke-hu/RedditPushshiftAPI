Has exercise helped you to not smoke?

I'm trying again tomorrow. I'm smoking my last cigarette right this moment. My biggest issue has always been that I don't like to be angry or show anger, and not smoking has always made me.... Not me. 

Because of smoking mainly, I haven't worked out like I know I should. Because I'm not exercising, I'm smoking. I used to have an eating disorder and working out kept me from eating, so I'm hoping putting my mind towards eating healthy and working out will help like it did in the past. It may possibly help with the anger as well?  

Has anyone any tips about working through the anger? I seriously hate that feeling and hate showing it moreso. If I can both accept that it's just a temporary symtom of quitting and have coping skills to calm me, then I know I can do it. I could use some tips because I can't go back to smoking. I don't want to.

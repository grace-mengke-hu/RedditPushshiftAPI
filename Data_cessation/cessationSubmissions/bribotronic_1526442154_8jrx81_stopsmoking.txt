Freedom

I’ve had a horrible cold all weekend. The tightness in my chest and my swollen throat feels exactly like waking up after a night of chain smoking. I’m so grateful that I’m not smoking on top of it! That was always the worst part of being sick as a smoker- the compulsion to smoke even when you know it’ll make you feel 1000x worse. 
What’s a freedom or convenience you’ve gained from quitting?

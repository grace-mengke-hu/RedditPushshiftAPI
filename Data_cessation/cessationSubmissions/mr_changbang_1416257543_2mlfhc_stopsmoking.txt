I failed in three days. Super stressed out! Emotional venting in post.

So I felt pretty good the last few days, I was super psyched to have thrown away what I supposed was my last pack of cigarettes. Since then I've been working on writing an essay for school and I found myself really distracted and not concentrated. So I went down to Tesco, and without even thinking spent ten quid on a pack of Marlboros. After a few cigarettes I managed to get the first paragraph of my essay done with no problem, and then I stopped and stared at the pack I have just bought.

What have I just done????!!! The money I spent on the cigarettes was supposed to be my dinner. Now I'm hungry, I reek of smoke, and instead of relieving stress I've just added the extra emotional stress from my failure to quit. I literally broke down and cursed myself for feeding the little monster again and again...

So what have I learnt in the last 30 minutes? Cigarettes don't help with stress... they add to it!! If I was a nonsmoker, I wouldn't have spent the money, I would have finished the essay ages ago without procrastinating on whyquit.com and re-reading Allen Carr's book... I wouldn't have had to deal with this shitty situation I'm in now! I literally want to curl up and cry because not only am I behind in work, I have to go through the first few days of quitting again...

Seriously, fuck these cancer sticks. I'm angry and sick at myself for throwing the past few days down the drain, and now I'm feeling worse than ever. This week is going to be a long one for sure.

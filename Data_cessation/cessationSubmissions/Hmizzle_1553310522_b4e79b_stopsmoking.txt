0 nicotine vapes

I’m on day 2 of quitting with no nicotine supplements after 11 years of smoking, and I grabbed a nicotine free vape just for the muscle memory. For some reason it’s helping with the withdrawals though even though I KNOW without a shadow of a doubt there’s zero nicotine in it. Has anyone else had this happen?!

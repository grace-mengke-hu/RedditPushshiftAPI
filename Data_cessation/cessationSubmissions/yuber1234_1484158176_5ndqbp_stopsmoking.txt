Day 3. Question about exercise

I'm on day 3 of quitting. I've been having so much chest pain and shortness of breath that I've been calling in sick at work. I'm having a painful cough and a lot of phlegm is coming up. I've read that this is a result of your lungs clearing out all the crap in your lungs or something.

Does anyone know if exercise would make the chest pain/short breath better or worse? I'd like to get better asap because I don't get paid sick days, and I have a date this Saturday.

Thanks everyone, and stay strong

Cold turkey takes a couple tries to get the hang of.

This is for both smoking and nrt. The first try you feel horrible because you perceive the world differently in withdrawal. This led me to relapse. After a couple more tries you get used to the new perception of a nicotine free brain. For me it stuck about the fifth time.

Resilience in Times of Stress

Once you're quit for a while, staying quit gets easier. It's those times of true stress that really test your mettle.

I was a pack a day smoker for about seven years. My wife and I quit together in October of 2013 and it was very hard for both of us, but we made it. She told me in February of 2014 that she had started smoking again, and regretted it.

I stayed quit.

I have often tried to think of the most stressful situation possible and how that would affect me and my staying quit. Death in the family, divorce, injury, bankruptcy - I tried to role play them all in my mind to see if I would want to smoke again.

This past week I found out, unexpectedly, that we will be getting a divorce. And I'm proud to say that I stayed quit. I'm hurt, and I'm angry, and I'm sad but staying quit is one of the few things that no one can take from me and that becomes a bigger accomplishment every day.

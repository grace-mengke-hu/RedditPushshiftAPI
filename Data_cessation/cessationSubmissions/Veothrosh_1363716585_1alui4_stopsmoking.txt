34 hours of no smoking after 3 years of a pack a day.

God i really want a cig right now.

Edit: Man, for the longest time i thought, "Man, how do people get addicted to this? i could totally quit anytime with **no problems**. I feel like an idiot for thinking that. It wasn't until i was un-employeed and looking for change in the couch cushions for money so i could buy cigs that i realized "Man... it actually happened, i'm addicted".

Trying again

After a hugely successful 2 months of not smoking, I broke down and bought a pack. Since then, my sinuses have become ravaged again, breathing is harder and I'm having to constantly worry about the stale cig stench at work. I'm ready to give this another shot.

Last time I was doing the patch, but this time I'm going cold turkey [although I have a pack of the gum at work in case things get really dire]. Any words of wisdom/thoughts on relapse would be hugely appreciated!

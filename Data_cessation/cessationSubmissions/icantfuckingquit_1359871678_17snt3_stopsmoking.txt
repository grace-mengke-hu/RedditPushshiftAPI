I cannot kick the habit. I'm really fucking frustrated, and disgusted with myself.

What the fuck is my deal? I've "quit" like twenty times in the last eight months. I've never made it longer than 24 hours.

And you know, even when I do make it like half a day, I don't even bother lying to myself, as in, "I can just smoke one, it'll be fine." I *know* I'll go right back to a pack a day, and I'm well aware I'll just keep going on feeling like shit, having no little or no sense of smell, not being able to breathe, etc. And I do it the fuck anyway!

It's almost like I'm *afraid* to quit, but that's not even all of it. I'm just fucking *weak*. And that's disgusting, to me. In every other respect, I'm a go-getter, all about above-and-beyond and all that. It's just this one thing that I can't do. Goddamnit.

Just whining here, I guess.

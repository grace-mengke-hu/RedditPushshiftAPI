Relapsed After 3 days

I don't care. After bumming a cigarette from someone on the street, I immediately ordered an e-cig. I don't care about curbing my addiction to nicotine anymore. I just don't want to smoke cigarettes and give big tobacco 5-10 dollars every day. If I'm addicted to cheap, (mostly) healthy vapor, so be it.

(Also, I know that most of the liquid is sold by big tobacco anyway, but whatever--this is good enough for me anyway)

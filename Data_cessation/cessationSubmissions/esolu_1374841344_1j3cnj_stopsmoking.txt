Played Golf yesterday

It was a big test.  I would easily smoke a pack during around before.  I had a few cravings but made it through ok.  Around the 15th hole I was frustrated that I wasn't playing well.  I verbalized to my partner that I was playing crappy because I wasn't smoking (half joking).

16th hole, I hit a mother f@#$in hole in one,  17th hole birdie, 18th hole par.

A HOLE IN ONE!!!!  That's the universe/god/higher power/whatever you believe in telling me stay the fuck away from nicotine!

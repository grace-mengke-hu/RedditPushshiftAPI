Thanks to all of you. Just checking in at 4 months!

I haven't been thinking about smoking often.  The other day I was out drinking and tempted but the feeling passed very soon.  I have the occasional weekend dream of of having a cigarette.  Don't think about them at work or driving at all!  I like that I can come here and read how everyone else is doing and keep track of my days. It is a huge help and I would like to say thank you to everyone who participates in this sub and you guys and gals are all awesome. Keep it up!

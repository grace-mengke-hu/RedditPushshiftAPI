After being snowed in for 2 days.

I am going out today with my daughter for her 14th birthday. Going out for sushi and to get her a double piercing (snake bites). My brain keeps trying to tell me, it's ok, you could buy a pack and have a cig or two and be just fine... ha! This is about the time in my other quits where I would get over confident and go buy a pack with the intention of only smoking a few here and there and be a casual smoker. I know better. I know for me there is no such thing as a casual smoker. I will be strong today. I will enjoy the time out with my daughter and really taste the sushi with a clean palate. I will enjoy her excitement of getting her first piercing. I will not smoke.


But... this 43 year old mama might just get a septum piercing, because, since I am no longer smoking, I can afford the splurge.

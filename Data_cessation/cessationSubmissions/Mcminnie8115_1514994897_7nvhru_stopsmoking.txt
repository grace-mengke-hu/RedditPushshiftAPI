Staying strong, even with Temptation

So I decided to put the cigarettes down once and for all on New Years, however leading up to it I smoked like a chimney. While I was smoking like a chimney, maybe two days before the new year, I lost my pack. It was still half full so I just screw it a bought a new one.

Fast forward to this morning. Headache raging, cravings high, and dreams cigarette filled I walk towards my car ready for work and there buried in the snow was the half pack of smokes I lost. I tried to make every excuse to have just one. Then, I snapped them all and proceed to go to work.

Keep strong everyone! Remember, only you can break the chains cigarettes have on you!

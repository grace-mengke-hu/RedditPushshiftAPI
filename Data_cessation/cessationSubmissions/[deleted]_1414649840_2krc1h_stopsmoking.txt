From Cigarettes to Cacao

I think as an introspective person it is incredibly easy to go into my mind and manipulate myself into thinking I need a smoke. However, other people may avoid facing the toxicity inside them, instead letting it fester while seeking external stimulation. I suppose what I am trying to do is be positive in saying that being an introvert should mean that I can go into my mind and find a solution.

Today after work I sat in my room taking big deep breaths, and on each inhalation the frustration flared up like a raging fire. I've been exercising a lot in the last few days to distract myself from the addictive thoughts that keep clawing their way back into my head. Today I was too tired for that approach, by the time I left work at midday I had stingy eyes, a headache and dizzying nausea.

Don't worry, I didn't give in! Day 6 will still turn into Day 7!

I simply left the house and walked for half an hour listening to Pearl Jam, then ended up with some insane sugar-cravings, which I hear is yet another lovely side effect of quitting. I didn't fall into a full downward junkfood spiral, I actually grabbed some organic Choc Cacao balls with almond butter and pea protein. I also got some Senna Leaf tea which is great for cleansing, and pretty much any tea can restore my happiness.

Cannot wait until next week when the Cilia in my lungs start regrowing and bodily functions such as simply inhaling don't cause me to snarl with anger.

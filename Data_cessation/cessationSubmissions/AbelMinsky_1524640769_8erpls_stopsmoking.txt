Enduring The Grouchy Stage

Hello all.

I'm about to make another go at quitting cigarettes. Over the past few months I've attempted to quit smoking in various ways. Despite still smoking I know I've made progress. I don't believe the physical or behavioral aspect is my biggest hook that keeps me smoking. I've never been addicted to anything except cigarettes. Most things people find addictive have a 'meh' effect on me. I barely notice the physical withdrawal and the behavioral aspect is easily overcome by busying my hands with something. 

I think my addiction is mental in nature. I've been purposely delaying smoking a cigarette or delaying buying a pack for a day or two. When I do this all the mental garbage and junkie thinking tries to get me to smoke a cigarette or go to the store. I've been able to really witness the inner dialogue in my mind and slowly deconstruct the thinking patterns that convince me to smoke. I've dealt with a lot of anxiety, anger, and sadness and the mental inner dialogue related to those emotions. I feel I've overcome most of those emotional triggers.

The last remaining emotional trigger keeping me stuck is the one I hate the most. I hate being grouchy, irritable, or aggravated. I grew up with a brother who constantly aggravated me as a kid and I can't stand the feeling. I've got such a low threshold for being aggravated I've ended relationships and friendships when someone purposely aggravates me because they think it's funny or cute. I can't overstate how much I hate the feeling. By extension I don't like feeling grouchy or irritable either because my typical demeanor is calmness. 

How have others dealt with this stage of quitting smoking? I can always feel it coming on and it's when I cave every time. Need some tips!

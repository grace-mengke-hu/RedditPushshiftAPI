Hypno + $$$ or not?

I successfully quit about four years ago after seeing a hypnotherapist for three weeks. It cost me more than $600.

About two years ago, when I was living abroad, I had some bad times and relapsed on impulse. I haven't quit since.

The hypno has offered me a follow up for $200. I am perilously broke at the moment, but soon to get paid about $1200 for some freelance work. Should I invest it?

Greater than your addiction.

I am a long time lurker on this community (21 year old male, smoking for about five years). For the past few months I've been trying to quit smoking. I must have thrown away twenty packs which were half full, thinking today was gonna be the day that I was gonna quit for good. I smoked my 'last cigarette' a dozen times. But allways the little nicotine monster inside of me lured me back to my addiction, because I believed that that monster was more powerful than me.

But about an hour ago it struck me. I was thinking about the books I read about smoking, about the posts I read everyday on this subreddit, and something came to mind.

That little monster that is trying to pull you back in, it is only doing that because you are killing it. Each minute you're not smoking your letting it slowly die, each cigarette you're saying no to it is becoming smaller and smaller, until the day it completely vanishes. And you are responsible for it.  Only you, because we my friends, we are greater than our addiction! 

Tonight I'm gonna smoke my last cigarette. For real this time.

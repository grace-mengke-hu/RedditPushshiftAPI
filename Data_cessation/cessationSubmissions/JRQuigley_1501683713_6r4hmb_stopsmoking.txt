Smoking dreams..

So I'm just over two years not smoking.. But for some reason the last month or so I've been having dreams about smoking.  


Last night was the most vivid..  I actually dreamt I bought a pack, instead of just finding one, or bumming one.. In my dream I made the conscious decision to buy a pack.  And in my dream I was disappointed in myself even, knew my family was going to be disappointed, but I did it anyway.


I'm still disappointed in myself for this.  Every time I have a smoking dream, it irritates me.


Just needed to vent I guess..

Sorry, losing empathy for new quitters

I feel bad about this but after quitting for a month I'm having difficulty relating to new quitters and their struggles. I suppose that's great for me but that seems selfish.

Early on after quitting, I posted a lot. About my struggles, or giving advice. Both helped me a lot. There it is, good for me. But what about the never ending tide of new quitters?

If I post today it is sometimes snarky. Get over it. Just don't smoke. You're free already dammit! Maybe not too helpful. Should I stop posting? Or post something different, like this one.

It isn't just me. I appreciate the long term winners of the battle who come back once a year or so to assure folks it's possible. But I don't think they really relate either. Yes, folks, I no longer organize my life around my next smoke and its great.

The advice for new quitters is pretty much the same. Someone should write a book ...

Will this post get down voted for not being 110% enthusiastic? Or up voted for proving a happy truth? If you quit resolutely, you can be free of smoking completely very quickly. The very best to all of you.

EDIT. In Allen Carr's lesser known and larger book, The Only Way to Stop Smoking Permanently, he relates how he completely lost touch with smoking addiction. He actually _started smoking again_ so he could remember what it was like for smokers, so he could help them (not recommended). Same thing. If I am not being clear, I am sharing this to highlight another (desirable) step on the non-smoking path.

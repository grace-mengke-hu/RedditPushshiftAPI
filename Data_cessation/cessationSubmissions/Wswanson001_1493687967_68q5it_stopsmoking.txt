So, first day and........well, nobody died.

Today was my quit day and today was the first time I truly realized how much of a habit this is. Wake up, and before I realized it, I'm on the back porch lighting up. I don't even remember making a conscious decision to. Wife gave me an e-cig to help take the edge off. Speaking of which, has anyone really used these things? Do you puff in them like you would a smoke? Or just hit it once?  

Anyways, driving home for lunch, same thing happened. Lit cigarette in my hand and I was about halfway done before I realized it. Threw that out the window, followed by the pack I kept in my truck. 

Tomorrow's a new day. If anything, small victory today. My office and truck are now tobacco free. 

Once more into the breach.....

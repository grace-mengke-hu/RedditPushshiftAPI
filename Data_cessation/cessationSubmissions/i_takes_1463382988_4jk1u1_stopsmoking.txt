Round Two

Awhile back, I would say last Julyish I quit smoking after smoking for 4 years before. I, to my surprise, felt like it wasn't entirely too difficult. I even went cold turkey. I made it past the 3 day mark, the 3 week, and the 3 month. I thought I was officially a non-smoker.

Unfortunately, that did not last. I think it was around the 250 day mark, but some things happened in my personal life. Actually a couple different things simultaneously, not all bad, but just a lot I could not handle. I drank a lot for a couple of weeks and as a result eventually everything caught up with me. I wasn't thinking straight and I did the unthinkable. I bought a pack and started smoking again.

I don't know why I did it. I can't believe I did it. So here I am again. I just got around to resetting my flair.. so sad to see it got up to 305 days while I was gone :(.

I just moved to a new city, so I am excited to start life here as a non-smoker.

Do i need to reset my badge ?

So i have quit smoking for sometime now, this weekend i was rolling up with my friends and smoked some weed, the weed was mixed with tiny( 2-5%) amount of tobacco to burn weed smoothly, i am wondering if i need to reset my badge. I do not intend to stop smoking weed and most of the time its pure except sometimes when we are smoking hash or the weed is not burning properly we mix some tobacco, does it count as smoking ciggarettes and i need to reset my badge when i do that.

PS: Not feeling like relapsing and no craving to smoke whatsoever

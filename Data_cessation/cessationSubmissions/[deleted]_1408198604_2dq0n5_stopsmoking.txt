Well I gave it a shot... Lasted a whole 13-14 hours. Dammit.

I had this vision yesterday.  I had 6 cigs in my pack when I woke up, those would be the last.  I was done.

Ran out about 5:30 last night, ate dinner, got through the craving for that after meal cig.  Went to bed without that last cig of the night.  Got up at 6:25 this morning and made it an hour, one hour, and I was heading to the gas station for a new pack.  I am thinking that I may need some kind of nicotine based aid to give this a serious shot.  I feel weak.

17 years I have been on this train of self destruction.  I have never in my life earned a pay check that I didn't spend on cigarettes.  I have never had sex and not smoked a cigarette after.  I have never drank a beer without smoking a cigarette.  Time to experience these things.

What stop smoking aids do you recommend?  In the past I did half-heartedly try the patch and the gum.  The gum made my gums hurt, I never liked the vivid dreams when trying the patch but wasn't really in the "quitting" mind set when I was attempting that.

15 years later....Day #1

I WAS a smoker for 15 years...solid pack a day. I started taking a variant of Chantix on Monday....I had 13 cigarettes. 10 on Tuesday. 9 on Wednesday and 9 on Thursday. Thursday night (last night) at 8:55pm, I had my last cigarette. I decided that I was just not going to buy another pack. So here I am, after being pointed here by a co-worker. I'm excited for my taste buds, not smelling like shit, saving $$$, and not pausing movies anymore.

You know what would make this day better? A lit cigarette.

I say that to myself as a joke now.  There used to be a time when I'd be on a date or vacation with my now wife and I'd be craving a smoke.  Sure I'd sneak them later but I'd really want one as we were drinking together or say taking a walk somewhere beautiful or on a boat.  Now, I'm disgusted by the smell.  So when things are really at a peak during a great day out I'll tell her "you know what'd be great?  A lit cigarette".  Gross.  

I was a smoker for 18 years.  You can do this!

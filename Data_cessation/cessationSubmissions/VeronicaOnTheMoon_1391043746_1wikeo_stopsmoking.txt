Just realized I made it one month! GO ME!

Seriously, it kind of snuck up on me. And I've even had a few rough minutes in the past few days due to stress but floated through them with my internal "eff off addiction monster!" speech. It feels good to make it to a whole month of no nicotine! Thank you all so much for being here. Just watching the struggles and achievements here have helped enormously!

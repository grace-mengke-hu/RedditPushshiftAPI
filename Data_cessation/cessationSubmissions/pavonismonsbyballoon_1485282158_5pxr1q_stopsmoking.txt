ADHD medication triggers intense nicotine cravings. (x-post from r/ADHD)

Hey there, I'm trying to stop smoking but I also take stimulant medication for ADHD. I often find that my meds trigger intense/amplified cravings for cigarettes. I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with this and knows of any good tips. Thanks!

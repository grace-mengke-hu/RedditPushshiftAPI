Canâ€˜t help but miss it!

I have been struggling lately. I quit exactly 8 months ago and would say that I was fine until recently. I am not sure if it is the summer but I am having cravings again and just feel like I miss my old buddy the cigarettes.
I am coming here because this thread had helped me tremendously in the beginning and I was wondering if someone had similar experiences after such a long time quitting. People usually say it gets easier with time, but I am questioning this statement now.
I really appreciate some help.

Almost 3 years smoke free! Still weekly nightmares about starting smoking again.

(English isn't my first language and I haven't written anything in English in quite a long time. I really hope my sentences are ok to read for you guys!)

It has been almost 3 years since I stopped smoking. Quit cold turkey, no relapse, never avoided smokers. It was hard, but I went through with it. I'm incredible proud of myself because of it! :)

And I feel great! For quite a while now it has been hard for me to grasp that my life was controlled by cigarettes. My cigarette-free life is great, and it was worth every single second of withdrawal. I never ever ever ever want to go back! 

In the past 2 years there have been maybe 2 times I felt the urge to smoke - but it never felt too strong. I only had to wait for it to go away. In some way, it was a weird reminder of my addiction still being there. Like a heads-up! Never stop being cautious!

I still dream of starting smoking again about once a week. These dreams have never stopped. In my dreams I'm always super sad and desperate and disappointed because of that. I never dream HOW or WHY I start again. I'm just smoking and realise "Holy shit I'm smoking again?? How did that happen? NO!!!".

Do you think these nightmares will stop at some point in the future?

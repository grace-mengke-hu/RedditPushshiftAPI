I think it's going to stick this time.

I'd been a cigarette smoker for about 10 years.

I've tried quitting many times, and I think my own personal secret was giving myself the space to keep trying and not feel too guilty about not being ready. Emotionally, it's a big deal, and I had to get to the bottom of my emotional attachment to cigarettes.

So, for a while, I found I was going through a guilt cycle. If I bummed out and had a cigarette, I was a full-blown smoker pretty quickly again, feeling shitty about myself. Other bad habits would follow.

I had a quit smoking hypnosis session with my hypnotherapist, and while it didn't work immediately (I was living with other smokers at the time), it started me on a real journey, with imagining the trajectory of my life with and without cigarettes.

With cigarettes, my health would deteriorate. I saw my relationships failing. I saw myself closed off from other people. I saw myself and my smoker friends depressed and alone!

Well, this week I traveled to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where it was mighty cold... And I was the only smoker.

It's funny how doing something alone in the cold can be a huge motivator to quit a bad habit.

Anyway, instead of buying a pack of smokes this time when I was at the gas station, I got some disposable e-cigs to help my transition.

This was 4 days ago, and I'm hardly even hitting the e-cigs at this point! Today, I started coughing up a lot of tar, and I'm noticing delightful subtlety to smells I haven't experienced in years.

I'm feeling really good about it this time, because I'm moving TOWARDS a life I want, rather than running away from a life I don't. I'm moving towards connection and health and vitality, rather than running away from things I'm afraid of.

I hope this encourages anyone who reads it!

I'm over two months without inhaling anything now...

I gotta say, the coughing stopped, but now I feel like there's a weight in my chest that still needs to go away. Also, I feel like at any moment I could get sick. Like, my immune system isn't all there if that makes any sense.

Has anyone else felt this blehnes after quitting for a month or two?

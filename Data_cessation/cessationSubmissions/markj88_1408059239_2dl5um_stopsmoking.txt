I can make it this time!

I have been a smoker for nearly eight years. I tried to quit it for several times but failed. Although I know all the harm smoking does to my health, I still found it difficult to quit. However, I believe I can make it this time as I am going to marry and I dont want smoking ruin it. Hope all goes smooth. I can make it this time!

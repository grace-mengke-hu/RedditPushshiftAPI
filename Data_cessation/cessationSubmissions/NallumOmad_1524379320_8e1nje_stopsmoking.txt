Here we go. Yet again.

So, day one. Again. I've had a pretty consistent pattern build up that I am very keen to break. I usually quit, make it 3-4 weeks (sometimes longer) and end up back on them due to drinking. My drinking is another story, it was usually only once a week, but is now always a binge (10+ beers in a sitting) and can end up being multiple days. Drinking= smoking. This is the allowance you make for yourself. This becomes normal. This is also completely ridiculous. I feel like shit so much now. Physically and mentally. I am stopping this also. 9 times out of 10, this is why I smoke again. If I wake up and have tobacco or cigarettes left, the old "I'll just finish these" creeps in. 

I'm sick of the initial 1-3 day itch that I get. I'm really snappy with my wife and my anxiety levels go through the roof. I constantly have to remind myself that this will pass and that all irrational thoughts will eventually settle down. I can't concentrate on much and am generally getting pisssd off at the most menial of things.

I really hope that this is the time I will do it. I think that if I can steer clear of the booze, that I definitely can. I hope at least that my habits may resonate with someone else and they can find the strength to quit and stay quit. Let's do this!

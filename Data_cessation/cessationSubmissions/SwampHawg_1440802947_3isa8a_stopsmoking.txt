24 Day Check-in. Still pitching a shutout.

Wow, what a ride.  

For some reason, quitting smoking for me over the past month has been one of those times when life burned a little brighter.  To be honest, it's been one of the best months I've had in a long time.  Started jogging and even hurt my foot, and now I have a Sports-related injury!!!  How awesome is that!   Back in the game.

Cheers to everyone, wherever you are.

Do you feel disgusted to the smell?

I stopped day 26 of aug, this year, about a mouth after, i cant stand the smell anymore.. My mom still smokes and when she does and comes to talk to me i just cant stand being in front of her... I feel like i want to throw up. Is this normal? I feel bad because i cant stand next to my friends who smoke anymore... If this is normal, how you guys deal with close friends and family who still smoke?

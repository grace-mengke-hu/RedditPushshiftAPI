Quitting in a smoking friendly environment

I'm 26 and been smoking since I was 20. I've gone through periods of one or two packs a day to just a few. Quit for a few months here and there but always relapsed.

I'm currently smoking about 6 cigarettes a day if I'm working or about 12 if I have a day off. A night out drinking is definitely a pack. 

I had my last cigarette on the 22nd of December when I left to visit my parents for the holidays. No one in my family smokes so I don't do it around them or in their house. It hasn't been too bad, a few cravings but having so many family members around, good food, relaxing environment - has been manageable, even when knocking back a few beers.

The issue is in a few days I'm going back to my apartment which I share with two smokers. We don't smoke inside but we have a balcony where we do it. I just know that going back to that environment will make it so much harder. Those guys are great but that's how we interact usually - on the balcony, a few beers, talking and smoking. I'm afraid it will be so easy to go back to old habits, especially after coming home from a hard or stressful day at work.

I don't want to begin to avoid my flatmates or stop hanging out with them but I know the temptation will be ridiculous. I've relapsed many times before but feel a lot more serious about it now.

Any tips from people who have been through this situation? Any help or advice would be appreciated!

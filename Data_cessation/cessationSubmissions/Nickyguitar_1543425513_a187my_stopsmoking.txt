Can I get through it

I am on day 17 after relapsing around 1 month in after a trip to the pub. A friend of mine wants to meet for a quick catch up after sport this evening. He has also given up smoking but seems to not have a problem with cravings in conjunction with alcohol. I really want to meet and I guess also test myself but am a bit worried it may be difficult.

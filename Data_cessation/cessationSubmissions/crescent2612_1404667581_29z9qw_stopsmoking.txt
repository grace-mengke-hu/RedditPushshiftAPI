Quit smoking all together two weeks ago still having trouble with one thing.

Hey Reddit,
I smoked for 3 years and was on the ecig for about 5 months. I finally quit everything a little over two weeks ago. The hardest part for me is finding ways to be social now. My main group of friends consists of 5 people of which 4 are smokers.  The real kicker is the fact that although I genuinely love them as friends we dont really do much when we hang out. It mostly just consists of everyone except me getting high and playing video games. I'm cool with this for short durations but video games dont do much for me when they are played for 6-8 hours every single day the group is together. I tend to feel pretty crappy during some of these times because we all know boredom is the number one obstacle when you decide to quit smoking. Basically I need to meet new people but I feel so stuck in my group and between a non-social job and no car I'm not sure how to break out.  Has anyone else had this issue when they went to quit smoking?

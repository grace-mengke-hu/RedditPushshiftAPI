Looking for some advice

Gday, I’m looking for some help.
For the last 4 years I’ve smoked, early on it wasn’t that much but for the past 2-3 years I’d classify it as full time. Everything that i do i associate with smoking.. such as first thing in the morning, when i drink coffee and alcohol, when i finish a task at work, after meals and the last thing before bed. 

I don’t need help with the actual quitting part as I’ve tried numerous times and lasted a few months each time but i don’t know how to deal with the triggers I’ve mentioned above. Do i stop drinking coffee and alcohol altogether? Do i stop waking up and going to sleep? Do i stop finishing tasks at work? Do i stop seeing all my smoking friends? 

Any advice would be appreciated! Cheers :)

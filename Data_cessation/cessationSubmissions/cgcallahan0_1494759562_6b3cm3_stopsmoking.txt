Had a cigar

So I'm about 12.5 days through and went to a big festival yesterday. Literally, everyone around me was smoking and instead of having a cigarette I began to smoke a cigar I was saving for the beach. Cigar actually sucked and couldn't make it halfway through it. My question is, did I relapse?

Cutting back to quit

So I have wanted to quit smoking for sometime now. I have been smoking since I was 15 at almost two packs a day. I have cut back to about 19 smokes. I want to get down to a point where I can use my vape because currently it hurts me and makes me cough. The biggest problem is I have ended up with a right chesty cough as it is. The whole of the right side of my chest really hurts and it feels as though there is something stuck in my throat. 

Should I see a doctor for this or will it go away in a few days. I choose to cut down before taking the plunge because my nicotine intake is so high I predict little chance of success. Anyone have any ideas?

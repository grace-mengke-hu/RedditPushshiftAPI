Relapse so sad

After nearly 3 months I got drunk, got in a fight with my fiancé and smoked half a cig. Heart racing trying to go to sleep on the couch. What a mess. I’m so sad and mad at myself about the fight but even more about the cig. It didn’t even taste good, I was preoccupied and didn’t even enjoy it. Ugh. It didn’t make me feel better. Now what? Start over? I have to reset my days? This fucking sucks

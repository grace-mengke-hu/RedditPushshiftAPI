Confronted my dad about quitting smoking finally

I've been thinking about taking to my dad about quitting smoking for a long time, and I finally did tonight. I gave him Alan Carr's *Easyway to Stop Smoking* and I made him promise that he would read it. I want him to quit so bad. Crossing my fingers.

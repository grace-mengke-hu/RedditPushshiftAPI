Week 3 - Day 15

The last cigarette I had was November 30th 2014. Until now I've been dealing with insomnia, mood swings, anxiety (yes, I've been eating my feelings and my nicotine addiction). Now I'm starting my third week and I've been dealing with a new found cough, I know it's because my body is healing and my cilia is starting to work again but it sucks. I'm very firm with my decision to stop smoking, before I made the decision I was waking up in the middle of the night thinking that I made a stupid choice the first day I started smoking and that I was getting lung cancer (as well as all the varieties of cancer caused by smoking) just as a consequence of poor judgement. This fear of dying in such a torturing and scary way made me want to quit smoking even more. If someone is reading this and wants some support, I'm here struggling every day and trying to be smoke free every minute. It sucks I really enjoyed smoking but i love myself much more than this stupid addiction. I encourage YOU to make the decision, choose the date and start trying eventually you will be too an ex smoker. good luck.

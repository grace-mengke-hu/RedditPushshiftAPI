When I stopped smoking I wanted to help change the world of smokers

but I didn't want to do it in an extreme way. My goal was to get 1 person to quit. 1 at a time. Just talk someone through it. if they mentioned they want to stop I jumped all over the chance to help them.

I hate the fact our governments make insane amounts of money off of our health. I crave for a day when the government relies on us, not the other way around. The first step is to take control of our own lives & stop smoking.

I challenge you all reading this to do the same. Help 1 person along the way become a non smoker. If you're reading this and you are a smoker, now is the time to stop.

I'm going to stop today need some support. What to do with the mood?

Hi guys/gals anyhow this is my last smoke. been smoking on/off for 15y. Last time I tried to quit I was really irritated and couldn't concentrate.

 I'm already proactively trying to exercise more not to gain weight. How to get discreet support? 

Even thinking on quitting makes me anxious :) but i will do it. 

Thank you

Day 1, Round 3 :-/

I've tried quitting 3 times since I really started smoking habitually. The most successful time I've quit before this was last year at the same time. Not sure what it is about this time of year that makes me want to stop but whatever...

Since May, I've been smoking like a chimney. Probably a pack a day. That's the most I had ever smoked in my 3 years of doing so. Before that relapse, I was a pack every 3-4 days but I hit a stressful road block back in May and started again.

My anxiety really gets the best of me and that's when I let my addiction flourish. I quit for a short period of time back in August but my best friend ended up in the hospital with some critical problems and I started right back up as a worrying soother. 

I'm a chronic worrier but I can't let every stressful situation throw me back into the world of smoking. I just can't. It needs to stick this time. My parents are going through a divorce and my mom isn't treating my dad very well. He told me the other night that I'm all he's got. I have to stop smoking for my dad. He can't lose me, too. 

Here's the round 3.

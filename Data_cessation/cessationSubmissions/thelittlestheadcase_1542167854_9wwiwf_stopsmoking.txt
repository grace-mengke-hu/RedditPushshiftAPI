Quitting again. 5th times the charm?

I've been a smoker for 11 years. I've "tried" to quit 4 times and have never made it more than the 3 day mark everyone keeps telling me about. I'm on hour 7 at the moment, which isn't a lot, but something feels slightly different this time. I really really want this. I constantly worry about my health and I'm hoping this time will be the final time. Just found this sub, and feel like I'll be spending a lot of time here over the next couple of weeks.

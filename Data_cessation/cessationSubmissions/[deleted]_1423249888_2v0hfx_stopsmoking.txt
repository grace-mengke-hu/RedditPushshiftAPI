Pain & Suffering

Today I am 101 days free of smoking. I believe it has been an easy experience for me due to the fact that my grandma, grandpa, and father all passed away in 2014 from cancer. My father was the only one out of the three to smoke for the majority of his life. When they removed the brain tumor at New York Presbyterian they told us it was cancerous and that the cancer must of traveled from somewhere else in his body (lung). This means the cancer is stage 4 and generally a death sentence in most cases. After the Doctor gave my mother and I a hug I went to see my father. Laying in the hospital bed with his head wrapped in bandages he was coherent enough to ask what the results of the operation were. The most difficult thing I have ever had to do in my life was in that moment. Telling my father he has cancer. His facial expression was that of pure pain. I imagine in that moment he regretted every single cigarette he had ever smoked. 


From there he received treatments and things were even looking up at one point. Unfortunately the cancer spread to his brain again leading to his demise. It wasn't quick though. The restlessness of his body slowly dieing went on for a while. Years of smoking leading to pain and suffering on a physical and emotional level knowing your time is limited is a personal hell I hope to never know. I wish all those who are trying to quit could have witnessed what I saw unfold during that time. It was by far the most effective/dark quitting method one could ask for.

Closing in on one year and struggling

I'm very close to a year of non-smoking at this point (my last cigarette was January 3rd) and I'm struggling to stay on track. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first quit I started going to the gym on the regular and was feeling great physically, but then I moved and there aren't any convenient gyms near my new apartment and I've started gaining a bit of weight. Nothing crazy, but I'm 5'7" and around 167 which is more than I've ever weighed before.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also been struggling with anxiety. I smoked from the age of 16 to 33 or so, off and on, and I feel like maybe I underestimated the amount that smoking helped regulate my anxiety. I knew that there would be an increase after I quit, but I assumed that after 11 months nicotine free it would have disappointed by now. Instead I'm just drinking more and more alcohol to compensate.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't touched a single cigarette since I quit. Even when I'm out at the bar or the clubs and I've been drinking and I really want it.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some bright sides. I've been getting sick a lot less and my respiratory health is clearly better, but I can't help but think that maybe smoking would be a great way to manage my weight and keep my anxiety in check again.

Please help me stay on track. I could really use some common sense and encouragement to avoid picking up the cigarettes again.

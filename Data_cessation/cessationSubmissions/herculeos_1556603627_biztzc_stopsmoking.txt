Day 9! Let's talk about rewards

There are few things as bad for you as smoking, so you can use almost any other pleasurable thing as a reward. That said, there are some things that I'd rather not do, because I do not want to develop new bad habits.

**Good ideas for rewards**

* Taking some time off from work
* Going on walks
* Exercise
* Healthy snacks
* Coffee
* Buying some books

Many of these good things above are on the list because they help me deal with stress, which I once did by smoking, which was very ineffective on the long term, but I felt I needed a crutch. Now, I no longer want a crutch, I just want to live a balanced lifestyle, I want to have healthy ways to unwind and relax.

I have already received a ton of rewards, they come directly from quitting: I can live without the shame and stress of being an addict, without having to worry about nasty self-inflicted diseases, without wasting lots of money and then burning it, without destroying my fitness, without smelling bad...

The largest reward I am going to give myself is the chance to build a very positive life, and I am definitely going to do that. I will be patient with myself, not demanding unrealistic changes, but by building good habits one by one. I never give up on myself and always strive to go forwards, even if I sometimes struggle. I will build the life that I want to live, not to please anyone, but in line with my own values and needs.

*That was day 9. I had a few cravings (3-4), but managed to get through them without too much trouble. My last craving was days ago, so having a few was surprising. So, it's good that I do this writing, keeps me motivated. I hope you found it interesting.*

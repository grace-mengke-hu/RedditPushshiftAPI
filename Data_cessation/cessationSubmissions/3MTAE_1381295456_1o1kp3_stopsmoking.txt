Burnin' one didn't cross my mind today

We all know that we experience things on a unique schedule but I wanted to share a few of my milestones with my fellow quitters.

Day 1-5: I knew it was going to be tough so I was mentally prepared for a struggle.  Calm, focused, energized

Day 7-10: I was not prepared for how much these days still sucked. Irritable, annoyed

Day 21: Felt like quite an achievement, fewer compulsions.  Lazy and irritable

Day 35: Cravings pass quickly and occur rarely (3 per day?)  I feel pretty good.

Day 41: Burnin' one didn't cross my mind today. I will stay vigilant.

Other thoughts: I had been hooked on a very addictive drug for 17 years.  This addiction shortened my only life.  The symptoms of withdrawal needed to be felt, acknowledged and suffered.  I needed to change some behaviors or habits that triggered cravings.  I bought a gym membership and I found that sore muscles help me change habits in a hurry.  A pack of Camel Menthols per day for 41 days at $6.00 per pack is $246 saved so far (5 months of gym membership)

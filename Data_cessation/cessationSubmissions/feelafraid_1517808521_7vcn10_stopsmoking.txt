Every night is a battle

And every morning is a success. 

Every night, especially the party atmosphere tonight for super bowl was a difficult trigger. After smoking for 12+ yrs and developing asthma as a 25 yr old f it hurt to lay flat at night. It always felt like somebody was reaching into my chest and squeezing my lungs til I couldnâ€™t bare it anymore and sat up til it relieved itself. 

Now my main motivation is to remember the pain thatâ€™s often absent since Iâ€™ve quit. I feel alright now most days but every once and a while I sleep too long and on one side to where it still hurts and my lungs feel tight. Thatâ€™s after 12+hrs tho and not a hardly 5 like it would have been before. 

Last night was hard because I was drinking and there was a super bowl party and I was arguing with my partner a bit (and he still smokes) but I made it through and I definitely know that when I wake up in the morning Iâ€™ll be proud of myself for staying strong, Iâ€™m praying to make it to six months - 1 yr to just let myself know itâ€™s possible no matter the circumstances, and to avoid the asthma pains at night and in the morning. Iâ€™ve made it this far before but always fail around the 2 month mark because I feel better and think I can handle smoking again. 

Hereâ€™s to keeping strong this time ðŸ˜Ž

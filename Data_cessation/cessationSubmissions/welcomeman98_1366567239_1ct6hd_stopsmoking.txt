Changes since I quit. (Week 3)

It's been about 3 weeks since I quit smoking. Decided to quit when I noticed I couldn't inhale fully and clothes smelled like ass. Well what I've noticed so far is that food doesn't taste bland and my face looks healthier (from what my mom tells me). I remember eating one of those baby carrots and they taste awesome! 

So far tea and a ton of celery is helping me curb the cravings. Just so you guys know this subreddit inspired me to quit so thank you.

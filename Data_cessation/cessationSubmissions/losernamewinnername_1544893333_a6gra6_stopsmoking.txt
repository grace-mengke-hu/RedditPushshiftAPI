When did energy come back for you?

Day 17 no cigs, and 28 without weed. 

Weed wasn't the problem to leave, but without cigs I feel like shit. I feel a bit mental and anxious without them. This is not me. This sucks so much... Ffs -.-

I just want to be able to play basketball without feeling like shit in the first minutes but I also want to go out without feeling anxious as fuck. This is fucking annoying already. My sinuses are clogged, my energy and motivation are low as fuck. Don't even have motivation for taking a stupid walk atm.

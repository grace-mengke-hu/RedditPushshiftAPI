I made it through the weekend!

I have had it in my mind for months that I wanted to quit. I have tried and failed MANY times in the past. For about the past 2-3 months I have been consistently trying to quit. The week would go fine, and then the weekend would happen. BUT THIS WEEKEND WAS DIFFERENT. I still went about my business, spend time with my smoker boyfriend, and friends who smoke and didn't even consider having one. I use the patch, which definitely is helping me not be irritable over it. I am so proud to have gotten through a weekend, because now I know that next weekend will be a piece of cake. As long as I can stay positive and remind myself in weak moments that this is the most important decision I will probably ever make, I will hopefully be able to stick to it this time :)

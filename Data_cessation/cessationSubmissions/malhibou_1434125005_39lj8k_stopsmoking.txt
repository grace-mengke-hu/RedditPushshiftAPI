My brain is a brat (but I'm Supernanny...)

I just experienced such a fast cycle of my brain's arsenal of weapons that my head is spinning--but now that it's over it is completely hilarious. Felt like a great example of an extinction burst (thanks to whoever linked to that "You are not so smart" article about Skinner--fascinating!) because I watched my brain pull out all the tactics that usually work.

I woke up earlier than usual, so my brain said "we've got 10 extra minutes, and it's all nice and misty outside. Let's go smoke!" Told my brain to shut up, went and took a shower instead. Not even twenty minutes later, my brain says "You know, this whole quitting smoking thing is pretty easy. You don't even really want a cigarette any more. That means you could have one on special occasions and not get addicted. Maybe 4th of July! Maybe summer solstice! Doesn't somebody have a birthday this weekend or something?" Told my brain to shut up, went and ate some orange slices.

Got to work, some minor problems arose and I burst into tears. My boss (who was constantly requesting I quit but who now makes jokes about how I've "gone psychotic" and will start "eating chairs" whenever I get cranky) said "do you think this is just a nicotine withdrawal?" And right at that moment, my brain said "NO IT'S TOTALLY UNRELATED BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION NICOTINE LET'S GO GET SOME I BET SOMEBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES HAS SOME OR WHAT ABOUT ANTHONY IN THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE..."

So I told my that it probably was nicotine withdrawals, but that that didn't make it any less real. Cleaned myself up, went and bought a coffee (and a donut, fuck it). Feeling better, but also just reeling from the fact that my brain would try so many different tactics within an HOUR. But I got through it, which is worth smearing some mascara for.

**TL;DR My brain is behaving like a kid who wants Totino's Pizza Rolls, I'm having to lay down the law.**

2 weeks ago I quit smoking for the second time. Going great so far!

I've tried to quit smoking before and relapsed without noticing. It was the casual single cigarrette a day.

Then I would say 'one more won't hurt' during my afternoon coffee. Then one at night when I left from work. 

Pretty soon I was smoking 5 cigs a day.

Since I tried to quit before and let everybody know, this time I just kept it to myself and quit cold turkey. I'm no longer getting headaches, fucks sake, these things were causing my headaches. I'm feel much better overall.

Smoking addiction can really sneak up on ya. I'll never smoke again.

I got weak.

Went to Vegas last weekend and... yeah...... but that is why I am debating if I should perhaps wait until the new year and just limit my cigarette intake until then. There are still 2 major social functions I will attend before the new year, and then I have nothing scheduled. I feel like my mind isn't just there to quit even though I know I should. 

dammit i was 6 days in, but i knew i was walking into a huge trap. thought if i could avoid stogs  in vegas, i could avoid cigarettes everywhere... well back to day one and to that same shitty depressed, groggy feeling.

Needed a bad smoking memory

I was smoke free for a week and then met a friend I hadn't seen in a while tonight. We had a couple cigs together for nostalgia sake and this evening right after I felt really terrible and had a really upset stomach and just felt gross and unwell. As stupid as it sounds, I feel that this is exactly what I needed to truly never want to touch one again. I think I didn't 100% seriously want to quit before that. More like 80% which led me to being ok with lighting up that nostalgia cigarette. Now I feel like I can truly let go and just say no when the feeling or occasion arises again. Now I am just looking forward to have the poison out of my system and feel awesome again. I feel bad for failing today but I feel good about what I learned if that makes any sense.

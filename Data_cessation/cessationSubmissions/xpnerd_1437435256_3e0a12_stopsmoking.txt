1010 Days! Woohoo

It's been a little while since I've checked in and I noticed I'm at 1010 days.  If you would've asked me 1010 days ago if I thought I'd be here.. I'd of told you "hopefully, but knowing me, I'd cave long before then"  If I can do it... **YOU CAN DO IT**.  Don't listen to your scumbag brain.. it's just trying to get a fix.  Keep it up and stay strong fellow quitters.

What should I expect?

I'm 27 years old, in fairly good shape (I jog 3 days a week, my work keeps me on my feet all day, etc), and I've smoked, on average, a pack per day for 12 years. I've decided that I don't want to keep smoking past my 20s, so here I am thinking about quitting. Can anyone in a similar situation share their experience, pitfalls, and tips? Thanks!

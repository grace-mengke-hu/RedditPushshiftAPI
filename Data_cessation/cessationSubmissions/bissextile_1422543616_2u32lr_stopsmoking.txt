I am a non smoker. Thank you Allen Carr.

I have smoked for the past 15 years. I have tried to quit many, many times and all of them ended in misery. I just finished [Allen Carr's Easyway](http://www.theeasywaytostopsmoking.com/) to stop smoking. The first 11 chapters are like pulling teeth, your smoking brain wants to fight everything he says because smoking is your little crutch.  But as I continued with the book my eyes opened and I could understand what was going on in my life. the book cost 12$ and took me 3 days to read. My life has changed, if you have tried everything and it won't work try this he even tells you to smoke while reading it so what do you have to lose.

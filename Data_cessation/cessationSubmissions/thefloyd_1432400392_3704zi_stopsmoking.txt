3 weeks, 300 cigarettes I haven't smoked. I feel great!

Just wanted to crow a little. I quit for about a year with Allen Carr maybe 3 years ago. Fell off after about a year. Now I'm vaping and it's really easy. Yeah, it's a crutch. Yeah, I'm expecting lectures. But I can smell again, and I don't get winded coming up the stairs anymore, and to me that's victory enough. I started out on 12 mg/ml juice when I still smoked, quit without really noticing it, then cut down to 8 and now 3 mg/ml for the past week. I'm thinking once I hit a month I'll go down to zero nic.

Also, it bears mentioning that I work in a restaurant and 3 co-workers have had birthdays in the past two weeks. For anybody who's never worked in a restaurant, this means huge parties. Chain smoking. I didn't so much as take a drag off of a cig. Wasn't even tempted. They don't make mocha-flavored cigarettes, so...

Withdrawal symptoms

Hello.

I just quit smoking for like 10 days now. I did it because 12 days ago i got hit with some severe anxiety and stress and i just thought this is the last straw and i wanted my life back.
I still get twitches and panic attacks and the stuff that i used to get when i was smoking too but i was just thinking if quitting smoking will actually amplify my stress and anxiety?

I've always been some sort of a nevrotic dude, but i was never this stressed and anxious like 24/7. 
Was wondering if u guys know if quitting smoking will actually worsen my state or am i going in a good direction.

Also most of my colleagues tell me i'm sort of high right now even though i'm 10 days of not smoking and my withdrawal symptoms should have passed. I'm fluctuating between hyperactivity and anxious can't get up from my chair at work. But i see that when i'm talking to people and not thinking about it that i'm fine.

Anyone that can offer some insight and advice on my situation?

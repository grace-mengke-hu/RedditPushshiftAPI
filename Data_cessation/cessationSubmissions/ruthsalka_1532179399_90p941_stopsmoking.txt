So the really sucky part is

How bad everything smells. The house smells. The car smells. The cat and everything associated with him smells. My husband smells. I smell. I scrub and wash and vacuum... the vacuum smells . The trash smells the compost bin smells the carpet smells. I sweep and launder and bleach and everything still smells.
In past attempts I have used this as an excuse to start smoking again knowing that smoking would quickly eliminate this problem. Everything would still stink-I simply wouldnâ€™t be able to smell it.
Today is day five. I just filled my diffuser with patchouli essential oil and am about to turn it on. Everything will still smell but with a happy hippie overcoat.

New Here, Quitting...Now!

Hey guys, thought I'd introduce myself. I've been smoking since I was 16, turned 26 this year, and I decided it was time. I've been trying to get healthy, kicked my soda addiction a few months ago, dropped from smoking 1.5 packs/day (grad school) to 1 pack to, this year, 1/2 a pack. Now it's time to quit altogether.

Today. 

Right now.

Decision made.

I'm not scared, I swear... Okay, maybe, just a hint. 

I'm staying with family for the weekend, and can't smoke there anyway (they think I quit a long time ago), so I figured it'd be a good jumping off point. Except for the 5 hour drive to get there. 

What do you do in a car when you can't smoke on a long drive? 

Any tips for dealing with craving would be wonderful and most welcome. I've tried before, and had a successful 6 months, but now I need to do it again, and make it stick. My health isn't great, and I'm so desperately sick of my lungs crapping out on me.

I can do this.

I got this.

I'm going to kick this hold these smelly, expensive, death sticks have on me.


Update: I tried the lozenges, and felt like I couldn't breathe. Is that normal?

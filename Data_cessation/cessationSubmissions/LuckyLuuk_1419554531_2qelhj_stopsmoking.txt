Quit today, if you want

I wanted to quit the 1st of January, but a few days I decided to just quit immediately. Just got sick of the coughing, the smell and the expense. I've noticed my body's natural resistance has dropped drastically so I really wanted to quit.

But let me tell you, only quit because you WANT to, not because you should! Otherwise you'll fail, I've been there. I haven't touched a cigarette for almost a week now and it's been really easy, whereas during summer I tried to quit because my parents wanted me to, and it was the roughest time of the year, I failed and felt worthless.
Just wanted to share this with you guys, if you're ever thinking about quitting cigarettes, do it for yourself, not for someone else. It will make it a lot easier.

Why does it feel like so long ago...

...when i quit? I've had some pretty hardcore cravings. but other than that ive been going strong. i cant even remember the taste anymore. 

not gonna lie, when i second-hand off someone, i crave really hard, other brands of smokes make me sick to my stomach when i second-hand them.

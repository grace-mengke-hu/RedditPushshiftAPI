Week without poison

Hi all,
I promised to myself that I'll make my first milestone post, if I would make the first week. 
I did it. I survived one week.

I am truly happy and somehow surprised that it wasn't that hard at all. Of course the first days was the hardest. 
But last time I tried to get rid of these little, money sucking, health damaging, tubes of misery. I remember it was much harder than now. 

**The bad:** 

* I still have a couple of carvings every day, but they are easier to overcome

* I still do not have 100% confidence in myself, that I can do it

**The good:**

* I have saved 25 Euros

* I do not have to worry about my breath and clothes stinking everyday

* I do not need to go outside to freeze every 40 minutes  

* I can drink 2-3 beers and overcome carvings

Thank you Reddit for your posts of success and even failures, it really helps to read and understand that there are plenty of people who are going/ or have gone through it. Without you I doubt I would lasted this long :)

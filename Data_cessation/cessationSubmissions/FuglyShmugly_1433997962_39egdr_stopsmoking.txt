Two weeks! I didn't think it will be so easy :D

I didn't know how to not smoke and what will I do instead of smoking to get away from work for a few minutes to chill. So when I decided to quit I bought an e-cig, vaped for a week or so and then just stopped vaping too. I realized that I can just go drink a glass of juice or just stare at the wall without damaging my health, sucking a deathstick and stinking like a used prostitute on a hot summer day.    
Not stinking and being able to breath is great.

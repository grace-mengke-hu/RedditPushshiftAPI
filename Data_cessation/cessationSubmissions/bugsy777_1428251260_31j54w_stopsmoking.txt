My birthday gift to me and my S/O

My birthday was April 1st. I stopped buying cartons. My fiance's birthday is April 7th. I know it may be corny, but I told him this was his main gift for his birthday, to stop smoking.  I have had a couple puffs here and there to try and not shock my body by quitting cold turkey.  But today is the official day I stop smoking! The cravings aren't as bad as I thought they would be, nor as often, however there are those few times a day when it is REALLY BAD.  Any advice or suggestions on how to really keep doing this and to do it well is greatly appreciated! Thanks Redditors!

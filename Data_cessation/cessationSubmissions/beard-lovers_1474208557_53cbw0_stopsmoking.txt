+++ A Plan For You That Will Work +++

Quitting smoking is just like anything else that you would like to succeed at in life. You need a plan to follow and you need to do some planning beforehand to ensure than you can manage and succeed with the plan.

This involves making the process of not having a smoke easier to follow.

Obviously one of the first steps that you will need to take is to remove all possibilities of having access to cigarettes from the day you start your program.

You need to get rid of all the cigarettes you have in your possession.

Many people like to retain one pack of cigarettes as something to fall back on 'just in case they need one' but this is setting yourself up for failure before you start.

There needs to be no thoughts in your mind that you will even need another cigarette.

You should have also worked out what causes you to want to have a cigarette and be ready to avoid such circumstances or the possibility of such emotions when you start your process to stop smoking.

Avoid anything that will make you feel like having a cigarette and make arrangements to do things that will keep you occupied and help you to keep your mind off the cravings that are bound to happen.

Do things that will change your regular routines as this will help to break the habits that cause you to smoke.

Arrange to be with people who can offer you support and try to avoid those who are smokers as this can lead to unnecessary temptation. 

In the initial stages of your program you won't want these temptations and socializing with certain people will need to be postponed until you are in a position where you can handle having them around without feeling the need to have a cigarette of your own.

Anything that you can do to make your life easier during this period will help you to get the results that you are after and ensure that you will be able to finally quit for good.

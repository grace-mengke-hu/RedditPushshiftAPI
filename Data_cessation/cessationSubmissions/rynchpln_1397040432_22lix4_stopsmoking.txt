That smooth two week breakthrough

Every time I make it past 14(ish) days I am amazed by how little I want a cigarette. Granted the dreams usually start up by this point, but I'm cool with that. 

Am I alone, or does it seem like the addiction stops talking so much after 2 weeks? Most everyone knows about the 3 day breakthrough. 14 days just seems to be about as monumental to me.

I'll see this sub on my front page and click it out of curiosity. Compare that to the previous 2 weeks where I search it out and can't stop moving my extremities out of anxiety the whole time I read. The first two weeks I come here looking for a fix, something to trick my mind into fighting it's own natural reaction to withdrawal. Now I come just curious to learn more about what I just went through and if everyone else feels the same.

I still don't know if you guys say genius shit sometimes or if I just am here the eternal 3 minutes until the craving diminishes then I think, wow he's right I don't need a smoke. Anyways thanks for all of your posts. It has helped me get this far.


Edit: Grammar and when I officially make it to 17 days by the hour (5pm tonight). I know I will be at slightly over $100 saved, 4+ grams of tar avoided, and 300 cigs I haven't smoked, via QuitIt app. Amazing!

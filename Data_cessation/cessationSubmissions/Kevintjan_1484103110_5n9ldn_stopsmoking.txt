That feeling of being filled with smoke

Hi guys and gals,

It's 4AM now and i love reading all your posts about stoping with smoking. And i feel pretty encouraged to stop now, the first day really didn't feel to hard don't have a lot of cravings. When i have them i just chew gum. But one thing i really do miss, is the feeling of your lungs being filled after you inhaled the smoke. It feels i can't breathe enough air to get that same feeling. I'm really craving for that feeling, but also not really. I hope i'll make it, but i feel confident i really want to stop this time, i think it's going to happen this time. I also stopped smoking marihuana 4 days ago now, which also feels so good. I hope day 2 of stopping with smoking will also be a success! But anyhow, do you guys have the same feeling of not being "filled" enough with air in your lungs as you would've if you'd be smoking?  

Sorry if my english is gramatically incorrect sometimes :P

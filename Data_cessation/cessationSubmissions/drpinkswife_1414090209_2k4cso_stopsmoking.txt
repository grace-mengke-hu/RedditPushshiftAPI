Have a Plan! ...and never think you are out of the woods!

So I moved to the UK some time ago. Didn't need a car until about a year ago. Ended up having to take lessons again. Damn small roads. Got my driver's license couple of weeks ago. And [this](http://i.imgur.com/t2ukVuJ.jpg) arrived yesterday. I haven't been a regular driver in almost 10 years! First time I got in the car, I had the worst craving in two months!!! It was so overwhelming. It threw me straight back to that first week! I used to always smoke and drive. I had to walk it off. It was shockingly bad and lasted more than a blip. I thought I was past them; cravings like that. Wow and wow! Today is much better! Put about 15 more miles on the car. And in a roman town that takes like two hours. No more cravings. Back to happy. So there's my 'new to me' car. If you see it driving down the lane, give me a wide berth, I'm not used to these small roads! :))

Edit: I have to go to Paris next week. I'm not bitching...I mean I like it there, but I'm almost scared of another surprise attack craving because Paris to me means...smoking and red wine. I actually tried to get out of going. I think I will re-watch 'the video' before I head to the chunnel.

Got pressured into hitting a vape, will I feel the withdrawal effects again

I asked after and she SAID she thinks there is no nicotine in it. But there's no way to know for sure. I didn't feel any nicotine buzz at all and it didn't really increase my desire to smoke either. 

I was on day 15 before this "relapse" and I just finally got over cigarettes completely on day 10. I used to smoke only 4-5 a day. I also feel really guilty about this.

Will I have to go through a whole other 15 days again, or am I most likely fine and worrying over nothing?

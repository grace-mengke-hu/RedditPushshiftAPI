Relapsed after a year and a half, trying to find the motivation to get back on the horse

Context: I first quit in December 2016. I was disgusted with myself as a pack a day smoker for 5 years. I was unblieveably thin, my skin was terrible, my teeth were yellow, and I just generally felt unattractive. My self esteem was at my lowest, and I knew I needed a change.


I quit cold turkey, and took pride in the fact that I had the will power to just turn off that part of my life. It wasn't easy, and many times I would find myself crying randomly as my body slowly weened itself off the addiction. Fast forward one year: I start going to the gym, eating right, gain 15 pounds, graduate university, complete an intense IB internship, and finally move to HK from Canada as a fulltime analyst. The whole time I had never even touched a cigarette.


In HK, everyone smokes. When I first got here I had no friends, no family, no one to lean on. I felt lost and mentally weak. After a particularly stressful day (the 3rd consecutive 4AM day where we had 3 fire drill pitches to complete), I walked downstairs and bought a pack. It was almost like I was in a trance. I took a cigarette out, lit it, and have not been myself ever since. I'm back to smoking regularly now, and am slowly regressing to the person I used to be. I need to find the motivation to quit again, but I don't want to tell my friends/family and get their help because they will be so dissapointed in me, particularly my mother. She was so happy when I quit (my dad and brother both still smoke).


I don't really know what the point of this post is, but I feel better after venting. Thanks for listening.

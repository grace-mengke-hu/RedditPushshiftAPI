Did you set a quit date for yourself?

I’ve been wanting to quit for a few days now and I noticed i have been procrastinating it since the thought of quitting crossed my mind. 

FYI I’m 25 now, and I have been smoking since I was 15. Quit for 6 months when I was 21. 

Did you stop immediately when you realised you needed to quit? Or did you set a date for yourself to quit a few days later. 

I hope you guys can help me out and maybe give me some tips. 

Thanks in advance.

15 Days in so far after quitting. I still have a few issues.

Small backstory: I'm 21 (going on 22) and have been smoking since I was 16. I finally made the leap to quit on Valentine's Day. As of so far, everything has been great except for one thing: my anger. Every time I forget my patch, I become way way WAY more ornery than usual. It makes it seem like every little thing ticks me off in a way to the point where I can't focus on my job, my tasks that I'm doing like driving, or anything at all. Has someone been on this boat before? I'm assuming this will get better with time, one can hope at least.

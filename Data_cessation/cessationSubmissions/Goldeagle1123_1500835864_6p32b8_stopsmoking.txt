25 days into quit, really struggling.

I'm having a real hard time, I feel miserable all the time. I'm chew nictotine gum maybe once every few days to stop me from going to gas station and buying a pack, but the lack of nicotine and just the whole experience is killing me. Super irritable, and my head always hurts, I even got into a fight with my girlfriend yesterday because I was just in such a shitty mood and snapped. I don't know what to do, I constantly am just wanting to buy a pack so everything will feel normal again, I'll feel fine and well, and be regular old me again.

Don't really know who else to turn to, don't have a ton of friends, just really needs of advice or really anything. I like and miss smoking, but I really don't to die a horrific death of lung cancer.

Update: I ended up busting out my grandparents old Polaroid and walking around our city's river and lake, just taking pictures. Was very relaxing and distracting, it was also blazing hot so it really tired me out, as of right now I have no desire to smoke. I'll trying to these things in future when I start craving really intensely.

Withdrawals?

So I quit smoking 3 days ago and recently I've started to get flu like symptoms. Sweating then freezing on and off all night and and insane headache. Are these common symptoms? Or am I actually sick? Would an e-cig be a good combatant? 

Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone! Got rid of me ecig and if this is indeed withdrawals then I'll just tough it out.

Hit the three week mark cold turkey.

You guys seriously need to get the smoke free app. It is the only reason I've been able to quit.  This is the longest I've gone in 15 years.  I crashed and burned using patches and vapes.  I'm no longer counting days after today.  I'm just a non smoker.  

Thanks to everyone for the support.

Smoke Free me!

Been focused on self improvement as of late and I decided I want to quite smoking. I'm tired of the power it has on my life. Waking up and going outside in the cold because I just have to have a cigarette.  The habit I formed of starting my car, lowering the window and grabbing my lighter. The smell of my car and clothes. Having to take smoke that end up taking way longer than they should have and end up affecting the amount of time I have to study. No more I have overcome so much in the quest to be the best version of myself possible and this is just one more hurtle I am ready to jump. I look forward to having the support of this community behind me as I become a better man.

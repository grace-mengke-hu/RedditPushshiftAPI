Do the cravings ever go away?

Today is day 17 for me with no cigarettes. I feel awesome. I quit cold turkey, no e-cigs, no gum. But goddamn, every time I get in the car or finish up a tasty meal, I want to light one up so bad. Veteran quitters: how long did it take you for this to subside? I feel like I'm on the verge of slipping and I want to be done with them forever

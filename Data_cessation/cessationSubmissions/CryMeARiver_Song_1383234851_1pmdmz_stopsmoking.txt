Has anyone gotten pretty ill when quitting?

I've quit (or tried to) a myriad of times but nothing like this has happened to me before. I feel feverish and am sweating profusely, I vomited this AM and am feeling quite queasy still, my head hurts, and my mind feels foggy. Am I coincidentally sick or is this a thing?

Possibly useful info: I was smoking about 10 cigs/day, on and off for 10 years (quit for 2 years until 4 years ago). Yesterday was day 1 cig-free. I'm using the patch.

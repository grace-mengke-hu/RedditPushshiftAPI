YES! 3 Weeks!!

Pretty stoked about hitting week three and really surprised at how great I feel. I've had one major craving that lasted around 12 hours and one that lasted a couple of hours. That's not bad, not at all.

I made a direct point of addressing triggers and cravings right off the bat. I think that helped. And I went into this with the mind set of, I don't know how I'm going to feel, so I'm just gonna roll with it. Count myself fortunate that it hasn't been that bad.

Have a plan and take it one day at a time. We got this!

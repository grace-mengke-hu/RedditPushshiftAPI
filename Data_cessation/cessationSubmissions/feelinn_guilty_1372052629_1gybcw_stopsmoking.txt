I've faltered...

I was 2 months clean until I made the mistake of smoking a cigarette, now in the past few weeks I've smoked multiple times and I feel as if I'm sliding down a slippery slope.

I made a throwaway because I'm afraid my redditor friends will see this post and berate me for relapsing.

Honestly, I just need some words of encouragement. A success story from a similar situation. Part of me feels like it's inevitable that I'll fall into smoking again.

 I'm starting the counter from the beginning again tonight.

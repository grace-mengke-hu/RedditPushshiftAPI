Smoked heavily for almost 10 years. Went to the doctor today.

Here's a lesson for anyone on here that's looking to quit:

Every day, packs at a time, during my 20's. I just got back from a full-on physical, and my doctor said my lungs show absolutely zero audible signs of damage, due to the fact that I quit almost 3 years ago.

I almost did a back handspring. 

Quit.

Quit now. 

Quit yesterday.

Just stop smoking.

A few years ago, not smoking seemed like something which would probably never happen.

Yesterday my girlfriend and I were at 7-11 buying some caffeinated drinks for a long drive when I jokingly asked her which brand she wanted, gesturing toward the cigarettes.

It was such a familiar feeling which was, at the same time, so foreign.

It's only been a little over two years but smoking isn't something I think about at all anymore or, more importantly, something I identify with.

I tried to quit so many times, and maybe I just got lucky, but it does eventually stick.

Don't give up folks.

(I used an e-cig at first, but I think it only helped because I hated it)

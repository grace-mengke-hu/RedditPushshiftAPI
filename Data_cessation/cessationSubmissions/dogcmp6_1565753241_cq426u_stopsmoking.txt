24 hours in, Oh god the Cravings

I decided to quit 2 weeks ago, the doctor put me on Chantix, 30 hours ago I decided to start  my quit, I drowned my vape in a tub and Sweet and Sour and sauce, emptied my last can of dip into the container, threw it in the trash, and took it out to my apartment complexes dumpster where it has been rained on heavily, its not coming back...but nobody warns you the irritability and the cravings are this bad, even trying to keep my mind off nicotine, or chewing on a piece of gum, the cravings hit every 15 to 20 minutes like clockwork, and keep fighting me mentally...its exhausting, and I dont thing the Chantix is doing anything to reduce them, any tips?

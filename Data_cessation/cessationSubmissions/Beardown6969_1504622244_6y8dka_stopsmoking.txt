College student

I really can't afford to keep up with my nicotine addiction. I've been a moderate user since high school but I've been consistently using since my freshman year of college and I'm a junior now. Dip, cigarettes, ecigs, tobacco out of bongs u name it I've used it at least once every day for the last year. I live with a group of friends that all use tobacco product, is it even possible to quit cold turkey? any tips on quitting asap would be extremely helpful. Thank you

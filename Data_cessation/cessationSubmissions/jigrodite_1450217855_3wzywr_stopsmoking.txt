the last of lasts

Hello fellow non-smokers and future non-smokers!  I am writing this to make my last cigarette more official and share my current mentality with you all.  

A bit of history, I quit many times this year... One time was for 4 months but I went through a bad breakup and used it as an *excuse* to smoke again.  Was hooked for 1 month after that.  Then I quit again for 2 months after reading Alan Carr's Easy Way.  I smoked again for 2 weeks and here I am.  Back to square one.  It is difficult to pinpoint the source of my failure this time.. I feel like I simply gave in knowing that I could quit once again at a later time. My resolution faded and I convinced myself to smoke just once and of course it spiraled out of control.

I have learned a fair amount lurking here and reading Alan Carr and I now know that anyone can quit.  I just smoked my last cigarette 12/15/15 5pm and i feel sick: light-headed, short breath, heart is racing, throat hurts, awful taste in mouth, and a general feeling of agitation throughout my body.  

I am now a non-smoker and I look forward to suffocating this nicotine monster once and for all.  For people who haven't officially quit yet it is important to be absolute in your resolve.  One puff = thousands of puffs so I'll take zero.

Thank you stopsmoking for your support

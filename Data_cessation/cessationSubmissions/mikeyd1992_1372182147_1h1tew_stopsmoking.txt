Today is the 5th time I have tried to quit

I started smoking when i was 14. I don't really know why, I think I was trying to impress my friends. I was a dumb 14 year old. Either way, I got "caught" smoking at school once when i wasn't doing it in the first place; At least i hadn't been smoking at that moment. they searched me and told my family they had caught me smoking. So my family came down on me like a stack of bricks. I got pulled out of school and was accused of doing all sorts of horrible things I had never even tried. I was accused of doing drugs even though I couldn't find any if i tried and once I got back into school I started doing all of these things just because no one believed me that I wasn't doing any of these things. I figured, if I was doing the time, I may as well be doing the crime. And about two years of partying later I had gotten pretty bad into drugs and smoking and I got caught. This time I was actually doing the things I was accused of so I fessed up and my family forced me to quit. A few months later, I started smoking again, and it was much worse now. At least a pack a day and I was very bitter. I don't remember what happened but I became a goody goody overnight and quit for jesus. I quickly gave up jesus and picked up smoking again and have been in the throws of trying to quit for months now. I tried allen carr's easy way and I had gotten to day 15 before I lit up this morning. I think I just smoked about half a pack before I said no more and put it out. I'm back on the wagon and today is again day one. So I'm going to be hanging out here for a while now. I picked up again because a friend told me I would crave a cigarette for the rest of my life and then I just decided even if I did that it would be preferable to feeling like I'm a slave of tobacco. So I'm done. Nice to meet all of you here at r/stopsmoking!

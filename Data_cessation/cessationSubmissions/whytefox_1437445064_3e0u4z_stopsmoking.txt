What is tobacco abuse?

Everytime I  leave the doctor they give me a sheet of paper with general information about my visit on it. It also includes a section with other thing my family has been in for recently. 

On this list of various things I noticed they had put "Tobacco Abuse". I haven't updated them since I quit, and my husband was talking to them about quitting aids recently, so either of these could be the reason it's on there. But the phrasing struck me as odd. 

I figure they put "Abuse" because it sounds bad, like drug abuse or alcohol abuse. But those things are considered abuse, because there's an appropriate use for those things. Using alcohol in moderation isn't bad, and can have health benefits, and drugs have medical applications. 

Has anyone else encountered anything like this?

Help me smoking less

I don't know if I should say this here but I love smoking. I always did. I love everything about it the taste the beauty of the smoke and obviously the pleasure it gives me. I'm very young (18M) but I smoke for around 3 years and I've been smoking more and more (I guess it is normal). But lately as I started working it is worse because I can't smoke all day so when I can (at night) I smoke one cigarette after the other ( I can smoke like 5 cigarettes in 20 minutes) and never get that feeling of full pleasure. I don't really want to fully stop smoking, because, as I said before I love it, but I want to at least smoke less. Is there anything I can do, anything I can take (not very expensive) to calm down my need to smoke. I've tried chewing gum but it sometimes even makes me smoke more and eating makes me spends to much money (something I don't have that's why I want to smoke less)

Am i truly quitting??

Hello all. I am 6 days free from the bondage of smoking disgusting cigarettes. Whoo hoo! But here is the thing. I stuggled doing it cold turkey. I had resl bad withdrawals and I checked out patches. They have been working for me. I just am feeling like i havent really fully quit because im still getting nicotine. I would appreciate some feed back on the matter if possible. Maybe I'm not in this boat alone. Thanks

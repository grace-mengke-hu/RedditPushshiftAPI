Roughly day three. Why would I quit vaping?

I quit smoking almost five years ago (well, on and off - I still smoked cannabis/tobacco joints for a number of years).

But -
In terms of tobacco smoking for the sake of tobacco smoking, I managed to quit - but only with Electronic Cigarettes, and back in 2012. 

So skip forward to 2018. I'm 24 years old, bored to death of weed, bored to death of daily, and increasingly incessantly 'douche fluting' (that is, vaping; the smell, taste, bizarre annoying subculture, the cost, the constant craving, the need to escape situations to go out and consume nicotine, the need to stop work to vape, the worry about the unknown health issues, the sticky E-Liquid hands, the disgusting feeling of stimulation at bedtime, over-stimulation at morning time, and the under stimulation at times of accidental abstinence). 

So I quit cold turkey last Wednesday (30th). I was consuming about a bottle a day of 6mg E-Liquid. This after trying patches for a long time.

The withdrawal is continuing to be pretty ruthless, but I am managing. I do not want to be nicotine dependent anymore. 

One issue I am having is the fact that most inspirational websites related to nicotine cessation only focus on cigarettes. This is annoying because, as we all know, in times of desperate autonomic rationalisation for seeking nicotine (brought on by the brain, independently of the mind) the craving is indiscriminate to the source. 

Essentially, from what I gather, the incentive to quit E-Cigarettes is less than that of quitting cigarettes. This made my quit in my last attempt (2015ish) fail miserably, and still plays on my mind now.

So I ask you legends, simply - and desperately: 

WHY SHOULD I BOTHER QUITTING THE VAPE?!!!!?

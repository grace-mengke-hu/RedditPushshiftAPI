Making the Decision

I'm still on the fence whether or not I truly want to quit. I'm 19, I smoke anywhere from 6 to 10 a day, more if I drive long distances (about every 45 minutes I find myself lighting up again).

My friends and co-workers want me to quit, but I'm not really committed to it. I took a quiz on quit.(com...org...whichever one is sponsored by GSK) and it said I'm a physiological smoker, meaning I'm way past becoming dependent on it, which isn't surprising since I've been smoking since mid November. I'm actually on my ~~second~~ third one since starting this post.

One of my supervisors was having a heart to heart with me, he used to smoke and said I probably won't actually ~~want~~ decide to quit until I find a reason that gives me motivation. I've tried vaping, not really my thing but I'm open if it's helped some of y'all.

So really I guess this post is kind of wondering what y'all had as motivation. Hopefully coming here Ill get real answers instead of the generic "You'll be healthier and if you don't quit you'll die of cancer!".

Thanks for your time.

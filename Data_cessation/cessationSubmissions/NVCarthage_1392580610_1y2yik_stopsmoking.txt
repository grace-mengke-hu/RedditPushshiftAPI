One month down, a lifetime to go

I never thought I would make it this long. My previous most successful 'quit' was 36 hours. Even when I started this one, I was sure I'd fail. I think you guys have been a big part of making it this long. I didn't think being part of an online community would really have any impact, but I was wrong. I'm rambling, but I just wanted to say thanks!

I can make it to 17 hours and boom!

The last week I’ve been trying my best to quit i can make it from 11pm (last cig) to 4 maybe 5pm the next day and the cravings get so severe I feel I have no way out but to smoke. Funny thing is when I light that cig I don’t really even want it. 

I have the smoke free app trying to go by that not working out too well. Considering buying nicotine patches will this help with severe cravings ?

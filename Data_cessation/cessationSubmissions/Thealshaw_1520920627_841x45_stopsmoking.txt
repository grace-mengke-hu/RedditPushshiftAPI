I quit about 50 hours ago. super bored

so the cravings are not that bad, through meditation i learned to drop these "feelings", like you would do thoughts while meditating. however i am extremely bored now. can't have a conversation with anyone since half way through i will either completely lose interest or punch them. tried playing video games, also boring. don't have the energy to go out and do stuff also. anyone has any tips maybe ?

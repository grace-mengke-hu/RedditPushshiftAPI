11 Days In. Surprisingly I'm the envy of my smoker friends.

I didn't really expect them to be so openly happy/proud/envious of me. 

The day I decided to quit smoking, I told anyone I could tell. I wanted to know that if I relapsed, I would have to face that embarrassment. In the last couple of days, two friends of mine who are smokers were surprised I haven't touched nicotine. And one of them even messaged me: 

"I think you might be more man than me. If I cold turkey quit I'd be in bed shivering for 3 days."

He then started telling me how he wants to quit, but doesn't think he can. It's funny. My friends who I would smoke with, we *all* acted like we smoked because we just enjoyed it, we actually *all* secretly wished we could quit. 

I bet most smokers wish they could quit, but they don't think they can. Do you know why? **Because smoking fucking sucks.**

My point is, the people in this subreddit are doing something that most smokers *wish* they could do. I think thats pretty cool. 

**Edit:** One more thing. It's not a big love-fest. My non-smoker friends don't give a flying crap that I quit smoking. They already "don't smoke" and I guess that they don't see what the big deal is. I get it. Well they can suck it. This shit is a big deal.    ;-)

3rd times the charm!

I have been lurking this sub for encouragement for a while now. But the day finally came and it feels good. I set a date a few weeks ago. My last cigarette was after an amazing party this past Saturday.

I have quit twice before in the past. Both times I lasted 3-4 months. Once in 2010 and the second time was the beginning of this year. I am tired of feeling like shit and not being able to be as athletic as I have been in the past. I am 28 years old and I don't want to do it anymore.

The problem is that my girlfriend is a smoker and we live together. When I quit earlier this year it didn't bother me too much, but it's still not pleasant. And once you quit you can smell it on them more intensely. I love her and would like her to quit as well, but she doesn't seem like she's too on board with it. She tried once a few years ago with that Chantix stuff and had a bad experience.

Aside from maintaining my zero tolerance for smoking for myself, how can I maybe convince her to stop?

Point Blank Woman

Three weeks in. Today, my SO was suspiciously absent. I spent SEVEN hours with my ADHD child while she completed her for a usual kid 2 hours max homework. I made food, baked cake, served more food, cajoled, cleaned, supported, swore, served more food, cajoled and supported more, cooked more, etc in the kitchen during most of that time. Now at near 9 pm in the evening after two glasses of wine my greatest wish for Mother's Day here in my country tomorrow is to be Far Away from my family so I get rid of my current Obsessive Desire to Smoke. Just shoot me now to stop me from Ubering to the nearest petrol station to smoke myself stupid. I don't want to smoke, but I don't want this either. What do I do aside from deep breathing? Thanks for your moment.

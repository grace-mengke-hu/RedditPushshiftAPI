Reset me, I'm starting again.

Day one is almost over. Was only at about 3 cigs a day so the withdrawal isn't so bad at the moment. With that said I'm still feeling pretty shitty and having a hard time focusing. Looking forward to Sunday as I should be over the humps by then.

What I'm really worried about is getting past the 3 month mark, which is were I have always failed.

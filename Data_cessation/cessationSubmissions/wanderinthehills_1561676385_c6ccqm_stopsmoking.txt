Mood swings?

I’m on day 47 (Yey!) but the last couple of weeks have been tough. Cravings are few and far between and I’m actually feeling confident that this is it.
The only thing is that since quitting I’ve had bad mood swings. They were really bad at first but the last couple of weeks I’ve just felt really low which is kind of worse. It’s like I’m struggling to enjoy anything. It’s been a stressful time at work and where I used to manage it by slipping out the back for a smoke, I just stay at my desk. It feels like my crutch and my little treat to myself has gone.
I’ve also put on about 7lbs so not feeling my best either. 
Has anyone else experienced similar? And does it get better? And how soon? Thank you in advance

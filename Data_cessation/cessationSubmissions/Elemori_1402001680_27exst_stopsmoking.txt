One month nicotine free!

I quit with the help of Chantix. I had been smoking for 6-7 years. The first two weeks was the hardest and I still REALLY want a cigarette every now and then, but the cravings are much easier to ignore now. It's a simple desire, not a compulsion.

About a week ago I sat in the kitchen smelling all the different spices we had just stocked back up on and many of them smelled so much stronger!

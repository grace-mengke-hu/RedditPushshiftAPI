I didn't quit smoking, I quit being a smoker (35 Days)

Hi guys!

I smoked for nearly 9 years, 5 of them a pack a day, then I went on an E-Cig for +/- 2 weeks, and finally I just quit smoking cold turkey.

I still get cravings every now and then, when I do I just power through it and don't smoke.
During this month I've smoked 3 cigarettes, not because I was craving them or felt an urge, but because I was in a "spot" where it would taste good. Smoking those cigarettes has made me realize  how much better those 3 cigs tasted then all the 650 I didn't smoke during this month, and that is why I believe I can keep going like this.
Finally I believe this whole experience made me a hell of a lot stronger person, mentally at least, and healthier!

Anyone with me on this way of thinking?

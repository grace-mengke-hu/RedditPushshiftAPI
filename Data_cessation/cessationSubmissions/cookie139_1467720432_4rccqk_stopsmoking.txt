Ex-smokers: How long did it take to get clear & healthy looking skin?

I smoked my last cigarette 16 hours ago. My motivation to quit is of course for health reasons but moreover, I'm so tired of looking into a mirror and seeing an unhealthy face with puckered lips, hollow eyes, stained teeth and wrinkles. It sends me into a cycle of self-loathing - smoking - self-loathing. I would love to read some of your personal experiences about positive physical changes that you saw in your body post quitting.

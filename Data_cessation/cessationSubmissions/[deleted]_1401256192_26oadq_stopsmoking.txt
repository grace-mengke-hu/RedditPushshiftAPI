My encouragement to not continue smoking.

After quitting smoking for a year, I recently bought a pack of smokes.  I've smoked about 8 out of the pack and just destroyed them after having a conversation with myself in my head.  I'm posting this on reddit so it can serve as a reminder that I need to continue not smoking and never pick it up again. Not wanting karma or any bullshit of the sort, just need encouragement so I don't let the addiction take hold again.

Hello, it's been 10 hours

Hi everyone, and thanks for this. I'm posting because I'm about halfway through easy way and even though Saturday was supposed to be my quit date, I decided to toss my pack earlier today. I've tried it all to quit, and ecigs worked for a bit, but I have vaped and smoked for the past year. Basically I smoke cigs all day and vaped at home with my family. Kinda ridiculous and so now I'm just done. I feel like I understand the theory behind easy way but am still too scared to commit without my ecig as well. So today I at least said no more cigs but I still am handling cravings with my ecig. Did easy way just click for some of you, or did anyone here have the same struggle as me  knowing that I'm still feeding the monster with my ecig. Thanks.

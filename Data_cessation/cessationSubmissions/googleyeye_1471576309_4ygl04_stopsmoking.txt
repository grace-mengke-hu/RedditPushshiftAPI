In one hour, I'll have gone 168 hours without a cigarette or a vape

Still fighting cravings while using the patch (step 2) but they are becoming much easier to manage. I am, however, eating too much as a replacement so I'll have to knock that off and start hitting the gym. I like the vivid dreams from the patch but they have dropped off in intensity the last two or three days. 

I haven't been without a cigarette or a vape for more than three days in years. I didn't even realize it had been that many days until I popped in here and saw I was on day 7. I actually went out for dinner and drinks two nights this past week and didn't smoke, which really helped me feel empowered and that this time is for real. 

I am looking forward to week two smoke free!

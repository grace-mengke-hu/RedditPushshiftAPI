I am a shit.

I gave in to this nicodemon in a moment of weakness. I walked to the convenience store in hopes that the craving would pass, and I would simply buy some candy and chips to help with future cravings. I'm planning on buying some Champix in the morning and re-quitting.

I hope to get a new badge asap.

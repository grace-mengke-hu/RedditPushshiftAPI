I told my fiance he wouldn't marry a smoker.

I have been telling him this for years. In just about one month, we will be married; we have been together for coming up on 7 years, the day of our wedding. One month away is about a week away from now.

I had initially planned on quitting on the exact date of our wedding being one month away, giving me that exact amount of time to kill the withdrawal and see if I can go without slipping up.

But for some reason... I started yesterday instead. I remember driving to work, thinking "I only have three cigarettes left..." and I knew how easy it would be for me to go grab some as I pass countless gas stations on my way. 

However, strange things happened instead. 

First: I passed every single gas station. I did not stop. 
Second: I did not ask my manager to grab me some, as he often temporarily leaves during shifts to go get cigarettes or energy drinks.
Third: I remember only smoking two of my three cigarettes; when I went to smoke the third, my pack was suddenly empty.
Fourth: I tried to bum either two or three times. Each time I did, I couldn't finish the cigarette. They tasted horrible to me.
Fifth: I did not buy anymore cigarettes on my way home.

Instead, I updated my vape collection and decided to buy a new mod and tank online. It will arrive in a few days. Since Sunday evening, I have been vaping. I have thus been cigarette free 30 hours. Every single other time I have tried to quit smoking I have failed. Every time I have tried to set a specific goal, I slip up. Even when I try to do it spontaneously, it does not last.

I am truly hoping this time will be the one. After all... I told my fiance he wouldn't marry a smoker.

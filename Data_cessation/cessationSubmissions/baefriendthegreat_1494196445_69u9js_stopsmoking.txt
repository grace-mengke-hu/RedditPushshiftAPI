Tooth whitening

I am the kind of person who needs to be immediately affected in order to know that I've made a good decision (I guess it's part of being a member of the millennial generation). In order to help myself quit I've decided to also try and whiten my teeth. I'm using crest 3D white strips since the 3D white toothpaste has actually seemed to work. Anyone else have any suggestions? Right now I'm whitening and still having cravings (first day as a non smoker btw)

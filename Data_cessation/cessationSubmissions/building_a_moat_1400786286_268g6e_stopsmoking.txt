I woke up feeling sick today.

I'm 22, I've been smoking for about two years now. I woke up this morning, sick to my stomach. I rolled out of bed, threw up and got ready for work.

I can't deal with feeling like this. It's not just the smoking, I have a terrible diet and sedentary lifestyle, it's a miracle I'm not morbidly obese. I'm done smoking. I'm done feeling like shit for no reason. I'm done spending the money I need to move on with my life on something that makes me feel like this.

I'm not a pack a day smoker, I haven't been doing this for 20 years but I'm done with it. Starting today.

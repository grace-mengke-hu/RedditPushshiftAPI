Quitting smoking. Have some questions

So first let me say, I'm not new to quitting... Ive "quit" several times before, sometimes making as long as a few months. For me it's not the chemical addiction. I romanticize cigs. I allow my mind to tell myself that i work hard and "deserve" them. That i can't enjoy a vacation, a day at work, or a Saturday at yhe beach without them. So my question. What do you guys do to kind of replace the times when you'd normally light up. Those down boring times. Also can anyone give me details about how they physically feel beyter after quiting. Sounds weird, but it motivates me when i hear how you sleep better. Or have better mental clarity. I've smoked for 10 years and just recently started getting these "jittery" feelings when i smoke. Almost like that feeling when you chug a red bull. Shaky. Can anyone relate. Anyway any response would be helpful. Appreciate it y'all

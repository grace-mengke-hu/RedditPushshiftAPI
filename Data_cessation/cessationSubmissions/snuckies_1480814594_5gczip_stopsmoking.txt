Serial Quitter

I've lost count of the amount of times I have tried to quit. Whether it's been 2 days, 2 weeks or 2 months that I have managed to go smoke free, I find myself always failing and back to smoking. I am angry at myself and it's really getting me down! 

I'm throwing another half empty pack in the garbage right now, here we go again. I'm so sick of smoking. Really want to get rid of this horrible addiction once and for all! Wish me luck guys. Any advice is appreciated

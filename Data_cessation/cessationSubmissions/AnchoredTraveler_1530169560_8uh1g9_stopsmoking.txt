My gazillionth attempt to quit. Day 1 done, which is kinda of routine by now. I would like to talk about a specific psychological symptom, being more serious or even apathetic.

So I quit, like, a lot. I do it for a few days, few weeks, few months, or even once I did it for a year and a half. Then I'm always like, "Dude life sucks without smoking" and I go back.

Of course, I'm not an idiot, and I can very easily tell how cigarettes are immediately damaging my health, let alone my how I look and smell, and so I find myself quitting again some time later.

I'm a dorky guy, I make silly remarks and goofy gestures. One of the psychological aspects that I would like to discuss is how, in the first few days of quitting, I always become much more serious. I lose my capacity to laugh, to the point of seeming rude to someone who is trying to tell a joke, for example. I lose interest in many things but mostly people, so when my friend expresses his excitement about something my reaction is almost always *"meh"*. 

I call this the "meh" phase. Do you go through this phase? How long does it last for you? Do you think it's caused by actual reduction in dopamine levels or just a psychological effect resulting from the emptiness left in the wake of cigs?

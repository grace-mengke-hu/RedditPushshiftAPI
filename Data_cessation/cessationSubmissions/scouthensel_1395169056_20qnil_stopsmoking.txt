For the first time ever, I finally feel like I'm going to do it this time...I'm gonna quit smoking.

It's been since 4am on Sunday March 16th that I threw my pack away. I turned 24 on the 15th and smoked since I was 14. I've been wanting to be done for years but something clicked in me recently. I'm ready. Encouraging words, disgusting pictures, and sad stories really help the cause.

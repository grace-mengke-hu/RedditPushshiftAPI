Beginning to Quit

I've never really been a heavy smoker. I started out 3 years into a 5 year major. Just the occasional "I'll have one with everyone" thing. Eventually it goes on into "every now and then even if it's just by myself", then it went into 4 sticks a day. Just this lunch I had my first for the day and for some reason found my way to /r/stopsmoking. I'm making a decision to stop. It's not going to be easy as I live with 2 smokers at home, but I will do it.

So.. Yea.

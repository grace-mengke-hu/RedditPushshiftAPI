The best part of 2 years quit

...is the freedom from addiction. Don't get me wrong, I love being able to breath and not waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air.

But having peace of mind throughout the day. Not constantly worrying about who's offended by my stink. Not constantly figuring out how I can ditch my family and get my fix. Not constantly turning into an asshole in a meeting because it's dragging on and I just want to smoke. Not feeling like a jerk for having told my wife I'd quit hundreds of times. Not wondering what my kids would think if they found out. I get to just be me.

I smoked for 15 years, pack and a half a day. I never thought I would actually be able to quit. Yet here I am. Make quitting the addiction the most important part of your life. If it's easy, great. If it's not, so what. In no time at all it won't even be a thing anymore.

I don't care how you get here folks, just get here.

A nicotine-free replacement for cigarettes?

I've been quit for 3 weeks now and don't feel cravings, only kinda tempting when drinking, really.

Every year me and my friends go to a festival, and we all usually smoke up constantly while we're there, I know that I probably won't be able to resist and am going to rationalize it with "I'm just smoking while on this festival, then quitting after". Is there anything other than weed that can be smoked as a substitute for nicotine? Also, hopefully not vape.

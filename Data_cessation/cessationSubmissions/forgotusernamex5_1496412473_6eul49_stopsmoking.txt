Confronting High Stress Tasks

I've been taking it pretty easy work wise since I quit, but now I really need to get on top of a few things. My stress levels are through the roof. One thing in particular is very difficult to do with a lot of pressure, and I'm finding it almost impossible to tackle without my cancer crutches. It's tempting to pick up a pack if it means the work will be done, but I know that's in my head. 

People who have been here, what did you do to get through the mental hurdle of points like these?

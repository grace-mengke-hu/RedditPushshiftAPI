Where to start?

Hi! I'm new here and I am super glad I found this sub. So I have been a smoker for decades. I have tried the patch, the gum, the pills in the past but I can whole heartily way I didn't want to quit then. I'm ready. 
Can anyone lend some advice on a 'game plan' that works/worked for them?  I have taken the first step by quitting alcohol so I'm REALLY trying to set myself up for success here! 

Also, I have read Alan Carrs book but they do have seminars that guarantee you quit. Has anyone tried that?

Can Passive Smoke from Vape's awaken your Nicotine receptors?

I have been smoke free since the end of last January and I recently have started hanging out with a friend which hits his Vape a lot. I noticed that up to two days after I go to his place, I start getting feelings similar to the annoying withdrawal symptoms of when I first quit. Additionally I also had an increase in the phlegm in my throat and nose, really annoying. So my question (as the title suggests) is: is it all in my mind or is there a causal interaction between vape passive smoke and my symptoms? 

Thanks in advance for the answers.

A promise I made to myself today.

I ended up falling back into cigs in January after about two months free. Well after a few unsuccessful attempts since then I really cut back smoking, only having one, or half of one, or none for a few weeks with probably three or four days smoking upwards of like four or five. Well now I'm like five or six days no cigs.

Last night I really wanted a cigarette, i had just one in my room, but in my better judgement I didn't smoke it. So here's what I promised myself today. If I'm going to smoke a cigarette, it has to be that one first. I put it in a spot in my room where I won't be looking at it. But if I'm at a friends and they're smoking and I want one, too bad. If I'm at work and someone offers me one too bad. It's not that one. When I'm at home it's easier to not smoke and to ignore the craving. When I'm at a friend's and they keep going out for a cig it's hard to say no.

Any other tricks or techniques that work for others? Other than just willpower?

Anyway, keep breathing easy folks.

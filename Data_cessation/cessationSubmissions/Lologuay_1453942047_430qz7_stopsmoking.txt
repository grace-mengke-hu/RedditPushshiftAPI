Almost 2 months today and I really want to smoke

Hi all, so today I am on day 55, and for some reason I really want to smoke today. I know just one cig will get me back to hell. 

Why after 55 days do I get these nasty cravings? Maybe because today I am supergrumpy and did not sleep great?  I am 43 years old and can not contemplate to go back.

Every time I've tried has been more difficult than the previous. This is insanity.

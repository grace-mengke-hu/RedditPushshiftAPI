My quiting started when I became sick, because of the pain in my lungs I couldn't smoke. After a week, when the sickness was already treated, I had no nicotine in my body. From that moment, a day without cigs was nolonger a chalenge for me. And so I'm here, being an ex-smoker for 1 month and 2 days.

Getting my teeth fixed.

Slightly different post I guess.

I've been a smoker for about 9 years, at my best a pack a day, at my worst 2. I've been to a dentist once in my life as a child and that was it, and after years of smoking my teeth and gums went to heck. Riddled with cavities and decay, one molar has about 1/4th remaining and another tooth is half gone. I've been relatively smoke free for a year now and since then I've returned to school, hit the gym, moved in with my girlfriend and everything is wonder. The only thing left was my teeth.

I've hated my teeth for years now, never smiled, even have consistent nightmares where they just crumble up and fall out. I avoided the dentist because I figured they were done for and would need to be all ripped out and dentures put in, so why not just wait until they go?

On impulse I went to the dentist a month ago and they set me up with a plan after taking some x-rays and such. Oddly enough all my teeth are salvageable, lots of fillings and such will need to be done but it isn't as bad as I thought. It has been 4 days since my first appointment, they performed 2 root canals and ripped 4 wisdom teeth out. and I have two more appointments until I'm finished. it is expensive but through their own health plans and partially my insurance (until it's maxed) I going to get it done.

What I mean is, I know there are others out there like me, you're done smoking but the aftermath will linger, you may think it is too late and you should just ignore it. Don't. like me, it may not be as bad as you think, if you are struggling financially, look into a care credit card, it is a credit card strictly for healthcare, it may give you the flexibility you need to get the operations done.

TLDR: Teeth are messed up and I'm finally making a change.

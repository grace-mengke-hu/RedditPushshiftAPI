Why does summer trigger cravings?

Once again summer is coming in Italy.
And once again it triggers my cravings for a cigarette.

Climate changes, it starts to be hot. But sometimes the weather is bad due to high humidity and it rains. It is like crazy.
I always feel tired and a bit sad.
Exams are coming.
And there is a girl which I'm having some flirt with (maybe we like each other), but I never feel like "okay, I'm going to date her" and I am afraid she receives "photos" by another guy (but I can't know this for sure, of course).

And I found myself desiring for a good cigarette. Why does summer trigger all of this? Do you have to cope against it too?

Slowly but surely...

It’s day 4, made it thru a Friday night while drinking. Just hope to keep this up.  Smoking cigarettes has really affected the health of some of my family. I want to make them proud and stop now, before I’m in their shoes of not being healthy. But this is not easy! Just doing it cold turkey!!!!

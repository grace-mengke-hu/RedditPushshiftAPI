Constantly sick since quitting

Hi all, I am on the approach for 3 months since I quit (yay!), but I have yet another cold and sore throat settling in. Since I quit I have basically had back to back colds, coughs, sore throat. They go away and then a few days later - POW - guess who's back (back again).

Did anyone else experience the same thing? Any idea how long I can expect this to last? Terribly bored of it now, as much as the husky voice has helped my over-the-phone sales at work.

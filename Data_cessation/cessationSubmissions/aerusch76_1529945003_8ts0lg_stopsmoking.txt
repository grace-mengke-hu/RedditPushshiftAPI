This lady is having a conversation on the phone next to me at work and smoking a cigarette as I'm writing this.

I dont mind the smell and I dont care if people smoke, but this definitely made up my mind that I'm never going to smoke.

This lady's voice is the most atrocious thing I've ever heard. She sounds like the green slug lady from monster's inc. She sounds like the grandma who 'always hated' chocolate from spongebob. Please kids. Dont sound cringy. Dont start smoking.

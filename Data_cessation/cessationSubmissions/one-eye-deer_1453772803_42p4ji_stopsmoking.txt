I made it three weeks cold turkey!

I still feel like a ravenous beast half the time (nicotine really is a huge appetite supressant!), and the urge to smoke is starting to come back a bit, but I haven't caved in! It's gotten easier with each passing day, and seeing my ticker upgrade up to the "three" and to actually see "21 days" is a huge motivator. Telling myself "no" and meaning it has been huge. I'm in control again, after three years of on/off smoking and half-assed attempts to quit.

Keep at it, everyone. Just take it one day at a time, and you'll go far!

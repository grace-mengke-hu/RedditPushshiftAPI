Quitting Saturday! Some questions.

Im 20 been smoking since 17. I smoke  3-5 a day but I never go a day without them. Im reading Allen Carr's book this week. Im dropping acid saturday and hope to quit after my trip. Some quick questions do you guys normally tell family\friends that your quitting? What activities or hobbies have you took up? Lastly what do you do when going to a place that you always smoke at (work, school)

After spending Christmas morning in the ER with my girlfriend I decided it's time to end a 6 year relationship with the one thing holding me back. .

(Sorry for a wall of text, in not a writer and I'm on mobile) 
After me and my girlfriend went to bed at around 10 on Christmas eve she woke me up at about 3am saying she needs to go to the hospital because she couldn't breath. .. she's been smoking for 13 years and has had an asthma problem since childhood but that never stopped her.. until we spent Christmas morning in the emergency room because of a severe asthma attack. She didn't smoke at all yesterday but I "needed" my fix and when I got near her after smoking she pushed me away because of my breath and the smell of cigarettes on my beard. So this morning after smoking my ritual morning cigarette on the porch with my coffee I dumped out the rest of the pack of camel crush bold and snapped each of em in half and threw them away.... time to finally post here after months of lurking.

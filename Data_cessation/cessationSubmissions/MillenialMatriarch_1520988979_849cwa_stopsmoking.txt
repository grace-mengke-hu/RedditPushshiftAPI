What did you do in day 1?

I've had more "day 1"s than I can count. 

Still, as I do it again for hopefully the last time, I want your best advice for the first 24 hours. I've told the world to expect nothing of me  (except for my gym buddy). 

So far I've let housework pile up that I can work on and crochet projects I haven't picked up in a while.

Almost 3 months smoke-free, still suffering from stomach issues

In few days, I will complete 3 months without smoking. It feels much longer than that!

My urge to smoke has completely gone away. I've been avoiding hanging out with colleagues on their smoke breaks thinking that I could be tempted. However, yesterday, I happened to accompany them and I am proud to say that even after seeing them smoke, I didn't feel like smoking myself. Moreover, I found the smell disgusting. That's a really good sign.

On the other hand, my productivity at work has come down considerably because of stomach issues. I've had symptoms of IBS for many years but quitting smoking seem to have flared them. From past two months, I've been suffering from flatulence and bouts of diarrhea. I met a gastroenterologist a week back and he changed my medication, it helped for a while but today it's as bad as it was before meeting him. If things don't improve in another week, I most probably would get an endoscopy done to get to the root of it. 

I've been asked to avoid a lot of foods: chocolates, tomato, cabbage, potato, milk. I've been tracking my diet myself as well, to avoid foods which give me gas. However, I struggle with portion control and tend to overeat. Any tips on how to control portions?

5th day as a non-smoker!

4th day was definitely my hardest day, was craving most of the day cause I couldn't handle myself mentally haha Get better at night, just completely forgot I ever smoked and today has been great so far! Just woke up forgetting I ever smoked, getting my energy back now cause I was feeling like shit for the first 4 days and the cold I got is going too. One thing that I noticed is that the feeling of hunger in your stomach is so much stronger when you don't smoke.. I'm feeling great and doing great, finally a non-smoker and to everyone on this subreddit thank you because I check this everyday a few times to keep myself motivated! I hope everyone is doing good and keep working towards your goals

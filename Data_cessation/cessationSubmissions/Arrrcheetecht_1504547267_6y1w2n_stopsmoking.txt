Little update as I go on

Day 18, didn't mean to post till week 3, but I felt like it.

Cravings almost none, maybe just a tought every once in a while, blood pressure repairing, sleeping like a baby now. Because of weight gains I started walking daily, more and more, then decided to try running. Downloaded the C25K and strava and I already finished two days. I'm still a chubby locomotive, but I slowly love the transformation I'm making in my life. Love all this apps, I think they give me motivation and strenght to change. 

Next logical thing, diet... Keto seems perfectly suited for me, but I'm a little afraid of the challenge as my meals involve a lot of carbs (bread, pasta, rice,...) + I have a really sweet tooth. Must really prepare mentally for this one.

Never tought that the change would be this big...but I like it. Be strong everybody, enjoy the ride.

For the last 10 days i've been buying and throwing away packs after 5-8 cigs. What's wrong with me?

I'm 33 and a pack a day smoker. I want to quit but everytime i think 'this is it' and i throw away my 'last' pack i just buy another one a couple of hours later. I feel like i'm in a loop and i don't how to stop it, did this happen to anyone else?  
I've read Allen Carr's book and i'm listening to the audiobook hoping something in my brain finally clicks. I want to quit not just for the sake of quitting but to also stop thinking about quitting (i don't know if that make sense)

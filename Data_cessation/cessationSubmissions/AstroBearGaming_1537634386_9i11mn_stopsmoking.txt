So it's been about 23 hours

Almost a day, and I was doing fine but at about twenty hours it's like my cravings flared up to 11

I also found some fraud on my debit card and have been dealing with that over the last hour so increased cravings and stress aren't helping. Any tips on what I can do to deal with this?

Need to give up for good, please please help!

So I've been smoking for 9 years on and off. I started when I was a teenager in order to be 'cool'. 
I'm quite clued up on smoking, I've read the literature and seen the pictures about what it does to my insides and my wallet. However, I've tried to give up so many times over the years and always end up thinking that 'one won't hurt'. 

I used an e-cig for about 18 months but that just made my nicotine dependency much much worse. Psychologically, I'm 110% addicted to nicotine. 

I really want to be rid of it for good, I don't want to revert to e-cigs. What do you guys suggest as a giving up tool? I'm not sure if going cold turkey would be the best idea for someone like me. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I really want to live the rest of my life as a non-smoker. 

tl;dr - smoking for nearly a decade. Need tips for giving up forever. E-cigs don't work for me. 


**Edit: I've just finished Carr's book and I'm amazed how simply it's been put in to perspective.  I had my last cigarette earlier and immediately I felt like a physical weight had been lifted from my shoulders.  I can now honestly say "Yipeeee, I'm a non-smoker!"  I feel so free!**

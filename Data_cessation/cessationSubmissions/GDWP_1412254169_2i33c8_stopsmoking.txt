9 days in and...sick

9 days in and for the past 2 days or so I have been really achy, with headaches. And sometimes have cold or hot sweats. has this ever happened to anybody? Also not every night but probably  every other I can't sleep... Tossing and turning and waking up. And I used to sleep like a rock!

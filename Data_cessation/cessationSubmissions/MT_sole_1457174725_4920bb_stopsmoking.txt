I'm 20 and been smoking for 7 years, please read.

So I started as typical as it can be, I was 13 and started to hangout with a guy who I got to be best friends with and who still is. He was a smoker and while he smoked always around me, whenever I asked for a bum he wouldn't agree, so I was like fuck it I'm buying my own. It's really easy even when you are 13. Been smoking since then.

So I really wanna quit now but this nonsense idea of I'm still young keeps coming. I don't know why I always think that. I don't know, I'm just looking for some motivational words.

EDIT: I know that being around my friend who is a heavy smoker is not helping but honestly he is one of the best people I met in my life. He totally supports me on quitting although he is not willing to quit himself.

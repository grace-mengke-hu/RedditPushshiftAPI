Thinking that I'm done with Nicotine for good. It was fun at times, but I think I'm ready to move on.

Most of those times would be during social interactions. For the most part, I was a social smoker and would only do so during parties and whatnot.

Thinking about it, though, it never really made me feel very good. More recently, I became involved with Nicotine again, but using them in the form of lozenges in order to "boost my productivity."

Instead the reverse happened, and they had a tendency to make me more on edge and anxious, completely derailing my ability to actually do anything productive.

So? I think that's it. There's not really much more I need to get out of it, so I'm done.

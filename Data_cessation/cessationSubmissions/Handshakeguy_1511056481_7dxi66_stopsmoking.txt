Drunk and depressed, still managed to hold back

This may be inappropriate, but I can't help but be proud of myself for looking at a cigar and taking a pass despite being halfway into a bottle of benchmark.  If I can do it, so you can you.  Keep it up everyone!

Edit: Whew, that was a night.  Thanks for the encouragement friends!

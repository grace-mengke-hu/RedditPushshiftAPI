Quitting my Vape — the last step to recovery

I’m quitting my vape today. Going to just throw it away. I feel like I’m ready now. I’ve made so many mistakes in my life, and there are moments that make me cringe for how much of a little birch-wimp I was in the past. On my journey of self recovery I decided to reinvent myself and shed all bad habits I have. I’m in my mid 20s. It’s time to man up and grow up. Cigarettes were introduced to my life at a young age; almost everyone in my family smoked in one form or another. Cigarettes made me complacent and weak; instead of going to the gym to regulate my emotions and become stronger to protect myself from life’s bullies and challenges — I smoked. Looking back, it was the cowards way out. Not only that, it has caused me so much pain and regret in my life to smoke. To think I was so weak and stupid to go this far in life addicted to this fucking thing... I can’t believe it. I just can’t believe how pathetic I was. How I would hide behind video games, the internet, cigarettes, pornography and masturbation to avoid dealing with my problems — though at the time I didn’t know it. Didn’t have any disciplinary figure in my life, didn’t have a mentor. Wish I did. So many wasted years and I have my young, naive, developing brain to blame. I am fucking sick and tired of living like a loser, of being pushed around by life and my shitty addictions and habits. I’m so sick and tired of it. I am committing this time. I will not fail. I am worthy of love and respect. I will not hurt myself anymore. I will not hide anymore. I will not be weak anymore. I am a grown man... a grown fucking man.... and I’ve already wasted so much time. Enough is enough. This is it. 
If I can do it, you can too.
Seize the day, boys.

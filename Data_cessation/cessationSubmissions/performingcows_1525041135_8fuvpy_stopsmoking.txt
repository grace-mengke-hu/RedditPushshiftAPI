Still have cravings but not for a cigarette

I'm about a month in. I still sometimes have something that feels like cravings, but i really don't want a cigarette. It's just that at the times when I would usually smoke, my brain still tells me it wants to be rewarded in some way, but i think i've managed to not associate cigarettes with reward anymore. a couple of days ago I felt miserable and smoked a bit of a cig. It was disgusting. I guess I still crave what my addicted brain perceived cigarettes as, but i know now that that's not actually what they are, so i can't fet it from them. it's a strange feeling! anyone else experience it?

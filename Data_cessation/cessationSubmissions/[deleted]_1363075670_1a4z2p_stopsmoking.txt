So this is my first year of successfully quitting smoking

And this would have to be my best year so far in a long time :) Good luck to all of you who are newly quitting, once you know you will quit, you will quit for good and you will feel better about it.

Thank you very much to this subreddit, reading some of the posts in the past year kept my motivation going strong.

Congrats to everyone else who have also reached 1 year today.

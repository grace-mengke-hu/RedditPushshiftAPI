are these symptoms normal?

hey guys,

I started smoking late last year, after going through divorce. I had a break, but during an especially tough phase I smoked 1 pack/day for a short time. 

I decided to quit now, cold turkey. I feel sharp chest pain, I'm incredibly exhausted, irritated 24/7, have headaches and stomachaches after every meal. Is this normal when you quit smoking? And if so, how long before I feel normal again?

The time period I smoked for was short, but it seems like it was enough for me to get hooked quite a bit.

Thanks!

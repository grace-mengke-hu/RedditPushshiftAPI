Merry Smoke-free Christmas, Y'all!

9 days.  Wow.  I honestly didn't think I could do it through the holidays.  But you know what?  Right now, I'm resisting the urge more out of spite than for my own personal desire to quit.  Every cigarette that I don't smoke is a slap to the smug face of all those "friends" and family who smirk when I tell them I've quit.  Especially the smokers who, because they're weak and still hooked, project their own failure on me.  They want to see me fail so they can continue to justify their habit.  Fuck the haters!

Sorry for the rant, y'all.  Stay strong.

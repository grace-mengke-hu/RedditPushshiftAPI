Anyone else just MEANER?

Hey all! I've been smoke free for about 4 months. Had to quit bc of a PE. (Blood clot in lungs) For those just starting, yes it's hard. Its gruelling. But it slowly gets better. The worst part is remapping my habits. But I'm curious, has anyone else just gotten MEAN after quitting? And a shorter temper?

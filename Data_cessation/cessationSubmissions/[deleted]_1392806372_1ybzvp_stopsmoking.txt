My dad thinks I have no idea that he smokes.

As I was doing recycling in the garage, I caught a quick bright reflection from the drivers side in my dads car, I looked closer and realized it was a shiny little lighter.    
    
I feel bad about it, but I decided to investigate a little further. I found nicotine patches in one of his jackets, and using the spare key to his car found a couple of packs of smokes in his car. Before you get mad at me for invading his privacy (which I know I did and feel terribly guilty about), realize that it's his life we're talking about here. I smoked for a year in high school and know a little about how awful the addiction is and only want the best for him.    
    
Considering the way I found out about this, how can I possibly approach him about it? I only want to help but fear the consequences if I tell him.

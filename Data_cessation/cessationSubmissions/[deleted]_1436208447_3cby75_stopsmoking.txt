A morally dubious - but highly effective way of staying on the bandwagon.

I'm not sure if I'm a terrible person for doing this, but whenever I feel the urge to smoke, I keep an eye out for stories related to terrible illnesses that are commonly associated with smoking. 

Even when I'm not actively searching, I always seem to run into posts about how a cancer diagnosis has essentially upended someone's life. 

I don't read too much into any individual situation - because I have no idea whether it's related to tobacco-use or not. But I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge by now that smoking is *surprise* not good for you - and greatly increases your risk of getting a life-threatening illness. 

The stories are heartwrenching - especially when it comes from someone around my age (~early 20s). It also really strikes home for me because my own mother was diagnoses with early-ish stage breast cancer not too long ago.

A lot of these people just got unlucky and have never touched a cigarette in their life. It could happen to me. It could happen to you. It could happen to anyone. 

So when I think about how much I myself can do to lower (and possibly even eliminate) my risk for disease, it quickly becomes a no brainer that quitting is the way to go. I can take control of my health.

For me, stories of general improvements in health are sort of wishy-washy and nebulous. Sure, I guess I'll smell better and breathe better. But do I really care? I smelled and breathed just fine before I quit. 

It's the horror stories on the other side of the spectrum that help me stay off the smoke. The risk of smoking is real, and out of so many things you can't control in your life, quitting is something you can.

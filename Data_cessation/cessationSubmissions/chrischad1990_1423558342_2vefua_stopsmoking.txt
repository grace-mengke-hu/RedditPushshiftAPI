day 39 smoke free I am worried though.........

I am on day 39 smoke free and so far so good, only problem is I have also been alcohol free for 39 days and in the past when I drank I loved a smoke and would go through 25 cigs when drunk easily!! I was a 10-15 cig a day smoker however now I have quit I am worried about going out for a drink in case it triggers me to smoke!! please help I am going crazy here and feel like I have no life and I am avoiding going out for a few drinks!!!!!

Day 2

Smoker for 17 years.  Tried quitting before, unsuccessfully obviously.  I'm on day 2.  I'm on Chantix, which I believe has helped me tremendously.  However, today, I feel like I'm going to bite someone's head off... more than once.  The smallest thing is setting me off, and I am usually a REALLY, REALLY, REALLY chill guy.  How do I get through today?  How do I make sure I don't fuck something up today, like a work relationship or something?

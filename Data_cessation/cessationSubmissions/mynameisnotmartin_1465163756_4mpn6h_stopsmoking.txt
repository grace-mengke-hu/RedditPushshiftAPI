Yesterday I smoked :(

Yesterday I had a few drags of one cigarette after 39 days of not smoking. The interesting thing was, I didn't enjoy it AT ALL! I tasted gross and chemically and I just generally wasn't a fan. I think this is a setback, but it has shown me what cigarettes actually taste like and allowed me to see past my addiction. Keep up the good work /r/stopsmoking  <3

500 Days!!!

Never thought I would get here... I've been nicotine free for 500 days. I'm not ready to say I've stopped for good yet, even if it feels like it; last time I was able to stop this long I restarted after 2 and a half year and I definitely don't want to do that again. So, I remain vigilant, while enjoying life so much more than before.

To all the peeps who recently stopped, I just want to say that it gets better and it's totally worth going through the rough patches that you'll encounter at the beginning. It's a journey, some days are easier than others, and the easy ones will outnumber the rough ones as you progress. Take the time once in a while to count of all the things that have changed in your body and in the way you think and feel since you've stopped smoking, it will motivate you to continue on this path.

Good folks of r/stopsmoking, right at this moment, we are non-smokers. Take this moment with you everywhere you go, and we shall remain smoke free.

Cheers!! :)

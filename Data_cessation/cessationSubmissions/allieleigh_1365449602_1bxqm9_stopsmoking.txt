I need help...

So I started smoking when I was about 18 and working in a restaurant the summer between my freshman and sophomore year of college. No one working there was really allowed breaks with the exception of smokers. Me, being the clever deviant that I am, started to go out on "smoke breaks" with a pack of cigarettes I bought solely for this purpose. In retrospect, this is without a doubt the dumbest thing I've done in my 25 years on this planet. While I dont smoke more than a pack every other day, the fact remains that I still smoke. It smells terrible, it's expensive (even 2-3 packs per week adds up), my family hates it, my boyfriend hates it and I hate it. 
To top it all off, my father has been dealing with emphysema, congestive heart failure, kidney failure and bladder cancer. He was a smoker, too. My grandmother also smoked most of her life and she died from bladder cancer when I was a little girl. Despite the obvious warnings in my family history, here I am still smoking. 
I know I need to stop smoking now, but I feel powerless to quit. Any advice you could give would be great. I would love to stop smoking completely by my 26th birthday.

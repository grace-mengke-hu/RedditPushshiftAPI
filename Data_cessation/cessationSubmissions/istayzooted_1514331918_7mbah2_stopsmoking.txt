I need help/motivation to quit smoking cigarettes.

How did you guys /gals do it ..cold turkey ? How much has your life improved since? How long does it take for these stupid cravings to stop? Thanks.. I'm on my last cigarette .. thinking about going to the store .. then I started thinking they are getting way too expensive  (14.50 a pack )and I can feel them catching up to me now (7 year smoker).. really feeling guilty about it lately

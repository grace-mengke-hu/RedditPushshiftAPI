Doing alright...

Coming up on 2 weeks.  I haven't been keeping track and actually just checked into this sub so I could see where I was at.  Reset my flare after a slip up 13 days ago.  All in all I've smoked 1 out of the last 27 days.  I've been using the patch and stepping down quicker than their "recommended" plan (they're so expensive, I'm ready to start saving money now!)  I did 2 weeks on Step 1, just about done with 2 weeks on step 2, and I feel ready to move onto step 3 this weekend.  Cravings have been hit or miss but I've kept a steady supply of dum dum suckers and sugar free candies in my desk and in my car to keep my mouth busy (my male co-workers have a field day with that.)

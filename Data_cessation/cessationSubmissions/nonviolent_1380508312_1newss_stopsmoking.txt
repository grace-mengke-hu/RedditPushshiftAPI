It's been one whole year!

I completely forgot to post on my one year anniversary!  Wow.  I can't even begin to describe how amazing it feels to be free from that addiction.  As someone who smoked a pack a day for 14ish years, I thought I would be chained to cigarettes for the rest of my life but I did it!  I actually quit and I am no longer pulled by the unrelenting need to smoke.  I can honestly say that I will never return to that. 

If you are just starting out and struggling to let go of the addiction, know that you CAN do it and once you do you'll never look back!

Day 9, having a new kind of weird 'thing' making me nervous

Today I've been having these new kind of head games going on; they're not like cravings and they're not like triggers, and they're scaring me a little as they're persuasive. Bear with me as it's difficult to explain.

It's like I get comfortable, no triggers, no cravings, say I'm having my favorite whole bean coffee and watching a movie I've really wanted to watch for a while. Normally your brain might think you know what would go great here, toast, ice cream, extra cushions, lying on the sofa blah, blah, but my brain goes cigarette. Then it blows up into a massive craving. It's been happening all day. 

Is it because it's Saturday or something? Is it because I'm relaxing and I'm off guard?

It feels weird to be in control..

I'm 20, and I've been smoking for 4-5 years now. Not a day that I don't have a cigarette in my mouth. My head is kinda "heavy" all the time. But I stopped smoking for like a day or so, and my mind is clear. Not heavy anymore. I have more control of my head now. But this level of control is a little bit intimidating to me. My head used to be "heavy" all the time. And now it's clear, too clear. I'm not freaking out but this feeling is weird. It's great but it's weird..

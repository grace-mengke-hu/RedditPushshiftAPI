Drinking After Quitting

Hey guys,

So tonight, 8 days after quitting, I am going out drinking with my friends (none of whom smoke btw).

Before when I've quit it got ruined by drinking on Day 3 or 4, but because I've been nicotine free longer I think I'll be okay. I'm not planning on going too hard, and my mates are all aware that I've quit.

Just wondering if any long term quitters/anyone has any advice for me, or even just words of encouragement, or ways to enjoy drinking without the cigarette that I am used to having in conjunction.

Cheers guys, hope you're all going strong!

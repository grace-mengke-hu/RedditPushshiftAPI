Day 2 no smoking; any advice or words of encouragement?

I'm a 22 yr old guy from the UK, and have decided i'm going to stop before i do any lasting damage. I'm using Patches and supplementing it with an inhalor (for when i'd normally have a ciggarette break). I'm really excited about feeling the benefits, but could use some wise words/ encouragement :)

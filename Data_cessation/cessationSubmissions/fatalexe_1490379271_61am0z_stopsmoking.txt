5 years later, I can't start back even if I wanted.

Five years after quitting smoking it is hard to remember what it was like when I was still smoking, even less wanting to quit. Over the past five years I've made a mistake or two.  Been drunk and taken a single puff from some one's cigarette. Ended up regretting how even just one puff made me think about smoking again so much more than I did before, like a whole year of dedication to not starting up again went out the window.  I don't like how starting smoking again has turned into a joke for me.  Still sigh longingly at the tobacco shelf in convenience stores, remember my favorite brands and reminisce about the good old days of smoking at restaurants and bars.  So many times I've wanted to ask for a pack at the grocery store checkout, even bought one once.  But I just can't seem to make myself light up again.  It was too damn hard to quit.  Just couldn't put myself through all that again. Every day has its own challenges.  Stopping smoking was one of the hardest things I've ever done.  It took me countless tries to make it out the other side finally. All I know is no matter how much I want to, taking that first puff just isn't worth it. If I can get through today without it then that is all that really matters. Just like that first day I decided not to smoke.

Day 5 (well, technically day 6) update.

So far, this has been pretty easy for me. Even with all of my sinus problems, I can actually smell spring! I thought something was wrong with me a couple of days ago because I was smelling these rich smells I haven't noticed in a LONG time. I have been smoking almost constantly for 8 years now (I started at quite the young age of 12). 

  I had a dream two nights ago that I had stepped outside on the balcony for a midnight smoke. Even in my dream, I remember "shaking off" the feeling and telling myself I wasn't supposed to be smoking, and that it was disgusting and stinky.  My husband is still smoking (he is convinced he can't quit), and I can definitely smell it on his breath and on his skin/clothes/hair when he comes in from a smoke. It turns my stomach, and all I can think is "Did I smell like that to everyone else??", and I cringe when I realize that I did.  

  Just my little rambling post about nothing. I'm proud of myself so far, and I hope things continue to go as smoothly as these six days have. Thanks for reading my ramble!

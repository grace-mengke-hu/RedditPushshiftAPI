Help me stop smoking

Ok I will try and make this short. I’m just new to reddit and finished the last of my tobacco just now. Telling myself “ok I can do this” I’m overweight and only 5ft and obviously being overweight isn’t healthy so smoking isn’t helping my health either. My problem is I enjoy a cigarettes. A 30g pouch of tobacco lasts me 5-7 days. I only started smoking after my daughter was born. So been smoking for 2 years my partner warned me it would get worse I started with 1-2 a day and now smoke 10-12 a day. So not been smoking long I also smoke really quickly because I smoke outside so I feel rushed when I smoke. I enjoy that quick 3-5 minute break. So that’s a problem it’s sort of a “breath of fresh air for me. But I want to stop, I cough a lot I’m wheezy and I’ve always been overweight but usually been quite fit and active but starting to struggle. I also don’t want my daughter to see me smoking and I don’t like her being around smokers which is why I choose not to smoke in the house.  I have a really addictive type of personality so if I start something it’s hard for me to stop. Just need ideas to help. My grandmother passed away from Problems with smoking which you would think would put me off. I tried smoking less a day which only works temporarily and then I have an awful day and back to smoking my usual amount. Tried to not make this long but basically want people to tell me the best tips and tricks that help them overcome the first hurdle (I don’t want to vape tried it and I cough more and get headaches) any advice or statistics etc that I can keep in my journal to motivate me please. Thank you ❤️

I had a dream about a cigarette

It's day 3 for me. Last night I dreamed that I asked someone for a cigarette, but then I carried it around with me in my pocket thinking, "just in case I need it," and didn't actually smoke it. Anyone else dream about smoking after quitting? The last time I stopped smoking, I used to smoke in dreams from time to time and then wake up feeling guilty.

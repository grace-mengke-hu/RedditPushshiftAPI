Many thanks to users here.

Completed first month without a puff. Thanks for the ideas and motivation folks.
To those who are trying keep doing it no matter how many times you fail. 
I would advise to take small but concrete steps. I decided to go for one day without smoking and I tried for almost 4 months. But once I achieved that day I kept building on from there.
IMO leave all at once ( i mean try not to taper it because that's a trap, after few days you will again go back to pack a day).

Again many thanks

Okay, here we go...

I've been lurking in this sub for quite some time, and I've made a few attempts to stop smoking, but I've never made it 3 days in before without crumbling.  I feel confident enough to finally post here and grab that badge and be accountable for the decision I'm making.  

I already suffer from high anxiety and the increased anxiety so far has been the hardest to deal with.  I've noticed that yesterday it wasn't as bad as the day before, and I'm hoping that today will be even a little better. Someone please tell me that it'll get better...

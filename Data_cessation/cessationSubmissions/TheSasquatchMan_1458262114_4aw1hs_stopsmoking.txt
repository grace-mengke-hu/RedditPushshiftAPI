Day 2

Having a very hard time with quitting smoking, I'm crying alot as well as feeling all feverish.  Things are getting better though, I went for a run today and my girlfriend is making me a special dinner and has been super supportive.  The withdrawal is much worse than I thought it would be, I've been through Delerium Tremens, and this compares.  Is there anything you guys reccomend to reduce the withdrawals, I hear hour 48 is the worst, and I really hope it is because Idk if I can do another day like this...

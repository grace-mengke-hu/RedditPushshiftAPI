Smoking is interfering with everything I do. I need to quit, but I feel like a big wimp. 

This is a rant more than anything. Any advice would be helpful. 

I feel like a big pussy because I have been using cigarettes as a crutch for so long. Feeling a little bored? Have a few cigarettes? Annoyed at your SO? A couple more. Stressed? Eh, a couple more will loosen me up. I use them as a reward and a way to deal with feelings. I am unable to smoke one at a time. I have the mentality "gotta smoke as much as I can when I can!" I am sure my car smells nasty. I'm used to it, of course. 

I hate smoking. I don't like how I smell. I hate the constant headache. My breath is nasty. I am embarrassed to smoke around friends. I will avoid going out with friends because I know I will want a cigarette. I sometimes avoid family functions because I know I won't be able to smoke for a couple hours. I will leave work early because I really want a cigarette, but don't want to have my coworkers know I smoke. 

How do I take the plunge? I'm scared. I hate but love smoking. They're my buddies, but they're big assholes most of the time. Looks like I will be purchasing Allen Carr's book tonight...

2 Days in

Hmm, well 2 days in and honestly I figured this would be a whole lot worse. Some people make it seem like you jittery and are incredibly irritable. But other then the odd craving every now and then which really do suck Im not that irritable and not very jittery. I actually had my morning coffee today and for the first time in a long time I could actually taste it fully and it was much better then how smokes taste.

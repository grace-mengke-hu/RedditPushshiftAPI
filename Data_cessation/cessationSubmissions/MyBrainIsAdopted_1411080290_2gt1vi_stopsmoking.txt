need help to stop craving at my job

Hello quitters,

I'm working at a large corporation with a 9-7 schedule. The amount of work that I do creates an enormous amount of stress.

I used to steam off my stress by smoking cigs, but since I quit last Monday, I do not know how to redirect my stress.
I get cranky and frustrated and I am afraid that i will start smoking again if I can't handle my job stress properly.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to redirect stress while having a desk job?

Please help!

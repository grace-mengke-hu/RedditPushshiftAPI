After a week... The smell.... I now understand all of my ex's and why they hated it

I've been around smokers the whole time. 

It's not the fresh cigarette smell. 


It's the stale, 5 minutes ago smell. 


Oh my Jesus. It's awful. This is what I smelled like for 16 years. 


That alone gave me more motivation. 

Today is a week!

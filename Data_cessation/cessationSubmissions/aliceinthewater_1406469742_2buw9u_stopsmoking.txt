That one day I pulled into 7-11

A few days ago I was running some errands, and I pulled into 7-11 without thinking. I looked down, full tank of gas, looked over, had a bottle of water, and then I realized. I was there to buy cigarettes. I quit smoking 3.5 years ago, but the mental part of it is still there for me. 

Anyone else have this?

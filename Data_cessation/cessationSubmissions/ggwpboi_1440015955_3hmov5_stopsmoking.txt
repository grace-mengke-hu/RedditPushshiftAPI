Quitting nicotine my way

So I'm a nicotine addict. I'm like a fucking heroin addict, need to quit this shit right now or it'll destroy my life. 
If I have money, I spend it on nicotine. If I don't have money, I'll ask to borrow some money so I can spend it on nicotine. 
Today, I used a cissor to cut my credit card in half (I'll get a new one from the bank for free, so it's no problem, but it'll take a couple of days). I bought food so that I can make it through the weekend. 

So wether I like it or not I just ended my nicotine addiction. 
Just wanted to get it on paper pretty much. I've been wanting to quit for a long long time. I think this is the only way for me.

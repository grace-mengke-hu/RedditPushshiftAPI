...Relapse

Well I just bought a pack and had one. My now ex gf and I just broke up and it finally ended after 2 months of indecisively trying to work it out. I'm not really sure as to how else I can release stress. I already workout daily, so that isn't much of an option. I don't know what to do, guys. What else can I do to relieve myself other than smoking? I had one cig and realized it wasn't what I wanted.   

My best friend is gone. And I'm at a loss, here.

What should my next steps be?

Finally ready to quit!

I just realized I have been smoking for almost 5 years and that was a depressing thought because when I started I never thought it would last this long. Lately it has been less satisfying and I end up feeling guilty afterwards. I am ashamed of the way it makes me smell, my teeth aren't as white, and I am becoming more worried about future health problems. I have a 1 year old daughter and I want to see her become a healthy old woman someday! I had no problem quitting while I was pregnant, but as soon as I could I started up again. I don't smoke a lot compared to other people, usually 4 or 5 cigarettes on a workday, sometimes less when I am at home. I work in a restaurant, which makes it hard to quit, because it's a high stress job with lots of other smokers and it's so nice to go out back with coworkers to decompress for a few minutes. I have tried to quit cold turkey, but as soon as I go to work, I can't resist taking a smoke break. I have been working on getting in the right mind frame, and I know I have all the right reasons to quit, it's just a matter of doing it. I'm hoping having this subreddit will help!

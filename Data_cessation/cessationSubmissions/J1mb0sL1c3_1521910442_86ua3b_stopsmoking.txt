Putting the vape down.

Lungs hurt, racing heartbeat, tired, depressed. I know I don’t feel normal. I had 18 months clean from nicotine  at one point and remember how great I felt. Vaping helped to get off smoking but I always knew this was the next step. I won’t use today if you won’t. Time to go read why quit.com. Just thought I would share. Thanks for letting me.

4th day coming up. Go me.

It feels good to put words down on my road to recovery.  It feels good to have in my hand the possibility of never having to go back to the status of smoker.  It feels good to be able to say these things to you all and still remain anonymous.  It feels good to know that certain people ie relatives coworkers will never know I smoked.  It feels good to know that I don't have to hide a dirty habit from people I respect.  It feels good to know that I have a lot of things to feel good about concerning this.  It feels good to know I'm not alone.  It feels good that maybe one other person will see this and be motivated to make a feel good list.  It feels good to have the absolute worst part behind me.  It feels good to honor my body in a higher regard for God.  It feels good to know I'm being more healthy, with better lungs, to run, farther, faster, and with less pain.  This just feels fucking awesome.  Go me.

Did anyone stop smoking for a significant other?

I hope this is the right place to ask this question. My boyfriend has been smoking for about 10 years. When we started dating he had quit for about 2 weeks and told me he didn't miss it. I naively believed him. (I am a non-smoker so I don't understand how hard it is) Well he soon started again. He lights up the first one within an hour of waking up in the morning. Being a smoker is a big part of his identity, and he also seems to love the act of rolling a cig. Also I think he has some fear of failure & possible weight gain with quitting.

At first I tried being very negative, like refusing to kiss if he had recently smoked, but as you can guess that did not work at all! I then tried pointing out the positive things that would happen if he quit, which also didn't work. I almost never mention it anymore but I still hate it, especially when his smoke blows onto me. I don't want to bother him about it all the time, but I also don't want to sit in angry silence while getting wafted with smoke.

Anyway the relationship is pretty serious at this point (almost 3 years now) so here's my question: is it a lost cause? Is there anything I can do to motivate him? I know he has to want to quit, but do I just have to wait years and years, and maybe he never wants to? He always says he wants to make me happy, and him quitting would make me sooooooo happy. Did pleasing your partner motivate anyone to quit or am I expecting too much?

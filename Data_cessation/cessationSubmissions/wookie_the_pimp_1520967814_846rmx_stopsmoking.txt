4 weeks today - no NRT used yesterday - I think I have this habit tamed.

Just wanted to share for those who don't feel like the cravings will ever subside, they will.  They are not gone completely, but they are not there yelling "Have a cigarette! Have a cigarette! Have a cigarette!" It is just a whisper now. "^Have ^a ^cigarette! ^^Have ^^a ^^cigarette! ^^^Have ^^^a ^^^cigarette! "

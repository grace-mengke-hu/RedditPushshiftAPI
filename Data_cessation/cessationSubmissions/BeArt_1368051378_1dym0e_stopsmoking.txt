Second day. Smell improved significantly! And my house stinks!!

Even after a couple of days after my last cigarette (wearing patches completely removed the cravings) I came home to find my house smelling of tabacco. 

What is the best way to remove the smell with as little effort as possible? I am going on a business trip next week, so I do not mind to have some really potent detergent in my appartment for 17 days... But which one?

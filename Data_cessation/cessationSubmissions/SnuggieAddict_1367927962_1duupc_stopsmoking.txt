Day 1 after Alan Carr's Seminar. I'm a nervous wreck.

So I went to the alan carr's seminar yesterday. It all made perfect sense. Cigarettes won't help or cure anything. They have no benefits. I do not "need" a smoke now, or ever. 
So there, I threw away my pack last night, and today, almost 24 in, the panic sets in. It's not a panic that says "I need a smoke" - because I know it won't help or subside the panic. It might lessen the panic for a few minutes but then kick me back into the addiction. It's panic of change. Panic of the process I'm going to go through. Panic of living without my death sticks. Panic of what's yet to come - What if i'll go crazy?
so, what can I do to chill out? I don't want to smoke. I don't even want to let the nicotine take control now. please help me.

Funny part: I've been smoking 10-15 a day. last month I've been down to 2-3 smokes a day. So why am I so scared if my daily nicotine dose is so low?
Arrgh!
I'm going to make myself a sandwich and take a nap. Please. Help.

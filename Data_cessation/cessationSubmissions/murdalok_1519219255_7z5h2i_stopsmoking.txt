One Year Smoke Free

2/19/2017 was a normal Sunday for me, at least so I thought. I had just finished the last cigarette in the pack, hoping I could find a stray pack somewhere so I didn't have to go to the store. I couldn't find any, so I put my shoes on and started walking down to the WaWa around the corner from my apartment. 

As I stood in the tobacco line, patiently waiting for the line to slowly move forward something snapped in my mind. What was I buying these for? What is it doing to my health? What am I wasting my money on?

You see I had been diagnosed with severe hypertension months earlier. My doctor urged me to quit as continuing to smoke could greatly increase my risk of stroke. But I was stubborn, and noting my doctor said, or how many times my girlfriend cried and begged me to quit, I still smoked. Because I didn't want to stop. I was selfish and scared.

But something happened in that WaWa line on 2/19/2017. I finally wanted to stop. I did, me , myself. I walked out of the store empty-handed and never looked back. 

I smoked my last cigarette on 2/19/2017. Every day is a challenge. It's still scary when I tell myself I can never smoke again, but I know I can do it. And so can you.

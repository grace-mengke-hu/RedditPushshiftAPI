Day one

I've noticed several posts on day one of quitting or even the first work and I don't mean to flood with these, but here is mine. I was setting a quit date for thanksgiving, but I've decided to quit right now. I just finished my last cigarette only minutes ago but I'm just looking for some words of advice for myself. As well as if anyone has any advice I could give to my girlfriend to help me through this. Thank you!

I just relapsed

Hey guys. I quit vaping 1 month and 14 days ago. However i was just sleeping over at a friends and everyones asleep and his vape was right there and i dont know what happened but i lost all self control and i hit it. I didnt get a buzz or anything. It just hurt my stomach and throat. But i feel so bad. I dont know why i did it. Its been a hard past 3 weeks and ive had to fight the urge everyday when i hang out with my friends who all vape. I had to get this off my chest and hopefully i can stay sober this time around.

Here we go! (Again)

Hey, guys.

I've posted a few times about quitting but it's now really time.
Had some cigarettes yesterday and two drinks with my brother and I was having heart palpitations last night that honestly were quite scary.

I just had a cigarette and felt my heart again and it's seriously time. I'm sick and tired of feeling this way and letting myself and my wife down with false promises.

Could really use some support today in my mission for better health.
Reset my badge and my quit smoking app.

Thanks for reading.

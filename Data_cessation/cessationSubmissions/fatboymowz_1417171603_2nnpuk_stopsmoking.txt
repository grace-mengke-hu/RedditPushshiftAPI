Quit 3 days ago, would appreciate help and guidance.

Hey everyone! So I decided it was time to quit after 6 months of heavy smoking following some traumatic events in my life. I realise the trap of smoking and wanted to get out before I became super addicted and before it became more physically and mentally challenging to quit. I had my last cigarette around 11:45 pm Tuesday night and it is now 9:50 pm Friday night, so I am nearing on almost 3 days without the devilish drug nicotine coursing through my body. 

I just wanted to ask for some help. I'm finding that its hard to concentrate, like I lose focus much more easily than when I was smoking / before I was smoking compared to this period now. Is this normal and just a side affect of the nicotine leaving my body and my mind recalibrating to that of a non-smokers? It's freaking me out a little bit! Also, I'm feeling really tired and mentally drained - is this normal?

Thanks for the read and any help would be much appreciated! 

Keep up the good work!

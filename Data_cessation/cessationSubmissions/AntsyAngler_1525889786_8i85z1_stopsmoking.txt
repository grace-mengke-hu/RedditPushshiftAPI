YouTube meditation recommendations for quitters?

Hi.  I'm looking for any leg up I can get with this.  I'm a chronic quitter.  I've been quitting for 20 years, sometimes making it one year, sometimes only a few weeks or days.  I'm back at it.  

Has anyone listened to any youtube meditations that they feel really helped them while quitting?  I've tried a couple but thought this sub might have advice.  Thanks.

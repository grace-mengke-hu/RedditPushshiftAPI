Day 24. Lied to my friends about feeling sick so I could avoid going to a concert. Lost that ability to feel OK in crowds.

Only been a smoker for 5ish years. That didn’t stop it from being my ultimate crutch. Almost every friend and relationship I’ve been in has come from smoke breaks outside bars and houses. Didn’t have that many friends before I did. Now I’m stuck with a bunch of friends who are all social smokers. Oh and my anxiety doubled last week to the point I thought I was having a heart attack.

I’ve stopped and I mean it this time, but I don’t know if I want it.

Just a rant at this point.

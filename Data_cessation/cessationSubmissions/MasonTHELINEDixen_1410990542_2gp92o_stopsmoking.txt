Quitting smoking with an addictive personality

I have tried everything, all the patches and gums and inhalers and e-cigarettes, and the longest I've gone without a cigarette has been maybe 16 hours in the last decade. I managed to limit my alcohol intake before that became a problem because that struck me as being far more serious a problem, but I can't do the same with smoking.

I've tried getting myself into every mental state possible before trying to quit, I've had trips to the doctors with scare tactics and charts and all of that. When I just put all of my tobacco in the bin, I ended up getting it back out, when I've made sure there is none in the house, I've gone out and bought more (when this happens, it's almost like I'm on autopilot and can't help myself).

Has anybody here been as far down the rabbit hole as me, and managed to get themselves out?

Just do it.

I had my last cigarette today at 8am est. 
I've been smoking for about 10 years now- off and on a lot. I've been reading this sub for months. It has helped in my decision.
I am doing this.
Here's to day one, friends. 

Edit: Day 2. It's been over a day since my last one. I'm still going strong. Thanks for the kind wishes and to everyone: good luck! You can do it!

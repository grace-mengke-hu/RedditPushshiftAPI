1 month update.

It's been 32 days since I had my last taste of nicotine.

**The good:**

* Sleep has improved, and I'm refreshed when I wake up
* Smoking only crosses my mind every couple of days
* Sense of smell has improved some
* Sense of taste has improved a lot. I'm tasting flavors I had forgotten about over the past 10 years.
* Mood swings are becoming less frequent

**The bad:**

* Still unnecessarily stressed out. The longer it's been since I've run, the more angry and depressed I get. I've let it go as far as 2 days without running, but I dropped everything and went for a jog when I caught myself thinking about putting the car next to me on the highway into the wall for having their brights on.
* I've gained some weight, even with the running. Trying to get snacking under control.
* Haven't noticed an increase in lung capacity
* Still often feeling shortness of breath
* Office recently lifted the on-campus smoking ban and built two smoking huts. One of them is in the parking garage, and the entire first floor of the garage smells like cigarettes.

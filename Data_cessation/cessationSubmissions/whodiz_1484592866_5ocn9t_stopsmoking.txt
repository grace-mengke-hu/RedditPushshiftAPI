Day 2 down!

Never felt this happy to be honest. I've never went a day without smoking in years. I'm sure some of you would find not smoking for a day easy but it was really trying for me. This sub has helped me a lot, thank you for this. 

As time pass, I realise how much of my life I changed just to accommodate to the fact that I smoke. When dining, picking an outdoor seat so I could smoke. When hanging out with smoker friends, picking an open space so we could smoke. When booking a hotel, the room got to have a balcony so I could smoke. Occasionally, I shower at work to get rid of the smell. These are just the bare minimum changes I made to make smoking more convenient for me. How silly of me to be honest. Now that I don't smoke, I don't really think of these. I don't have these unnecessary stress that I inflict on myself. I've never felt this much free. 

To those that are quitting, I hope that you have the same realisations as I did. Think of some things when being a smoker is REALLY inconvenient. 

Hindsight it's ok if this doesn't work for you, everybody is built differently so find something that works for you and stick with it!!

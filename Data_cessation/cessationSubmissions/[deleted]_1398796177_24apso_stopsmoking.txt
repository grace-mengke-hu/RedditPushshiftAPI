Anyone have trouble quitting nicorette?

I've been on the nicotine lozenges for about 3 years now. Haven't smoked more than a handful of cigarettes since, but I'm finding it hard to kick the lozenges. It's a bummer because I have anxiety issues and they really help with that; they really mellow me out sometimes. Anyone have any tips? I'd really like to quit wasting my money on this stuff.

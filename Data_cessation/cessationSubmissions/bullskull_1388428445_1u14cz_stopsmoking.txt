30 days smoke free!

Sorry it just feels really good to be able to say this. No plans on going back either. Still able to hang out with my friends that smoke with very little temptation. I do vape in these types of social settings but probably spend 1/4 of the time  vaping then I did with smoking cigs.  I can't stand the smell of cigs anymore, its actually offensive, and I cant believe I used to smoke cigs as often as i did (1 pack a day). Anyway I just want to say thanks to r/stopsmoking because you guys played a pretty big role in my most recent and most succesful attempt at quitting!

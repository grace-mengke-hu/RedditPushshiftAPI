I smoke 25 cigarettes a day and I want to stop but I need help - what advice do you have for me?

I've been smoking about 25 cigarettes a day for the past two years and I'm only 20...

I've tried to quit but I always cave in and smoke after just a few hours...

It feels like I need a cigarette in my hand constantly in order to enjoy my life and the things I do... Like without cigarettes I don't enjoy things half as much... Talking, driving, using the computer, taking a break, writing, reading (unless it's my Bible, I never smoke and read the Bible lol), listening to music, etc...

I feel like I need a constant form of escape and cigarettes are my go to form of this... 

I want to stop but life is so boring without cigarettes, I just need a replacement and some kind of breakthrough that'll convince me to put down my cigarette and never light up another one again...

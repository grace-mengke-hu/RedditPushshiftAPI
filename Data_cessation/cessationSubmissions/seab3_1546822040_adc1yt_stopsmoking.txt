16 days

And all it took was a trip to the hospital by ambulance with a fever of 105.5 F and uncontrollable shivering.
Pneumonia in both lungs and was down to 1/3 lung capacity.  Came on like a freight train. 

At home now, still struggling to keep my SO2 above 95, but I’m alive after a close call. 
Can’t imagine smoking ever again.

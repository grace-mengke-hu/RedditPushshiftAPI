A small victory

So I'm about 2 weeks in now. I was recently visiting family and my return flight home got canceled and naturally I flipped out. As I'm frantically searching for other flights, dozens of others are around me doing the same. Stress has always been a trigger for me and the people were smoking around me. It would have been all to easy to get one, but I stayed cool. I'm still upset about the flight because money, but hey, at least I didn't smoke.

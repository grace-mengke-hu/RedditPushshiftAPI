A week smoke free

Hello , hope you guys are doing well .I’m 22 , I have been smoking for 6 years (a heavy smoker unfortunately).I heard somewhere about this community and I immediately signed up for reddit and here I am reading  experiences and taking force to move on without smoking. It’s been a week and I didn’t have so much problems these days , I must say I was in lack of attention and felt without energy some days but I think I started to get better and I’m so convinced that I never ever gonna smoke again.

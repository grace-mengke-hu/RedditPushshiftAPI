The patch and nausea?

I have been using the patch for about a week. For the past 4-5 days I have been getting nausea toward nighttime. It's annoying. Nausea is my most hated symptom ever, worse than pain, malaise, etc. It's so uncomfortable and I hate it. 



But I also hate being a smoker lol. Cold turkey has failed many times so I wanted something different. I am already having a hard enough time not smoking and am afraid if I stop the patch I will start again (my husband is continuing to smoke until he starts a new job, so cigs are readily available). But the nausea is awful. Anyone else have nausea on the patch? Know how to beat it?

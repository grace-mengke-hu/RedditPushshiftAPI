Since I stopped smoking I've been eating way too many chocholate chip cookies

So I stopped just over a month ago, after a pack a day for 6 years. The first week was bad, the second was a bit better, and since then its been completely fine. I think about smoking maybe once or twice a week. All is good.

BUT!

I have been eating so many fucking chocholate chip cookies, and I just cant stop. Several packs a day, thousands of calories. Its bad. I get worse withdrawels from the fucking cookies than I ever got from cigs. Is this normal? Does it go away? Help me!

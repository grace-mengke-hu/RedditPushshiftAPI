20 hours since my last smoke...

I feel like crying... not for any reason, just because my body want to. Im not letting myself. It feels like it would be weak of me to do so. But i havent smoked today. I still have 4 smokes. Sitting in front of me. Testing my willpower. I kept them on purpose, to prove to myself that i have self-control. And i do. But its hard. Got a craving so intense a few minutes ago, my hands started shaking a bit. I wonder if i will sleep tonight...
Anyone have some distraction? A joke, or story(short), personal experience...

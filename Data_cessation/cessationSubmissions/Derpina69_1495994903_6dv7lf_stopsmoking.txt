I smoke in my dreams.

Does anyone else do this? In my dreams I either completely forget that I've quit, or I go for the "guilty pack". 

It makes the mornings a little harder to deal with as it's always fresh in the mind. 

I'm currently 10 days cig free and I wanna stay that way. But it sometimes feels so good to light up in my dreams :(. How have other people gotten over this bump?

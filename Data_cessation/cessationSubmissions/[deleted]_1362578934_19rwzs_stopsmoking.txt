Never just one?

Lately i have seen a ton of posts about just one being lethal to smokers habit's starting again.

Has anyone here occasionally smoked after giving up? What about cigars?

Expecting a shit load of down votes on this......but i am interested as i found allan carrs book doesnt work for me so i chose a different (but effective for me) route.

How do you guys deal with Physical Withdraw

Hey guys, I'm 19 years old, and I first started smoking at the age of 14. I quit until I turned 18, and have been smoking about a half a pack a day for a year and a half. I have come to the realization that smoking is the dumbest thing a human can do for their health and I want to quit. So yesterday I woke up at 700 am to head to class, I took a shower, made breakfast, and put my clothes on, you know the daily routine, but missing one step, my morning smoke. It wasn't that bad at first, I arrived at class at 8 and was able to function just fine through all my classes that day. When I got home I was angry... I cant explain it, I was just mad at the world, and I was stressed out about nothing. I felt this tightness in my chest and I knew what I was experiencing was withdraws. I ignored it for a while, but when I was doing my calculus homework I literally started yelling out loud because of a difficult problem. My roommate was actually concerned about me. I couldn't take it any more, I walked to the  store and bought me a pack of smokes. With the first puff the tightness in my chest immediately went away, and so did all of my stress. This is the first time I have every been physically addicted to something, it is scary. I can Ignore the cravings, but the anger, stress, and tightness in my chest, I am going to struggle with.

I am determined to quit, I didn't know it was going to involve Physical withdraw symptoms. I have a half a pack left, and I would like to know some ways to deal with the with draw symptoms. Thanks :)

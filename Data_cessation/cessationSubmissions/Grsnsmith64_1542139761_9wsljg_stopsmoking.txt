Trying for the last time

Hi ya’ll. New here. This is my first day (19 hrs) of quit. Been struggling with this gdamn addiction since I was 20. 54 now. I have moderate COPD now with Emphysema, Chronic Bronchitis and Sinusitis. Sick all the time and still have been smoking‼️. Got diagnosed a year ago and go in for annual lung CT Scan this Friday and nervous about it. I simply must quit if I want to live. Why isn’t my condition caused by cigarettes enough?? I’ve quit so many times my friends and family are sick of hearing about it so I don’t tell them. Been like a deadly secret full of shame.

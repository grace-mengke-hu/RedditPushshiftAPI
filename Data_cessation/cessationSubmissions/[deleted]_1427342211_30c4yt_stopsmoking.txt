How to deal with bloating and distention after quitting ?

It has been around 9 months since I have quit and I am seriously considering smoking again.  All that nicotine helped my digestion and now that my digestive system is on its own, I am bloated 24/7.  I look like a pregnant man, it is embarrassing and totally humiliating.  I eat clean, low sugar and no fast foods, lots of veggies and fruits.  I go to the gym 5 days a week and take probiotics and all kinds of tea (ginger, peppermint etc...)  I have tried everything and now my only hope is to go back to smoking to get rid of this problem.

Please help!

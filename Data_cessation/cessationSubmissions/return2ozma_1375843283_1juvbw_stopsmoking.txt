Helping my SO quit again, need advice.

My SO and his best friend made a pact to quit smoking together and had both stopped cold turkey for about 3 months. Then they both decided to smoke again together and have cut down smoking significantly but still smoke 3-4 cigs/day. How can I be an encourager to stop smoking again? I don't want to be a nag or annoying about it.

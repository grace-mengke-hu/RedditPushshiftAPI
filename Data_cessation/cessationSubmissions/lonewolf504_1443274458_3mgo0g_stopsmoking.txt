Feel like a failure...

I bummed a cig last night at the bar... had about 2/3 and threw the rest away because if I didn't finish it, that meant it didn't count as a whole cigarette. For about 2 months, I have been bumming puffs here and there while drinking on weekends, and last night I took it to the next level... I let myself down. Time to start over.

Today’s the day I set out on my new journey...

Couple weeks ago I decided it was time for me to quit due to so many reasons and I choose 12/18 to be my quit date and I’m actually really excited to fully quit smoking cigs. I don’t like them, especially the smell from them and don’t know why I even got myself into them. It’s been over a year of me smoking them and I usually can smoke between a couple cigs to half a pack or more in a day and last night I had my last cig. I’m hoping my vape and Juul will help me with NRT, but I’m not sure if I wanna continue using the juul also. Might wanna quit that too due to the nicotine salt. Just looking for some support and help through this because I know I can quit, my mom smoked 30+ years and quit so I believe I can do this!

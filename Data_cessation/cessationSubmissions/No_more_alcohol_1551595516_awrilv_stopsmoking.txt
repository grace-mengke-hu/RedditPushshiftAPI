Day 1

I'm irritated this afternoon. I'm eating lots of food tody, I'm also drinking cordial with water. Anything to not smoke! I have been active on here reading posts. I have over one month sober from alcohol, now I want to be tobacco free also, its so hard, I have tried to quit a few times! I know it only takes a week to feel a lot better , but its the thinking of smoking a cigarette. I plan going for a walk at sunset, which is soon. Breath in some fresh air and get through today!

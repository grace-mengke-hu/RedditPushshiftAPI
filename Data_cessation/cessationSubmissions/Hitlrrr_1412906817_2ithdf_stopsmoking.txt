I think it's time.

Every time I smoke a cigarette, I have this nagging reminder in the back of my mind telling me all the reasons I shouldn't be smoking. I decided to suffocate the life out of that voice. It's been about 12 hours since I smoked my last cigarette, and I'm wearing my first patch. The kids are about an inch away from death, but I think I'm mentally ready this time. Wish me luck!

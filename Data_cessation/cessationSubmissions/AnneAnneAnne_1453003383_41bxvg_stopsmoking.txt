When did secondhand smoke start smelling bad to you?

I was a smoker for 15-16 years before I stopped on January 1st. According to the info that I read online, by now the nicotine would have already left my body and that any craving that I might be having right now is "all in the mind."


But why is that whenever I go outside and smell someone smoking I still enjoy the secondhand smoke? (P.S. I live in the Philippines, almost every open area here or sidewalk is littered with smokers)

Help please, are there people here who have also quit but still find cigarette smoke inviting? I kinda feel like there's something wrong with me because reading the other posts in different topics here it seems like people find cigarette smell already disgusting only after a few days and yet here I am still enjoying it. When will I start to think that cigarette smell is disgusting?

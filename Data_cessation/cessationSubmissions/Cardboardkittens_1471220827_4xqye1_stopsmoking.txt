tomorrow is the day

For the past week I have tried and failed to quit. I go 20 hours with nothing then boom I cave. The bad thing is I will be having testing done at the end of the month. I have 15 days from tomorrow to quit and be free from nicotine. I just finished the Allen Carr book, and just wow. I know I can do this. I belive in myself.

My plan, starting at midnight:
- keep my hands busy. I have to clean my whole apartment anyways so I'm going to super scrub it to keep my hands and mind busy.
- eat healthier. Snacks will be fruits and veggies. Cut out junk.
-drink ONLY water.
- go to bed at a normal time and wake up in the morning.
-exercise for at least 2 hours a day.
- take vitamin c and e (or a multivitamin).
- throw away all smoking stuff (cigarettes, lighters, ashtrays etc)
-ask for help when needed. Either it's going toy husband or coming on here.
- when a craving hits, I'm going to set a timer for 10 minutes and do something I really have to focus on.


I have 15 days to detox my body. It's going to be hard but I can do this. I've heard of people who smoked longer and more than me doing it, so why can't i. I need to do this for something life changing to happen. I don't know what I'll do if I don't pass the test. I have 2 apps to help as well. I will be changing habits that I know are triggers for smoking as well. (For example, I always stop at this one rest stop to have a smoke. I'll skip it. Before bed I always do, I'm gonna do something else instead).

I have 15 days to detox. I have to do this. No more fucking off, no more excuses, no more killing myself. If I want things to change I have to make them. I have to, no one else. If I don't pass the test, it's my own fault.

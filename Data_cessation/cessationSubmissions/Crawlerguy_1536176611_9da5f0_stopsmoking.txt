1st time quitter,after smoking for 30 years

havent smoked this month,so proud of myself for achieving this,my smoke free app told me to visit this subreddit so here i am.every day i tell myself that i made it yesterday,so today should be easier.it kinda worked for me for the past 5 days.
question: how long does it take before you really break the habbit?

10 year smoker, 5 days quit.

I've had numerous failed attempts to quit but this one feels like it's working. The cravings suck, but whenever I want to smoke I just tell myself: I'm glad I don't have to smoke anymore. 

It seems to help. Now its just a matter of renormalizing a life without nicotine.

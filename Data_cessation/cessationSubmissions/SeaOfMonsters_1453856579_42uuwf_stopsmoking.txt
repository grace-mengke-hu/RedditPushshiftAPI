Smoking dreams

I'm still getting them more than 2 years since quitting! The one I had last night was so realistic I remember thinking that I needed to reset my badge! I was confused and couldn't figure out if I had really smoked or not for a few minutes upon waking. How many long term quitters still get smoking dreams?

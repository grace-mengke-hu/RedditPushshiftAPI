Im going to quit smoking cigarettes.

More than that though i plan on dropping weed and beer as well. I have been a smoker for about 7 years now and equally for weed. Im not much of a drinker so im not too worried about that but over all im stressed even thinking about quitting. Can anyone offer words of advice? This is day 1.

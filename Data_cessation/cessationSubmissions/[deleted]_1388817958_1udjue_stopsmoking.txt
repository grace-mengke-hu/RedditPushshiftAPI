3 days in and could use some advice

So, the first 2 days were not too bad. But tonight I had real bad cravings because I was around my friends drinking and they were smoking. I really wanted a cigarette, but not the craving way of the past 2 days. It was more like when your hungry and you want to eat good food. I was drinking and I wanted to smoke a cigarette. Does this feeling ever stop? Or every time I drink will I always want a cigarette?

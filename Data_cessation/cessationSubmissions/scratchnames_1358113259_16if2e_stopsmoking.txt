14 year smoker; now on 4th day sobriety (14 year alcoholic) - wants to quit smoking... just read Allan Carr's book today and had a few extra questions.

Hi everyone - so I'm in my mid-30's now... on my 4th day of sobriety from over a 14 year binge drinking spree, and /r/stopdrinking has been fantastic! 

I was thinking over the past few days that while I am practicing and learning on how to curb my alcoholism, I might as well stop smoking - it's been a little over 14 years (similar to when I started drinking) now; at nearly a pack to 2 packs (on binge drink sessions) per day. 

I just finished reading Allan Carr's book, and luckily I only had one more cigarette in the box right before the last few pages - I was about to make the drive to the gas station for another run, **but,** I think I'll just stay inside now...

I know I might be getting a bit of brain fog/crankiness and fatigue in the upcoming days and weeks, and they'll eventually go away - how long and how to reduce the effects?

* would like to hold off from nicotine substitutes... not too sure on using cinnamon sticks/toothpicks/regular chewing gum - hear these are helpful, but Carr's book did briefly mention on substituting (other oral fixations/learned gestures) for another albeit harmless to health physically.

* besides exercise (which I am slowly doing with for the sobriety), ***can you maybe fill me in on ways to minimize my loss of focus/concentration ?*** I don't consume much caffeine (e.g. cups of coffee) apart from some black tea a few times a day.

* other thoughts on fatigue/sleep and mood changes that I could consider to help dampen the nicotine withdrawal effects?

* anything else that you might think would help for me to consider,would be appreciated - open to listening...

Thanks everyone!

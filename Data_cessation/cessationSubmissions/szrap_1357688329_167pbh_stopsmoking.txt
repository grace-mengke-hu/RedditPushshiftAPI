Smoke free for just over a month

So I just found out about this subreddit today and thought I'd share my experience so far.  

Been smoking a pack a day for the past 5 years and have tried to quit a bunch of times to no avail.  Finally decided to give it the kick over the winter break from school.  Tried going cold turkey and realized "Holy crap everything I do is associated with smoking".  This was the hard part for me, every aspect of my life was regimented around having cigarettes. Driving, eating, anytime I went outside, I divided my practice time with them (musician), band practice (3 other members smoke heavily), gigging, etc.  Was gonna need some help.

Went out and got the patch.  Man, did that help.  I've been able to go about my daily life not smoking, hang out with people who smoke like chimneys and not feel stressed.  In fact today while at school I realized I had just walked out the door without putting the patch on this morning.  This realization of course had to happen while I was outside with my friend while he was having a cigarette.  To my surprise, minor craving but easily dealt with.

Its been just over a month now and feeling great!

BTW how do I get one of those neat little stars?  I feel like seeing that number rise everyday is going to be a really nice mental high five.

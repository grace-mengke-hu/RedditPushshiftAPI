Day 6, holding strong.

Been smoking for 10 years, this has been my first real attempt at quitting and am still holding strong. 

I am not one for personal posts, but felt like venting. My friends are all smokers/drinkers and despite their own personal addictions, they have been greatly supportive. Alcohol was a usual trigger for me and gave that up as well.

I am so happy to be rid of this terrible drug of nicotine, alcohol and smoke once and for all which we all at some point used as a crutch. Growing up as a punk in the DC scene, music such as Minor Threat, Government Issue etc. Has helped me identify why i do not need toxins to enjoy life.(Despite the occasional relapse)

We are all human beings and lets all work for something positive: [Lets all take time to think](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNcDC8wJiRE)

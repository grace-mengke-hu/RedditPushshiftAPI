I want to stop

I've been trying to stop smoking for a long time.. I've failed alot times.. I stopped but the thing is i start again because if someone offers me a cigarette I don't reject it. Idk how to stop. I told my friends that I stopped and then they laugh it off and tell na ur not and they're right. I really don't know how to stop, I'm tired of this shit.. There's no high or anything, it's just smoke.. I'm so fucking weak tbh that I can't stop.. Idk what to do...how do I stop this. Please give me some tips.. How do I stop the fucking craving for cigarettes?.. I fucking hate it.. Like I don't see the point why the fuck am I smoking even though I know there's no use.. I really need some help guys.. How did you stop? How did you overcome the cravings? How did you reject the cigs from someone?

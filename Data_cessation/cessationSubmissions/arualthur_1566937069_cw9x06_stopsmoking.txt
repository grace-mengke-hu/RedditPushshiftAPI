Has anyone else experienced...?

I'm nine days in and I feel bloated, my throat burns a bit (feels kind of acid reflux-ey) and I have zero appetite which I feel is kind of backwards to everything I've heard about quitting so far? Has anyone else experienced this/any of these side effects as Google doesn't seem to bring any results up..

Also having the weirdest dreams but I realise that's fairly normal - or at least I hope so!

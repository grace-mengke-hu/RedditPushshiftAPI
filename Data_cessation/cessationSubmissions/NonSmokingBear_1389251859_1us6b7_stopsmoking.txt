Just over 8 days in.....

.....and I have hit the 200 not smoked mark and have to say am feeling good. Still hey cravings on days I don't expect - guess it takes a while to really crack it?? However cravings get SOOOOOOO much easier to manage. Also worked out how much I will save this month yesterday and bought a brand new suit - crazy that money would have gone on smoking!!

Today is the day I finally quit!

Started smoking around 9 years ago and switched to an e-cig around 3 years ago to feel “healthier”.

Today I’ve finally accepted that it’s an addiction and that I don’t need these chemicals in my body to feel better. I have a great support network and I found this sub with all of your amazing posts and inspiring comments and I’ve decided that today is the day!

I’m not on any nicotine replacements and I’m going into this knowing that I’m going to feel down for a few days and that it’s gonna be hard and sometimes I’ll feel like I can’t take the stress, but I know it’ll be worth it in the end.

Thank you for reading this far and I’m sorry for the wall of text haha, wish me luck!

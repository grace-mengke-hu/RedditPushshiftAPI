Joining the club !

Hi guys !

It has been several weeks I was reading this sub to prepare myself...

Turning 30 y/o 2 months ago and having smoked for 17 years .... with several attempts including 2 times quitting for 1 year, this time is the good one !

The 1st week the afternoons were quite tough but surprisingly it's going pretty well by now. Much better than the previous attempts !

I have to admit that I use sometimes the afternoon my e-cig and the evening if I drink but regarding my progress, I am pretty confident that within 2 or 3 weeks, even if drinking I won't need it !

This time this is the good one !!!

PS:I still stick to my dear "green leaves", less than before but still almost one per day (without any tobacco).

I am planing to buy one vaporizer such as the Volcano to still be able to enjoy my THC time to time without smoking !

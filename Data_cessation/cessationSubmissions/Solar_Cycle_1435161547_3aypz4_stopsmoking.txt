Day 3, feel antsy, distracted, depressed.. but oddly no cravings

It could be more than just the cigs.. I put down a few glasses of wine a night and since stopping have gone cold turkey there.  All vices dropped like a hot rock.

I can take these feelings and in a way I deserve them.  This is my body finally getting a chance to purge itself of accumulated garbage.  My brain not having the quilt of alcohol wrapped around it at night.  There are consequences and I will bear these.

There's an existential restlessness that's hard to pin down.  I'm pacing around inside myself like a prisoner in a yard.  I want to clench my fists, tighten every muscle in my body and expel every bit of tobacco residue that still pollutes.  I want to double over and vomit out every useless glass of alcohol I've ever drank (it would take a long time!).  But then what?

Ugh.. well.. thanks for letting me vent.  I will get through this.  Obviously there a many forms of addiction and breaking some of them require us to adjust ourselves in ways beyond simply stopping intake.  Onward.

day 5 and insomnia continues

Day 5 and experiencing bad maintenance insomnia. I can fall asleep quite easily but wake up within 2-3 hours and am awake for 15mins-2 hours. Anybody experience the same? Any tips? 

I’ve been keeping a good, healthy diet with daily exercise and been intentional with my caffeine intake throughout the five days. Heavy-duty melatonin hasn’t helped for me.

Stop Smoking App Idea

I'm not very good at coding and making apps, but I was thinking it would be a great idea to add a visual representation of the amount of cigs not smoked in addition to all the other stats most cig quitting apps have. 

I'm not sure about y'all, but having a picture of a ashtray fill up with cig butts of those not smoked, moving all the way up to a bucket full of cig butts not smoked would help reinforce how disgusting cigs are, rather than just a number of the cigs not smoked.

Thoughts?

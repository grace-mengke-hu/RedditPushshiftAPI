That time AGAIN...

Hey guys, 

I've posted here in the past that I would stop, but I could't stop for more than a few days before re-starting smoking even more than before my attempt. 

Now, if it's not the biggest wake-up call of my life, i'm having chest pains like i've never got before. I know it's because of the cigarette: for years now i've sensed my heart having more trouble than in the past, i'm out of breath fast... 

I realized this evening that my heart is fragile and that cigarette will definitely kill me prematurely if I don't stop ASAP. 

I once thought that I didn't cared about my life, that it seemed to long anyway, but I don't wanna miss having kids and being a grandpa one day. Also, I want to grow old with my current gf, I love her so much. 

If you read this, please, for pete's sake, if you want to live long and definitely more healty than you are now, stop. Don't wait like me to have your heart screaming SOS.

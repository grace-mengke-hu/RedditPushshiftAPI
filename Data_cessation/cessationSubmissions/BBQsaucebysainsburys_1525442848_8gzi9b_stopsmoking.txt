Time to restart the clock (again)

Hello \- just posting for any tips and advice really.

Have just embarked on what I hope will be my third \(and final\) long\-term quit. After months of doing days on and off here and there I managed to get 19 days under my belt. Then one of my main triggers \(spending time away from home alone\) caught me out and I smoked. After that pack I did 25 days smoke\-free and thought I was there \- I managed to avoid smoking even during triggering situations. However, at a family wedding I was very drunk and ended up having one. The next day I thought "I didn't buy them, I don't want one right now, so maybe I'm fine" but a couple days later I realised my motivation was gone, and I smoked. I felt like when I was looking at my progress it was all a lie because of the one drunken cigarette. Now I'm here on day 1 again and hoping to get there on this quit. 

Wish me luck, and any unusual tips to avoid smoking during typical triggers would be greatly appreciated!

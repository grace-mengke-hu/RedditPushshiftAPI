3 days without a cigarette, and I'm struggling!

I've lost a bet with my SO and had to quit smoking. I've been wanting to quit for a long time (I'm 25 and been smoking for 10 years nonstop) but the bet have finally pushed me to actually try!
Well, it's been three days and I'm struggling. I would murder for a cigarette. Work is quiet on Sundays, so I'm just sat here in the kitchen, waiting for someone to order some food, and the only thing I can think of is cigarette.
Any tips how to get through this horrible period? What helped you to stop thinking about smoking.
Btw: I don't like vapes! I've tried but it's always led me back to a normal cigarette..

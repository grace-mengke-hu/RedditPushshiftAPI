SIXTY-SIX DAYS!

I am Just past the two month mark. Can’t believe it. I smoked for DECADES.  It was really affecting my health.  I had a chronic cough.  And was starting to get winded with physical activity.  The cough is GONE and tonight I walked a mile and didn’t get out of breath!   I’m getting my life back!  Thanks to everyone here who provided critical support on this journey.   If you’re reading this and think you can’t  quit, I’m telling you that you CAN!

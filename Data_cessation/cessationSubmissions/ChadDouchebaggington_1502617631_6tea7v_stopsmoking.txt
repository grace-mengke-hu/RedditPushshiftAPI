One year ago today, I made the best decision of my life.

I hit the 1 year mark!!!!!

I've been here since day 1. I'd like to say thank you to all of you people for supporting me through this journey. I never thought I'd get this far!

It gets easier, I promise! I can't even believe I used to smoke in the first place!!

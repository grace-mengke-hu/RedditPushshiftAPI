need advice on my hands/mouth

HIHO, im 21 and smoked for 9 years (with some breaks in between) and yesterday i quit again. Im not sure if i should call this a craving or not. I'm just confused on what to do with my hands/mouth when I'm at the places where i used to smoke at or when doing activities i heavily associate with smoking like drinking coffee for example. 
any advice on that? i use normal chewing gum to keep my mouth busy which works quite well but when it comes to my hands I'm kinda lost.

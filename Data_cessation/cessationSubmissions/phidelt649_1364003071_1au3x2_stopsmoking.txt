Six weeks without smoking. Now what? 

I know it is probably too early to declare myself "cured" of my addiction but I had a few questions. 

I quit, and I believe it will stick this time, because someone very close to me recently passed away from stage 4 lung cancer. Never even knew he had it. Came into work for a few days feeling like he had the "flu." Doctors found fluid on his lungs and declared that it would need to be drained via chest tube. During placement, they found a nodule and biopsied it. Turned out to be cancer. They gave him 6-18 months. He lasted 4. It really, truly, just happened faster than I ever could have imagined. I'm still sort of in shock about it. 

At any rate, I was wondering what former smokers should do medically once they quit? I'm aware of good diet and exercise. But is it possible to go the doctor and say "Hey, I'm a former smoker and I want a full work up, CXR, CT, MRI, whatever, to see if I have anything that looks precancerous/cancerous"? Or do I just have to wait until I'm symptomatic to find out if something is amiss. And I don't just mean cancer, anything really. I feel that I've become extremely paranoid since I quit. I started snoring out of nowhere and then I started envisioning a lump in my throat that would be cancer. 

I know it all seems silly, but I feel like this would be my luck: finally quit for longer than three days, fully committed, and end up with some awful disease in return. Am I just being paranoid? Is there anything medically I can actually do?

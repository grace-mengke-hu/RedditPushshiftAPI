Finally made it 1 week!

After a week, I am feeling really good about quitting this time. I know last time I quit, I had convinced myself I could always do occasional smoking and not form another habit (which is also why I think I failed).
  
Now though, I am ready to give it up and have accepted I will never be able to have just one. But I am feeling good! I have energy, my lungs feel great, and I only get one or two cravings a day. I am just hoping I avoid the depression and what not for the next little bit.

Smoking is too glamorized?

I've been wondering why is that people perceive smoking as 'cool'?
Is that because it has been glamorized by movies and good looking celebrities or do smoking appear in them because it is cool by default in our subconscious?

I know most of you now say that smoking is definitely not cool but I have witnessed it in my clubbing and bar days that a man smoking a cigarette in an elegant manner indeed increases his attractiveness in the opposite sex at least in that environment and in more younger population. Hell, even my gf has said that smoking is hot and she doesn't know why. Is it because it makes you look like a rebellious bad boy and that is also cool in big audience?

What do you think?

Just made a new dating profile and got to check the non-smoker box!

The best part was I did it without even thinking, and then did a double take. I really see myself as a non smoker now instead of a smoker who is quitting. Things feel different, like I've turned a corner and I'm never going back. 

Now I'm looking back, remembering the shame and anxiety of dating non smokers. That feeling of getting a little tipsy on the first or second date and neeeeeding a cigarette, of breaking down and lighting up knowing I was going to make kissing me a little gross for them. Knowing they were probably a bummed out that I was stinking  up their air supply, and possibly ruling me out as a serious romantic prospect because of my nasty habit. That shit ruled my life. I am so so happy to be free!

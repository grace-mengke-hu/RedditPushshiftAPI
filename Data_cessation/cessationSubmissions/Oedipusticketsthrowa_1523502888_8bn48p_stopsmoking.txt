100 days baby

I honestly feel less sure of myself as time passes. Quitting took a lot of conviction and it can be difficult to hold onto that for a long time. 

I don't have urges to smoke anymore. I got one the other day and it felt really foreign.

The thing that worked for me was picking a quit day like 6 months in advance. I really had time to come to terms with quitting. I was more excited than scared by the time it happened. 

I also smoked a TON of marijuana, which is a luxury some people are not afforded. 

I write this at a crowded local bar, knowing if I get cravings, I can smoke the joint in my backpack.

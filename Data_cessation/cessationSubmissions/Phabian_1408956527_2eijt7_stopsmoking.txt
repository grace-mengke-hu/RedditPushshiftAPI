20 days

It's been 20 days - I've survived 2 weddings, a75-year birthday celebration, 4 days of grilling on the beach with friends, 3 trips to the movies, a smoker-friend living with us and smoking inside for 4 days, 2 concerts and one marathon (just cheering for my friend) - so many triggers, but I survived.. I can do -anything- (now my biggest/last trigger is boredom at home in the evening)

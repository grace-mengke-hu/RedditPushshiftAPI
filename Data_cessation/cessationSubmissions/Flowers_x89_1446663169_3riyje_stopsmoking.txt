I dont smoke, but still crave PLEASE READ!

Hi there guys, never thought that I would seek online help for this but here I am. I am currently 18 years old and I am legally allowed to buy cigarettes if I wish to, however I do NOT smoke. 

I have this very strange feeling that I am craving one cigarette even though I dont smoke, please take notice that I have probably only smokedd >10 cigarettes in my whole life. 

Yesterday I honestly could not resist this weird urge, so I decided to try smoking and have ever since regretted it since I know it is wrong and a VERY stupid habit to pick up. The weirdest part of this probably is the fact that my parents dont smoke, and have not really been around smokers.

My question here is, does anyone know of any stories similar to this?

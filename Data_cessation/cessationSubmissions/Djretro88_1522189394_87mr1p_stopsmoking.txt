Day 6 quit using patches. Bit of advice needed.

Hi, I have been smoking for like 10 years+, quit cigarettes 2 or 3 years ago and switched to vaping. I loved it but I want to get rid of the nicotine addiction. I tried cold turkey several times but the dizziness gets the better of me by the end of day 2 and I just can't hack it.

I am currently using 21mg patches but they seem to run out at around 6pm so I put a fresh one on to see me through the night. Does anyone know how long it will be until one patch is enough and is it a bad thing that I am using 2 in one day? I feel like I am just feeding the addiction further rather than quitting if you know what I mean

I used to smoke 30 cigs a day, and then vaped 10ml 1.2mg liquid every 3 days or so (not sure what the equivalent is with cigarettes)

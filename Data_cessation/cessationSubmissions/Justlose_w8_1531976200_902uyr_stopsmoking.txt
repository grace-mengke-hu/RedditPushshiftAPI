Reached 7 days after more than a decade smoking!

It feels amazing, and it’s been the easiest time trying to quit so far. I’ve tried patches, e-cigs, cold turkey, and combos of the patch/e-cig but nothing has worked. 

I ordered a new vape and it’s seriously worked wonders(I don’t want to name it so I don’t advertise, but it rhymes with school and cool and has two u’s in the name). This thing is seriously awesome and I’ve barely had any cravings. On day 3 I was at my friend’s wedding and had a good amount to drink and still didn’t feel the need to smoke. I was even around a few people smoking. 

I don’t know why this thing worked so well, but I’m glad. I’m addicted to it now though, but that’s better than smoking and I can work on quitting nicotine in the future. 

I swear I’m not affiliated with that company, I just wanted to share how much it’s helped me get to 7 days cigarette free.

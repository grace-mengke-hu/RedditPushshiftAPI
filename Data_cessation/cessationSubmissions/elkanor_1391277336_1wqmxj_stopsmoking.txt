2 years later - THANK YOU ALL

I quit two years ago and created a reddit account specifically so I could post and follow here. I haven't had a cigarette since then. Lately its been tough and I've found myself craving nicotine. Grabbed some lozenges, which worked for me the first time, and occasionally will take a little nibble. But no inhale, no tar, no smoke, no nothing to clog up my lungs.

THANKS!

This subreddit really helped, especially that first month when my body was craving everything. I really appreciated this space. Thank you all :)

Sidenote: I also became active on reddit, slowly at first, now daily. Met tons of people on my  local subreddit who have become great friends. So, /r/stopsmoking is directly responsible for one healthy decision in my life and indirectly for another one. Big thanks!

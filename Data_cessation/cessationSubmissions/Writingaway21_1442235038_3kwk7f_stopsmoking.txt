Nicotine patch

Hey guys got a question. I haven't smoked in a while but I am still on the patch due to it helping my adhd. I didn't know where else to ask this as I haven't seen anything on this yet. 

Anyways, can you reuse a nicotine patch? If so how many times? And will it become weaker? If it helps I use the 24 hour patch but take it off at night.

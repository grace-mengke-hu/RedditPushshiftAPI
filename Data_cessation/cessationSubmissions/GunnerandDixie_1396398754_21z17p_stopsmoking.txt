Am I crazy for wanting just one more?

My girlfriend kinda forced me into quitting really quickly. One day she told me I could buy and enjoy one last pack and at first I thought I would just ignore it and it would go away but she was persistent while I smoked that pack. Anyways, I ran out on saturday, and randomly started reading *EASYWAY*, and eventually she got me motivated to quit. The more I've read *EASYWAY* and *Don't Puff* the more I feel like the last cigarette was boring and I didn't enjoy it or pay attention. I think I was on the phone with an insurance agent and figured I would get more later. These books are convincing me to never smoke again EVER, but in trying to come around to never trying it again I'm kinda bummed that my last one was so unceremonious. Maybe I'm just withdrawing hard and making excuses, but I feel like I should have gone out in style smoking the perfect one, one last time. Please help its really messing with my head.

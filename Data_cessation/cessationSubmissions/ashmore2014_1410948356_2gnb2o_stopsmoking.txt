An ex-smoker, always a (potential) smoker?

I'm 2 weeks down the track of quitting and it's harder than first few days. For those who have quitted for a long time, are you always in high risk of going back to smoke? Are we always going to be potential smokers because we can be more tempted than people who have never smoked? Summing up, is there hope?! :)

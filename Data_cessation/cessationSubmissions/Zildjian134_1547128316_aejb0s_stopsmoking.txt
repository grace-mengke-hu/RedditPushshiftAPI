Sleep issues

Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'm quitting again. I had my last one a couple days ago. I read that the withdrawal can cause insomnia, but I've never had that issue before. Anyone else experience this? I laid down last night at 10:30 and didn't fall asleep until 5am and had to be at work by 7. Not a pleasant day.

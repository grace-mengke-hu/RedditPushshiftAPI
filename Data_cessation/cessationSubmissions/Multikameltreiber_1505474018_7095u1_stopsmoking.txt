To all that feel weak

I've been looking through posts on this subreddit and there's one thing that most of them have in common. 
People are saying that cigarettes smell bad, that they never ever would smoke a cigarette again not even for money and that they don't miss it at all.

For someone like me, who doesn't feel that way this was offputting at first. I felt like I was doing something wrong or wasn't ready yet. I first quit a couple of years back because my girlfriend wanted me to. Then after about 14 months we split and I started smoking again. Just because I remembered how fun it was at times. I recently quit a second time and I have not a single doubt I'm going to make it. It doesn't feel that hard because I'm thinking to myself "cigs aren't either just bad or just good, they're both, depending on the situation. And right now they are not something I want in my life. That may change, but it it may also not." Just saying they are the spawn of evil doesn't do anything for me and lots of others I've talked to about this. 
You miss the social aspect of having a smoke with friends or coworkers? That's alright man! You will eventually find a way to cope with it, but don't think there's something wrong with you for it or that you are too weak. Smoking isn't ALL bad, because not everything you associate with it is bad. 

What I want to say is: Don't blindly listen to others when they talk about their expiriences. Don't feel bad for taking a different approach. You got this, in the end you KNOW it's bad for you one way or another and that thought will prevail as along as you nourish it. :)

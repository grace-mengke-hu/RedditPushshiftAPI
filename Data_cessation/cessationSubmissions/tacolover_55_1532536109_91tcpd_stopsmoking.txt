I think it's time to kick the habit.

Hi guys!

So I've only really been smoking since January 2018. I did smoke back in 2011 but very casually and i would have cigarettes while i was drinking with friends in between. Well this year work got me super stressed and I have slowly gone from one pack a week to half a pack a day.

I did quit for 4 days since January this year and noticed there were no real withdrawal symptons. No headache or irritability. But man did I miss the habit of lighting up a cigarette on my commute into work. In the end the appeal of the habit won out. 

Now I want to seriously quit. I've been looking into vapes so I can still feed my habit of smoking while driving. Do you have any good recommendations? I hate the idea of getting a vape because the culture around them is incredibly douchey. But I genuinely want to ue it to stop smoking the cancer sticks. 

I plan on stopping everything completely eventually but I know myself and it takes a while to break a habit. I tried chewing gum while driving, chewing on a straw, etc. But it just wasnt doing it. As you can probably tell the main time i smoke is while driving. Which i do a lot and stops my anger at other drivers during traffic jama because I'll just chill and have a smoke.

Anyways, back to the main question of:

What is a good vape? I'm looking under $200 and ideally not one of those big bulky ones that just scream "IM A DOUCHEBAG" 

Thanks! :)

UCLA Nicotine Ban:

Ladies and gentlemen of /R/stop smoking, 

On April 22, 2013 UCLA will officially be going smoke free.  If any of you are from there, we can get stop smoking aids from the Ashe center.
   
As of this Monday, if you are a student here who smokes you will be asked to comply to the change of rules while on campus.  Initially it will be a verbal warning, (but housing will start writing you up for breaking the rules.

Because of this, most of my group of smoker friends have wheened themselves down to fewer cigs in preparation for the big day.

With that being said, we feel we are capable of meeting the school challange to quit, and would like to invite any students of UCLA to come up to the Patio at Delta Terrace April 21 10:00PM for one last official "smoke break"  people are invited to bring their dinner, laptops, as well as your cigs, e cigs, pipes, and such to welcome in change.

Lets make this unofficially official and say farewell to nicotine with your smoking buddies.

Just finished my last, tomorrow morning I quit!

Hey all!
My situation isn't nearly as bad as some, as I've only been smoking about 3 years, however while using YNAB earlier, the money I spend on smoking could go on much more useful things such as savings, or extra spending money. Not to mention all the health side affects!

I've finished my last, and from now on, I don't want to be called a "smoker". I'm joining you all on this journey and look forward to the next few months here! :)

I know this may get buried, but I'd appreciate it if anyone could stick by me as I do this - I'd love to be able to talk to you all, find out about your experiences and maybe have someone from time to time just checking how I'm doing. I don't talk to many people, so hopefully this sub can help... I'll be sure to do the same to other people!

Here we go!

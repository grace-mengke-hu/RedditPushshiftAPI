I'm 17 and having hard time quitting.

I'm aware of the fact that this subreddit's average age is older than 17 and that's why I'm here seeking out some help from you guys.

I started smoking about 3.5 months ago as a result of hanging out with "cool kids" in high school. I first smoked one or two cigarettes a day then it increased as time passed and as I started smoking more, I started enjoying it less. Today, I smoked about two packs (about 35-40 cigs) and I can feel the veins in my leg almost burning.

It has brought me nothing but coughing, bad smell and worries about my health (I like to imagine myself living a long, happy life) in return while taking all my lunch money away from me. It also causes a pretty hard headache but somehow I really am having a hard time quitting it. If you have any suggestions or any thing in general that would make me help quit smoking, please share it with me because I really am in need of some help. Thank you.

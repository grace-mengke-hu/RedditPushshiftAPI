So damn hard!

I've quit every day since the New Year. Sometimes with gusto, sometimes a little bit lacklustre. Its doing my head in, I think my best effort was 20 hours. I've avoided posting here, but have been on this sub for hours each day reading your successes and wanting to be one myself. I havent told anyone that I'm trying to quit, until now, as maybe I do need a bit of support. I've read EasyWay, I've signed on for support txt msgs, got the quit smoking app, and come to this forum. This is going to be the year that I ditch the witch. Actually, trying to give up drinking for a year too, as an experiment. Its a miserable experience to keep failing. But, in another way it's helped reveal my weakest times- first thing in the morning, and by about 8pm in the evening. I've realised the only way to get away from that morning cigarette, is to literally get away from it and head out the door for a walk/run. I've got a track that will keep me occupied for a hour, and I can extend that to 1.5 , something I might do to really kill that craving. The last one at night is a bit trickier, but I think I'll indulge in the longest shower ever, fluffiest jarmies, nice cup of herbal tea and curl up on the couch with a blanket. That's about another 1-1.5hrs covered, and hopefully the two will work together. I've reset my quit app for tomorrow morning, but am finishing my last cigarette now and hoping this time I am strong enough to make it happen. Its going to be a lazy day at home, as the weather isn't all that pleasant. All I am hoping is that I can post here tomorrow at this time and say "I did it! 24 hours"

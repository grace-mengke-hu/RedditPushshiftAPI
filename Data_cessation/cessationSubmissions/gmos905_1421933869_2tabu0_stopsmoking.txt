Forgot about this sub, just checking in to say keep going!

There is absolutely zero benefit to smoking. Not once in the last year and a bit have I felt I was missing something by being a non-smoker.

Hopefully you guys just starting out can remember that when you feel the craving. All that smoking does is rob you of pleasure, happiness, time and money. 

Good luck crew :).

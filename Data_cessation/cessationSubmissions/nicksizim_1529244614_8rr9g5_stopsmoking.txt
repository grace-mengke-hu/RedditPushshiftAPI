Quitters, i need to hear benefits from you.

I am a 25 years old male smoking a pack for 9 yrs. I am sick of it. I consider my bad habit as a milestone for my life. I quit lots of times but longest i gone is 12 days. I am smoking right now but 'i have to quit' idea wont let me do what i want. I got to quit first. That's my motivate. But i want to hear benefits from you guys. All of it. It really help me to set my mindset and wont cave again. Thanks in advence.

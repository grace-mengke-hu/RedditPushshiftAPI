Day 2 of the rest of my life.

24hrs after my last cigarette, not having one has made me realize a few things. My lungs feel like shit, I don't really need a cig as much as my body craved for one. Not downplaying this experience, currently fiending for a cig so bad I can taste it, but I'll get threw it. Next goal is this time tmrw 48hrs cigarette free.

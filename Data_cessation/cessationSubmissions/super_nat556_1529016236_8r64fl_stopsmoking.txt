Mental Health Troubles

I had my last cigarette last Tuesday (June 5th). I didn’t plan to quit, but I was out drinking with mates, and drunkenly poked my tongue out at the bathroom mirror and I hated what I saw. All the white crap on my tongue just made something click in my brain.

The weird thing is, I have no craving for a cigarette whatsoever. I don’t even want nicotine gum or a vape, as I know it’ll just send me backwards (albeit slightly). But the depression, insomnia and anxiety are utterly destroying me. I’m currently travelling across Canada, going to some amazing cities with so many interesting people to meet, and I just wanna lie in bed and watch Netflix. 

Has anyone got any tips on how to deal with this? I was out today in shorts in 12 degree weather and still cold sweating buckets, I just don’t know how to deal with this stress!

Tl;dr - giving up smoking has given me depression and anxiety symptoms + insomnia, anyone got advice?

Do nicotine patches give you a nicotine high?

Does the nicotine in patches come in as quick as a cigarette? Trying to quit, but I do get extremely moody without my cigs and I'm afraid of turning into a dick in the middle of a date. So I was wondering when you use a patch does it come in quick or is it more of an over time sort of effect that just keeps you from craving rather than give you the nicotine when you need it?

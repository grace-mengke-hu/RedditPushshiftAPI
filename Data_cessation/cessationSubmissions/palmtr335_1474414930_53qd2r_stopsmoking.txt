Has anyone ever used herbal alternatives to tobacco to wean off nicotine?

I smoke rollies (roll your own) and I bought a "no Nic" mix of passionflower, incarnata, nepeta etc (don't actually know of any of them except passionflower). I've been mixing it in with my tobacco and slowly adding less and less actual tobacco in my cigs. I'm hoping in the next few weeks to cut the tobacco out completely and when the nicotine is out of my system, work on stopping the habitual addiction.

Am I just prolonging the process? Has anyone tried this with success? I recreationally smoke weed as well, so I kinda wanted to "normalise" smoking without the intense nicotine cravings.

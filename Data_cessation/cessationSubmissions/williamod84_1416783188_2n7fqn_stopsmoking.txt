11 years smoking a pack a day. Tomorrow begins Day 1 as a non-smoker.

The longest I've ever gone without smoking a cigarette was two days when I tried to quit about four years ago. I just can't do it anymore. I hate it. I hate the smell. I hate the taste. I hate that I'm spending $40 a week on ash. I hate walking away from groups of people to have a smoke. 

I've taken a few steps to get ready for tomorrow. I would chain smoke on my commute to work so I cleaned my truck inside and out and haven't smoked in it for 4 days. I've gotten rid of my ash tray. I've done all my laundry and febreezed my whole apartment (even though I didn't smoke inside). I've bought gum and dum dums to deal with the oral fixations. 

My big problem is that I have no support group. I have no family, few friends who are all far away, I work in a city I moved to 3 months ago and don't really know anyone. I have to fucking quit. But I'm terrified I'll fall back into it again.

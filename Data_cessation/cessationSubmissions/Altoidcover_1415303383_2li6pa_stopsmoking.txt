Well, here I am on my third day one.

I'm 19. I started this January when I was 18. I smoked for a few months as self medication for my depression and eventually stopped in April. I made it to June before I broke and had just one. I stopped again, but I bought an e-cig yesterday (blu disposable) and smoked all of it in one day. Today I bought a pack of Marlboro Reds and smoked one before breaking down and crying like a damned child. I'm going to dump the rest, but I don't really know how to fight it. I know I don't have as strong an addiction as some, but damn it I feel pretty worthless at the moment. I figured I might as well try something like this subreddit.

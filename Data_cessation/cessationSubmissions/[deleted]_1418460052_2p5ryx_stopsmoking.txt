This too shall pass

I'm at 5 days.  The first two were alright, but I hit a wall on the 3rd day that was so bad that I was about to roll up the area rug and light it.  I would have failed if I weren't so pissed off at cigarettes.  I hate them too much to let them win.  I haven't cheated, even once.

It passed.  And it will pass again.  I refuse to fail.

health promotion project

Hi All!

I am doing a health promotion project for smoking cessation. I was wondering how ya'll have coped with quitting. If you don't mind sharing your strategies on how you coped with triggers and anything else you may have to share about how you managed to quit.

I want to know people's first hand experiences as these usually help to educate myself and others!

TIA!

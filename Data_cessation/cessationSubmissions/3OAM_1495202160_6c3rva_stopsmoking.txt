6 Months

Yesterday was my six month anniversary. I don't even think about it anymore. At a certain point, "I quit smoking" turns into "I'm a non-smoker."

I don't know when that switch happened in my brain, but I dig it. One of the best feelings and choices I've ever made. I owe it completely to the support of my friends, this sub, and the SmokeFree app.

I love you guys and for anyone in here struggling with it, be strong and keep fighting. Make it a game you play against yourself. Eventually you'll get so good at the game that you win it without even having to think about it.

I'm forever rooting for you all. 💪🏼💪🏼

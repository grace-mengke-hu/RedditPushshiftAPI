Mental Health and Smoking

Hey All,


Longtime lurker, first time poster. I want to start by saying that the comments in this community have been helpful to me in the past. Thank you for that. 


So I've been a pack-a-day smoker for ten years. Over the past year, I've tried to quit and failed I don't know how many times. Vaping seems to work for me. I can get to the month point using 3mg nicotine cartridges. For whatever reason, though, my mindset just totally goes to shit once I get there. I've had anxiety and depression all my life, and I know that cigarettes make that worse, but after a month smoke free, I turn into a totally different person.


It stops being, "you're going to die and you're a terrible person" and it starts being, "everyone and everything else is the reason that you are so miserable." I turn into a huge fucking prick, basically, and the negativity just becomes all consuming. So I broke after three weeks this time; I started smoking again four days ago just to see if that's what it was and I'm finally feeling somewhat normal.


I desperately want to quit and be a healthy, happy person, but if it means I'm going to fuck my life up in other ways, I'm not sure that it's worth it. I don't want to lose my fiance, for example, because I've convinced myself (erroneously) that she's the cause of all my problems. 


Does anyone here have experience dealing with this kind of thing?

Thanks in advance for your replies.

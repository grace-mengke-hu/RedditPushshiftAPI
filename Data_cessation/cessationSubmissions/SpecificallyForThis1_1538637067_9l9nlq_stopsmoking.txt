Relapse

So. If you didn’t believe in the ‘never take another puff’ rhetoric then you probably should. After my 21st birthday I was feeling some type of way and following getting incredibly intoxicated I decided that I wanted to feel anything but what had overcome me. I snuck one cigarette. Then another. And after two days - crazy that it wasn’t immediate - I bought a pack. I’m now on three weeks smoking after a 9 month cessation and it was a huge mistake. It was one of the only things I felt I had truly accomplished thus far. Here’s to another quit starting right now. Hope it’s a good one.

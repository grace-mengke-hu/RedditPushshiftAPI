This Will Be My Last Time Quitting

I've posted here before. I stopped for 30 days back in February. I don't drink anymore, which helps. I also am never taking Adderall again. I am studying without any meds. I feel good. Today is my 4th day smoke-free. I've smoked for 10 years. I've tried to quit many times. I've used lozenges, and cold turkey, neither worked. The doctor had me do this: take wellbutrin (150 XR), put on a patch (14mg), and take a Lozenge (2mg) whenever I get a craving. I only had cravings on day 2 of 4. I used two lozenges that day. So far, so good. If anyone has any words of wisdom, advice, or can help with motivation. Please, I need it. I really don't want to die of lung cancer, get a stroke, a heart-attack, or anything negative that goes along with this habit. Thanks ahead of time.

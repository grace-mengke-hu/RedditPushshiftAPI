6th try in a year 4 days now

I have been smoking for 37 years. I have been smoking cloves for the last 8 years   I started those because I hated the smell of cigarettes on my clothes.  WOW. They were great with wine.  I thought they were better guess what they SUCK  too!!

I quit last year on June 12th. I remember it well because that was the day of the Pulse Nightclub tragedy here in Orlando. I quit for 2 months and I forget why I started back but I found myself constantly trying to get back to that day where my lungs opened up.  That was a great feeling when you quit. I quit 5 more times since and am currently on the 6th time. 

This why I am here now. I went for physical Bullshit!!  Doctor sent me for cardio grams EKG test, Stress Test, and CT scans.  They found I have high cholesterol and that I may have some spots on my lungs that need to be checked. The doctor said I am one of the healthiest smokers he has seen. I exercise to smoke. Smoking is the cause for my Cholesterol and definitely the cause for the spots.  I am 51, 185 lbs and feel great. In great shape.  I have a 32 year old wife that is amazing and we are always doing something great. She doesn't smoke and waited until we were married to finally tell me this sucks and is a shitty habit. No one smokes anymore- TRUE!! I have to leave parties to go have a smoke.  Well I don't want to die and it has to go once and for all. 

Doctor says it takes an average of 7 times before it takes. I want it gone. 

Last note.  If every test comes back clear then I tell you I will never have another physical because they are truly scaring the shit out of me. 

Good luck to the rest of the quitters. 

JOKE:
I quit Cold Turkey once.  Then I decided to quit smoking. ðŸ˜€

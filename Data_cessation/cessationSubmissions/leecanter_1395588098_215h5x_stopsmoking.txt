Smoking Cessation Google Hangout

So I've been a frequent lurker/occasional poster in this sub (I've made a few quit attempts) and I realized something.

Everyone involved in this sub gives great advice, but reading text seems to take the humanity out of these things (at least for me) and face to face communication I feel will help a lot if people finally kick the sticks.

I attend college at the moment, and although they offer free nicotine patches they don't offer cessation meetings which I think is ridiculous.

So what I'm proposing is this sub start having google hangouts and have online smoking meetings! We can try to make it as anonymous as possible, I'm new to google hangouts so any advice would be appreciated. 

What does this sub think? Would anyone be interested?

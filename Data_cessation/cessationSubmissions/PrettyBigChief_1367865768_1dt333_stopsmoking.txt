Olfactory Time Machine

So, we all know that the olfactory sense is strongly tied to memory.

And quitting smoking has a drastic effect on improving your sense of smell. And that ain't no BS.

What they don't tell you, and I'm here to testify, is it's like stepping into a motherfucking time machine, at least as close as we can get to one for reals. Go back to when you started smoking and back even farther, and farther. And farther. I had no idea..

That is all, stay strong /r/stopsmoking

To those who quit with their SO's: did the dynamic of your relationship change? Did you fight harder?

I quit before my SO by about a month. Now that we're both not smoking, the tension can get kind of intense. Before, when we'd fight (which was very rarely), we would let things go quickly. The worst fights ended with a heart to heart over a cigarette. Bad feelings rarely persisted more than a day. Nowadays, we fight harder, more often, and things never feel truly resolved. This is something I expected for the first few weeks of each of our quits, but everything in our once perfect relationship still seems to be falling apart. If anything it's getting WORSE with time.


Did anyone else have a similar experience? Did you and your SO ever get over it? How? Any advice? I feel like my eight year relationship, which used to rarely have issues, is slowly going down the drain.

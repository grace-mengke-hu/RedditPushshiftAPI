Fucked up. Looking for new ideas.

Ok. I managed to go for a good long time, but I fucked up again in the fall of last year.

I've avoided this sub out of shame since then. I was trying to convince myself I didn't care, and that I was just going to be a smoker because, dammit, that's who I am.

I've removed my badge for the time being, and I'll start over once I manage to quit. I really am just out of ideas, though. I know I need to stop, for the good of my own health, for the good of my relationships, and so many other reasons. I have the most supportive boyfriend in the world who's not afraid to help me and call me out. But nothing I've tried in the past has "stuck."

There are a couple methods that have been super successful for people that I haven't tried yet. I've not tried NRT because a) it's expensive and b) I have an ego the size of a house that feels like it's cheating, for some reason. And I've not read Allen Carr's book that everyone seems to love because self-help books always strike me as the biggest, most insipid tripe, and I've read reviews on it that only enforce my cynicism.

I'm being open-minded now, though. Obviously nothing is working, so maybe there's something to it. I'm reaching out to you folks for help. Sell me on NRT, if it's worked for you. Sell me on Allen Carr, if he's helped you. I just need to stop. Please.

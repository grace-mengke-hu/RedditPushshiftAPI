Funk Checking In. Day 6, all is well.

I am trying to figure out what clicked in my brain so I can bottle it and give it to everyone for free. This is a cakewalk. I forgot to put on my patch this morning, and once today at work I kinda wanted something, but it was Cheetos.



This morning when I woke up at 0338, I was surprised at how awake I was and how good I felt by the time I got out of bed. STRANGE!



Keep it up everyone!

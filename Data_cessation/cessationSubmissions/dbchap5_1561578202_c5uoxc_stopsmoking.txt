Cold turkey

The idea of trying this route use to scare the shit out of me..
I thought I’d be a jerk, unable to cope at work, too stressed in general.. and to be fair in past attempts, that was the case.. 
I’ve been trying to quit using the patch for about a year.. a week ago I wanted to attempt quitting again, the thought of using the patch just made me angry (don’t discount its effectiveness, this is my particular experience, this time.. I quit in the past starting with the patch with great results..).
It made me angry this time because I felt like it was just me tricking myself.. 
Use the patch for a week, taper it off, don’t smoke for a couple days, up to a week.. then smoke again..
This had become a pattern for me.. gave me the dopamine hit of saying I’m quitting without fully wanting it and following through.
So this time, I just quit.. about a week ago (I haven’t even emphasized it day by day) I had a smoke before bed and woke up and just haven’t smoked.. haven’t even had a desire to.. I’m uninterested in it.
I wrote this that night too.. may be it helps someone else:

“No, I don’t want to be smoker guy.
I can rebel in so many other, better for myself ways.
It is a “fuck it” feeling, I enjoy from it.. how else can I get that feeling?
Through more rewarding avenues, that’s for certain.
And take its power away too, it’s actually just nicotine and marketing fooling me into believing lies, it’s been brainwashing, really.
I want to focus my time on way more rewarding activities.”

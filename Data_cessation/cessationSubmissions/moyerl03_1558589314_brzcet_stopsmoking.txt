Forgiveness

I’m still working on quitting, but it’s been a looooong time coming. I’ve smoked for about 10 years with a year quit somewhere in there. What I struggle with is forgiving myself for smoking all these years. Like I know I know better and also understand it’s an addiction but I feel like the unforgiveness keeps in a terrible cycle cause then I just beat myself up and say well why bother I’ve already ruined my body etc. anyone else feel this way? First time posting but it weighs heavy.

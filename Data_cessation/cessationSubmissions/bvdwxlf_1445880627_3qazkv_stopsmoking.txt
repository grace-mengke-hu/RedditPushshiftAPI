Open letter to myself a year ago.

Hey, it's me, well, you from the future.

I just want you to know that what you're about to do is probably the most important decision you've made yet, and it will change you for the better. I know, because 365 days from now it feels like someone's hit the reset button on life. Well, you did that.

You don't know yet, but quitting smoking is only the first link in the chain of life-changing events and shifts that will follow, that it enables. I would not be the man I am today, if it wasn't for the seemingly small but very precious action of you taking back the control that belongs to you.

You know it's going to be difficult, but you don't care.

You know it's going to hurt, but you don't care.

You know you're going to feel terrible for a long time, but you're still going to go through with it, you still want to do it, just for me. For that, I'm eternally greatful.

It's not going to be all bad, you know. It does get better the further you go. Just be careful, ok? Go now, and take the first step.

Signed, thankful, future you.

Very addicted, afraid I'll fuck up my job if I quit right now.

7+ years a smoker, 25+ cigs a day. You know how some people quit smoking and say "I barely felt the need to smoke anymore, it was just kicking a habit"? I'm not one of those - it's no habit, it's a straight up addiction. I will literally feel my lungs get itchy after 45 minutes without a ciggy, my hands get shaky, I get nervous like fuck. I wake up at 3 AM to take a piss and have a smoke while half-asleep. I smoke while taking a shit. I smoke mid-sex. I cut my meals halfway so I can have a smoke. My lungs could probably power a small train with all the coal I've accumulated over the years.

I would like a piece of info from an ex-smoker who was heavily addicted. My job is highly stressful and I'm required to brainstorm, come up with new ideas, make plans, organize my team and basically be well rested and at my mental peak 5 days a week. People on my workplace have been laid off because of performance drops before. 

I would like to drop these fucking shit sticks in the toilet tonight, but I'm afraid it will affect me enough for me to fuck my job up.

Be brutally honest, is quitting the right thing at this point and if yes, how do I minimize the withdrawal effects so I could be efficient at my job?

The path to self-improvement.

Last Year Around october I set on a path of self-improvement in every area of my life. If you don't like the bed you are sleeping on then it is your job to craft a new one. I was a mess, fat, no job, broke up with GF, living with parents. Over the course of this year I have a well paying job, live in my own apartment, have a new GF and multiple other women and can deadlift 140 KG. When I first started on this path I quit smoking and could manage 83 days. Now I feel myself slacking again and today I declare NO MORE. If you feel something dragging you down and logically understand that it harms you, there is absolutely no reason for you to hold on to it. That includes anything, your job, your relationships and your habbits. Smoking is a habbit that is really harming me, it makes me unproductive, wastes time, hamrs gains and overall indirectly harms all aspects of life by harming health. So Today I declare NO MORE SMOKING! I am writing this post as a reminder to myself for when times get tough and my bad habbits start knocking on the door again.

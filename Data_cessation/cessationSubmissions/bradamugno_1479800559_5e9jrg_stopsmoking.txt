Big Trigger coming my way!

Ok troops, I have a massive weekend of smoking torture heading my way. Like a runaway train there's no stopping it. I'm heading to a football cup final with all my old school friends this weekend. They all smoke and they will be staying at my place for the weekend. I really want to stay off smoking but I can't help thinking that the temptation with alcohol and celebration if we win could push me over the edge. I'm trying to think of a plan to deal with it but I'm struggling. Have any of you been in a similar situation and if so how did you successfully deal with it. I'm worried. Thanks.

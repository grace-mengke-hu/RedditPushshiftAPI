Tips on going off the patch?

My mailorder patches are delayed two days and I'm sick of them anyway and kinda feeling ready to go without them. So I'm trying today sans patch and seeing if I can just keep on going after that. 

 I was wearing the 7 mg patch for most of/part of the day for the past 2 weeks.
  
Any tips to get through what'll happen now? I'm not sure what to expect.  
  
This is not my first rodeo, so I know what nicotine withdrawal is like, but I haven't done it from the patch before, only cold turkey.  
  
Any tips/descriptions of what I might expect would be madly appreciated!  
  
  
Side note: I told myself on this quit that I could wear the patch as long as I wanted to as long as I didn't smoke. So if this ends up feeling risky I'm totally cool with just going back to patches. But I'm kinda just feeling tired of putting a thing on my arm every morning and wanna be free.  
  
Thanks!

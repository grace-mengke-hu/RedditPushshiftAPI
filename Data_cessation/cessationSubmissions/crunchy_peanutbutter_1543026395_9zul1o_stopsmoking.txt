Cravings got worse over time?

I've tried quitting 8-10 times. I've used patches, Chantix (varenicline), Wellbutrin (bupropion), running (I'm an avid distance runner), and even props/fake cigarettes.

Here's how things typically go:

1-15 days: a little weird, but manageable.

16-30 days: easy-peasy.

30-45: all the worst parts of cravings start to creep in. My temper gets shorter, anxiety dials up to 11, and I have all the typical signs of a craving.

45+ days: cravings are back in full force. Smoker's cough from hell. Run time is markedly worse than when I was smoking.


The longest I've gone is roughly six months, and the cravings didn't abate from the "45+ days" description. I'm 38, have been smoking around a pack of Marlboro reds a day for 21 years.

I know my biggest stumbling block is that I enjoy smoking. I also have piss-poor self control, so that doesn't help. I'll likely be cutting out alcohol on my next attempt, too.

Anyone seen this "reverse timeline" problem? Any suggestions? I truly want to quit, but you all know how the mental game goes. Any help's appreciated.

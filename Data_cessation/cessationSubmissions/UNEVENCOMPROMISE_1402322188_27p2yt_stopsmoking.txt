Day 6 but I need your guys help

Hi, I'm a first time poster but a longtime lurker here and for a long time I've been growing more and more dissatisfied with myself smoking, in the front of my mind I know how dirty it is, I feel it in my throat and lungs often. I've smoked 1-2 packs a week pretty regularly for about three and a half years and I feel it weighing my body down and how it taxes and wears down my mind but whenever I muster the willpower to stop it only takes a few days before I convince myself to have just that one and then the cycle repeats. Now I feel like I'm in a much more stable position with myself to quit but I struggle with my triggers like my girlfriend, who's been a steady smoker with me for almost a year now and my job at Starbucks. she's tends to smoke impulsively and Ill impulsively light one too, but that's not where I smoke the most. At work, struggling through an 8-10 hour shift, my ten minute breaks are the just enough time to go outside of that crazy store and smoke one, every time (I get 2-4ish breaks during these long shifts). Now  six days ago I got a sore throat/virus that has put me 6 days in without smoking and I want to keep this ball rolling, anything you brave lads have learned in all this time that you think would help, please, I'm all ears and I hope to stick around with you guys for a long while

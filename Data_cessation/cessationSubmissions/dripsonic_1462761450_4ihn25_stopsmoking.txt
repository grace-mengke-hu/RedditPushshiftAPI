On the last week of champix...what should I expect when I stop?

Title says most of it. I'd like to hear from someone who also has used this to quit smoking. I talked to my doctor about this before starting the program, and he seemed confident that there was no withdrawal or side effects from stopping the champix itself.  He did say that if I have a problem with cravings he could write me a script for another x weeks, but that doesn't really get to what I'm wondering about.  

At this point I'm not even thinking about smoking again, and cravings are generally a thing of the past (except for a handful of times I've posted on this sub and you wonderful people have given me support). But i am concerned on two points.  

1) Is champix masking any cravings i might be having?  Are the cravings going to come back/be stronger than what i was dealing with while on the medication?

2) My doctor really seemed unconcerned with any problems related to stopping champix.  Anyone have any unexpected side effects or withdrawal effects when going through this?

Thanks in advance
I really appreciate this sub and everything you all have helped me achieve.

Should I worry that I am NOT coughing?

I really tried to prepare for this quit and have been on here lurking for a month or so as well as a bunch of other websites. I quit 3 weeks ago after smoking a pack a day + for 33 years. :-(

I have read that once you quit, it is normal to be coughing up the junk for months. That it is your body's way of getting rid of the tar that has accumulated in your lungs over the years.

My cough was done in about 4 days. I can take a deep breath now and there is no cough at all. Should this worry me?

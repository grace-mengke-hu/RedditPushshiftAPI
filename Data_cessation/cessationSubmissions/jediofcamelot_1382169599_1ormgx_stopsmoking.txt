Just got through day five.

I'm feeling absolutely fantastic. No crazy withdrawal symptoms. I've been using nicotine lozenges at two-hour intervals and the cravings are manageable, and really not that unpleasant. I don't feel like the insane gollum-creature that I felt like the times I've tried quitting without using nicotine replacement. I noticed that there are are a ton of cold-turkey badasses on this subreddit. Much respect to you homies, I wish I had that kind of courage and will. But I don't, I know that I don't, and I'm not going to pretend I don't need the lozenges. I'm planning on using them for the twelve weeks listed in the directions. Anyone out there tried this before? I could use advice on how to slowly wean myself off nicotine. Thanks.

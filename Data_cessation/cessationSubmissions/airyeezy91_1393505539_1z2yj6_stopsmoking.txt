"It's never just one."

I've heard this a million times and I was wondering on your opinions of it?

I've always believed this but recently got really drunk and smoked 2 cigarettes. They were as good as I remember. Like exactly the same. Difference is, I wasn't quenching a withdrawal. I didn't have that moment of relief when I sparked up. Simply put, I experience a cigarette from the perspective of a non smoker. This really opened my eyes. Although both were positively delightful, they weren't any where near good enough to get readdicted, waste money, destroy my health and make me smell bad. It showed me just how much my addiction had been dragging me along and tricking me into believeing it was worth it. 

I was wanting a cigarette for a couple weeks before this and I can honestly say that smoking them reassured me that I made the right decision. I don't want to go back to smoking and I never will. I don't even have any desire to smoke when intoxicated. 

I just crossed the 6 month mark and won't be setting my badge. 194 days ago I quit smoking and I will never return. In fact I don't even think I've been on this sub in about 3 months. 

Has anyone had any similar experiences?

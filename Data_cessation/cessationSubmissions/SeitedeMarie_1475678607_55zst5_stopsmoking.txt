Withdrawal symptoms?

I think I may have accidentally started withdrawing from nicotine by suddenly cutting down from almost a pack a day to 2 a day. When I am at work or with friends who smoke I almost constantly have a cigarette in my hand when I'm not on a call. However, I have had the past two days off work and I've been so busy with things around the house I really didn't notice how little I had smoked until I totalled up my symptoms yesterday evening. Vivid nightmares, sleep disturbances, shaking hands, muscle cramps, headache, nausea or intense hunger, mood swings, general malaise.



The good thing about the symptoms is that it's a reminder that I am doing something good for myself - no pain no gain, right? The bad thing is that my most severe symptoms - sleep disturbance and nightmares - come at a time where I'm so busy I can't afford to lose any sleep. It feels like I am making up an excuse not to quit right now but I only had three hours of sleep yesterday and it really affected me. My job depends on me being sharp and well rested. I can't have my hands shaking if I'm doing an IV on someone. I'm going between crying because I'm so tired, angry and lashing out at people, to laughing and joking like there's nothing wrong. I am either hungrier than I have ever been before or nauseous to the point of dry heaving.



So what to do? Keep on 2 a day until the symptoms go away and my body adjusts? Bump it up to 3 cigarettes a day so the withdrawal isn't so severe? Go cold turkey and tough it out? Put quitting on the back shelf for now? God, I just want to be able to breathe again, I wish I had never started.

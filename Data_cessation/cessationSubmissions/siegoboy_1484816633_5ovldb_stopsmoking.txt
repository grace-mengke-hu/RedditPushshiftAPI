9 Days and Counting

This is the third time that I have quit in eighteen Months.

The first attempt was brutal, I suffered for weeks, I locked myself in my house, avoiding the outside world and anyone smoking...

After living like a recluse for about two months, I was ready to face the world and kept clean for about eight months.

Then I lit up again whilst drunk and one thing led to another which led to two packs a day.

I gave up again after this but only for a week or two, then cracked again whilst drunk.

On my current quit mission, I have also given u drinking, as a new years resolution, then ten days into the new year I gave up smoking.

It has been a breeze really, I exercise a lot and just the results after nine days of quitting is enough to keep me motivated. I have actually shaved off 43 seconds on my time per kilometer whilst running, approximately 10 kilometer run.

Apart from that, my sinuses have cleared up, my taste and small has returned and all numbness in limbs have disappeared.

I know that this time I won't return to the nasty habit as I have learned my lesson the hard way, there is no such thing as just a drag or just one cigarette.

Good luck to all of you going through the same process and those yet to start, you can do it!

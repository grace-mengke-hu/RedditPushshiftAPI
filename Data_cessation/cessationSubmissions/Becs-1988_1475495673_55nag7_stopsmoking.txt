E-cigs, any advice?

Okay, so I quit smoking about two months ago and used an e-cig which I came off after about 3 weeks, did really well then was completely and utterly stupid and decided to 'just have one' which obviously turned me into a full blown smoker again!

I HATE smoking, I hate the smell of it, the taste of it, the fact it gives me a cough and it costs so much money its unreal!

Anyway I have been stopped smoking now for 4 days and its going good, I never want to smoke again BUT I am using an e-cig. So my question is, how quickly should I be aiming to come off my e-cig? I started on a 12mg but dropped to a 6mg yesterday. The guy in the shop was trying to talk me into staying on a 12mg long term but I want to stop using the e-cig relatively quickly! I have got a nicotine free liquid as well so when would you guys recommend starting on that?

Thanks in advance and sorry for the ramble!

Today is day 2

I've made it to day 2!!!  So proud of myself...so fucking proud!!! I was grinning ear to ear on my walk to breaky this AM with the dog.  Seeing all the regulars hanging around, cig in mouth....it was like I was viewing from another world.  Fucking crazy.    

I watched a youtube video last night geared to help high performers...of visualization was part of the exercise.  The key distinction on this particular explanation was to visualize the hard parts...the tough times...the shit that sucks....this is really important, as running a marathon is a lot more than crossing the finish line with arms above and family/friends all around....there is a bit in the middle that truly does suck ass....So, that's what Ive done...I've visualized how bad it's going to suck when the cravings hit.  How bad I am going to satisfy the monster with a puff.  How easy and familiar it will be to cave in and go back to being a spineless bitch...but I'm not.  I am stronger than that.  And because I have visualized it and know it, I'll be ready for it.  I know its coming, sooner than later...but I'll be ready when it does.  

Fuck smoking.  I choose health and wellness.

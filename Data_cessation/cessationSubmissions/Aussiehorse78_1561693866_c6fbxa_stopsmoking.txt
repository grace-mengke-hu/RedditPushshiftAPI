Going strong but tips wanted

20 days now, started with champix but tossed them out as dreams and mood swings didn't sit right for me. Do vape flavours only i had from before to help with cravings. Not looking back and only forwards. Do crave most when things aren't going well but just gotta bite the bullet and power on.
Any tips/suggestions on how to kill mild cravings? 
Thanks for the support peeps

I need help to stop smoking.

Hi Reddit. I'm an obese person and I'm in the worst point in my life right now. I had to move out of the country where I lived and I'm in a rough spot. I want to quit because I don't feel well and I want to be healthy because I want to support my mom and my brother but I feel my addiction is dragging us down. Money is tight but I still find ways to buy packs.

I want to quit but I love it and I don't see a way out of it. Every day I picture myself going for a jog or breathing fresh air or whatever and tell myself I'm gonna quit but it's so hard and I never last. I'm 23 years old and I burn through 1 pack per day.

I don't have friends or anything because I'm on another country, so I don't have too much support; I'm also a very anxious person and I don't really drink or anything, my only vices are food and cigarettes, but I don't know what to do.

I already set my quit on leading a better life, I just don't know how.
Please help me, reddit? :)

We're making it easier to quit.

Hi guys/gals, we checked the rules to make sure we are not violating anything so here it goes.

We're a bunch of ex-smokers who happened to be involved in tech and like industries and we realized there aren't any solid resources to actually help you quit smoking in an innovative kind of way (that works).

So we created [QuitNow](http://quitnow.co) (currently in launch mode) but we anticipate to be fully operational in about a month. There is no money incentive for us (we've spent quite a bit actually), it's just a project to give back and share with the community.

Our goal is to disrupt the current norms surrounding tobacco use/cessation, and the tobacco industry in general but we need your help!

Head over to [QuitNow](http://quitnow.co) and signup!

Thank you!

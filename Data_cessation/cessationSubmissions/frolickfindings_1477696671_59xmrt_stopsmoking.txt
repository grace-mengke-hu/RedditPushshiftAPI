Badge on the way

I've stopped smoking, and am at 15 days today. I waited this long to make sure I was actually quitting.

One night, just before Midnight I smoked my last cigarette of a pack. Then the next day I kind of forgot to buy a new pack, then the next day realized I was going out of town for the weekend with my girlfriend and didn't really want to reek of smoke the whole time. 

Then that turned into over 2 weeks. I didn't really experience a lot of withdrawal symptoms, I was a relatively light smoker. This Halloween weekend is spooky though, and I know one of the bigger tests I've had so far. I'm posting to keep myself on the right track!

This sub is truly amazing.

Some things I've noticed:

1. My dick works. Like before I smoked, my dick worked fine, like pretty good. But DAMN THIS DICK IS LIKE A NEW DICK
2. NUMBER 1 IS A GOOD ENOUGH REASON
3. I still have a few friends who smoke my brand (Camel Crush), and the biggest thing I'm noticing is that the smoke smells completely different. I can hardly smell the menthol, and just smell the vaguely gross smell of the cigarette. 
4. I still want to smoke

At this point, I might as well just not smoke for the rest of my life, I mean, I'd only have to make it 15 days like 1500 more times to live a smokefree, relatively long life.

Here's to that.

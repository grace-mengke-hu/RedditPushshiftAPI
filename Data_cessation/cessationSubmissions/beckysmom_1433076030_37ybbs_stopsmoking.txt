I started running

I've NEVER been much of a runner.  I did it in HS because I had to for gym.  I'm not fast.  My best time on the mile was 8 minutes & change.  The girl w/ the pigeon toes beat me at the 50 yard dash.  

My last voluntary run was freshman year of college - my roommates convinced me to go with them to the fitness center where I completely overdid it.  I ran til my nose bled & my body was so sore I could barely move for the next week.  

I am too embarrassed to tell you how long ago that happened.  Just trust me - it's been a loooooong time - LOL!

So I started running on Friday, and really...  "Running" is an overstatement as I was walking 90% of the time as I was gasping for dear life after the 10% of running.

Why am I doing this if I don't like to run?  To get my body moving, my heart pumping, to change my mostly sedentary lifestyle.

My older daughter was a cross country runner & tried to convince me to run with her.  NOPE - never happened.  Now my  younger daughter is showing signs of interest in running & trying to convince me to run with her.  I blew the chance to do this with her sister...  

Anyway - did my 2nd run/walk this morning.  All the gasping/wheezing is a great motivator to be a nonsmoker!  LOL!

Didn't look at my flair this morning to check how many days I have under my belt...  But I will not smoke again.  I got this!

Thanks StopSmoking for the support. You have no idea how much I appreciate it.  :-)

I gave away my pack to a stranger

I was waiting for the bus and I wanted to light a cigarette and asked a stranger for a light. She gave me a light and asked me if I have a spare cig, so I said fuck it, have the whole pack and the cigarette I wanted to light. She thanked me and had a little chat too. 

I feel proud, but also kinda bad for that girl's health now ğŸ˜•

One step closer to quitting for good, I guess.

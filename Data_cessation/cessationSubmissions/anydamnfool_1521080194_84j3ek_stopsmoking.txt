Quitting smoking as a group: - First one who cracks has to buy everyone else a pack

Hey, just thought I'd share the above technique... Maybe some of you have tried it?

So far I've found it to be the most effective method for quitting smoking by far. Take four or more friends, have a big weekend out drinking or whatever, smoke as much as you want/can, and be aware that as soon as it's over, you're all quitting.

Whoever cracks first has to buy the others a pack of smokes, which costs them money, but more importantly means they have to watch their close friends all fail on the quit attempt which is an extremely painful thing to do. In my mind it's easy to hate ourselves enough to think it's okay to smoke, but the thought of causing my mates to start again is far, far worse than the joy any single cigarette could bring. 


That said be careful who you chose, last time I tried this it was going well, until my mate who's bipolar was manic and started smoking like crazy, which then meant his girlfriend did, then we all did. Still, it was going great while it lasted.. :D

Hopefully this might help someone, or if not I'd love to know if someone's tried it themselves already

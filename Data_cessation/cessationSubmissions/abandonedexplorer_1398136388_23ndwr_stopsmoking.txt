Stopped smoking about a year ago and now Im getting hooked again.

I dont think anyone is really interested in this, but I need to write this to try and remind myself that I really did change my life for the better, even though it's hard to remember what the benefits were.

I cant remember exactly when, but about a year ago I stopped smoking. After smoking for 8 years I had finally kicked the habbit. The first couple of months I literally felt like a huge burden had fallen off my back. I felt so good, my life really took a turn for the better, my sense of smell and taste came back and I found that my general mood was so much better. I started jogging, stretching, and picking up old unfinished projects. I first thought that the benefits of quitting wouldnt be so huge, but I came to realise that the nicotine had really messed with every aspect of my life. After 6 months I lost almost all the cravings and I was born again.

Now, I think all smokers know that after a couple of beers theres nothing like puffing a cig. Well that is my only problem, I love drinking and smoking. The cravings I have when I drink a couple of beers is a 100x worse than sober. I started to give myself a "break" by bumming a couple smokes from friends during a good night out. It didnt take very long to get into a routine of smoking a couple everytime I was drunk. I believe that small habit kept my body still in a very small nicotine hook, so when the time was right it was easier for me to start smoking again. 
And here I am. A couple of weeks ago I started giving myself a "break" on my new hard construction job by smoking a couple everyday on the site. 
And today after work, I was hit with the hardest cravings I have had in a long time, I smoked one and felt like all my worries washed away.
What the fuck am I doing?

What I've noticed over the past 2 days.

Now that I've actually made a super conscious decision to stop, here are a few things I've noticed over the past 2 days. 

1. My city stinks. Seriously. I used to always smell smoke off of me, but now, I smell the city, and near town, its all car exhausts, the haze, and cigarette smoke from smokers 

2. There are way more smokers than I thought over here. I smell them when they walk into the trains, or into a room. And I tend to gag at the smell, which has resulted in some really awkward stares. 

3. Food tastes great. I never realised what I was missing. 

I've felt the cravings every now and then, but I just think about the 3 reasons above and they fade away. I can't wait till I kick these cravings entirely.

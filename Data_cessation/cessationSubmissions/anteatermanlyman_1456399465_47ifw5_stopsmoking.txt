Lost to the monster

I was around a lot of smokers today. It's illegal to smoke 20 feet within a bus stop, but every bus stop I was at today had people smoking. It used to not be like this, I feel like more and more people are smoking again. Someone was talking about that a few days ago, cop just drove right past someone smoking at one.

Then, I got a discount in the mail for a MarkTen for a dollar. I know, cheap e cigarette, but I've been around smokers all day. Worst day for it to come in. Woke up with the worst craving because people were smoking outside, so I borrowed one. Howell, here's another patch. Went four days without a cigarette.

Stopped smoking since October last year.

I’m 54 and I have been smoking since I was 14 because I was the odd one out and wanted to fit in.

In the end I was smoking 40/50 cigarettes a day, my health was suffering and although I tried quitting multiple times in the past I thought nope this is it!

One thing I took away from a previous cessation on how to stop was I chose patches but I still got the craving and the nurse/advisor said then why don’t you top up with nicotine gum, inhaler or whatever and that’s when the light bulb moment happened for me. 

So I started off the first week with patches and topped up with a lozenges and then I did away with the patches and carried on with the lozenges, that helped me not to look for sweets/candy and I’m now into my 7th month.

If you feel like a craving is coming on, I found brushing my teeth helped a lot or colouring in one of those therapeutic adult colouring books.

Day 15, feeling a bit down, but still hanging on

Decided to quit for good, had a bump on the road, but now at day 15 and very glad I made it this far. I woke up with nostalgia for the feeling it once gave me. I know if I smoke it won't make me feel good at all, but there is this part of my brain that still tries to trick me by making me feel bad and wanting to feel that light-headed feeling. Sticking to coffee today... but it's the hardest day yet.

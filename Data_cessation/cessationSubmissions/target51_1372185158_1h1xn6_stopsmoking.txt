Having problems starting my new quit attempt.

Hi All, 
First of all a bit of back story. I've been a smoker since I was 15, my first quit attempt was aged 17 and I used prescribed patches but I barely managed a week. My second was aged 18 again with the patches and again barely a week since then I have used an e-cigarette to keep my smoking to a minimum. I now smoke 25g of tobacco per week and about 10 rollies a day. I'm just wondering if anyone has some sort of a plan, guide, advice or anything to help me dispose of this annoying habit? Because every time I think about quitting I end up smoking more than I normally would...

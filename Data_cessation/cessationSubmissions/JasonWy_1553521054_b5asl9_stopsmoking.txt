Couple Frustrations Over the Weekend from a Newly Quit Addict

Sorry if this is tl;dr but....

Today marks 1-week of my decision to quit smoking.  For a little background, I'm 45 years old and have been a pack-a-day smoker for 27 years.  As many others, I've tried and failed to quit time and time again.  What finally did it for me was the realization that I'm spending over $60 a week for smokes.  I just cannot justify that anymore, so I decided to quit for good.  

This was the first weekend I've gone smoke free in \[what seems like\] forever.  There have been some frustrations regarding triggers that I really need some help with.  

As mentioned, I've been a heavy smoker for 27 years.  After 27 years, do you know what triggers smoking?  EVERYTHING.  I have realized that I associate smoking with literally everything I do.  How do we re-program ourselves to know that we can still do the things in life we enjoy without the nicotine dependency we're accustomed to?

That's my struggle after week 1.  I've been "afraid" to do the things that I normally do on the weekends in fear of overwhelming triggers.  I did have one beer over the weekend when I would typically have..well...many more than 1.  

Any advice from the long-term quitters here how to face everyday life and re-programming ourselves to understand that it's ok to live without depending on nicotine?

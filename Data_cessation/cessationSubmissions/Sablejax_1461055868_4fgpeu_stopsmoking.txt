Sick with Bronchitis and Laryngitis. Help me get through this!

I have smoked for the past 10 years, gradually getting up to nearly a pack a day. I am 30/F. I am active, work out regularly, in great shape, but still have this secret shame. I try to hide it from everyone for as long as I can until I get caught or don't care because I want a cig so bad. My fiancé hates it, but tolerates it and tries to be as supportive as he can. He got sick with acute bronchitis and other than a cough you could barely tell he was sick. After one week I came down with it and I got a fever, chills,had to leave work early. I even coughed up blood on two occasions. My fever is gone but I had to go back to work tonight and I have absolutely no voice and my throat is super sore but I still want to smoke! ! I have a vape but I have never really gotten into it. I also missed getting to watch the Boston Marathon and volunteer because I was so sick.  I know I just need to stop now but every time I do after I wake up my mind immediately starts telling me to just grab a pack, just don't smoke them all, your fiancé will understand. Or he won't know because you aren't with him. How do I do this? I've read Allen carrs book and it lasts for a day or two and then I find an excuse.  I'm seeing a therapist on Thursday to help. Any other resources? Or Mantras? Any other secret female smokers? By this time next year I want to have a 365 badge and be posting my race report on r/advancedrunning

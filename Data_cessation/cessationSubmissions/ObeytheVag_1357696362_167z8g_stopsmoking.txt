Help with the RAGE!

Can any of you give me tips to help with the anger? I have stayed strong, even while smoking I was still running 4 miles in 33:52 (smoker for 6 years, fitness buff for 10) and I love that I'm not only getting faster, but can go longer at a pace. But once my boyfriend and I start fighting I completly fly off the handle, I almost want to leave to smoke, but at the same time I don't want to give up all my hard work obviously. I'm sure many of you have felt the same, help me find my calmness! I'll go full throttle off the dumbest shit! I'm switching up between an e-cig (no nicotine, used to smoke hookah, nice hobby) and nicotine gum, but I swear to God I might kill someone, haha.

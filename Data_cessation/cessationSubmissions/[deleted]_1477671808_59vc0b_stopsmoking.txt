5 days :)

I'm still new to this sub, so it feels a little weird posting, but I just wanted to celebrate today being day five.

The first three days were brutal and to be honest, I didn't see my husband and me actually lasting through it. I've had so many day 1's I've lost count. They mean nothing at this point. The fact that I am on day five is very promising!

I've been cutting back on the wine at night as well, as part of an overall health improvement. Since I do all my smoking at night when I'm usually drinking said wine, last night was a big test. I had a friend over who I sometimes smoke around, and even though we were drinking wine, I never even thought about smoking. It was great. Just a normal night without having to leave the conversation once every 45 minutes to go smoke.

Edit: I also forgot how gloriously non-existent hangovers are when you don't smoke 20 cigarettes with the booze!

Going back to the day five thing - I cannot tell you how clean I feel. This is always the first thing I notice when I stop smoking for a few days :( I literally feel free of chemicals and poison and it makes me sad to think that I have lived the opposite for 20 years. My mouth tastes great, my skin looks normal, my clothes don't smell, I can breathe, I am not coughing. I don't feel like walking cancer. It's great. I think I may even stick with it this time :)

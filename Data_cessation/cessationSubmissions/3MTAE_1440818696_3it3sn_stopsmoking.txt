Two years not up in smoke

Two years ago today, I finished Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking.  It wasn't *easy* to quit but it was what I wanted.  I was a smelly, junkie slave as a smoker.  I wasted time and money on a pathetic addiction.
  
I spent the first six weeks of freedom pretty weirded out by the transition from being a slave.  I spent a lot of therapeutic time reading posts here and elsewhere.  I slept more and exercised more.  I worked more, played more, thought more and eventually, smiled more.
  
I am free of nicotine now.  Quitting caffeine was simple by comparison.  Passing up junk food is easy.  Losing weight just takes patience.  I hope but I don't know if vapers or other NRT users will have similar beneficial side effects.

The one good thing that came from smoking is the education I received quitting by contemplating weakness and examining myself.
  
My 4 tips are:

* The craving will pass whether you smoke or not.
* Remembering what you want the most will help you forget what you want now.
* You can endure what you are prepared for. Be ready for a rough 6 weeks and an unpleasant 6 months.
* Check out [r/stoicism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/).  
 
Allen Carr's Easyway made me see that I was a smelly, addicted, junkie slave as long as I was using nicotine. All I had to do was quit to be free.

one full week! thanks to everyone here!

Well I've officially made it a full week without smoking and I feel great! I don't get winded as easily, everything seems to smell and taste better, and I don't have to worry about the smell on myself!

The cravings are just about gone, with just a minor one every now and then, but nothing I can't deal with. I just wanted to thank everyone here for their support; Y'all helped me out more than you can imagine!

How to want to stop smoking?

I would like to not smoke. I'm a mess though. A month ago I created a badge for myself. Bough a pack 4 hours after creating a badge. Filled a removal request just now.

* It'll kill me? Honestly, I'm in a place right now where I don't care. And even if it does, other things are going to kill me sooner. It's a chicken and egg problem that I can't solve. I'm not happy with myself, because I can't do anything right (any good habit - I don't have it. Well, I brush my teeth two times a day and shower daily, but it doesn't feel like a great accomplishement). I don't care enough about my health because I'm not happy with myself and would like it to be over. Not going to kill myself, don't worry. Too much of a wuss.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure I'm going to care when it does kill me. Just can't care right now.

* It's expensive? Meh, I can afford it. I don't like things. Money is only useful to a point. If I have enough for a computer, internet, roof and some food that's enough.
* It's gross to other people? Makes me less desireable? WHAT OTHER PEOPLE?

I tried quitting in that state of mind, and I instantly go to the point where I think 'well, everything else is shit, I might at least have that'. I don't think quitting is possible with that attitude. I have no idea where to go from here. **Intellectually I know quitting will help** not only my physical state but my mental state too. But I can't feel that.

tl;dr I just realized I'm a lowlife and a basement dweller who probably belongs on 4chan.

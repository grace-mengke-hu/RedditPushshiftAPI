27-year-old smoker looking for a physiological and philosophical understanding of breathing

I've been smoking consistently for half of my life. Had a few successful gos at quitting but got drawn back into it because reasons. A few of those successes were because of Alan Carr. I've listened to his book three times and now, when I try again, I find the words lack the impact they once had on me.

I want to stop taking breath for granted. I want to understand the physiological processes related to breathing and how exactly smoking impacts them. I want to develop a philosophy on breathing and be able to compare clean breathing to eating healthy food / smoking to poor diet.

Please, tell me what perspective moves you to action and keeps you emotionally invested in your own health and well-being. I feel like I can take care of anybody but myself.

How I Quit the Juul

The Juul is a discrete chrome device that will soon become all you can think about. It becomes attached to you like an extra limb and will not let go. It is under your pillow while you sleep and with you for the third unnecessary trip to the bathroom at work. It gives you a rush that at one time tasted like mint but now tastes like faded wintergreen windex. Rather quickly actually, you become insistent on its presence and you become completely forlorn without it. Even on the short trip to the bathroom downstairs, before you get into the shower and after you towel off, you make sure it is there. This is my first week without it and while not easy to let go, I needed to. It is marketed as a safe alternative but I know we have still yet to truly understand its long term effects on people.  The crime here is not the fruity flavors being marketed to kids but that Juul is well aware we do not need 5 mg's of nicotine. They are aware that anyone who buys one will be massively addicted in under a week.

Having Issues

So, I've had this sore throat for a few days.  The problem is, it's the exact same feeling my throat would get when I had gone a little too long without a cigarette and it's DRIVING ME CRAZY.  I know I'm not addicted to nicotine any more, and I don't want to smoke, and I'm not going to.  But physically I am craving a cigarette all the time and it's been difficult to think about other things.  

I gave myself a lot of leeway for the first month, but now I feel like it's been long enough that I shouldn't be thinking about smoking any more.  I want to stress that I don't feel like I'm in any danger of actually smoking, I'm just so sick of thinking about cigarettes and I was under the impression that the symptoms and cravings should be mostly gone by now.  I'm not really sure what I'm doing wrong.  It's to the point that I'm not even sure I should be hanging around on this sub becuase even though I really like being able to hear other poeples' experiences and give and get advice as needed, I'm not sure if it's healthy for me to be dwelling so much on cigarettes right now.  It's frustrating because I don't want to smoke, which makes it seem like there's no way to fix how I feel.

I am just really hoping that this sore throat will go away soon and that my preoccupation with cigarettes will disappear with it.

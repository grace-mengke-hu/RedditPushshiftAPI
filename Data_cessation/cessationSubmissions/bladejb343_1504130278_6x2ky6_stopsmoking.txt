Smoking in dreams.

Hi y'all! You might remember me from way back, here's my affirmation post. See bellow:

I've been good! I haven't had a cigarette in 77 days (started checking this sub 5 days after quit day) and I'm proud of myself. I've also essentially quit marijuana (though not a hard-quit like with nicotine) and I'm currently in the midst of NoFap and other good practices for mind/body health.

Anyway, I was wondering how often y'all dream about smoking. I've had probably 3-4 dreams now in which I have at least one cigarette, and I'm always feeling quite guilty in the morning. That said, it's always a relief to know it didn't really occur.

What are your experiences?

I just passed 72 hours!

So this is my third follow up post and I'm sorry if that's excessive for three days but either way I want to thank you guys for all the support so far! 

Anyways, I feel like I might be over the worst of it. Day 1 wasn't that bad. Days 2 and 3 were TERRIBLE. I've been nauseous and dizzy and I wont even get started on the constant anxiety. But today waking up I had so much less anxiety. The nausea was still there but much less so and now just after hitting the 72 hour mark I'm eating some pizza and I don't feel sick ^^

I'm really, really hoping it starts to get easier from here. And if it does, I definitely wont let my guard down. I know the rules, there's no such thing as just one! 

Alright, that's my small update. Thanks for all the support thus far guys. I couldn't have made it this far without you <33 !!!

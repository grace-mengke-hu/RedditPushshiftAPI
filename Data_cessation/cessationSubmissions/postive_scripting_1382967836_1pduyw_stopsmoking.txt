Semi-Related to smoking

So I am 200+ days free from smoking and had the weirdest closest encounter with cigarettes. My aunt, an honest, non-smoker, drinker and one of the greatest people on earth is the most unlikely person to have ever smoked(something of that manner) for me. 


Story: So I grabbed my headset to listen to some music. Wearing it on my head, I leaned back comfortably to listen to some deep-house tracks as I usually do when working on some excel reports. Listening, I feel some unusual, static-ky sound in my left ear and suddenly, a sharp pain accompanied by noise crackling like something alive is inside crawling in my ear -- something that came to mind immediately. I then ran to my aunt in the kitchen. Motioning her to come help me with urgency, I told her about what happened and asked her to place cooking oil inside my ear (As a nurse, that's the first aid for insects in ears.) I see her grab a pack of cigarettes that my uncle has laying around and started lighting it up. I've never seen her smoke and thought to myself, this is the most inconvenient time to pick up a vice. What the fuck? I asked her what she's doing but she grabbed me by my shoulder, then grabbed my head and tilted it sideways. She blew smoke inside my ear and all the pain was drowned in confusion of what is happening. She then pinched my earlobe with herindex and thumb, low-and-behold, an ant. 

Ok. So not really related to smoking but there just want to get it out there. Cigarettes couldbe useful in getting insects out of your ears -- something that I've never learned in nursing school.

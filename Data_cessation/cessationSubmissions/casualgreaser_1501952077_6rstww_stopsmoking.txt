Is it normal to get very emotional after quitting?

I'm currently on day 1. I've fought numerous cravings since I woke up but I've been feeling very emotional and sensitive the whole day. I sit down and cry about things I wouldn't normally care. It's almost like my brain is constantly looking for excuses to smoke.

I was wondering if this is a common occurrence? And if so, does it go away eventually?

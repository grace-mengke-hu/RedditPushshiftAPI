Its all perspective

That's all it takes to quit. Perspective. I've spent the past four years seeing smoking as an essential part of my life. Something I need. I'd be late for things just to have a smoke. My friends would have to wait for me, just to have a smoke. I'd leave any family gathering, just to have a smoke.

In a matter of only 3 days my life has turned around. I am a proud a non-smoker. I honestly thought that this was going to be the hardest thing I've ever done, and in the moment, it was. I'm just feeling my withdrawals ease up now. I don't have that craving feeling nagging me any more. I just feel at ease, relaxed, like I've just smoke a cigarette. But my throat isn't sore. My breaths are deeper and clearer with every one I take. Life seems brighter.

Maybe I'm going insane from the lack of nicotine, but in a matter of 3 days, I've changed. I'm a new person. Withdrawals may have seemed like the hardest thing in the world before, and even harder while dealing with them, but looking back, it's actually easy. The decision is easy. You just stop. You don't wait for that special thing to happen. You don't wait for Christmas, or a night out or a holiday. You just stop, cut it out. Let it go. About 72 hours after doing that, you're free.

I've been building up this number in my head, 72. Ive been telling myself that if I can make it past that number, I can make it past any number. I'm 9 hours off that number as of right now and I'm about to go to sleep. If I can get to work tomorrow morning without smoking (and I sure can). I can quit forever.

I know I'm going to have temptation, but I also know that withdrawing was not fun, and I've already made that easy decision once, I'm going to continue to make it for the rest of my life now. 

Sorry for the rambling, it helps me haha. Hope someone can find some motivation from this if you're feeling a bit low. Just make that decision. It's easy. :)

Coming up on 8 months.

I feel great, smell and taste things better, and have saved so much money. Like roughly $1070.00.

After failed attempts using the patches and gum, I can say my PV (electronic cigarette) has been the only option that has worked for me.

I wish the rest of you the best of luck and to never let your guard down (primarily when drinking).

For those that have just quit and wonder when the cravings subsided, it took about a solid month of breaking the habit of buying packs before I felt better.

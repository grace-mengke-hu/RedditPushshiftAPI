1 month today! I did it!

Except for the fact I had the flu last week I have never felt better!  I am sleeping better, my dark circles are almost invisible and I'm able to concentrate better.  Finally being able to quit is the best thing I have ever done.

This subreddit,the support/encouragement and everyone else's stories has been a tremendous help. Thank you!

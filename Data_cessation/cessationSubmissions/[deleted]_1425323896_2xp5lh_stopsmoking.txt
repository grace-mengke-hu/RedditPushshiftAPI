Just smoked my last cig, any words of inspiration would be greatly appreciated.

Not sure how hard this will be but I am a 20 yr old male who chewed for about a year.  I just moved to Spain about two months ago and they do not sell chew here so I started smoking.  I found myself hating myself every time I light up so I am going to try and stop.  would love to here from people about their experiences as I don't really know anyone who has gone through this and I can't talk to my parents about it.

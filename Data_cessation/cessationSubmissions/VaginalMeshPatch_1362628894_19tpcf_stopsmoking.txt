From cold turkey to the patch...

15 year smoker. Started when I was 15. Countless unsuccessful attempts. This most recent time I had support person and I had this sub. I made it the first week cold turkey. It was my impression that once I got through the first 72 hours and nicotine was detoxed from my body, it was going to be smooth sailing from there on out...only to find myself constantly craving nicotine, yet refusing to indulge, which brought me to the point where I became short with friends and strangers, and got a talking-to from my job.

I started doing research and learned that my brain is seriously a little jacked up from having that nicotine to stimulate my dopamine prodution. When my nicotine craving became almost painful at 9 days, I put on a 7mg patch and within the first hour my agitation fell and I was blown away by how a little patch made me so much more comfortable. 

I had tried the patch in the past, but it was always, "here let me put this cig out and now I'll put this patch on"..."oh jeez I just ate, one cig won't hurt" and then FAIL.  I think that by stretching myself to stop cold turkey and really prove to myself that I really wanted to be a nonsmoker, really helped me understand what a nicotine replacement product is designed to do and how to use it most effectively.

**TL;DR: I didn't decide to quit smoking, I decided to become a nonsmoker.**

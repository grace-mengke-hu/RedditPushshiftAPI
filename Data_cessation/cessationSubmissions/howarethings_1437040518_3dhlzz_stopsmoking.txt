Started smoking at 17, just turned 25 three weeks ago and have made the decision to never smoke again.

I started smoking around 8 years ago. Never anything serious until I turned 19 and started buying packs. As it usually goes, a few cigs a day turned into a handful, a handful into half a pack, half a pack into a full pack. 4 weeks ago I was smoking 15 - 25 cigs a day. Looking back I can't even believe it really. It all seem so normal to me. Then came my wake up call. 

When I was around 22 I had a some wisdom teeth pulled and 2 root canals done on some bad teeth. I thought everything was fine until about 1 month ago, when I noticed a sizable bump on my gums. Freaked out, I went to the dentist. Turns out I had an abscessed tooth, basically an infection at the root of one of my molars. I was given two options, have another root canal or cut my losses and have them extract the infected tooth. I decided I'd rather pay the $2000 (no insurance) to have them save my tooth with the root canal rather than have a gap and have to chew on one side of my mouth for the rest of my life. That is when it finally hit me. I had to get control of my life back. 

I haven't touch a cig since I got that root canal. Quit cold turkey. Many of my friends still smoke and I've hung out and drank with them plenty of times in the last 2 weeks but I'm staying strong. Tbh I am almost glad I learned my lesson the hard way. It made me realize how awful my habit was, how I was damaging my body, and how blind I was to it all. 

I am really proud of myself right now, even if it has only been a couple weeks. I've made the decision, I'm not smoking again. Best of luck to all of you out there that might be struggling. Just remember, quit while you are ahead, don't wait till you learn the hard way.

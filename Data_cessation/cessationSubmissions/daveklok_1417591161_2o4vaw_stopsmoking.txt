I fucked up :( back to day 1...

So I was at day 120 of not smoking.. Then I was offered a few drags of a cigarette since my girl has been stressing this week (she had quit too) and now I just bought a pack :( I was doing so good.. My plan is to make this my last pack (again *sigh*) and quit after I smoke the rest of these.. Damnit! :(

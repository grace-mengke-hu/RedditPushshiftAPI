Been tapering off all weekend...Official Day One

This is my first day not smoking any cigarettes in months. I tapered off through the weekend...12 on Friday, 6 on Saturday, 2 yesterday, and 0 today so far. I have been chewing on sunflower seeds like crazy and my lips are all dry now so I think I may need to figure something else out...like straws or something. I am quitting because I don't like the way it makes me smell and my boyfriend and I are talking about getting engaged this year and I know if I don't quit before he proposes that I won't ever do it  because it I will continue to make excuses like, "I am too stressed to quit while planning a wedding" and then I will never do it. I really don't want to smoke on my wedding day or get all irritated if I can't. I don't know if that is really good reasoning but it has gotten me this far. I think what I am struggling with today is that sometimes I don't think I can actually do it and stay stopped. Any suggestions would be nice...thanks!

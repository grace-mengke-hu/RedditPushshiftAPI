70 days and little triggers still surface sometimes.

I was driving this evening and reached into my purse, just feeling about for some mints.  My hand landed on a box.  "Cigarettes!" I thought and I felt my heart race and that old feeling of anticipation start up.  Then I remembered I've quit. The box was some playing cards.  I was subconsciously disappointed for a moment until I snapped out of it.  There was just something about that muscle memory about groping for a pack of smokes and light in my purse that really triggered the sequence.  I'm sure glad to be smoke free though!

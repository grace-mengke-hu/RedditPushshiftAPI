21min smoke free

So I've been a smoker for 8 years now. I'm 26. I've tried to quit smoking a few times. Once I went about a month without one. My chest is starting to ache. I feel like my circulation is getting worse. Some days I wake up and I feel like breathing is such a chore and then I have a cigarette anyways.

So anyways I decided tonight is my last night to smoke. I went outside for my last one and I heard an owl. Now I've never been really religious or anything but I get certain feelings about sudden appearances of animals I don't normally see. I live in a city and owls aren't common. They can be interpreted both as a symbol of death or change. I find that interesting. 

I'm really just here because I need the support from all of you. Thank you for reading this!

Started to take quitting seriously today!

Hey guys, just found this subreddit at work whilst on my lunch break. I've been trying to for quite some time but never really took to it very seriously. From when I was young I've always had it drilled into me how bad smoking is, not just for the normal health risk perspective but because I suffer from type 1 Diabetes too. My Doctors, parents and just about everyone under the Sun have been telling me I'm a jackass for ever starting. After many half ass attempts, or flat out lies about quitting I've finally taken a positive step. Subscribed here, binned my fags and I've had what I'd like to consider my last smoke. Here we go.

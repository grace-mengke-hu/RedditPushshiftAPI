About to smoke my last cig.

Tomorrow morning, I will be a part of this community. I've read Allen Carr, I've been doing the smoke free missions/diaries for a week, and I'm ready to follow through with my quit date. It's going to be tough, but I've got this. I'm going to beat the shit out of this nicotine monster.

9 Days

So I'm at about 9 days cigarette-free and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I wasn't even a heavy smoker (2-3 cigs a day avg, less on weekends) so I didn't expect to be so affected.

I had been using an ecig with minimal nicotine (3mg liquid) during cravings but yesterday I experienced hives and some throat itching/mouth numbness and all I can attribute it to is the propylene glycol (or possibly a flavor additive) in the liquid. We're currently under 2 feet of snow in MD (higher in some of the wind drifts, with more coming down) so I can't get more liquid and I don't want to risk anaphylaxis just to get a meagre dose of nicotine.

I keep experiencing these awful headaches, sometimes with dizziness and brain fog. My muscles feel tense and hurt at times. I have an anxiety disorder and am not currently medicated so my anxiety is through the roof. A few days ago I had panic attacks all day.

I have been drinking water like mad - 72oz/day minimum (often over 100oz). No caffeine, nothing high in sugar. Eating makes my stomach feel weird so I'm sticking to vegetables, fruits, and proteins. Occasional carbs and starches, but they feel heavy in my stomach.

I'm trying to stick with it, but I am having a rough go. I keep reminding myself I'm doing it for my health, that smoking one more cig isn't worth having to withdrawal longer, etc. I hate that my body feels wrong though. I hate being in pain and feeling stressed and panicked. And I hate the snow.

Sorry for the vent but there's no one else I can talk to about this. I figured you guys might understand better than anyone.

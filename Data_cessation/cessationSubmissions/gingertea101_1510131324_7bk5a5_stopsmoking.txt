Just quit for good.

My head feels like it's gonna explode. The thightness in my chest feels like a heavy blub hugging my rib cage. My mouth is dry. My feet and arms are tingling. I can't take it anymore. 
Every time I quit, after tree days, I feel high. I feel light and happier. I get high on oxygen, basically. It's such a good feeling that I get stressed. Afraid. Thinking I can't lieve like that. So I use this excuse to go back to smoking.
See, I spend my whole life in misery and cigarrettes became a way to make me feel safe in all that misery. 
It's a bunch horse shit. 
I deserve to be happy. I deserve to be healthy and free from this effing nightmare of tar and hideous smoke, ammaright?

I can't take this anymore. I hate this crap so much.
After 9 years I'm done for good. 
Bring it on withdrawal, I'm ready.

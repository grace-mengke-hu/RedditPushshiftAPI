Day 34

My employer started a program I can't find on our website anymore to stop smoking.  They sent me 6 weeks of 21mg patches.  I have been a ten year smoker.  

I never got the second shipment and even my HR doesn't have a way for me to contact these people and order the second one.  I should've known - when I picked a quit date they showed up a few days late too.

I'm posting this as I leave the house.  Going to try cold turkey from here.  :X

When to say you've relapsed?

To keep it short, I quit cold turkey on December 27th, 2015. A couple of weeks later while wasted I had a cigarette on the walk home with my room mates. I told myself I wouldn't count it if I continued to not smoke. I have not smoked since that one so I feel comfortable saying it's been a month now.

What say you? When is it a relapse, when should you restart 'the clock.' One puff? One cigarette? A day of being a smoker?

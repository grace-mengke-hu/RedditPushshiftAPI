Just stumbled on this sub and...

I've been wanting to quit for at least 3 years now. Haven't found the strength and will power yet. I've smoked since I was 12 years old, so 20 years in now. I am feeling the effects take hold, watching the money  go out the window, and I have 2 young kids now so it's time to stop. Does anyone have any advice or tricks you want to share?

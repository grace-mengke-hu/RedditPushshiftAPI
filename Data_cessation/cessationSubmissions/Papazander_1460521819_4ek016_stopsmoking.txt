Need to quit. Feels like it will never happen.

I've been a smoker for almost 10 years. I've tried the gum, the lozenge, and the patch. The longest I've gone smoke free is one week.

I'm so ready to quit. I feel bad physically, I worry about my kids, I worry about the money, and I'm so ashamed that I can't seem to kick this.

What I have been looking for is an extreme solution. Some way to alter my behaviors radically. I'm ready to do what it takes, but I don't know where to start. 

I came here hoping to find some new ideas from people actually get the problem. I can tell from how he talks that my doctor has never had an addiction. My wife also doesn't seem to understand what it is like. 

I just quit another addiction (porn) 5 months ago, so I know that it's possible. I just need a boost.

Thanks for reading.

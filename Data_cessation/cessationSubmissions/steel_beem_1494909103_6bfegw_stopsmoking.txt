Got my friend hooked and feel shitty (long)

About a year ago I started smoking, mostly a social thing but then it became a habit
One time I was hanging with my friend and I pulled out a smoke, he said the typical shit "you smoke? That's so gross, don't even light it" and he left it at that (I didn't smoke in front of him at that time)

A few weeks later he comes over and with him he has a box of newports. Honestly I was excited because I had someone to smoke with and he assured me "he can quit anytime" 

We hung out a lot after that and we smoked wherever we went, but eventually I just realized these things are horrible for your health and I didn't want to end up addicted to this stuff later in my life.

I just reached 1 month today and I'm happy, (I mean I had a couple along the way but I never went back at it) but my friend is still smoking even without me. I don't know what to say or do about it because there's simply nothing I can do. I just feel like a shitty person for even opening up the idea of smoking to him, and he's a healthy guy too!

Is there anything I can say or do to help him along and quit? 

Tl;dr: I was smoking, friend started smoking. I quit, friends still smoking. What should I do?

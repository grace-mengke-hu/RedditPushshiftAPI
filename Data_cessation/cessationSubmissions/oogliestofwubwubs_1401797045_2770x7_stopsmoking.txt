I screwed up

I was five months non-smoking. FIVE MONTHS. I made it through a horrific move in the middle of winter. I made it through staying with family for two months while we tried to find a new house. I made it through dealing with a toddler by myself. I made it through another move. I made it through unpacking and getting settled into our new place.

And this past weekend I threw five months away.
I am so mad at myself and so sad that I gave in.  I'm upset that I've disappointed myself and my husband. I'm upset that my 2 year old has now seen Mommy smoke.

I'm really pissed that now I have to go through all of it again.

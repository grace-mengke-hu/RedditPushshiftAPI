7 days Base camp 1 established!

Believe me a week is so good for me, I am chuffed to bits. I suppose I'm cheating a bit in a way by using patches (postponing the inevitable?) but rather than be prodded all the time by an invisible finger bullying me to smoke, I go long periods without even thinking about it.. When I do remember, all the punch has gone out of it and I can handle it pretty well. I know its early days but as I say, I have at least reached base camp and am settled in for the long haul.

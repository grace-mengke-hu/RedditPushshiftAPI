I think my job is a greater trigger than even drinking or eating are

I'm trying to quit again (so ignore any badge by the name) and it's not easy. I woke up this morning and thought I didn't really need a cigarette. Grabbed my morning coffee and thought a smoke would be nice, but decided against it and breathed in the fresh morning air. 

Then I got to work. I think within two minutes of logging on it hit me that the day is going to feel *that much longer* because I won't be taking smoke breaks. They got me out of these dreadful conference rooms and broke up the monotony of the day to say the least. 

Anybody else have this problem? I can only take so much buzzword talk and Excel spreadsheets before I snap.

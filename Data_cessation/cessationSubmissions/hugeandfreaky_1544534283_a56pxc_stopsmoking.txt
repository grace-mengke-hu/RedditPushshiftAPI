I am about to relapse pretty soon

Hi all, I've just turned 20 and I've been smoking since I was 14. I went up to 3 packs a day for a brief period of time around last year when my mood was quite low. Was smoking half a pack a day until I eventually quit cold turkey 2 months and 18 days ago. This has been my most successful attempt so far, although I've been constantly trying to quit since I was 18; mainly because my parents had a heartfelt conversation with me about their concerns with my health. I've been paying super close attention to my physical health (except for smoking) for 1.5 years now. I'm very physically active.

My life is a complete joke right now, I'm working night shifts to save up some money so I can get back to studying but it won't be happening until the next semester, which is in June. I've quit drinking and using other substances sometime around last year, don't even miss them a bit since being sober turned out to be something i quite enjoy. But I'm constantly thinking about having a smoke. Life -at least for the time being- seems so dull and unbearable that I feel like I'm willing to do anything for a little bit of "entertainment." I've lost someone very dear to me at the start of this year. I was kicked out of the University. I've got no friends, no girlfriend and I have to work in harsh conditions. Let alone I have to help support the family. Got no place to make new friends since I'm not studying. I feel like my mental conditions will get the best of me before smoking will. My addiction keeps telling me I will quit when things get better but I know this is a lie because I've experienced this before. I used to feel guilty when I smoked in my dreams and was relieved to find out it was just a dream. Now when that happens, I just want to light one up when I wake up.

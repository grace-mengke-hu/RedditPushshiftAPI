This is so hard

It’s been 8 days since I last smoked a cigarette, I’m sitting here at work and I’m going crazy. My back aches, my stomach constantly hurts, I’m constipated, I have trouble sleeping and all I’m thinking about is how I never want to go thru this again. My mind wanders off and I think about how just one cigarette would make all this pain go away but I know that’s not the way to go, the cycle would just continue. I don’t know how long this is gonna last and I think I can make it thru, but god this is hard.

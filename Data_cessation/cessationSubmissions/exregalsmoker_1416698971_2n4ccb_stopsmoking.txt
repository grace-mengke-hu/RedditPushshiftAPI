Bought ten cigs today

At 1pm today and still not had one.Reason why ive been at work while 10pm tempted to have one or two.Ive had strong cravings for weeks now so booked myself an appointment at the stop smoking clinic to go back on champix to stop these strong cravings.
Im using my ecig at the moment but always puffing on it and i need to get out of the habit of using it.Least i know if i start smoking again the champix will work.I have done so well getting this far but if i fail im sure i can do this again.

Today's Gonna be the Day

I'm much more invested in it this time than I have been at any point prior.   I mean, shit, It's been over ten years that i've been smoking  about a pack of red's every single day.  

It's time.

Time to stop.  Forever.  A new me.  The same me.  Just better.

After a 6 month break from quitting quitting I finally feel like I'm ready.  

I got some patches.  I made my Pros and Cons list.  Even went and got myself the iQuit app. 

I'm planning on taking the entire month of April off of drinking to give myself a fighting chance.  

I also have a 100 dollar bet with my quitting buddy.  

And of course, I have all of you wonderful people over here at r/stopsmoking.

So no more self-defeating bullshit this time.  Man... we smokers sure are good at rationalizing and justifying puffing on another square, aren't we?

It's time.  No more cigs in my mouth ever again.  For any reason. 

Never again.

So I leave you with some motivational links that may or may not help you on your journey.  Don't give up.  You can do it.

I wanna help my dad quit. Advice appreciated!

Hello /r/stopsmoking,

my dad is a heavy smoker for almost 40 years now. He is in a bad health condition and almost died a few years ago due to his smoking and general bad habits. 

Nevertheless, he says he doesn't want to quit. It physically hurts me, seeing him destroying his body and throwing away his life. 

My dad is kind of a hedonistic person. He keeps repeating, that he smokes and eats trash because it gives him "pleasure". When my mom gets angry - which tends to happen more over the years - he always says, we are trying to take away the last thing, which gives him pleasure. 

However, this isn't true. I struggled with addiction myself. I understand how addiction works and how hard it is to quit. I know it. I lived it. I want to help him, because I want him to meet his grandchildren one day. If he keeps going like this, he will probably die in a few years.

I read, that vaping is a little bit healthier than regular smoking. When I suggested to maybe give it a  try instead of smoking, he was willing for the first time in decades.

He says, he likes the taste of tobacco. He always smokes in the morning, while having coffee, after he comes home from work, after dinner, and while watching TV. As far as I know, he doesn't smoke at work.

Is there a way to help him, even though he says he doesn't want to quit? Any strategies to change his view?

My thread is a mess. Sorry about that. I'm just so confused about the entire situation.

Any insight are greatly appreciated!

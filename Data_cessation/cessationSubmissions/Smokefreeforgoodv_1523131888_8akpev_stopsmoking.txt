Being tested

I am at 140 days and it has been going really well - stopped thinking about smoking all the time and felt like a non-smoker - until two days ago I fell and fractured my wrist. I am really in pain and just want to smoke. It seems every where I look there are people enjoying a cigarette and the smell is driving me crazy...

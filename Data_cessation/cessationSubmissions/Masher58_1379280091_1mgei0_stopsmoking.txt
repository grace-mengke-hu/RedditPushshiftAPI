8 days free!! Or am I!!

So I've been smoking since I was 14 I'm 31 now and have been trying to quit for literally 13 years I've tried champix, Allan carrs easyway, patches, gum, cold turkey nothing ever has worked! I've done a few weeks here and thee and the same old story ill get to the weekend go out with the boys and off it goes my stupid brain "just have a couple tonight you'll be fine in the morning" and what happens I buy a pack smoke the lot buy another pack promising myself ill throw them away and what happens? I lie to myself again, ill keep them just in case I go out again next week what a load of bollocks I smoke them in the morning and I'm back on the merry go round of absolute smoky dog shit!!! I smoked my last coffin nail last Saturday night and will never ever put another in my mouth!! Don't get me wrong it's the hardest thing ever I don't go an hour without trying to persuade myself to have "just one more"!! Not happening this time fuck them all cigarettes, tobacco companies they're all filthy fucking bastards!! The way I look at it now bring on the cravings you ain't gonna beat me the more they try the harder I will become make it harder I say This is one fight I am not going to lose BOOM!!

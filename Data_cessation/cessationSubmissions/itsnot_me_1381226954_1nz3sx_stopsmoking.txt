Just me?

Am i the only one on this sub reddit that hated Allan Carrs book? totally get some of the principles behind it, such as understanding addiction and cravings but i found the general tone of the book and style of writing to be really patronising, i've read it twice, didn't manage to quit either time and found that it just made me really cross!

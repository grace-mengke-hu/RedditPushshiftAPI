Proof in the Pudding!

12Days 10Hours Exactly. That's me right now. The last time I lost my quit was because I started drinking with my best bud and broke. This time I have had 9 beers and still have not smoked. I rack this up to what I had read earlier about taking it head on and beating it psychologically after you have gotten through the physiological nicotine  addition. I worked on this on day nine as I have posted earlier. To be honest, I was not sure if that would have helped in a "real world" scenario. I'm happy to report that it did work, I did hang out socially, drink beer, jam on tunes and still did not light up a smoke!

If any of you folks are worried about this (I was), rest assured that it can be beaten. I just now proved that to myself and hopefully helped you guys too.

Good luck and God Speed on your Quit..Stay Strong Brothers!

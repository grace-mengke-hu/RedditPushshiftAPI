Lost without nicotine

So I left the states on May 17 and returned July 7, I was free from nicotine that entire time (17f) now that I’m back I’m officially clean I would say? I tried hitting nicotine again and found it to be repulsive and got nic sick easily. So now that’s out of the way, I just feel lost? I did it so often that idk how to feel ‘normal’ again.

Any suggestions for getting rid of this feeling?

Need a new morning routine. What helped you?

Hi there! Iâ€™m prepping to quit, and I need to figure out what my new morning routine will be. Normally, I wake up extra early so I can sit outside with cigs and water (I quit coffee already ðŸ˜ƒ) and scroll through Reddit. Iâ€™m a teacher and for the next 7 weeks I am on summer break, so Iâ€™m pretty much without a routine, and my morning sitting out time just kind of goes on all day. 

I have no idea how to start my days differently.

What helped for you?

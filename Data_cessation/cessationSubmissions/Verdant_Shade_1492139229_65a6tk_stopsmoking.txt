How long does breathlessness last?

I smoked from January through now, trying to quit and I get cravings from everything and it sucks. Is someone smoking? Do I smell it? Is there a no smoking ad? I can't keep busy enough to avoid it... but it never ever used to be on my radar like this. :(

I have to quit and want to. The cravings wouldn't be so bad if I could just catch my breath. I'm a 25F and had a check up at the doctors a few days ago. I'm totally healthy-- BP, O2 levels, weight.

Has anyone experienced breathlessness before, and if so, did anything help? How long did it last? Bonus if you have insight for me as a <1 year smoker.

Thank you, and Happy Easter! :)

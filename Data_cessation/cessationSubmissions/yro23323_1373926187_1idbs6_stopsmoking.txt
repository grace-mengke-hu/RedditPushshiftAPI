This month has been tough.

I have been smoke free for 9 months and a week and feel absolutely wonderful.  Stopping wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be as I had put it off many, many times.  I had been a smoker for 16 years and smoked at a minimum of a pack per day.  Fast forward to month nine and it feels like I'm back at day 3.  I've had a shit month and it seems like every day is another reason to start back up.  I can't help but think it's going to be like this the rest of my life, but I know I'm not going back.  I'm not sure what to do to cure the cravings since I don't use any sort of deterrent or replacements like e-cigs, or anything along those lines.  I'm worried I'm going to start replacing cravings with food like I did before, but I'm curious as to what methods and tricks others have used.  I really need to start exercising again, and know that would help tremendously, but I am at wits end and need a new avenue.  Thanks for listening and for any response that you may provide.

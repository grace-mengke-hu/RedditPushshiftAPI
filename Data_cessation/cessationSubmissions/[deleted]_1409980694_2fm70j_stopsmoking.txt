It is time

A few days ago now, I've come to the realization and decision that I really want to quit smoking.
I've been smoking for near on 3 years now, on a daily basis...
It's costing me money, health, attractiveness, personal hygeine, it disrupts my social and work flow, it is a burden in almost every regard...

it makes me feel like i'm weak to something I shouldn't even have in my life. I got hooked on and quit meth in the past, shouldn't be a big deal right?

I had a 'last cigarette', then soaked and trashed the pack. Day one went okay... day two I was extremely stressed and on edge, but I made it through the majority of it... then caved

The biggest problem is that I still have cigarettes available at my disposal (people i'm surrounded by), but I still have the idea strongly in mind every single time, I just keep caving..
 I don't want to lose to cigarettes. I really want to fucking stop, I don't want to be dishonest to myself or the people around me

i've had my justifications, I have my slip ups, but i'll be damned if I lose again this time around. 

What are the best ways to go about this?
I'm thinking of just having a chat with said people and letting them know my goals here, making sure they keep them well and truly out of reach for me because, honestly, when i'm not around them, I can get through the cravings, I can go without

but subject to their presence and i'm suddenly switching mindsets and failing myself, and it happens without me even realizing what i'm doing, like i'm not in control of the behavioural/habitual reaction/responses no matter how hard I try....

This is hard shit, but i'm not giving up on giving up. Not this time, not until I win.

My closest friends are chain-smokers. I want to help them.

I only saw this subreddit today, and I apologise if I am breaking any rules trying to ask for advice like this, but I was wondering if I could do ANYTHING at all. Three of my closest friends smoke a lot. I don't know how much exactly but once when I was at their apartment (the three of them practically stay around each other all the time), they were lighting up one smoke after another. I talked to one of them, and she keeps telling me she wants to quit eventually but not right now because she's "having too much fun". I am really worried for them, because it doesn't seem like they have any intentions to stop. We are all still in college. I have no idea what I can do to at least get them to REALISE they need to quit. They KNOW the health consequences. Money is not an issue for any of them... But they just won't do it. 

I just don't know where to begin.

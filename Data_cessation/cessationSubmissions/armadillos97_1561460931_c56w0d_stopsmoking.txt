Day 2. Somehow my sense of time has been destroyed.

I know I've gone to sleep 3 times since I quit, and yet it's still day 2? This is confusing. The seconds stretch out and I have a mild headache. 

I've kept suckers around like Kojack, and I'm feeling good about this. If I'm not mistaken, my brain is going to have to change a bit as the receptors for various chemicals are not in use. ? I want to say "Down regulate the receptors for nicotine" but I'm not sure. I learned the half life for nicotine is 2 hours, the average cigarette allows the absorption of 2mg of nicotine, and that it is related to the nightshade. I also learned that information is processed in the brain like a reward, like food, and music...  so yeah. Addict brain still searching for dopamine and stimulation. Nothing new.

Good luck everyone with your quit attempts. Do not give up when you feel like it. It's just your nerves, brain, but at the end of the day you are more than that. You have control. It's going to be ok.

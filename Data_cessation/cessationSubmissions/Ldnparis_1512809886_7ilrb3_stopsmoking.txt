I dont feel like i'm missing out by not smoking, I just feel like Ive missed out by not quitting sooner

I feel absolutely fantastic, seriously. I know its early days and id be naive to think there wont be tough times to come but so far I am just over the moon that I don't smoke anymore. I suffer with bad depression and anxiety and feeling that i'm in control of smoking has really helped me this week!

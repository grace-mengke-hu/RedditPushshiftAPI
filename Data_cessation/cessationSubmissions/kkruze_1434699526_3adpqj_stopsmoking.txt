One week -ish

After today I will hit my I one week mark . A bit of a headache and the occasional craving once in a while but otherwise I'm feeling great . It was maybe my hundredth try in a year's time(barely ever made it past 2 days) but I guess persistence is the key. this time it is so easy that it's even scary . Sometimes my body still gets the urge to smoke but then I remind him to shut the fuck up and do 20 push ups because I'm the one in charge . Fuck you cigarettes you have made me miserable for too long . That's pretty much it ,just felt that I've got to share this . You guys can do it . Stay awesome

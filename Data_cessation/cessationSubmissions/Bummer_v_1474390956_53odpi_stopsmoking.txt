I failed

So yeah, I failed. I started to smoke back saturday night and I haven't stop yet. 

I will try to stop again tomorrow. I'm only at 5-6 cig a day instead of 30-35 (like I was before my last try).  I think this will look a lot like a note to myself but whatever, I need to write this :) 

Here's what I learn from my relapse:
-Relapsing may make it better in the short term, but not in the long term. The cravings are worst after the first time you relapse 
-I clearly underestimate my addiction (was the reason why I failed first time I tried too)
-I stop coming on this subred after a while - that encourage me to unfocus on my goal and to feel alone in this process
-Didn't see it as one day at a time - I was always wondering when I would feel better, and if I could make it to X number of week or months. Made this challenge seems impossible because I was always focusing on the future and not on the ''right now''
-I made a list of motivations, but I never looked at it - I didn't use it as a tool
-I didn't change my lifestyle - I wanted to start training but I didn't. I started to eat healthier though.
-I took my progress for granted - when I started to feel better, I thought it couldn't hurt me to smoke a cig...
-I can drink beer but I CAN'T drink wine
-I can't smoke, even if it's an electronic cigarette (it reminds me too much about the habit of smoking)
-I can't smoke anything with nicotine in it (even if it's an electronic cigarette or a blunt)
-Everytime I smoke, I feel guilty now. Like, I know that I failed. My cigarettes are not helping me. They are just making my nicotine monster happy - but they don't make me happy because I feel like a failure everytime I smoke (I made it to 8 days (and I was so proud of myself), then I smoked, and then I didn't smoke for 3 days and then I smoked again - I made it to 8 days and I was doing great until I just gave up...)
-I didn't re-read Allen Carr's book. It really helped me in the first few days, so I should have re-read it when it was getting harder. 
-I didn't focus enough on the fact that I'm a non-smoker. 

So this is it. Tomorrow is a new day. And I hope I will do it like a big girl :)
Sorry for bad english

45 days without a Cig & 21 days without Nictotine. Why are the past two days so hard?

Hey Friends! After 14 years at about 30 cigarettes a day, I finally quit smoking about 45 days ago. I used the vape method. I started at 18mg of nicotine and weaned myself down over 24 days till I was down to 0mg of nicotine. I have been off nicotine for 21 days now. Since then, I have still been hitting the Vape pretty heavily most of the time. Sometimes I go for many many hours without a puff. I just need the sensation sometimes. The withdrawals since being at 0mg were pretty brutal. I didn't sleep for almost a week. I was constipated like crazy and am just finally getting back to normal (thank you prune juice). Also, the emotional depression has been rather brutal. I suffer from anxiety, depression & OCD to begin with...This just made everything a little worse.

But the past two days have been extra brutal. I thought it would be easier. I almost feel like the past two days were harder than any of the days in the first week of 0mg. I am hardcore craving a cigarette right now. Stronger than ever before.

Has anybody else experienced this so far into the quitting process? I don't know what has triggered it. Figured 21 days in and it wouldn't be that bad.

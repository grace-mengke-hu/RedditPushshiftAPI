Very vivid dream actually woke my ass up (literally).

Had an incredibly rough dream last night, I'm using the patches and yesterday I forgot to so all day at work it wasn't too bad but since I forgot I decided to use it at night so I think that's what triggered my dream maybe (dunno?), but in the dream I was with my younger step brother and an old friend who we used to sit in a trailer and do nothing but play MTG and smoke/chew tobacco. I was with both of them and I only had 2-3 ciggs left and in the dream said fuck it and went to a store to buy some. The urge to smoke was so strong I actually woke up and stayed awake for 15 minutes at 4am. I had a glass of water and used the bathroom and eventually fell asleep but for those 15 minutes all I could think about was ciggarettes. And I kept thinking "fuck it, I'm a writer, writers smoke, the first thing I'm going to do in the morning is buy a pack with the $10 I have left for two weeks fuck it". I ripped the patch off thinking maybe that would help.

Now of course you don't think very rationally at 4am, and when I woke up at my normal time was glad it was just a dream. But holy shit. I just started over about a week ago from quitting from my 2nd longest attempt (50ish days), my longest streak was 102 days, and I feel like I'm never going to beat this, especially since I'm a writer (it helps taking breaks, can focus on where I'm going next in the story, etc.)

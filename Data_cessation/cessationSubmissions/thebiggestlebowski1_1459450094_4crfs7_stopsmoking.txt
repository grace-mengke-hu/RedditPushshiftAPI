3 weeks

Its been 3 weeks since my last camel crush and I feel so much better. My throat doesn't hurt everyday. I don't have to leave my house early to get to work to have 2 cigs before I even clock in. I know its still going to be a battle, but I can finally see things paying off. Thank you to this subreddit for getting me this far.  If you're in the early days, just push through.  It will get so much easier

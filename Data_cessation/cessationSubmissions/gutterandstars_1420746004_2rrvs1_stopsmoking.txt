Bad start to 2015...picked up smoking after ~150 days, about to finish first pack

Completely unexpected but it's almost funny that smoking early on in Jan is looking like an anti-resolution....     
At this point, I'm about to finish my first pack of the year and I don't feel great.      
Anyone else having a bad start to the year after a good run? I think I need to go back to fitness as my motivation...Have printed the '7 weeks to 100 pushups' schedule to begin it and continue running. How's it looking for others? Doing good?     
Edit: Removed my shiny  badge in disappointment...

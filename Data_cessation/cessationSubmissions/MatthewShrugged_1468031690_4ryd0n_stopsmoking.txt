week 1 complete! bathroom issues?

Just wanted to thank all of you for your advice and support. My first week is complete and the cravings are a minor problem now. Sometimes my brain will be like "Time for a cigarette" and I have to be like "No brain, not anymore". Otherwise life has more or less returned to normal except. well there is the small matter of number 2 ;). I quit smoking as part of a "summer of getting healthy". So I've been exercising (I gave up the diet until after week 2 of no smoking). I'm not sure which of my major life style changes is causing it. I seem to be constipated for a day or two and then give birth. 

Did anyone else have this problem"

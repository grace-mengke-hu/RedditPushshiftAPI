New here! How my first day of quitting went.

Hey all, I found this subreddit a day or two ago, and it has been very fun and educational reading some of the posts. Basically I have been smoking for about 3 years now. The first 1.5 years was 2 packs of Black and Milds a day, all inhaled. The second 1.5 years was Camel Crush, one pack a day, up until yesterday. I have tried to quit before, but I used an E-cig. After 2 months of that, I went back to cigs.

I have been trying to get back into cycling and losing weight, however i need to quit cigs first so I don't kill myself while doing cardio. (or from the cigs themselves!) Exactly 24 hours ago, 12:15am on 5/6/2013 I took my final drag. In the last 24 hours I haven't even wanted a cig. Why you say? After 3 hours on Youtube watching various videos, specifically Allen Carr's videos, I just ask myself why I want to smoke if I do get some sort or urge, and when I come up with no good answer to smoke, I simply . . don't smoke.

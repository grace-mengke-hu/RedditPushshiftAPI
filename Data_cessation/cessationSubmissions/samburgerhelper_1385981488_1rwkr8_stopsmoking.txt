33 hours in

I've been a pack a day smoker for 5.5 years and started smoking when I was 14, 9 years ago. 
Anyway, I've been subscribed to this sub for a few months now. I don't know what possessed me but on saturday I went on discretionary leave from work, drove 130 miles home to my parents,  and locked myself in. Oh, I also take 20mg Adderall 2 times daily. I've stopped that, for now, as well because the urge to smoke on that stuff is ridiculous.
It's odd how I can feel my fingertips and toes. 
The withdrawal is ok so far... my biggest issue is dealing with what seems to be an inability to concentrate. My biggest worry is driving. My car smells like an ashtray, and I've convinced myself for so many years that driving and smoking can't be done without the latter.
Meh. Feels like there's a lot of weird grammar on here but I don't care. Starting to feel restless. It's 5:47am. Any support or advice would be appreciated!

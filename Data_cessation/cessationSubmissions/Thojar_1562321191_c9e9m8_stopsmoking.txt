3 Years

It's been 3 years, what a journey...

  
Just making this post for both congratulate myself after 17 years of smoking, for having hold on to it, and also to cheer up and encourage you that are on this path. 

It has been hard at the beginning, and to be honest there are these (very rare now) moments where I could picture myself having one (never do that, not a single puff), but it is just SO GOOD to have kicked cigarettes out of my life.

  
Best to all of you.

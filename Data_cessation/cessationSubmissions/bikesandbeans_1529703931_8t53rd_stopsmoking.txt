First full day

So today is my first full day where I haven't had a single cigarette. I quit half way through the day yesterday and even though I've hit 24 hours already I feel more from getting the first full day out of the way. On a Friday where the stress levels are high at work. 
I did it. Filled with doubt for so long and feeling like I wouldn't be able to do it, I got through it. 

I posted yesterday when my mind was running wild over what was happening and reading everything that you lot wrote really made me not feel alone and like I really could do it. 

Thank you all. I just walked past the shop on my normal route where I would have a cigarette on the way down and pick up a fresh pack and didn't do either, it wasn't easy in fact it was so difficult I don't really know how I managed but I got past and didn't do it. 

I'll be around for a while now, you lot are life savers. Thanks for the advice and support.

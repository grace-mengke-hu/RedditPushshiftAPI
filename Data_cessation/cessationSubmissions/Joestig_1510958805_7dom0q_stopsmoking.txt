I will quit NOW. This time, for good!

It's 11.39 pm. I just had my last cigarette.

I have quit many times for many months over the last years. I don't consider myself a smoker anymore, but I do relapse a lot for weeks. To the point where I start doubting what I just said.

It isn't easy to quit after such a relapse, but it isn't as hard as it was when I quit after years of non-interupted smoking.

So, I just have to do it again. And I will do so now.

First, my focus will be just on quitting. After a few weeks, when I feel it's easy to not smoke, I will start reflecting on why I relapse every time and see what I can do at those moments.

What I know already: I relapse in stressful periods (so I need to work on my stress management), I relapse when I drink too much (so I need to figure out how I will handle that. Quitting alcohol seems too radical, I think this is the most difficult one to figure out) and I relapse when I am offered a cigarette in social situations.

That said, I don't relapse most of the times when I have those situations. Just some of the times, and that's enough to smoke 20% of the time of the year. Which is not something I want to do.

So, let's do this. I expect to feel weird, restless and irritable over the next week, but it's worth it.

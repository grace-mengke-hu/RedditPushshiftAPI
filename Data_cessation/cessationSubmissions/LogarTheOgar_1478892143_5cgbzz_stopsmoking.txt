I'm trying to distract myself from the thing I use to distract myself from myself XD

I just can't seem to quit for more than a week or so.

I don't even LIKE cigarettes. Every time I smoke one I get a little headache, and then 4 hours later I've smoke 5 of them and I feel like absolute garbage.

I decide "Oh man this is terrible." I destroy (wet) all of my cigarettes and throw them in the trash. I wake up, I feel good, my body eventually comes around and I don't feel like trash anymore. I got the rest of the day without smoking.

The next day I don't smoke, I go to the gym, everything feels great, I've got so much energy and my body doesn't feel like garbage. This is great.

AND THEN SUDDENLY BAM I GET CIGARETTES AND I'M SMOKING AND I'M LIKE WHYYY THO BRAIN WHY U DO DIS I DON'T EVEN LIKE THIS.

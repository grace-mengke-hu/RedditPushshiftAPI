Question about vape.

Hello you all wonderful and strong people who resist the urge to smoke.
I guess straight to point, i am 24 years old and i have been smoking cigarettes since i was around 15. In early october 2018 i decided that it was enough so i have been smoke free or rather cigarette free for 103 days now. 
Thing is have been vaping this whole time, so i have basically transferred from one bad thing to another. Can i even call my self non-smoker? Or am i still smoker that just dont stink like one? I do around 65ml with 3mg nicotine of fluid in a month.  Sorry but i dont know how u mesure those in America.
I would really like to hear some opinion about this, thanks.

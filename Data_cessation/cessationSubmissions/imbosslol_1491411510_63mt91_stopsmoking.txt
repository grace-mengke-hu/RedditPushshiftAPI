I quit Monday

I thought I would have cravings and quite honestly it's been the easiest thing I've ever done in life (knock on wood) it's been 4 days and I haven't been anxious or stressed surprisingly enough. I'm curious, I've had pains on my right side(between shoulder and pectoral) past few days when breathing. When would that stop because I read online it could be days or weeks but those sites aren't as reliable of sources as the people who post  on here.

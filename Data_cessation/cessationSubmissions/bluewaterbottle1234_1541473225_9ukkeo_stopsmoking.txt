Just subscribed to this subreddit to admit to myself that I need to quit smoking.

I’ve been a smoker since I was a teenager. On and off. I started smoking again to get along with my smoker husband. We used to fight a lot when I wasn’t smoking because I hated the way it smelled. I figured the only way to make it work was to join him. Now I’m addicted to it. I smoke around 5 cigarettes a day. I promised myself that I will be the best version of myself this year. And this is a step. I need to quit. 

I think the hardest part is not knowing what I’ll do with the time I usually spend smoking. I need something to preoccupy my brain. 

What worked for you? What didn’t? I assume folks here have been through this before. 

Thank you for your support. 🙏

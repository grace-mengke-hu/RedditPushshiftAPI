Quit for a full year, relapsed on Swisher cigars!

Hey guys I'm looking for some advice, but first let me frame the issue a bit.

I smoked cigarettes for almost 6 years. I was never a heavy smoker (roughly 2 packs a week). Last new years day I quit smoking with the help of nicotine patches. After quitting, I started running every day. I eventually worked my way up to running 3 miles at a time. I lost close to 50 pounds, so it was a very positive change!

However, I recently started my first "real" job. As a celebration, I decided to buy a cigar. I told myself that it would be a one time thing  but unfortunately it didn't turn that way. I started buying swishers everyday, and now have even started inhaling them. (I know this is terrible for my lungs...more so than traditional cigs. Worst of all, I have stopped running. I kind of feel like if I don't get control of this thing I might eventually make the progression to cigs.

I quit smoking a year ago with the help of nicotine patches. I smoke 1 swisher a day, I was wondering which nicotine patches you guys would suggest. I really want to quit, and get back to a healthier lifestyle.

2 weeks and going strong

Been smoke free for 2 weeks now and still having cravings at least 3 - 4 times a day but they don’t last too long. I can’t stop eating to try and tackle these cravings. Hope they will go away soon. Feeling good about my achievements so far it what is keeping me going. Good luck everyone who is quitting. We can all go it!

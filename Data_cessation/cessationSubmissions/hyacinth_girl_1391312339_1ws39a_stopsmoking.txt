Day 1 and I actually want to die

No exaggeration, and not much to put in the body.  I'm bipolar, I have an excessive amount of life stress recently, and I'm quitting again after a relapse in the late fall.  I'm home from work, I'm upsetting my fiance which makes him clam up which makes me feel crazier/clingier.  I'm just ready to be dead now.  But I guess that's better than smoking.  There isn't really anyone else I can say this to.

How to not instantly light up when driving

My SO and I are trying to quit (per usual) but we both are delivery drivers. Its so hard to be in and out of the car all day and not instantly light up a cig when I start my car. I was wondering if anyone had any advice since when I’m at work I can’t really go for a walk or exercise and I do t want to use food as a replacement for smoking like I’ve seen many people do

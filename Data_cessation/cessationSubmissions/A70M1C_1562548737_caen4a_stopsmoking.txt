I smell nice

33 years old been smoking since I was 18. I stopped smoking 5 days ago after reading Allen Carr's book. 

Was having a shit morning today. I went to cafe to get my normal coffee like I do every day. The girl behind the counter asked me what cologne i was wearing, and than told me I smelled very nice.

The thing is I have been wearing the cologne for years, no one has ever told me I smell nice or commented about it. Been  going to the same cafe for 8 years. This was the first time this girl has said anything to me besides "the usual" and "have a nice day"


Feels good man.

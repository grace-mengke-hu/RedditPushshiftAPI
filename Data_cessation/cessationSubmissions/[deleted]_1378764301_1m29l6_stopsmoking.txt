I will choose to love myself over slowly, and knowingly, attempting to kill myself.

I've quit before, but why do we fall? So we can learn more about picking ourselves up - maybe something, some piece of perspective we didn't have the last time.

Well, the title says it all. There is one choice - whether we are consciously aware that we are choosing it or not. My advice? Make it conscious, make it foremost in your mind - not just with smoking - that you will choose the ground upon which you stand.

We are all on the same path :)

EDIT:

I am glad you are all getting something out of it. It's simple, in concept, and very difficult in practice. :) All the best!

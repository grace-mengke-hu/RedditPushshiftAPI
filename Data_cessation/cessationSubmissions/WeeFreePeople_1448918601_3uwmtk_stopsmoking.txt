Is this it?

Hey Everyone! I have been lurking here for a while and just wanted to say thanks for sharing all your experiences and knowledge and well done for being such a supportive community - I found it valuable just to know that there are others going through the process quitting.

I haven't had a cigarette for 35 days, I have been using the e-cig and gum to see off the worst of the cravings, but this is the longest I have managed to avoid smoking in the 10+ years of my addiction. I know that I am still getting my nicotine fix this way, but it feels great physically and mentally to be not smoking and I feel that this will help in making that final break with nicotine. 

I was planning a steady reduction in nicotine up until Christmas when I would quit for good. I have time off work so it thought it would be a good chance not to have to focus on anything for a week or so.

I have found a natural decline in my nicotine intake and now I am starting to feel like its dragging it out. My only two concerns about going cold turkey sooner are an inability to focus at work and the chance of relapse having not quit the cigarettes for long. Overall I am very postive about my quite - Just a bit apprehensive about making that final jump!

Once again thanks for sharing fellow quitters!

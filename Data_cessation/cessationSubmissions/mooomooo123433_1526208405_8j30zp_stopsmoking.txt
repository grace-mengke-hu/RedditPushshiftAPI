Post 72hrs

I'm almost half day since I passed the 72hrs mark. Feeling a bit better, I'm more in control now. However, I can't stop coughing and I went online to listen to music as I went through couple of songs I found something I like "Post Malone" but he smokes in every music video he ever made and it's making the ride a bit tougher if I'm being honest.

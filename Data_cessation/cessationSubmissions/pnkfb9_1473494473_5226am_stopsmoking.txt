motivation to quit

Day 3 in here, my battle starts to kick in hard.

What is motivating me is that my brain has been chemically unbalanced for a looong time (8/9 yrs of smoking cigs and 2.5yrs stoner) and I do not want to live with a non-functional brain. 

Also I like to exercise, but until now my brain preferred to get its dopamine doses from cigs and weed. It's time to quit guys, fully functional brain, no fog, beat anxiety and start live a new life!

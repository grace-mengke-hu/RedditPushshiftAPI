Woke up feeling so disappointed!

Let me start by saying that I am not a man of moderation. For the past 12 years I have been heavily drinking and smoking. I smoked tobacco and cannabis but I have decided no more of anything. No caffeine (used to be a pot-a-day), no tobacco (10g/day), no alcohol (2-3 pints/day) and no cannabis (1g/day). So I'm around day 4 of abstinence from a few different things.
 
I was in a circle of friends last night and forgot what I was doing, I lost focus and started smoking tobacco joints and drinking whiskey! This was right after me and a few friends were involved in a shoot-out on the streets involving some well-known UK grime music artists. I had been shot in the shoulder but managed to grab the cash that was involved and drive the van we had stolen to a safe spot. 

Luckily it was all a dream! Damn recovery dreams! So vivid!

So I woke up, realised I hadn't relapsed, made a honey and lemon drink, took a hit of my nicotine free e-cig, and praised the Gods :D

Goodluck to everyone today

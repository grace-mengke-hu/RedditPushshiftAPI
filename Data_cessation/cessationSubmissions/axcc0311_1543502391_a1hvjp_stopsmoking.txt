Day 6

Started 3 years ago when I got dumped by my gf of 3 years. Filled the missing gap in life with cigarettes. Lots of them. Started with 1 every Friday, to 1 with drinks, to one with each drink, to everyday, to 5 times a day to god knows how many. 

Looking at the 3 year report card, there is not a single problem that the stick solved. I have stopped working out, gained 10kgs (90kg now), which I was pretty religious about for since 2011. I am still single. I hate how I smell, don't even have the confidence to approach women. I can't look my parents in the eye. My boss doesn't consider me a jewel anymore, than when he hired me.

This is not how I used to describe myself back is 2015. Its enough now. I am the one who decided to shit on my life then I decide now, to turn it around. I have made half hearted attempts in the past, but this is it. This is the real deal. 

I have had a mild headache for 48 hours straight now, but the idea of having that disgusting thing in my mouth again is repelling enough to discourage me. I am going strong. And i will punch through. 

All quitters out there. Don't quit quitting!

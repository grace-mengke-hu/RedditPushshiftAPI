Overwhelmed by app choices - favourites?

Have been lurking here for a while, you are all so inspiring! My quit date is approaching (June 1st, which is the day after my 25th birthday) and I am trying to prepare myself. I've found so many apps but the reviews all sound generic ("sooo helpful! very easy!") and I was hoping one of you brave folk had any more specific pros and cons of various quitting apps.
I am more nervous about quitting than I've ever been about public speaking, heights, or bees. Wish me luck!

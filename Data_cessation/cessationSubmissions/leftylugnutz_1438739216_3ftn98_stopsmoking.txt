Crashed earlier today. First accident I've ever been in

Freaking loved that car more then anything and I'm so sad and worried about how it will all work out. I haven't had urges or cravings and my rationale is saying one will help, or make me feel better, but I worry about my willpower. 

I just feel stupid. No one was hurt thankfully, but it was my fault, and my confidence is just shattered. So down right now. Figured I'd see if anyone could tell me what I already know before I consider going to bum one from my brother

:(

E: Thank you guys, even if you're reading and didn't leave a comment. Instead I played a game of league of legends, which I haven't done since I quit since it's when I smoked the most. After a game and an hour I feel a lot better. 

This sub really helped me today. I'm very appreciative

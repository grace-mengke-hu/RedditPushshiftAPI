Treat your cravings like a little bitch

Ok, so I've been about 2 weeks now without a cig. Feeling great, like superhuman almost. One thing that's helped me so far was that every time I felt a cigarette craving come on, I would say (out loud), "Fuck off! You little bitch! Think you can come into MY house and start shit? Fuck you!" I made sure there was no one else around so I didn't look Skitzo, but the craving would go away almost instantly. Try it out!

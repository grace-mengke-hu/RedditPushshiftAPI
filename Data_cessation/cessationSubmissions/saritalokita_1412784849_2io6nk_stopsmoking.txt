Doing OK so far

I had been wanting to quit for most of the year, but for whatever reason I just couldn't make it more than a day.  However, I had managed to go from a pack a day to less than a half a pack, so at least I had made progress.  I've also had a few changes recently: moved, new boyfriend, and starting running and doing triathlons last spring.  It finally clicked that I didn't want smoking to be part of my life anymore.  None of my new neighbors smoke (as opposed to the smoking community where I used to live), my SO doesn't smoke (he didn't make it a big deal, but I know he didn't like it), and it's really hard to smoke when you're trying to turn your body into a machine.  So that's it, I'm over it.  It really seems easy this time because it just doesn't make sense to smoke anymore.  I love myself (and my SO) way more than I love to light up, so I'm just not allowing it to be a part of my life anymore.  It's weird because I don't have any cravings or mood swings, haven't been snacking or coughing more than usual, and generally haven't had any of the "normal" side-effects of quitting.  Life is just going on normally, just much better because I'm not thinking about when I'm going to sneak a smoke.  Fingers crossed it will continue to be this easy and I hope you guys will be here for me if/when it gets hard.

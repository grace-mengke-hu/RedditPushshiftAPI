Thank you Ramadan.

So I have tried to quit my bad habit for a long time. I even posted here when I last tried to quit. Alas, the next day, I was back to smoke. I had accepted lung cancer as something that is coming in near future as I was unable to quit;  my 6 cigs to a pack and a half fluctuating binges. I looked forward to doing chores out side. I looked for excuses to get out of the house, only so I can smoke one more. I didn't expect it, but like every Ramadan I quit smoke for the day light hours and smoke after breaking my fast. Well, this time around, today is my fifth day and I have not touched a cigarette. I just did not go outside after I broke my fast. All I did was force my self into bed after breaking my fast. So I don't find a reason to go outside to smoke. Sorry for blabbering on and on, but I have to tell someone. Im choosing to not mention it to family members, until they notice, as in the past I have made them aware of my quiting intentions and I don't follow through. Wife has pretty much given up trying to get me to quit. So Im hoping to stick with this so I can finally give her the gift she's been asking for since we got married. 


EDIT: Thank you so much everybody. I cant express my gratitude enough to hear your support. I hope to be a regular on this sub. I also hope contribute more, and hopefully I too can support others with their struggles while keeping the support of this community.

The only reason I'm unsubscribing.

When I've been drinking and going on reddit, I see quite a few posts from the /r/stopsmoking crew. I'll be honest, my heart is with you and if I have to think about a cigarette any more while tipsy/hammered, it will not end well for me.

I'll be back but, I'm giving myself some space to move beyond the I-used-to-be-a-smoker to the I-will-never-smoke-again camp.

I'm on your team. You are worth it! I can't wait to celebrate your success when I check back in.

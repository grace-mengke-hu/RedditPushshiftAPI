About 24 hours in...

I've been a smoker since I was 15, and I turned 27 this year.

It's funny to be actively quitting, because I never thought I would.  I became so emotionally and mentally tied to my smoking that I had my parents even reluctantly buying me cigarettes before I turned 19 (legal age here).  I threw myself into being a full-time pack a day smoker even before I could fathom the downsides of the entire situation. 

I have a heinous headache today, along with some shakiness and a sore feeling everywhere.  I know that nicotine withdrawals can cause flu-like symptoms and I already was having some seasonal allergies before I stopped so I think it's compounded.  I just laid down after breakfast and fell asleep breathing in, breathing out.  I feel really lazy but I'm letting myself feel that way today because this shit is totally not easy.  

My boyfriend says he can breathe for MILES, and he's a huge reason I'm quitting.  He has literally made me jealous now that he's quit for two weeks; everything he eats, when he sings, when he's doing physical work, he yaks about the changes he's experiencing since quitting.  I want to experience those positive changes too!

I've been smoking about half my life, so why shouldn't I try and see what the other side feels like?  Maybe I'm a marathon runner and never knew it!  Maybe I can sing opera but I never had enough breath!  I should try glassblowing or playing the trumpet!  

Long story short, I'm only 24 hours in and oh my goodness I want this.

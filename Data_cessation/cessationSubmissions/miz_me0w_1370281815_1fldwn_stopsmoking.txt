Validation received, the kick in the butt I needed.

I completed the Tough Mudder in Pennsylvania yesterday. My group completed it in 4 hrs. 10 miles, with obstacles in between.  And I'm here to post that I didn't wheeze, puke or die!! 

Before sunday, I was battling cravings and urges (never giving in to them), but this victory will stick out in my mind whenever a craving tries to interrupt.

Point of the post = pick a fitness goal that has a pay out! I framed my number tag and put the headband above my tv. I will look at what I accomplished and overcome the urge to smoke!

Going onto day 7....Big TY to this sub...

Half way through my first day of quitting a week ago i was losing my mind.  Trying to kill time during one of what seemed like an endless amount of cravings I came across this sub by fluke. 

Since then every hour, every day has been so much easier.  Knowing that there are so many people out there who have quit for around the same amount of days as me and are experiencing the same things is incredibly comforting and encouraging.  Reading posts and comments from those of you with badges in the hundreds of days gives me something to look forward to. 

I don't think I would have even made it this long without you guys, so TY to all of you. 

FUCK THIS WASTE OF MONEY, POISONOUS CRAP!!!! Don't want it, don't NEED it!! 

Saying no to every craving is like a mini victory and a boost to my confidence. Because of the strength, tips, and lessons learned from all of you I was able to go out this weekend (not smoke), go to my boring uninspiring job everyday (not smoke) and live my life without an anchor anymore. 

To everyone fighting the fight, keep up with it... Lean on the people here and you will not be let down. 

Congrats to everyone!!

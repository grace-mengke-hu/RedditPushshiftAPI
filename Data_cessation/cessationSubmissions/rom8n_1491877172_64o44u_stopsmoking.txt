Help me figure this out

Tomorrow is my 29th birthday and I have... 5 or 6 pack years on me. 

One of the reasons I started smoking was because it turns out I'm allergic to caffeine, and I was in college, and really needed a stimulant. Plus, was a part of theater program and wanted to have enough energy to do everything I wanted to do. 

I started slow, got addicted, have got disgusted at cigarettes, and stopped periodically (anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months). I've always felt like when I came back to smoking it was always a desire to (I liked it, makes me fidget less, gives me routine and rituals). 

But now I really want to quit. The problem is I have brachicardia (heart pumps too slow). I had a doctor check it out and said essentially I could go on medicine to keep my heart up (essentially amphetamines), could take pills for my caffeine allergy  (would need antidepressants) or keep smoking. Why, you ask? Because when I stop smoking I tend to faint because my bp falls too low, or my bpm. 

I'm trying to go to gym to cardio to strengthen my heart, but my heart gives out before my body does. So... I smoke between sets (so bad, I know).

I just need support through this. Help me figure this out if you can. Or motivate, please. 

Thank you.

44 days and I’m being tested

I haven’t smoked in 44 days. 

I’m really proud of myself and I know I can keep going because I am stronger than my addiction. 

But right now, I’m really being tested. I’m feeling terrible about myself, stressed out at work and filled with self defeating negative thoughts. And there’s this little voice saying “you’re such a worthless piece of crap you feel so bad right now you should just smoke because it would make you feel better. You’re so worthless anyway you might as well smoke because you don’t deserve to be healthy.”  

And I know it’s wrong. And I know I can fight this. But I need some help right now, I need to hear a voice louder than this stupid one in my brain right now.

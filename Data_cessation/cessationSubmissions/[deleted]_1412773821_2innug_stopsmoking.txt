Weird tip: Good electric toothbrush helps satisfy the oral craving with smoking.

This is a weird tip I discovered today. I have been using a regular toothbrush for years but my wife always said the electric was better, and now that I quit smoking I wanted to get my teeth whiter so I agreed. She bought me a really good electric toothbrush, the Oral B "professional". I emphasize getting the good quality kind because it does a fantastic job stimulating the gums too, which I find weirdly satisfying, making me brush a lot. It's a great fix for the oral craving with smoking. And the extra clean mouth prevents the desire to smoke too. Weird, but maybe it will be helpful to someone :)

How can I as a girlfriend, help my boyfriend with his struggle to quit smoking once and for all?

My boyfriend is 41 and he said he's been smoking since he was about 12 years old. He's noticed the friends his age don't even smoke and think it's gross. Plus, him and I are in a extreme sport together and he wants to live longer and not die to cigarettes. So he has some motivation. We've only been dating a few months and a few months ago he said he wanted to stop smoking for me. I told him he should do it for himself. I never noticed his cigarette smoke before we started dating and I've never said anything about it either. I used to smoke when I was younger for like 4 years and I quit cold turkey. 

I know since he's been smoking so long that it's going to be hard for him to quit. He said he was going to quit smoking for me a few months ago, and yesterday he told me he was going to quit smoking next Monday. I'm afraid he's doing this for me and I expressed my concerns and he said he wants to do it for himself. I just don't want it to be like him lying to me about quitting smoking just so he can impress me. What can I do to make this easy on him? We are both going to go through his house and take out all the triggers. Is it okay for him to have a lighter because he likes candles? No, he really does love candles, haha, so it's not a cop out.

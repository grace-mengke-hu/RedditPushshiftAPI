Day 8

I smoked my last cigarette last Wednesday. I used nicotine gum to help me transition and had my last gum last Tuesday so right now I'm pretty much nicotine free and I feel great, which is kind of strange because I'm not experiencing any physical withdrawal symptoms, anyone had that as well???

I struggle more with the psychological symptoms where I would crave the "act" or habit of smoking, but I just snack on something, reward myself with a treat and wait for it to pass. 

Needless I can feel the weight adding up in real time. but here's to being healthy and hopefully never smoke again!

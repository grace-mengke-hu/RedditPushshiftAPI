Fear of Alcohol.....

Hi all, 

Since quitting 11 days ago I haven't really been out drinking a large amount of alcohol - I have had few here and there and even after two pints the temptation to smoke was HUGE (but I managed to resist thanks to a supportive girlfriend leaving the party early just to help me not want to smoke).

Any tips on how I get over the Alcohol = crazy amount of smokes out of my head because I don't want to keep missing out on nights out because of this!!

Its really sad to say it but right now going out and partying just doesn't have the same appeal without the thought of both a drink and a smoke in my hand, I know that probably sounds stupid but I wander if anyone else feels the same, as I want to be able to have a good time and not feel like I am having less of a good time because I cant smoke along with drink - I look around at non smokers and they seem to be able to do it, but for me smoking and drinking in tandem was one of the best part about going out!!

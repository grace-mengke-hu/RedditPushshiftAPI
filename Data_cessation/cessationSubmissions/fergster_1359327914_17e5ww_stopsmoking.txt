Does anyone feel depressed after they quit smoking?

I quit smoking on the 2 January after 16 years of being a pack a day smoker. I had quit before for months at a time but I always made a conscious decision to start again. I'm 34 now.

The thing is though, I love(d) smoking. I've been smoke free for 4 weeks on Tuesday and I miss it. I'm over the worst of the cravings, I now know how to cope if they attack (fists with the toes and count down from 300).

But, I miss the cigarette in the morning with a cup of coffee sitting out the back garden watching the squirrels, I miss the last cigarette at night standing outside listening to the crickets and bugs. I miss sitting on the dock watching the boats having a cigarette.

I was never one for thinking I looked cool smoking (stop deluding yourself if you do), I was never a social smoker (I hate smoking in front of other people). For me smoking was a time of quiet contemplation and without it, I feel I am bottling things up and issues are not getting resolved.

I felt I was more productive if I could look forward to having a cigarette and things got resolved more quickly. Now, I'm just getting depressed and issues are affecting my judgement.

Anyone else thinking like this or is it just me?

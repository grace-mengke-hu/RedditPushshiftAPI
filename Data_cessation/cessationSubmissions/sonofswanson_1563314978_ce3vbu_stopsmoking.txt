First doctors appointment after 37 days...WOW!

Blood pressure back in the acceptably healthy range, resting heart rate is down to exactly 60. Lung function better than ever and oxygen levels are exactly where they should be for age. I cannot believe how empowering going to the doc and getting those results has been, as well as all the encouragement from med staff/docs. For all those struggling today...hang in there, YOU ARE WORTH IT!

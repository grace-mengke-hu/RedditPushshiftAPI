I swear.. I'm going to be one of those people that die of cancer while smoking a cigarette.

I do not know why I cannot win this battle with my brain. I have quit some other substances that were probably 100 times harder to quit than smoking yet.. Here I am.. Smoking... Still... Maybe it's because the other things were illegal and there was open support groups (NA/AA meetings) and there is a bigger stigma attached to those things.. I don't know.

What I do know is no matter how hard I try. The longest I've gone with out smoking is about 7 hours. I get panic attacks like you wouldn't believe. I start thinking of suicide and wanting to end the suffering. It's pretty freaking over dramatic and I don't know WHY this happens to me.

I have tried patches, medication, vaping, gum. Nothing works. That anxiety creeps up on me and I can't handle it. There was a time in my life that I ended up spending 45 days in jail. While being in jail there is absolutely no way that you can get cigarettes.  Your every waking moment in life is controlled by the guards there. I didn't have these issues. I didn't even crave a cigarette. Not once. My gums got better, I could breathe better... 45 days was the easiest I have ever endured. Then of course, I get released and the first thing I did was smoke a cig... I didn't even care about quitting back then though. 

Should I go get myself arrested and see if I can't spend a month in jail again? This is where I'm at. I don't know wtf I'm going to do. Smoking has offically takens it's toll on my health and is now causing me actual problems that I need to take medications for. You'd think I would quit, but it has no effect on me. I just keep going "Oh I'll quit tomorrow." --I know many will say stop making excuses and quit but, it's not WORKING.. Nothing is working! Oh my god I don't want to die of a heart attack.

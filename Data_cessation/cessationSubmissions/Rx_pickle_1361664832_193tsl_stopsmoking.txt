Time to quit - What helped you the most?

Hey! I am looking for a support group to quit, and I hope I have found it!

I have been smoking for 7 years now, and have made multiple attempts to quit. I have tried chantix, patches, gum, etc. So far minimal success.

The pack I am smoking from now is my last. I plan to quit first thing tomorrow morning! Wish me luck!

Do you have any advice for quitting? What helped you the most while quitting?

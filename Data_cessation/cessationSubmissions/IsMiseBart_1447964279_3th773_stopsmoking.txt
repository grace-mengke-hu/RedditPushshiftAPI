Constant Relapse help

So like many people I've decided to give up smoking many times and.. well it never goes too well. I get to maybe 6:30p.m. after a hard days work before my cravings get so bad I just need one. My real problem is that when I feel like I need ot think something through, I'll do it with a cigarette. I just cannot seem to get through this habbit. Anyone got suggestions other than chewing gum or patches or e-cigs?

Struggling as well

Well hello there!

I'm sick and tired of it. I'm done being chained to nicotine and done with always craving at moments I can't have a smoke.

Tried to quit. Numerous times. Cold turkey, patches, tablets, e-cig... It just won't work for me. Even when I get just as much nicotine in my body as with smoking, I still crave for a cigarette. Went to the doctor for help. She looked at Champix, but that's not wise due to other medication. This week I had another appointment, when I walked in I could proudly say I had already quit for 3 days. Today, day 8, I fell back into the bad habit.

I really would like to try again tomorrow morning. Cold turkey, most people say that's the best way. 3 days going crazy and then it will slowly go better.

Anyways, checking in. Hope I can learn something from all of you.

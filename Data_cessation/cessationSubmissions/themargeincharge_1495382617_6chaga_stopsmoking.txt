Day one. Help.

I am a 13 year smoker. It just got heavy over the last year or so. 1.5-2 packs a day. 

A few years ago I quit for about a month. At the time my sister quit too and she actually quit for good. Now she's super judgy every time I light up. (Funny story... she quit. Convinced herself she could have just one per day. Smoked one then shit herself in the grocery store.)

Next month I'm going to London and Paris with my sister. Long flights. Eight hours there and 14 hours home (connecting flight in Istanbul). As excited as I am for this trip, anxiety had set in.  I was envisioning that last cigarette at the airport and putting it out just knowing I wouldn't have another one in a very long time. I was panicking thinking about being five hours into my 14 hour flight and wanting a smoke and not being able to have it. I searched Amazon for nicorette gum. Don't people use that on flights???  As I was browsing the gum, it just hit me... JUST QUIT.  Just quit and solve all your damn problems.  I'm tired of it controlling me. I don't want to be on a trip or a lifetime constantly trying to find a place to light up or stressed when I can't have one. 

I smoked my last pack last night. I woke up ready to do this. I'm at work now and dying to smoke.  I'm drinking some Yogi Dextox tea. Hoping to get it out of my system. I read someone else post about how puffing on a straw helps. It does. Sort of. All I want to do is step outside and light up.  

Some other reasons are:
Tired of smelling bad
Parents don't know. Yes. I am almost 31 and I hide it from them. This makes spending a day with them hard and family vacations out of the question. 
I LOVE MONEY AND I LITERALLY LIGHT IT ON FIRE

I leave in 39 days. Should the worst of this be behind me then?  I don't want to have a miserable trip craving a cigarette the whole time. Did I do the right thing?

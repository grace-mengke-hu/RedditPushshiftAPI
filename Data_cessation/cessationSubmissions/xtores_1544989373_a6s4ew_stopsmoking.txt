1 year and 2 month 420 days.

hello guys.

i just want to share my experience with you. i tried hard to quite before .i try to reduce like 3 cigarette a day or only smoke in my room but didn't work. 
So if you want to quite .just throw it and stop. you didn't born with cigarette in hand so you can live with it . just put in your mind and convince yourself that you don't smoke and never did. 
i know it is hard the first month but after it will be easy .
you control your mind .and then you will feel the difference.
good luck just remember you  control your mind .
and now i look forward for no fap with me best

[UPDATE] to my earlier post about not being able to see my badge. I am using RES.

Original post:https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2ylf7t/so_i_got_a_badge_about_a_month_agowhere_can_i_see/

There is an option in preferences to "show user flair."  click that and then BAM!  Badges visible!

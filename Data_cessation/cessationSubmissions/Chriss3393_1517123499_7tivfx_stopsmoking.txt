I need help!!

I’ve thought about quitting.  So many times. I have the patch, which totally helps - when I remember to put it on. I “quit”, again, 5 days ago. I’ve slipped up, again. I have no other vices- I don’t drink on a regular basis, I’ve never done any type of drug. I smoke. I smoke when I’m stressed, I smoke when I’m social, I smoke when I’m alone. I am a smoker. Half the time, I don’t even really enjoy it, yet I still do it. Whenever I’m quitting, I’m a few days in, its like I’ve lost a friend. Sounds weird, I know. Anyways, I’m trying again tomorrow. Resetting the clock. I hope I can do it.

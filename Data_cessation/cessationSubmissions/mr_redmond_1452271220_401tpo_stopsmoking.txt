Time to quit ... again

So, this will be my first hour without a cigarette. I'm equip with nicorette quickmist, some chewing gums, and will power.

I'm sick of smoking and the problems it causes. Today I walked 3 miles, and got out of breath a good number of times. I'm 31. As soon as I got into town I decided it's time to stop. I've been smoking on and off since I was 13. I've quit for a year before and then started again. This time I am not going to give in. I am getting older and can't afford to deal with health problems later in life.

The smell that lingers is disgusting. I seem to get this slimy crap in my mouth after smoking and it makes me feel dirty and horrible. I wake up and have to spend 10 minutes brushing my tongue, which causes me to nearly be sick every time.

So, here goes. I am posting this purely for myself so in time to come I can look back on how I felt whenever I get the temptation to smoke.

Edit - Day One
==========

It's been almost 24 hours. Not touched a smoke. I've been using my nicorette mist but to be honest I don't use it too often. It makes my stomach feel gassy and sick. I woke up this morning and felt alive. Usually when I get up I grab a smoke and I feel shattered again for the next hour. Today I had non of that. I actually feel clean inside.

I've had no breathlessness when running up the stairs. Usually I get that for a couple of moments. Non at all today. I am coughing a little more this morning, but that's probably the s**t coming out.

I haven't felt like a cigarette once. They are disgusting things that make my clothing and hands stink! The smell is revolting. I couldn't smell any of this whilst I smoked. My girlfriend smokes, and when she had a smoke this morning all I could smell was an astray. Kissing her is literally like kissing an astray after she has smoked.

Day one nearly done :D Wooot. I can do this.

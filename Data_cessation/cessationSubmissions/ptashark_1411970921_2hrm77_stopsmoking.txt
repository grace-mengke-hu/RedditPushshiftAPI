Found a pack today.

So this morning while getting dressed for work I saw a pack in the back of my closet, which is pretty weird since that wasn't where my cigarettes used to be. I picked it up and it was basically a full pack! One missing. It must have been there for two months at least. 

I didn't feel the need to smoke it, not even a little pang. Chucked it in my bar area for my buddies who still smokes. Felt too bad to throw a whole pack away, shit was expensive.


Self control bitches! it works!

Attempt number 10.

Hello folks,
I quit cold turkey today. I've been a smoker for 15 years. I no longer want to be a smoker. I want to be a nonsmoker. I definitely don't want to still be smoking by my 30th birthday. I started the C25K program tonight. The breathless moments helped the cravings. Do I get a badge or something? I feel a little loopy and am not looking forward to the crazy dreams that are on their way. Thank you for listening.

 My husband has never smoked and definitely doesn't understand my feelings or aggitated state.

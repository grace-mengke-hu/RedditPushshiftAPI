Break out the ban hammer because I've decided to stay.

hi u/Armison.  I was going to leave you guys to the love fest you got going in this sub but decided otherwise. Why? Partly because I'm bored, partly because I want to try and help and partly because u/Armison doesn't know what the word 'literal' means.  

**why quitting for some people shouldn't be a choice**

Everyone on this sub has either quit already or are toying with the idea of it.   

Those that have not quit but are contemplating doing so have a choice, keep on choofing away, one day you will be ready , one day you will realise that you don't need it , or , you will continue to smoke either way it is your choice.    

Those that are using NRT (Gum , Vapor,  patch), well you guys still have a choice because  you are still ingesting Nicotine.  It doesn't really matter if you have the occasional cigarette here and there because the withdrawals won't be anywhere near as strong when you stop again because of the NRT

The rest of you fuckers ,  the ones who have gone cold turkey, the ones who have realised the true nature of your addiction,  **we do not have a choice** . You have to completely remove from your mind any notion  that smoking is a choice for you any longer.

Why? Because  your brain is very good at tricking you, very adept at deceiving you into getting what it wants and it wants nicotine.

Now , for those of you here that preach the 'Choice' option you have already put in your mind that smoking is an option.  If you have to choose between two things , then those two things are now equally valid options.  Everytime a craving hits, you have to go through the same thought process as you did when you first quit  "Should I have one....no I've quit....but just one won't hurt......no I choose not to smoke. ......just have one tonight and then stop tomorrow. .." So fuckimg tiring  

Once you have quit , and you know what addiction is then you know that one cigarette is a deal breaker.  You know it is not an option because it will only take one to send you back down the spiral. It is no longer a choice. **You do not have the luxury of Choice anymore** because you do not have any options. The only option you have is to acknowledge the urge/craving, acknowledge that it exists  and is your punishment for a lifetime of ignorance and acknowledge the fact that you no longer smoke.  You don't have to choose, you don't have to spend your time debating yourself whether to smoke or not. It is not an option so just move on.   

Do you spend time and energy deciding not to shoot heroin?  No? It is not an option , that is why.

22 days smoke free and hitting a major rough patch, helpful suggestions please?

I quit smoking 22 days ago and besides coughing terribly for over a week I haven't had any issues. My mood wasn't changed, I never had any cravings and avoided things that might cause me to crave (going out drinking, being around other smokers) however 4 days ago I started using a new pain medication prescribed by my doctor for my back issues. I didn't think the medication would cause any changes but ever since I started taking it I've been in an extreme funk, incredibly hostile, random fits of rage and I cry all the time, all I want to do is smoke! I still don't know for sure if the medication has anything to do with this or its just from not smoking. I am a front end manager at a grocery store, I have one cashier that has always gotten under my skin and today she really really got to me to the point where I drove to a gas station on my lunch break with every intention of buying a pack of smokes and throwing all my hard work away. I sat in my car in the gas station parking lot for about 10 minutes, changed my mind and decided it wasn't worth it and drove away. What are ways you've dealt with stress to avoid going back to smoking?

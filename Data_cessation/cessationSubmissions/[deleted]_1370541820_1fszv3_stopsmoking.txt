Anyone used the EASYWAY audiobook?

Been trying to quit smoking for the last few days. Each time I caved and bought cigarettes, this is fucking expensive u guise.

I always see recommendations of EASYWAY on here. Frankly, I hate reading as I don't have the patience to flicker through hundreds of pages for 10 hours. Therefore I'm listening to the audiobook instead. Who here has quit, just by listening to it? Do you think it delivers just as well as the book?

Some improvements I'd like to share

Sober since almost four weeks brings some other advantages:

- smoke free since 3 weeks
- weed free since 3 weeks
- more money in my pocket 
- overall improved energy
- I fall asleep so quick, earlier in my life I thought something is wrong because it always took me so long
- overall improved mood
- more chill, more relaxed 

Feel free to add things which are valid for you :)

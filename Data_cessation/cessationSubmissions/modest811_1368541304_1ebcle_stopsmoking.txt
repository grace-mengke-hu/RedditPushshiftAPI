Obligatory 100 day smoke free update!

Wow, that flew by, but at the same time it feels like a long time.

I hardly think about smoking anymore. Has my life been 100% dandy and carefree since quitting smoking? No, but things could be worse. 

Quitting smoking is one of the best things I've ever done, the amount of money I've saved is unreal. Keep it up guys, it is really worth it.

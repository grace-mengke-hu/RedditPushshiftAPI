Advice from the community

I am a smoker.
I managed to stop smoking when my child was born (I was then in Singapore) , only to pick it up again 5 years later during divorce. I now live in Japan, where my son lives. 

I moved recently to iQos (similar to vaping , but with much less smoke, and milder smell).

I would really like to to stop, but face the following issues :

- pretty much all restaurants are smoking areas

- all my clients (and most coworkers) do smoke. A large portion of the client relationship building occurs over dinner and drinks. Typically smoke dens.

How would you guys recommend approaching a stop? Hard stop vs soft stop. I am particularly fearing the temptation linked to the environment. 

I also noticed that many of you use the same app;  does it help?

I have immense respect for you guys who had the strength to go through this. I am finding myself wondering how to approach it.

Thanks in advance for your insights!

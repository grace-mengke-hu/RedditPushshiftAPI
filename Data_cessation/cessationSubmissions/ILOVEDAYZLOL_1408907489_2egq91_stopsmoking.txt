I quit 9 days ago, I'm 2 seconds away from buying a pack.

Can anyone give me a reason not to? I'm thinking that 1 more pack won't hurt, especially if I only smoke 2-3 a day. I've been smoking for 2 years, so it isn't like 1 more pack will do very much harm. I don't even have enough money to buy another pack after that. I live with my mom, i'm in school, and I don't have a job. So There is no way I can buy another pack. My mom will not buy me cigs, which is why I quit in the first place. I didn't have enough money to buy more.

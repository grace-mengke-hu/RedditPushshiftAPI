Is it a bad idea to use the patch every other day?

I've finally made the decision to quit smoking. It's only been 2 weeks but I'm still super proud of myself. I've been using the patch and it's been really helpful. I've once gone a day without it because I accidentally left it at home and I was surprisingly fine. Don't get me wrong, I had cravings but I fought the urges off. I think I should start trying to veer off of them because that'll be less nicotine going in my body. Am I getting ahead of myself here?


Do you think it's a good idea to use the patch every other day? It'll take longer to finish the box unless I quit them all together. Should I just follow the two month plan instructions to use it everyday? 


Oh yeah, has anyone else had fucking terrifying nightmares with the patch?

Vaping is not a good alternative in my experience

My new years resolution is to stop vaping.   I quit cigs in 1999 but started vaping in 2014 during the last semester of my masters degree.  I've quit a couple of times during 2018, once for 2 months and once for a week. Ugh I want to be free from this thing that saps my energy and wastes my time.

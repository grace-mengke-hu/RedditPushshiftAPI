500 days!

After 12 years as a smoker: 500 days of non-smoking - 10000 cigarettes not smoked, 2000 Euros saved.

Not looking for upvotes - just wanted to post it (because I'm happy about it and) because I want to encourage everyone who is trying to quit. Just do it. Not next week, not on the first of some month, not on your/his/her birthday - now. Do it now. Trust me, it is the only way.

Good luck!

01/15/2019 (or day #13)

So, how are you all doing today? How are the cravings? How many packs of cigarettes have you crushed in your dreams? Or in real life?  

I'm still sick with the flu. My weird, vivid dreams are back with full force and they are disturbing as f'ck. I lie awake a lot and am so tired. But I haven't smoked! I haven't smoked since 01/02/2019, 10pm. So I've got that going for me.  
It's a bloody reminder of the crap I've put in my body for so many years. The poisoning I've put my brain through, intentionally even. It's insane. It's even more insane that this drug is legal, as long as you're over 18. It's addictive and stupid and deathly and for some reason I picked it up 15 years ago. 15 years of intentional neglect and torture of my own body. Never again.  
I don't care how many dreams the addicted part of my brain throws at me. I don't care how disturbed I am when I wake up. Never again. Not one cigarette. Not one puff. Never.

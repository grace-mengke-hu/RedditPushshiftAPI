I'm struggling, any helpful advice is welcome.

Im clean for 2 days now. And that's not uncommon for me but that's the most usual time i relapse. I'm staying at my parents house for the winter break so it makes it kinda easy if i don't go out of the house because they don't know i smoke. And that's the thing, I'm in my room 2 straight days now with a TONS of college work and I'm going crazy. And if i go out i can only go to bars because its heavily raining whole week, and its a small town with a habit of drinking coffees during the day and beers during the night, all my friends who i would go with are smokers and if i step outside im afraid im going to definietly relapse and i don't want to throw another 2 days of my life i tried and felt miserable for no reason.

My will power is great. In theory. As soon as you put a cig in front of me it swallows me whole.

I would really like some kind words and advices because i failed more then 100 times and it's starting to kill me inside.

2 Days In - Should Have Listened to My Mom

After my second or third cigarette, when I was 17, my mom smelled me and asked if I'd been smoking. I said no, lied and told her my friend was. She got this odd look on her face and told me she wished she could explain how addictive they were, that she'd rather I smoke weed than cigarettes.

It's five years later and two days into my quit and I JUST remembered this happened. Sorry Mom! Should've realized you knew better.

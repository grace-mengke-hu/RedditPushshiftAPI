How long does it take for lung function to return to normal?

I tried to go running yesterday and couldn't even last a minute because my lungs were on fire. I didn't realize how bad my lung capacity has gotten and I want to be able to run so I'm going to try to quit. I'm just wondering if anyone knows roughly how long it will take for my lungs to repair themselves? Possibly relevant information: I smoke about a pack a day or half a pack a day and have been smoking for ~7 years. Thanks.

Quit before; want to quit again. Failing hard.

Does quitting count if you've restarted? Anyway. 

I've been a pack-a-day smoker for years and a few months ago, I read this self-help book and cold-turkeyed cigs. I was psychologically miserable but otherwise fine. Had an incident that made me a little self-destructive and the first thing I did was go to the gas station and grab a pack. That was two months ago. Been smoking ever since.

The knowledge and desire to quit is there, but the impulse is kicking my ass. I finished my "last one" last night, then immediately went to the store this morning to buy a pack. 

Think I should mention that I'm also tapering down a strong benzo and everyone is telling me that "now is not the time" to quit, but every cigarette that I smoke is doing more damage. (Plus it's a stimulant and probably ramping up my anxiety.) 

That said! Any advice on how to just cold-turkey again without flipping out and going to buy a pack in the morning? I know it's all about willpower and I have that. I mean, getting off of benzos is no joke, so if I can do that I don't understand why smoking is owning me this way.

Passed 30 days and didn't even realize

I passed 30 days and I didn't notice! Haven't had a craving in days! :-) 

The toughest times for me are when drinking. Had a party here the other day and a lot of people were smoking, even my non-smoker boyfriend had one, and I kinda wanted one, until he kissed me and I almost threw up in my mouth. What the eff was past me thinking? It was gross!

Hi guys, I made a free stop smoking app for Android, looking for beta testers

I originally made this app for quitting drinking, but then I saw that it could equally be used for quitting smoking. 

The app has a calendar with colour codes so you can visually track how many cigs you've smoked throughout the day, and it also has a smoke-free streak counter. 

There's also 700 quotes from people who are going through the same hell, so you can scroll through these quotes when you're having a craving or something :) Thanks so much to everyone here who contributed their wisdom!

The free version includes all functionality and 100 quotes, and I also made a paid version with all 700 quotes because frankly, I could really use the money... Don't worry, I won't get rich of this anytime soon ;)

I'm also working on an iOS version and on a widget, money-saved counter and short diary/note per day for the Android version.

You can find the app here:

I would really appreciate any feedback! Also, if you like it, please rate it in the Play store!

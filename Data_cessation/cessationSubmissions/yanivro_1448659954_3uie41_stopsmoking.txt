One year!

Omg guys , I can't believe I reached so far , if you'd ask me a year ago if I'd make it , I'd say "No way! " 

Well guess what , **surprise motherf*cers** , I made it!   

Never felt better!

Thank you guys for being here at the first weeks when I was going simply mad without my cigs.

I owe you guys so much.

Take care until we meet again.

3rd day, but Friday

Really trying here but having people near me smoking while I'm having a drink isn't the most pleasant thing to get through. At least I know I would've usually give up by now but I'm standing strong and fighting through the craving. For everyone that is going to read this, stay strong!! It only gets harder, but you need to stay motivated and fight, fight like you never fought before.

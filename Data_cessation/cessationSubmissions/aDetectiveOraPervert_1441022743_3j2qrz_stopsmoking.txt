Delighted with progress but struggling with weight gain.

I should have been prepared for this. I had read about it beforehand but just thought that I would be able to deal with it. Not suddenly half of my shirts don't fit because I've gained over a stone since I began three months ago. Does anyone have any suggestions, maybe even other subs that might be able to help? I've started to do 12km walks in the evenings over the course of two hours and am hoping that'll help some. Being more careful with my eating habits too.

I guess we're all kind of crazy

I'm coming to realize that the only reason I ever smoked was to stave off nicotine cravings, which suck. But that leads to the inevitable question, why did I pick up in the first place? I suppose I thought smoking was cool....

But why did I pick up again after I had years of clean time? I have no clever answer there. I'm an addict, as much as I hate to admit that to myself, and I'll do insane things for no good reason. Sometimes that leads me back to here, which for today is nicotine cravings and having to think about not going to the store to buy cigs. 

But I'm here. I made it here. All I can hope for is that I stay for TODAY and I'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow. Every day, I'm going to choose not to smoke for the next 24 hours. If I succeed, I'll love myself. If I fail, I'll love myself. Here's hoping I succeed, because I have a million good reasons not to smoke and the only reason I would ever smoke is to stave off nicotine cravings. 

Good luck to everyone who's not smoking today! We can do this!

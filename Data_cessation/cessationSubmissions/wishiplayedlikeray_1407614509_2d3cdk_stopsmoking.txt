I didn't think I was a smoker, started vape and now I crave...

So I am a musician and have worked in music retail among other things and so I was around smokers fairly often. I would rarely smoke for real. Someone would offer me a cig and if puff on it like a pipe without inhaling. Fast forward a bit and I eventually got to liking the inhaling more and would smoke maybe a cigarette or two a week socially with people but wouldn't buy them myself. About 6 months ago I started buying my own and smoking them about once a day plus more in social situations. My wife called me out on it and I figured okay I can stop. For me it felt more like I enjoyed just the act of smoking.. The smoke in my lungs and breathing it out in a cool cloud... I know this makes me sound like a weird teenager but I'm 27... Anyway, my thought was that I didn't really need the cigs so I got an e-cig to still be able to have that vapor but not the awful smell and taste that my wife didn't like. 

What I discovered this weekend was troubling. I ran out of vape stuff and I have been incredibly irritable. My wife is mad at me and wants me to quit because she thinks it's some sort of self loathing thing. Turns out, after I thought about it for awhile... The e-cig actually made me more addicted I think. It allowed me to puff on some nicotine through out the day. I didn't have to go outside or wait to drive home from work. I could have it all the time. Truth is I don't really want to feel attached to anything like this. I want to quit. So... Here I am... 

I had this feeling that if I was going to quit I wanted to smoke one last real cigarette and I went to the store and bought a pack. I just finished the second one as I'm typing this up and when I hit submit I'm throwing the rest of the pack away. I don't know what I'm asking for... I don't know if I have questions yet... I'm just writing this all down... Thanks for reading.

TLDR: I quit smoking when I posted this...

It's getting mighty close to my quit date

On February 9th, I had my last drink. The day after, I set my quit smoking date to April 9, two months after I stopped drinking. My logic was that with sobriety, I'd be strong enough to do it.

Well, I'm still sober, and 4/9 is coming up quick. I've been counting the days on my refrigerator whiteboard and it's barely more than two weeks away.

I need to quit this time, though. I can't delay any longer. 4/9 is the last day I will smoke.

I'm worried about the temptation, though. I'm worried about the little smoker demons which have always come back to me before, even when I had quit upwards of two months. I'm worried about my vape, I don't know if I should toss it or just get nicotine free juice to hold me over (or if that would even work or just make things worse).

I'm scared. I bought Allen Carr's book, and I'm going to read it on the days leading up to my quit, and I hope and pray it'll work the wonders for me that it seems to have for other people, but I don't know if that's hogwash or if I am too cynical to buy in.

I really hate being a smoker. I really really hate it. I hate my weak lungs, I hate the smell, the cost, the gross ashtray on my porch. I hate that girls are grossed out by it, and to be honest I hate it even more because I don't want to date a smoker because _I'm_ grossed out by it.

I need some ... Well, I would _really appreciate_ some feedback. Your thoughts. Your advice. Your motivation, and why you quit, and some sort of explanation of how the greenness of the grass on the other side is worth the climb over the mountain of addiction.

I don't know much about /stopsmoking, but I think I'll be getting to know you all really well!

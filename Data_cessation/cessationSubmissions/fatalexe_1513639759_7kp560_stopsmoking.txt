I don't know why any more but some how I manage

Almost six years later I'm still always joking and reminiscing about smoking tobacco. No matter what though I just can't seem to take another puff. It is a really good thing to not smoke; but I find it weird that I'm still fixated on the idea a bit. Just kinda strange. Good luck to you all trying to quit! Managed to quit after 15 years of smoking almost two packs a day. I used a full course of patches, nicotine gum when I stepped down levels and Thursday Plantation cinnamon chewing sticks for what was my six or seventh final quit attempt over three years of trying.

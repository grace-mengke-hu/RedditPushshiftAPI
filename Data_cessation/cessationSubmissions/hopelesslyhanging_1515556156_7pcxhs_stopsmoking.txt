I'm new to this. Please help.

Hi guys I just found this forum and it's so cool that you guys have made this bold decision and it inspired me as well! I've been a pack a day smoker for 5 years but because of singing (and health of course) I've been thinking about quitting very often, but fall short as I'm doubtful of my own will. I just trashed half a pack in attempt to truly embrace what is coming and I'm already regretting it.. So for those of you guys that have quit for a while what helped you through the cravings and doubts? Much love and best of luck to all!

Let's do this! NOW!

That's it.

There's no better time than now.

I want to be proud. I want to say '' Wow, It's been X time''. 

I've quit drinking last year and this year, I'm gonna quit smoking. No, i'm not ''gonna'' quit. I quit now. I'm already doing it! The feeling of being proud of myself is the best feeling and I want to feel it as much as I can! No more ''..one day'', no more ''I should stop soon'', I wanna get rid of this bad habit NOW. So now, I'm gonna throw away my pack, I'm gonna take a shower to wash the smell of cigarette I have on my hands, hair and body and I'm gonna wash my clothes.

I'm 25 and I've been smoking for a little more than 10 years now. It's crazy, I started so young I don't even know what it is to be a non-smoker. I feel like I've smoked my whole life. That sucks!!! I've never been a heavy smoker, only 1 to 3 per day, sometimes less sometimes more. But when I got a craving, I just didn't ''think'' and smoked right away. That is OVER! Now I wanna think, I wanna realize why I feel the need to smoke and try to change that.

I want to be able to trust myself, if I say I'm gonna do something, I want to do it, I want to stick to my words and be the kind of person who does what she says she will do! And it starts by doing it to myself, respecting myself by doing the things I say I'm going to do for me. I think this can help me become a better person :)

I really want to surround myself with positive people so if anyone is interested in being my stop-smoking buddy, someone I can message when I feel weak and vice versa I would really like that.

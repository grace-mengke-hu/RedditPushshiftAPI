My app just reminded me and my star confirmed it... 200 days!!!

I used to smoke around 15 cigarettes a day. Quit cold turkey after reading easyway. First 3 weeks were kinda tough. After that, cravings have pretty much disappeared. 

So, if you started in NYE / NYD... you are almost on the other side... Keep strong! You can do it!!

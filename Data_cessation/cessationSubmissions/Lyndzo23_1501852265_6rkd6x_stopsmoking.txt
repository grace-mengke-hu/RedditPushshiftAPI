Most vulnerable and emotional in the mornings/afternoon.

This group is so helpful! Been reading for a few days through but I've never posted anything before but I'm struggling. I quit 10 days ago. Emotions have hit me hard the past few days seemingly out of nowhere...crying, hard to concentrate, cranky. I literally cry about nothing. Just feel weird and start crying which is very unlike me. I really don't feel like myself and it's hard. It seems like it's the worst in the morning and starts to taper off in the evening to some extent. And my sleep is really messed up still. Is this normal? Going to end soon? Anyone else have this weird pattern? I worry sometimes and feel like it won't end. 

Thanks in advance!

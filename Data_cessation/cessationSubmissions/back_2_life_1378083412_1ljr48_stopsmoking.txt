Day two. Itchy and muscle spasms

Man.  This day feels the same as it always does.  Like my nerves are being stretched or something.  Just went on an epic walk. Now have to walk back. Should be good for another 24 hours.  Overall dark perspective right now. 

Damn addictions hate them!! 

I'm going to San Francisco in two weeks and I'm not going to smoke a single greatest cigarette before that NO MATTER WHAT!!!

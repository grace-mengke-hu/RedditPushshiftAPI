I think I can...at least I want to...

I'm a mom. To an awesome child. She has always bugged me to quit but I never  really tried. Wait...there was one time for about a week. Anyway, I now feel like I am at the place in my life, where I am ready to. Where I want to. But, Im scared. I don't know where to start. All of my friends are smokers. My SO, well he is one of those people who can pick up a smoke, smoke it. He will be good for a long time. Actually, the last time I saw him smoke was on July 4th. I just don't know where to start. I bought a pack yesterday. There is a part of me that wants to destroy that pack, another part of me wants to stop typing and smoke. I know the health risk, I have seen the pictures, I have had people in my life that smoking has caused major health issues. I have read the books. Which doesn't help much ( my ADHD causes me to...well you know...oh look an apple is sitting on my lap ). I don't know what I am really looking for on here. Maybe some words from all you awesome people, some advice, a place to write my train of thought down, or maybe a simple distraction from the pack sitting in my jacket waiting.....to be destroyed...I hope so.

It's been about a month but my ex-wife has me stressed and wanting to smoke. Badly.

My ex is turning the screws, and I don't want to smoke but sure feel like I do. 

Temptation is far away, no one around me smokes and I'm not going to buy any. I am frustrated and agitated, and these are triggers for me for smoking. 

I just had to vent rather than smoke. 

Oh and I'm so glad my ex's shit doesn't stink. /sarcasm

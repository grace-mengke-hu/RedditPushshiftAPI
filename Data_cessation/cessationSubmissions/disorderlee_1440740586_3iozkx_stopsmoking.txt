Discovered a new trick to help get over a craving. SMELL!

I was sitting at work earlier having a serious craving. I went out to my car as I normally would to smoke and took a quick sniff at the ashtray. I briefly thought I might vomit. 

 Sure, it's had a chance to sit and get some extra flavor, but even if you're fresh off the smokes it'll make you wretch and seemed to help me get over my craving as I sat and gagged over the smell. The craziest part is it's really not far off from what we smell like after having a smoke. That's the even bigger psychological trick.

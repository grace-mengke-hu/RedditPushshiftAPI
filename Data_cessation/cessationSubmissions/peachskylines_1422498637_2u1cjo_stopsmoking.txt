I Love Smoking

I do. It goes with everything. Driving to work? Shmag. Coffee? Shmag. Just ate? Shmag. About to go to bed? Shmag. Long ass car trip? Chain shmag. I smoke so much that my closest friends and I call it shmagging for what was a play on words but how we came to the term I have long forgotten. I started smoking right before I turned 18 and currently am at 22. The journey has been bittersweet. Started on Camel #9's, the pink box. Moved to Camel filters. Then Camel Crushes. Marlboro Smooths. And finally one of my best friends, Marlboro Menthols came into my life. I mean became my life. A lot of my daily rituals came with an MM. Still do, I mean. But that will end soon.

Because I hate smoking. It's disgusting. I used to work customer service and whenever someone came to the register in the middle of a shift, haven't smoked in four hours, just reeking of my addiction completely disgusted me. My fingers, clothes, and hair smell gross. My mouth tastes gross. It costs so much money. My anxiety levels depend on when I last had one. 

So as much as I love smoking, I hate it more. It was fun at one point but now it's just a bad habit that has got to go. I want to hear what you guys did. I'm going to read about what people had planned and had it work. This subreddit is going to by my rock during the storm (or whatever quote implies you guys are my new best friends). 

Quitting cold turkey has never worked in the past - too much stress in a job where being semi-calm is key. So I made a plan:

I'm going to cut back. I smoke about 9 cigarettes a day if I'm not going out or drinking (which, I forgot, alcohol+cig=gold). Start with not smoking in my car. Only bring a certain number with me when I go out. Progress from 9, 8, 7, 6, and so forth. 

I'll probably turn this into a diary of my journey. A countdown of some sort. And hopefully by the end, instead of saying I love smoking, I can honestly say that I *loved* smoking.

Been here before and going to make it stick

I'm not quitting. I did not fail at something. I am ending the worst relationship of my life. I am winning. Succeeding.

For nearly 7 years, smoking has been the thing that chains me. I can't sit through a movie any longer without needing to pause and step outside. I have to ask people if they mind riding in my car with the mess of empty cigarette packs on the floor and the smell of it clinging to everything.

I've not been well for three years and every time I light up, I know that the cigarette harms my already fragile system. Every time I talk to people about my chronic pain, fatigue, and disruptive autoimmune disorder, I feel like no matter what I say, I'm guilty for still being a smoker through it all. I have no right to complain about my troubled health if I continue to damage myself further. And now, my little brother has picked up the habit and I hate that I was the influence that got him to start such a disgusting relationship.

I'm ending. Certainly this isn't the first time but I'm determined to make it my last. As a new EMT trainee, I should be able to confidently tell my future patients that I am smoke free after my years of challenges and addiction. I don't want to passively accept this slow brand of suicide.

Not smoking is the best decision I can make for myself and it's the best one for you too.

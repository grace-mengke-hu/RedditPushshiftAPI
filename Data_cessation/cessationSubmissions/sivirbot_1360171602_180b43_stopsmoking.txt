Figured I'd share a funny story and 2 weeks down!

I was leaving for work the other day, head lost in the clouds due to the stressful day ahead, and I was trying to plan out my day to be the most efficient.  While I was doing that my subconscious mind had another plan, because my hand was rooting around in my jacket to find the pack of cigs that was no longer there.

Then I just thought to myself "Ha! Silly subconscious! You don't smoke anymore, now stop being silly and get back to work."

Just a friendly reminder that everything doesn't have to be serious =D

P.S. Two Weeks down!

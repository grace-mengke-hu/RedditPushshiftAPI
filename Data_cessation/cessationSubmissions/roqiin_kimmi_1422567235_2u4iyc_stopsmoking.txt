28 days...

... since my last cigarette! I've downloaded a stop smoking app called Smoke Free Beta the time I quit- which was new years eve.  I recommend this app to all- 

I've had 2 dreams this month where I did smoke a cig.  The first few weeks I used the patch as a crutch but I really don't need it anymore. 

I've replaced smoking with getting fit and working out and it's helped greatly :)

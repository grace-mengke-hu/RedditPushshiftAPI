Support for my Partner

I've never gotten into smoking, but I am a member of r/stopdrinking.

My partner recently decided to quit nicotine altogether.  He moved from cigarettes to vaping almost 2 years ago, and now he's moving from vaping to nothing. 

I know nicotine addiction is very different animal than alcohol addiction. Currently we are long distance and I was looking for advice on how to support him with this journey.

Thanks in advanced :)

48 hours- on vacation

So I am approaching 48 hours no nicotine! It's great except that I probably owe this success entirely to the fact that I didn't bring smokes along on a weekend getaway with my kids. We're up in the mountains of upstate NY with s friend of mine who is a non smoker. I feel alright, other than a little groggy and pessimistic (not great for a vacation but ok). 
  We start the 5 hour drive home this afternoon. Once we're back I'll most likely be welcomed by my husband and mother chain smoking in the front porch. Not sure I can muster the will to walk past. 

  Any advice from someone who quit on vacation and kept it going successsfully?

Made it 3 days. Would have been 1 week except for Friday.

Bummed a few cigarettes off of a friend on Friday but other than that I have been smoke free for 3 days and have not bought a back for 1 week. Been incredibly hungry and angry for the past few days and today I thought I was going to lose my mind. Also going through a tough time with SO and we're on a "break" so that doesn't help.

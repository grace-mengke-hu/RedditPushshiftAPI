Just looking for some advice on kicking the habit.

So I’ve been planning on quitting this year, but man so far 2018 has been one emotional roller coaster after another. In the space of one month my Dad passed away (from lung cancer, the reason I’m quitting), my boyfriend slept with other people, I’m moving country in a week and I’ve had to cut 80% of my friends off due to their drug and alcohol issues. So far I managed to go one full day of no cigarettes, but thats it. I’d love some advice on how to quit while having a lot of stress in your life, because right now it feels like it’ll never happen. My main issue is when I’m home and not doing anything, that’s when I crave the most (I’m at home alone most days as I’m preparing to move). How could I go about this effectively and not lose my marbles in the process. I have been smoking for 5ish years, about 10-15 a day. Thanks!

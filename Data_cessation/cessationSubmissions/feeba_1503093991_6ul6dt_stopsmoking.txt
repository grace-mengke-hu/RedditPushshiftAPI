Quitting

Right that’s it, just smoked my last cigarette and I’m feeling positive. I’m quitting this time because I want too, because I’ve stopped enjoying it and frankly it’s affecting my potential future with saving.

I know that I might falter at points and nights out will be challenging but that’s okay. 

Wish me luck and here’s to the future!

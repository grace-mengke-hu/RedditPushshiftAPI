23 (F) Day 2 of quitting... for the 28th time.

I recently posted here looking for advice on how to quit- long story short I read them as I continued to smoke my daily packet and didn’t re consider. That was until I went to visit my mum on Thursday, she has been a month without smoking but smoked approx 30 cigarettes a day for 20+ years.
Mum hasn’t been too well for a while, regular cold/cough etc; but when I went to visit she couldn’t breathe properly. I started going into panic mode and after speaking with a health hotline/calling paramedics she went to hospital. As we waited to find out what was wrong I couldn’t stop thinking about my pop- he passed away almost 2 years ago from lung cancer after smoking for 50 years. I watched my mum struggle to speak and it really did hit me- why am I doing this to myself?

Stayed in hospital with mum for most of the night as she continued to be told she should have given up sooner, she looked at me as if to say and now it’s your turn. Update on mum though she’s 100% fine just had a bad asthma flare up from the bronchitis.

3pm Monday afternoon I smoked the last cigarette from my packet and vowed to not buy another packet, I threw out my lighters/ash trays and am really trying hard. I decided cold turkey will be the only way I’ll ever succeed but I am struggling mentally. It’s all I think about and all I want to talk about (which I imagine is going to be really frustrating for my boyfriend who is a non smoker)- would love to hear from other people who are on their way to being smoke free as it really is a lonely road.

TLDR; have been smoking since I was 16- mum got sent to hospital struggling to breathe and it scared me into stopping for good. Looking for other quit pals to tell me their tips on how to sticking to it/all the struggles I’m yet to face.

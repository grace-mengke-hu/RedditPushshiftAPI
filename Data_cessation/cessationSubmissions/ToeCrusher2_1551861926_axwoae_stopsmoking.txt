How to get rid of nicotine addiction?

I quit smoking 10 days ago, I have been smoking 10+ cigarettes everyday for the last 3 years. I got the smoker’s flu on day 3, mild fever, chills, high blood pressure, high heart rate. My coughing increased a lot and I have been coughing out a lot of tar. My family obviously got worried and put me on antibiotics, I had a chest X-ray done and it turns out I have bronchitis.

The physical withdrawal symptoms lasted 3-4 days from day 3 to day 5, by day 6 I was completely healed from fever, my blood pressure is not in the perfect range, physically I never felt better although some coughing still persisted. Throughout the first 6 days I had absolutely no cravings to smoke, my mood was great even during the fever, mentally I was on a high, after passing through the physical symptoms I though this habit was finally behind me, days 6 and 7 was were fantastic both physically and mentally but on day 8 I was hit with depression, I was in mental hell all day, I wanted to smoke so badly, I just knew if I could smoke just 1 cigarette I will be happy again, I resisted the urge on day 8 but finally gave in and smoked a couple on day 9, I did feel a lot better mentally. Now today is day 10 and I am again fighting depressive thought, I miss smoking so badly, I just want to drive to my favorite smoking spot and just enjoy the sun while smoking. However instead of giving in again, I instead bought nicotine gum, and it worked, the depressive thoughts and cravings were completely gone. But this doesn’t really solve my problem, my body is still addicted to nicotine, I don’t want to be dependent on nicotine at all, How to completely get rid of this dependence?

22 1/2 days in - off patch (?)

22 1/2 days smoke free! never felt better. the first week i let myself eat whatever and then i was out of town but last week i took control of my food &amp; health &amp; diet and am down 3.2 lbs! i also stepped down to the step 2 patch yesterday and had no problems. just realized i forgot to put it on today so i'm gonna try to ride it out. and if i need to, put it on later. WE CAN DO THIS

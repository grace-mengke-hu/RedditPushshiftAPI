Today has been a tough one.

Today has been hard. Woke up on the wrong side of the bed with no motivation. Overwhelming anxiety and general sadness. Stressing about money and worry about my health. 

All things that would NOT have been helped (only hindered) by cigarettes. Regardless, it's still hard to struggle through the cravings in silence. 

Thank you all for being here as a virtual venting post.

In need of some help.

Hey everyone. So I’ve been trying to quit for for about 3 months. The last few months have been filled with false starts and tough days. But I’m determined and I truly want to quit. I hate smoking. I see no benefits and I know it’s just a matter of time. But I feel like maybe some of you can help give some advice.

I’m currently studying abroad so there is ALOT of time spent doing nothing. I find it very difficult to overcome cravings due to boredom. It’s crazy how much your brain will try and convince you to just have one smoke.  

I’ve cut down from one pack a day, to about 1-10 max. I just need some advice getting over the hump.  

Thank you!

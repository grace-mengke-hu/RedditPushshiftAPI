Most of the time I forget I was a smoker for 40 years

Occasionally I remember that I smoked up until November (I count the day I quit vaping, though), but most of the time... Not so much. I get very rare urges, they tend to be situational. Otherwise I'd say I've come to the point of it being a distant memory, but as the title says, I really rarely remember (I need to check my flair here to see how long it's actually been).

Stay strong quitters.

Quitting for the second time.

Mind you I'm on mobile and this is my first post but I see everyone saying sorry about it so I am to. Anyways I quit near the end of September in 2017 for 5 months cold turkey. Unfortunately I made the stupid mistake of having one thinking   " I did 5 months theres no way I'll get addicted from one." Turns out I did and fully relapsed back into a pack a day until today. I'm taking the plunge once more and this time I want to quit this hell once and for all and I was wondering if anyone has tips or anyone that's made my same mistake and started up again. What can I do going into this second time to better set myself for success. I'm only 24(M) and work in construction so I'm basically around smokers 24/7 and frankly they dont give a shit if you're trying to quit theyll still smoke around you and I cant exactly leave my job.

 How can I better cope being around smokers that offer cigarettes at all points throughout the day? I have told them not to offer me any but for them its routine to offer as we all would for eachother.

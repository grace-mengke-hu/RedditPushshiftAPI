I could really use some support from you dudes right now.

I'm en route to a weekend cabin trip with my fraternity brothers in Gatlinburg and I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't wanna smoke, but it will be all around me for 3 days. I could use some encouragement I guess. I hate to be needy, but you guys have been what's helped me through the shittiest time. And I could really use you all this weekend.

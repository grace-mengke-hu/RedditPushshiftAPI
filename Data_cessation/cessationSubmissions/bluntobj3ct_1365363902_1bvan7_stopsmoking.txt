Last Update and Thank You - 766 days.

You've got your badge, you've made your first post about all the reasons you hate smoking and how you're quitting. You and every single other person in this subreddit... How unoriginal. First-day, relapse, one-week, two-week, one-month, one-year... they're all the same shit over and over.    

Thank you!    

Recognize this: We all share the same struggle. For everyone here, each one of your posts is a rather-unsettling look straight back through time and right into the mirror. Each frustrated and passionate condemnation of all the awful and shitty feelings serves to reinforce the resolve of others.     

I know they did for me. At first I saw most posts and apparent reposts as boring and wondered what the hell I was doing here. All I really wanted was a cool little counter badge to see how far I could go. The more I read, the more I saw myself in everyone's posts and comments, day in and day out.     

**It gets said again and again: Stay strong. Quit or don't quit. No fucking excuses. It's a decision to be a non-smoker, not some half-assed try to try bullshit.**    

Make that decision. You will start thanking yourself a lot sooner than you think, even as you struggle. You will most certainly struggle, but each step is more gratifying than the last.    

I'll still be here throwing my $0.02 around periodically, but this will be my last update. I smoked about 15 a day for 7-8 years and quit around May of 2011. I was 24. It worked because I made a decision and stuck with it. Well, and because of other people like you. AND also that cool little counter badge :)     

For a little more info on my story, [here's a link to my 1 year post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/t9wsw/totally_missed_my_year_mark_guess_that_means_its/) for some of my personal strategies and details.     

Keep up all that quitting you've been up to! Bluntobj3ct out.

On day 16 &amp; need some love

First time experiencing premenstrual syndrome alongside the unfun emotional quit mood swings :( :( I went from feeling excited and hopeful and (sometimes) quite emotional to full on existential crisis under blankets mode

I know smoking will just make it worse but I feel soooo so bad, like I shouldn’t be allowed to exist as a person because I’m not good enough. It feels so silly to type 🤦🏻‍♀️ I went on a run and it helped a bit. I just need some virtual hugs &amp; high fives to make it through this phase. It feels like my body is Candyland and my heart is stuck in Molasses Swamp

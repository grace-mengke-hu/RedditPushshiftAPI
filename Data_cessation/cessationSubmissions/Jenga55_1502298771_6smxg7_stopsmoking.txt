I can't stop smoking completely when I'm at work!

Hi everyone, I stumbled over this sub and think I might be at the right place.


After smoking a pack a day for almost 6 years my coworker got diagnosed with lung cancer in the end stadium.

It's not like there weren't any signs, but my friend and mentor basically didn't give a damn about his health and lifestyle and ignored everything, blamed it to asthma, etc.


So I quit cold turkey from the day he told me and I successfully quit for four weeks, but I started smoking at work a week ago, I "only" smoke 3-5 cigs a day except sunday.

I have taken breaks or a book to read for a few mins but I just can't stop when I'm working. It's so frustrating that I'm so close to the goal but not getting to the goal. I don't think patches or nicotine gums would help to be honest, it'll only get me used to nicotine again.


Sorry for the long story!


TL;DR
Gone from twenty cigarettes per day to zero, but back to five because I can't stop smoking at work.

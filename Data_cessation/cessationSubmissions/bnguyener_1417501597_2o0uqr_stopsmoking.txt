A little advice for a smoker with some trouble quitting?

So, I've been smoking for a little over two years now, and my friends and family have been getting more on my back about it. My best friend recently decided to use all these tips he read about online to get me to stop(i.e. not guilt-tripping me every time I light a smoke). And I've been trying for awhile, I'd get to about two to three days and then give in to the stress smoking, then binge smoke a couple more.

Does anyone have any advice on just stopping or how to overcome being stress/depressed without smoking? Also, I smoke a lot when I have to walk long distances (i.e. class/work), does anybody do anything to keep themselves busy or their mind off of it?

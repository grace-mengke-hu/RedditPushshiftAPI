I caved last night, but I'm going to get right back on the wagon.

I don't even know why I did it, but I bummed a cigarette last night, and within half an hour, I bought a pack.  I smoked 9 in the span of an hour, and made myself sick.  I gave the rest away just now.  I'm not going to make excuses for myself, but I'm not going to beat myself up either.  


I had made it nearly 15 days before caving.  I need to figure out what triggered it.  I'm getting right back on the wagon.  

I really don't know what prompted it.  I was out drinking with friends.  It wasn't a super stressful night, I wasn't feeling particularly depressed or particularly happy.  Maybe it was out of boredom, or maybe it was just because I really missed it. If I can figure out why I did it, I can avoid the mistake in the future.  


This is only a minor setback, I'm still committed, and I can't allow one failure to demoralize me.

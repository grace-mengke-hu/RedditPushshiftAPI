1000 days. 142+ weeks. 24,000 hours.

I've been a non-smoker for 1000 days today. I finally killed the habit after a couple 13-14 attempts, one of which lasted over a year and was totalled during a night of drinking. I've learned from that one and will never let my guard down again. Keep trying if you are a smoker struggling to quit and maintain your vigilance if you are a non-smoker. I'm pulling for everyone here!!!!

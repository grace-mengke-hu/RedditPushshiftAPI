Trying again. (Also, stress management tips?)

I fell off the wagon but I want to get back on. My first week after I quit was pretty good, but then I experienced some challenges I really wasn't expecting or prepared for. Specifically, I used to engage in self-harming behavior, and apparently, smoking had taken the place of that. Arguably, smoking is a form of self-harm, it's just culturally acceptable. So, I need to figure out a good substitute, and if anyone has any suggestions, that would be great.

I've been under a lot of stress lately, but it's very clear that smoking doesn't fix any of my problems or relieve my stress. All it does is give me a jolt of energy or endorphins that makes life feel tolerable for a little while. Looking back on my life, I've always found harmful things I can do to make myself feel better when I get too overwhelmed. That's really depressing to think about, and I would like to get out of that cycle. (Yes, I'm trying to find a therapist.)

This month, I'm participating in a weekly choral workshop. Last week, I hadn't been smoking and I had a great time singing. This week, I had been smoking and singing was noticeably more difficult and less fun. I want next week to be fun. So I don't want to smoke anymore.

Anyway, I'm terrified. What do the rest of you do when you feel overwhelmed by stress?

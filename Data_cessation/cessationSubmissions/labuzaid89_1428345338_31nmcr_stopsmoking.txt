25 Years old been smoking for 10 years.

I used to smoke a pack and a half a day up untill I got swine flue when I was 19 now I smoke weekends only. As soon as friday hits I buy a case and pack and then I stop smoking sunday and the cycle repeats. I no longer want to smoke. I am tired of it I want my sense of smell and taste back.

Please Advise.

Thank you !

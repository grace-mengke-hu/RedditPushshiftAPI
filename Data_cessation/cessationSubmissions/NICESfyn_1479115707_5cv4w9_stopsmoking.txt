Haven't smoked in a few days, not by choice. Help!

A little about myself, I quit smoking a few years ago and lasted at least a year plus without smoking. If anyone has been in my shoe before, you'd know that the craving is always there. 

So anyway, I'm back in the habit. Sure, I've told myself that I want to quit SOME DAY but every time I'm out of cigarettes I'll go buy another pack. 

A few days ago however, I sprained my ankle. I'm unable to walk out and buy them for myself. It's been a few days and it's a terrible feeling. My question is, should I try and continue not smoking? Or should I go Cold Turkey? Meaning I'll smoke like a few cigarettes a day kind of thing. 

I feel a bit bad posting this as I know that whatever responses I get, I might still go out and buy it when I can. Please be patient with me.

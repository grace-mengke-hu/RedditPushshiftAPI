First post-quit night drinking... didn’t smoke!

Last night was two weeks for me cigarette free! I went out for drinks with a good friend and, though he was periodically stepping outside for cigarettes, I did not smoke! Usually the minute I start feeling the effects of a cocktail and someone pulls out a pack my quit goes out the window. I could have smoked, my non smoking husband is out of town and no one would have known but I didn’t and I’m so stinking excited right now!

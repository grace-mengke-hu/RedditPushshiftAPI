Giving it another go

I was smoke free up for 2 months up until yesterday. I fell off the the wagon for some really stupid reasons in hindsight, and someone was there with smokes. 

I was really feeling good about being smoke free, but I got so low yesterday that I broke down. 

I'm going for it again and hopefully I can make it stick.

I just have to keep telling myself to never quit quitting.

So I smoked today

After day 18 I smoked 3 cigarettes today.

This isn't my first time quitting, that was a few years ago. 

I work in a boozy, smoky environment in the City and have managed to drink and not smoke so far. Not really sure why I did smoke today.

I smoked 3 cigarettes in quick succession with a few beers, but other than the the first drag (after 18 days) I didn;t really notice I was doing it, or derive any pleasure/displeasure.

I'm a bit annoyed, but not overly so. Previous quits and relapses have made me really mad to the point I think what the fuck...and just smoke. Now, I'm just going to crack on and not smoke. Have to reset my badge though :(

Felt like I just needed to say this.

My quit day is approaching... I should be more excited.

Hi all, 

Over the past year and a bit I went 3 months without smoking (except a few when drinking) before starting again for 3 months. I quit again for 2 months (not ONE drag) and went back on again at Christmas time. My diary is cleared and my quit date is May 20th. 

I should be looking forward to it. I remember how amazing I felt every morning to wake up and go and do 45 minutes of exercise. Now I just lie in bed till I *have* to get up.

I remember how something like going to the shop to buy a can of soda didn't seem like a big deal. Now I sit on the couch for 20 minutes debating going and 20 minutes resting when I get back.

I miss being more confident, and being generally happier all the time. Now I'm prone to fits of 'pseudo-depression' where I'm just miserable without cause and want to go home.

I miss the whole being more healthy - eating better, exercising, the whole deal.

Then why am I not excited about this happening?

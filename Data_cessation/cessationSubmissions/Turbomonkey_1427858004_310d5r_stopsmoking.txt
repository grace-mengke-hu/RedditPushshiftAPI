I think i was addicted to something else other than nicotine

I've been smoke free for over a week and use e cigs to help the cravings. 

However, as I'm still getting the nicotine I need, I find it odd that sometimes I just want to buy a pack of cigs and a lighter and smoke the entire pack.

It must be something other than nicotine that I was addicted too. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

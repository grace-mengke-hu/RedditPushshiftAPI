My first visit to the dentist ever

Smoked for almost 30 years, 50 days ago started quitting.  30 days ago, two teeth started to loosen and hurt a bit.

For now they just loose, not hurt, so decided to visit the dentist. I have never been to the dentist.


 The doctor said that it is chronic periodontitis after initial examination and needs treatment. And, the two loose teeth need to be replaced. 

Up to now, at least 4 teeth have fallen. There are two other could be replaced.

My point is

For those who have started quitting, please stay strong, stay committed to quitting.

For the smokers, get ready to quit ASAP.

207 day update

Well the title says it all. 

207 days of freedom from smokes thanks to this subreddit and Cessation Nation app.

Been feeling awsome and I've made a few more other changes in my life thanks to a little kick in the arse.

Just stay strong and feel incredible whenever you take a look at your badge and bask in the glory of a smokefree life ;))))

Day 1 without cigs!

I've almost made it through my first day! pretty nervous about tomorrow but im going to tell those cigs to go fuck themselves. Also day 6 of coming off a heroin relapse. fuck letting chemicals control my life this year. I'm making the decisions now. I am feeling pretty nuts right now but im truly determined this time. Anyway, just needed to get that out there. So happy I found this sub reddit- you guys seem really great.

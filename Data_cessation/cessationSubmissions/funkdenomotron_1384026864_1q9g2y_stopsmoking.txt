Hmm, yes, I shall stop smoking cigarettes.

Its a long weekend for me, so a good time to kick the habit eh? 20 years save a few weeks a smoker. 10 cigs a day on average I imagine. I tried the e cig, did not like it at all. 



I kept rationalizing smoking by looking at the old dudes at work who smoke, and saying: "Those dudes are old, and they smoke, I'll be fine. My Grandfather smoked his whole life and made it to 91, he did switch to a pipe later in life though, but I'll be fine." But I am not those old dudes or my Opa.



So on to victory. I have defeated worse. I am stocked with my quitting supplies, including a deck of cards, and booze. Yes a deck of cards. I am 36 and I cannot shuffle cards the proper way. Gonna learn some tricks probably, seems like a good distraction to me. I hope I don't try and roll up and smoke the 10 of clubs though. I find guys that do card tricks kinda creepy, so it will be perfect. 



Booze! Hooray for good bourbon! Hoping it will take the edge off. I always smoked less when drinking for some reason, I know that is backwards. 



I am looking forward to REALLY tasting goat cheese. Oh, and risotto, seafood risotto. Oh my god, french onion soup with Gruyere. Mutha.Flippen.Dry.Aged.Ribeye.



Someone posted that his lady and his bike really helped him quit. I don't have either of those things, but with the money I save I am aiming for this: http://khsbicycles.com/bikes/2013-khs-models/sixfifty-6500/ 



Yeah.



So I mentioned the deck of cards to help me quit. What are some of the more peculiar things that helped you quit?  



Ok I am gonna go play some PC games and not smoke. 



Be well all.

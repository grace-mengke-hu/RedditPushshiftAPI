2 days in and a serious dilemma.

I have been smoking tobacco and weed for about 10 years. (26 now) I just decided i had had enough of the tobacco and quit 2 days ago. Problem is that because of the nature of my job, I use weed to self medicate my constant muscle aches. I usually use papers to smoke but i have a pipe and bowl that I use frequently. I prefer using papers because of the mobility of walking around the house. I have been using my bowl for the last couple days but I am scared if I roll a joint and smoke I will relapse and go back to smoking. Any words of advise from people who have been in this situation would be kindly appreciated along with any tips to keep this thing going.

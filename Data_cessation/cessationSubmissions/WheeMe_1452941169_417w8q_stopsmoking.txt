Stuck in perpetual day one.

I can't seem to get past the before sleep cig. I get way too anxious about sleeping during the evening and I just can't do it.. I've always suffered from insomnia and it's now somewhat in control so I'm anxious to do anything that might ruin that and I know that insomnia is probably a part of cessation.

Has anyone had it like this? Any advice? I'm tired of the Day 1 badge. I've been ashamed to post here, because two weeks on day one really really sucks. The days are ok though. I haven't smoked any today and I don't plan to either.

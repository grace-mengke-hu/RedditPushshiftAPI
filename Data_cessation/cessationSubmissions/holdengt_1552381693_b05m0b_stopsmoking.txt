anyone tried hypnosis??

Hey! 

Just wanted to get peoples thoughts on using hypnosis to quit smoking? Tried everything else and nothing seems to really work. 

If you’re in the UK and know a decent hypnotist I’d love a recommendation! 

I’m 26 years old been smoking about 9 years,  I desperately want to quit before I make it to the decade point! in the last 2 years the number I smoke a day has sky rocketed to almost 20. 

Thanks!

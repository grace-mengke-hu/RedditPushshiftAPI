Almost at one year but strong craving now

I am so willing to go buy a pack of smokes. Right now in this minute. I quit on Feb 8, 2014 and the craving is so strong. I will not cave. I am thankful for this sub. I am not going to buy a pack of smokes. Ohhh man how good it would feel to smoke one........

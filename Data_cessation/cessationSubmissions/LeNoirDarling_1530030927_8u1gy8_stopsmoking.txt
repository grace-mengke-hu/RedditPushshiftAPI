Day Three

My last quit was in September 2016. 
I made It 14 months and then shit happened. Major life stuff happened and I gave up. I wasn’t prepared and hadn’t put any coping mechanisms in place to deal with major life issues without cigarettes.

That was last November 2017. It took me almost 8 months to quit again. 

I almost immediately went into detox quitters-flu. I feel miserable. I am combination sweating my ass of and shaking until my bones ache. But I have been through this before and I’m not as freaked out as last time! 

I am happy that I quit. Not only for myself but also for my partner. 

I’ve come back to this group because it helped me so much before. (Coincidentally I stopped Reddit around the same time life went up in flames?) I truly believe in the power of support groups and this one is great. 

I’m just rambling but I reset my badge. It’s the only way I track because it makes me log on to the sub and make a positive comment and support someone else and then I can see what I’ve accomplished. 

So here we go to a new life!

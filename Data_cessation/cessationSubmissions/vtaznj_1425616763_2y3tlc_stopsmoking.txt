Five days in - I keep thinking about all the money I'll save.

I'm a (22) year old guy that has been a smoker since I was 12 years old. I've tried stopping various times, and never really made it past 3 days.

Well I was pretty sick a few days ago and it made me not able to smoke. Now that I am better, I still have not had a cigarette. The cravings are there - they pass after a while. Sometimes I'll take a cigarette and puff on it with out lighting it. I just keep thinking about all the money I will be saving. Especially seeing how a pack of smokes is 10 bucks where I live...

My main motivation for wanting to stop is so that my face doesn't age rapidly. And of course for the health benefits. I also have asthma, and found my self using my rescue inhaler way more than I should.

Alot of my friends smoke, and wish they didn't - so I'm excited to be able to tell them 
that I don't. I'm not telling anyone until I am two weeks in though, except for you guys. Wish me luck!!

Why do Nicotine Lozenges sore my mouth?

They absolutely wreck my mouth. I've been accustomed to canker sores all my life. 6-8 good episodes/year where I might have one to multiple lasting a week to 10 days. But wow. Within 36 hours of taking 2-3 nicotine lozenges I have sores all over my gums. (My canker sores only occur on my cheeks.) I mean, if I count them there are....six. And five of those are on the bottom gums, infront of the incisors and eye teeth. But I keep my lozenges in the top gums! 




I ain't allergic to anything I'm aware of. My mother's allergic to wool and is hypersensitive to chlorine. I don't really have any reason to believe I'm allergic to anything. I'm 23, have never dipped, and have smoked 18 months daily. 




I take as suggested. Minimized swallowing. I spit until they're small enough that I don't salivate as much. Uhh... I thought at first the sores were the result of the dry, hard candy scraping my mouth. But honestly. I don't think so. This is frustrating.

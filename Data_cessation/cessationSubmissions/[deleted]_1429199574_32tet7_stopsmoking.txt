How /r/thebutton is helping me not start smoking again.

I'm not sure how many of you are aware of /r/thebutton, it is a sub that you can visit and press the button and when the button is pressed the timer resets for everyone world-wide and based on the time you press it your account is permanently associated with a specific colour. I don't know what it is about resisting pressing the button, but it kind of teaches me self-control to not do so, similar to the self-control is takes to not go out and buy some cigarettes and smoke them.

Quite an interesting sub-reddit too, go ahead and check it out.. resist the button if you can and definitely resist smoking.

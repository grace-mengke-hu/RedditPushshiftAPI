Night sweats?

Anyone else experiencing this?

I'm not sure if I'm getting sick or if it's just because the weather is getting warmer and I'm still using my cozy bed sheets or something but I'm waking up with crazy sweaty sweats. My partner even said something about it the other morning. It wasn't as bothersome this morning or yesterday but I still woke up a time or two at night to kick off all my clothes and then ultimately woke up in the morning pretty groggy because of it... I've never really been a nakey sleeper and I really love to cuddle so it's not normal for me......?

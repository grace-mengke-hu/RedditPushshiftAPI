Please help me!

Please help me. I've been smoking for 14 years and tried to quite many time. I'm still smoking and cannot get rid of it. I feel how it affects my health. I need your support. Please tell me not to smoke for another 2-3 weeks. I really don't want to do that any more but I feel like I cannot do it alone.

I feel drunk...

I’ve quit smoking many times before. I actually quit for 3 years once, and for many shorter times too. 

It’s my very first day of no smokes and I think the nicotine withdrawal is giving me brain fog. I literally feel a bit tipsy/drunk. I can’t focus at all. I haven’t been drinking...

Anyone else get this?

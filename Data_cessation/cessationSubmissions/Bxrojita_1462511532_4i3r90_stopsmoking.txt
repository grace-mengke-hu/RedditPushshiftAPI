32 hours and feeling sick

I've been smoking since I was in high school so for about 8 years. I'm having some money issues so I couldn't buy another pack after my last one ran out. I bummed one off a coworker but after that I wasn't able to find another one. It's a terrible feeling to not be able to support your own bad habit - so out it goes. 
My fianc√© has been really encouraging. Along with my dad and sister. Lately I feel like cigarettes have isolated me from non smokers. The smell, having to go outside, judging looks. I'm hoping cold turkey works for me because I only want to feel this horrible once. 
My jaw is tense. My stomach is killing me and I feel like i'm just going through one continuos craving.

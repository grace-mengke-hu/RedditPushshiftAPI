Better to be a diamond with a flaw, than a pebble without

I've been putting off quitting cigarettes for a while because there never seemed to be a *good* quit day - there's always tomorrow because today was stressful, or maybe the day after the upcoming party / pub night because I know that I'll *need* to smoke there. I've made a lot of excuses to postpone quitting since my last serious quit attempt, which was years ago. 

This time, I decided to quit on a Thursday, even knowing that I have back-to-back parties this weekend. Why would I pick such a dumb time to quit?! Partly, because I know that when I get through this weekend - drinking and being surrounded by smokers - that I'll have faced some of my toughest personal challenges early-on. 

Day 3 is notoriously difficult - but so was Day 2, and I make it through a concert and an after-party without smoking. I'm still using an e-cig for now, but I'm maintaining my quit date on my terms. *To thine own self be true.*

I guess that I just wanted to say that however you approach quitting - that any day is a *good* day to do it, and that it's a different journey for every person and every quit attempt. Party if you're gonna party, vape if you're gonna vape, smoke a cigar with friends if you're into that. Just don't light another cigarette, but if you already have, just don't light another cigarette.

There is no right or perfect way to do this - what matters is that you do this. Confucius said: *Better to be a diamond with a flaw, than a pebble without.*

Much respect to those of you who aren't sure if they're doing it right. If you don't light the next cigarette - whatever you're doing - you're doing it right.

I'm bouncing back and forth.

Howdy. I've been not smoking for a quite long time now - my only weakness was alcohol, after getting drunk I'd smoke a whole pack. But now I overcame this! I am not smoking AT ALL for two weeks now! Feels great. 


I did things like this in the past but always came back - even after half a year. How do I avoid this? This is a country where people smoke everywhere, 3/4 of my friends are smokers. For now I even go out with them to talk when they smoke and it's okay - but last few times it ended ended badly - i started to smoke again - few hits, few fags, only @ weekends - I was one of them again. What I shall do?


Good day and good luck to you all too!

Time to remind ourselves why quitting smoking is/will be a great achievement

Hey guys ,

Though we abstain from smoking and other addictions and go on very longer streaks , we tend to lose our cool sometimes and almost relapse. But in such times we have to remind ourselves why we'd abstain in the first place. Here's a toast to ya'll for trying harder to quit this bad habit and reasons to quit smoking forever:

* Smoking is useless. It is pointless and doesn't help to be honest. It adds more stress to our body increasing anxiety and other bodily stress.
* One small ulcer is enough to initiate a tumor that can be fatal to our existence. It is not worth it.
* Though it may seem less harmful inhaling all the carcinogenic smoke , it will damage your eyes , lungs , nose , skin in the mere long run. Imagine you look at yourself in the mirror one day and see that your cheek layers are all eaten up cancer? \( Google throat cancer images\) Do you really want to get cancer? It is better to die than to get cancer. But we can quit this bad boy and be happy through out our lives.
* Worst thing is , it can cause cancers in any part of the body. You might even go blind , get your hands removed and legs too due to gangrene.
* It can cause infertility , can damage your balls making your existence nearly useless.
* You get less insurance if you're a smoker.
* Smoking will kill your relationships sometimes , affect your loved ones , may affect your new born baby and make it look like you're from Chernobyl.
* It can cause intellectual impairment , nervous disorders and can also effect your coming generations. The genes get modified and your coming generations will be vulnerable to worst diseases .
* It can make you smell bad , rot your gums , damage enamel on your teeth.
* Imagine one day , you are smoking your last cigarette and get diagnosed with throat cancer stage 4. You are happily married with your loved ones standing in front of you. Your kids , wife , mom , dad everyone healthy and there's you on the bed hours before you breathe your last and you tell yourself if only you had quit smoking this stupid stick back then.
* You will save a lot of money in the long run. A LOT! So much that you can use it to travel and or invest on anything else.
* You will have the highest will power in the world once you quit smoking one shot \- cold turkey! You can use that will power to quit other addictions like drinking , drugs , pornography \( I'm battling this , though I haven't overcome this addiction , I'm trying harder through Nofap Challenge\).
* You'll find that the smoker friends are just useless and you can make better and smart friends.
* You might get addicted to meditation because your brain wants a rush of dopamine and you can alter your though frequencies through meditation making you evolve on all levels of life!
* Quitting smoking will be one of the greatest achievements in your life so much because it requires huge amounts of will power.
* You will make new hobbies , better addictions once you quit it. You will try to draw , sketch , write that piece of article , learn a language , find the love of your life while on a solo trip , and most importantly , BREATHE FRESH FREAKING AIR AT 5:00 AM IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU'RE ON A BICYCLE RIDE TO BATTLE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS.
* You'll have more energy to do things.
* Better response from your immune system.
* You'll be a motivation to so many of your friends. People will learn tips and tricks to quit from you.
* Your relapses will teach you that it is okay to fail in something but what matters is being persistent in achieving the target.

I'm celebrating a pre 500 day milestone with you guys. It has been a heck of a journey guys. There are other worst addictions to battle now , so that I can live a happy life.

Good luck to you all sweet hearts.

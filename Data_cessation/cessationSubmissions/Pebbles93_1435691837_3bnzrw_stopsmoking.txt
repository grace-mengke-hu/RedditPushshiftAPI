Progress!

I went to the gym yesterday, for the first time since stopping smoking and it was awesome! No sore chest, no struggling to breathe! AND I was able to do more than ever without as much effort yay!! This is the first time iv really noticed something huge since giving up, and I am literally elated!!!

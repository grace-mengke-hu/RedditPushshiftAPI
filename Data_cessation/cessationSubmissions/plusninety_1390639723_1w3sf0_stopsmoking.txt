I got turned down for my dream job the second time. I want to smoke some cigarettes.

Last year I had failed the first multiple choice exam so it didn't make me feel very bad. This year I passed the multiple choice exam and the written exam. My interview also went quite well. Today I found out I didn't get the job. They won't tell me if I failed the interview or the background check but I think I failed the background check due to some wrongdoings of a relative of mine.

I'm thinking why stay so healthy? At least the nicotine rushes made me feel a little good while I was relieving cravings.

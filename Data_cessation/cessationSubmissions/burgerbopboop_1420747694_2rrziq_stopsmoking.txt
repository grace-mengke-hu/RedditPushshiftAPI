Stress is my trigger apparently.

I have been through all the tests of strength since stopping i.e drinking, being around other smokers, having coffee but it is the stress of a bad day that is killing me the most since i stopped.  It's stressful day at work as well as some family issues and i all has me wanting so bad to bum a smoke off a co-worker.

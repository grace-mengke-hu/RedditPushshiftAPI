Acne after quitting?

Hey folks! Has anyone else suffered from cystic acne on my forehead since quitting smoking?  My skin has never been great but what I've been experiencing is ten times worse then ever before.  It's been about 10-11 weeks since I stopped, and it's really embarrassing and I've done everything a person should do for good skin (Hot to Cold Showers, wash bedding once or twice a week, plenty of water, exercise, vitamins) but my body's just doing what it wants.  I've read through weird google searches that it takes your skin the longest to purge all the crazy toxins from cigarettes, but this has been nuts. Any comments would be greatly appreciated...Thanks a million guys!

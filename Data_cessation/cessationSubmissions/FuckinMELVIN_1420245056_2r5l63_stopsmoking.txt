Sleep problems

So far I've yet to face any cravings for cigarettes. When the tiniest bit of temptation comes around, I just shrug it off and it all recedes in an instant. Water helps a lot. Here's the thing though. I'm not able to sleep well. I wake up every hour and it's messing with my busy schedule. Is there an easy fix to this problem? A quick Google search tells me that the problem will persist for a week or so and is quite common. The problem with those answers are that people who wake up in the night actually crave for cigarettes that lead up to their failure to sleep. I wake up to no cravings. Just general restlessness.

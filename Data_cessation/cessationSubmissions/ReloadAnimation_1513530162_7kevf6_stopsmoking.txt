Paying it forward

This place, man.

  On March 3, 2016 I put out my last cigarette and made a decision.

That decision was only strengthened by this great support group of strangers.

It's coming up on 2 years of no cigarettes for me, and cigarettes are a distant memory. Every now and then, I'll smell cigarette smoke and be reminded. However, it's not a tempting smell any more, but much more the smell of an old ex-girlfriend that trickles into your thoughts every now and again.

As time goes on, you think about the ex-girlfriend less and less, and those terrible feelings you remember turn into an appreciation for a chapter of your life that is now closed.

I respect cigarettes (at a distance) for what they provided me at the time (an outing for my feelings, but very much a facade).

That doesn't mean I'm out of the fight. Even though my cigarette smoking stopped, my marijuana smoking continued and grew substantially. It had become my new vice in life. I now frequent /r/leaves and am on my way to having completely smoke free lungs.

I just want to let you people know, that cigarettes are simply superfluous. The only thing keeping you wanting a cigarette is the last cigarette you smoked. The nerves that you think are subsided with nicotine are anything but subsided. 


Take control! I did, and so can you.

Edit: forgot to mention, I don't have a flair with my days because that was a different Reddit account.

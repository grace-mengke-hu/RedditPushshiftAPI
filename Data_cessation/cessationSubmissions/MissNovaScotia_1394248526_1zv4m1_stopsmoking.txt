Where to start with quitting?

I'm 36 years old and have smoked daily since I was 12, with the exception of during my pregnancy. I thought I could stay quit after I had the baby, but within 24 hours I was outside smoking.  Most of my cigarettes each day are not enjoyable and required because of the addiction, but there are still a couple that I love (first one in the morning with a cup of tea and right before bed).  I use smoking as an excuse that it helps my anxiety and helps to deal with the stress of being a new mom, but I do know that these are excuses and it is pure addiction. 

I need to quit, it's not fair to my three month old that I can't enjoy spending time with him because I'm waiting for him to go to sleep so I can outside and and have a smoke; but I'm honestly not 100% sure I want to. Looking for advice on where to start.  Do I take the plunge and go cold turkey or pick a quit date? Nicotine replacement therapies? Any recommendations would be great.

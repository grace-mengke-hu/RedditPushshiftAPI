Must...not...smoke

I have not had a cigarette in 33 days. I stopped keeping track after 2 weeks so I had to check my app to confirm.

Been sitting here drinking wine since 4pm and would love a smoke right now. But I know I can't just have the one I want. I'd have to have all the others I don't want. So given the decision to have none or all, I choose none; because the shitty ones that make me a slave to Nic come with that one that is ohhhhh so good. 

Nic is not my buddy, my pal, nor my friend. He will bring me to the end. Whenever he goes. I need him to know. He's not my buddy, pal, nor friend.

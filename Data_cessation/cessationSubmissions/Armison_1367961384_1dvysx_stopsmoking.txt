100 days and I love not smoking.

Here are my top 3 contrarian quit tips:

Face your triggers head on and right away. I didn't avoid any people, places or activities that would trigger smoking urges. The only way to break the association with smoking is to do it as a non-smoker. (Be cautious with early alcohol use though.)

Work through any smoking urges instead of trying to get rid of them or distract yourself. Working through each urge solidified the reasons why I didn't want to smoke. Smoking always comes out the loser in any cost/benefit analysis.
 
Remember that smoking *is always* an option. No one is forcing me to stop. I can start again any time I want. It's not that smoking is off limits to me, I just don't want to do it.

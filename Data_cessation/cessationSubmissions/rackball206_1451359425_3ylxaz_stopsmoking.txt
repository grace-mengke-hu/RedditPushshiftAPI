Fuck!

I was at a month with out smoking. Little to no cravings and didn't even think about it anymore. Today was absolutely terrible. I broke down and bought a pack. I smoked 3 and I'm about to toss them out before I go to bed. Do I start over?

 I already don't want to smoke anymore. In fact I went to the bar. Had a few drinks and went home. Didn't smoke. I know tomorrow I'll wake up and keep going. Anyone else go through similar stages? 

I went that whole month and it was pretty easy for me. Has anyone else gone through stages of not smoking for prolonged periods of time just to have a few and then continue the non smoking?

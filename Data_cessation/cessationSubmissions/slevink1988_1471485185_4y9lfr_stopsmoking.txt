I just realized how far I made it

I didn't eve realize until my World of Warcraft account went to renew, I haven't bought cigarettes in 2 months! It was not only a shock but such a relief! The thought of forgetting about it, made me feel like I am in a good place! People who are just starting to quit, keep it up! You can do it!

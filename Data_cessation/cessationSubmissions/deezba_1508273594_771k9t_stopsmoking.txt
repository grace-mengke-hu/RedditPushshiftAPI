2 months today !!!

So Iâ€™m celebrating my 2 months of being smoke free. (Sorry for the grammar mistakes, not a native speaker) smoked a pack a day for 12 years. 

I went cold turkey after being hospitalized for a pulmonary embolism &amp; deep-vein thrombosis (yeah, contraceptive pills + smoking kills, and thatâ€™s not a myth). I did not choose to stop, I had no choice cause my lungs were really damaged. And they still are, but they can slowly heal now.

For all of the people starting a new life without cigs: trust me, It gets easier. Now I donâ€™t have any cravings, I can go out with my friends without wanting to smoke, and sometimes I forget that I once was a smoker. 
Iâ€™m still having tons of dreams where I smoke and when Iâ€™m waking up I feel so relieved. I know that smoking again will be a disaster to my body, especially about what happened to my lungs and the fact that I almost died because of smoking.

The best part is how amazing it is to be free of smoking, to not having to Â«Â prepareÂ Â» to when and how Iâ€™ll be able to smoke. There is also the money, and wow. Everything about stopping is so amazing, trust me, itâ€™s worth it. I went to this sub every time I had a craving, it was seriously really helpful. 
 
Anyway, all the best to everyone ðŸ’ª

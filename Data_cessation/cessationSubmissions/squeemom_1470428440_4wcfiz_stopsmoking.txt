Partying while Quitting

I didn't plan to quit until my birthday in early September. I had all of these plans in the next month. Parties, concerts, bbqs, etc. I didn't think I could quit and make it through all that without relapse. But, Monday night I got so fed up with drowning in my own phlegm that I threw my smokes out the window on my drive home from work and haven't smoked since. (I am vaping and using lozenges so I'm not cold turkey.)

The first of many social gatherings is coming up tomorrow. I'm worried about going. I'm worried about smoking. I would cancel but if I have to cancel all my plans and do everything differently to quit I'll be more likely to think my life sucks without cigs and throw in the towel. I need to learn to hang out with my friends, sooner rather than later. It's my only other source of stress relief and without it, I'll go crazy. Should I just not drink? Try to hang with the non-smokers? Use my vape? Remember nearly drowning in my own mucus? All of the above? Any tips for engaging in an active social life with smokers while trying to quit?

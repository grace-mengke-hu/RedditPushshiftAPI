My experience this past weekend - might be helpful

I wanted to share my experience from this past weekend as I found it to be really helpful.  I have been trying to quit this shit for about 6 months now.  I manage to make decent progress during the week, but when Thursday night / the weekend rolls around, I find myself walking to 7-Eleven to buy a pack (especially if I have been drinking).

This past weekend, I went to a wedding in VA.  I was on a mountain, away from any real accessible stores that might sell a pack.  I purposely did not bring cigarettes and I was fairly confident that there would not be a lot of smokers at the wedding.  Sure enough, there wasn't.  Although I craved smoking really badly on Friday and Saturday night, there was basically nothing I could do about it because I had been drinking, I was on a mountain, and no one else had cigarettes. 

Basically, what I'm getting at is if anyone here is having the same difficulties that I had, maybe try taking a camping trip or something to remove yourself from possible temptations for a weekend.  This is the first full week I've gone without smoking in I don't even know how long, and I am fucking thrilled.  It might seem like a lot of effort (or maybe not), but it worked.  Plus, it could be fun.

Anyways, my 2 cents.

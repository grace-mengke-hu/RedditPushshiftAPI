Day 20 smoke free!

Never thought I'd get this far. I've had a few hard days but somehow got through them. One of the things that has helped me was downloading an app called smoke free. It really gives you food for thought, shows you how well you're doing (health wise and financially). Just aiming for the one month mark now.  :-) Good luck to all you quitters.  Stay strong! üëç

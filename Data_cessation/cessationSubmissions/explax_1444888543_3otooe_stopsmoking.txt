Day four and beyond (the first weekend)

Hi everyone,

I had only been smoking for about 4 years and only up to a maximum of around 10 a day. I took the decision to quit on Monday.

Day 1 and 2 were particularly bad but so far so good. I have some sleeping and digestion issues that may or may not be related to the quit but not too problematic.

I am struggling with the concept of never smoking again however.. I really enjoyed (or at least my brain is telling me that i enjoyed smoking) and of course, a lot of the good times ive had has involved me smoking (of course so have the bad times but your brain doesnt seem to link them as well).

What i need is a strategy, so when i am next out watching the football with my friends, or out at the pub/club, or even just out on a walk i can stay strong?

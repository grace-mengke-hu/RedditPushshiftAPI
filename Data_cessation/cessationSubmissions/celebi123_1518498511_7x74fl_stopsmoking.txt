Feeling like shit.

I had my last smoke 5 days ago. I'm starting to get all the withdrawal/whatever symptoms they are. I have a headache, I am irritable, my throat is sore and scratchy and I've been coughing up gross stuff. 
I can't afford to smoke anymore, that's what caused me to give up in the first place. It was super easy the first 3 days but now I don't know if I can make it through. I need something to keep me going.

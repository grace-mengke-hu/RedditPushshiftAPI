10 days in and I've never felt better@

It's amazing how much better you can feel going a little over a week without a cigarette. I can smell and taste things better already. (The smell of coffee in the morning is one of my new favorite smells.) I sleep better, and don't wake up as tired anymore! Before I would smoke a cigarette just before bed and it was a mission to get myself out and ready for the day. Now I can wake up fairly easily and have enough time to shower and eat breakfast! The gym is 10x better as well. I can actually breathe when I'm working out! 

I still get cravings. Nothing too bad though. My friends still smoke so I'm tempted to bum one off them but I tell myself I don't need it. The one thing I did notice though was that I can actually smell cigarettes now. Before I guess I got so used to the smell that I never noticed it. Goes to show you how much I smoked!

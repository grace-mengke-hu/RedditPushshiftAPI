I have to be careful because I've been eating more since I stopped smoking.

This coming Wednesday it will be two weeks since I quit smoking. I went cold turkey.  Although my appetite stayed about the same, I now see it's been increasing. I have to watch it because I lost about 20 lbs during the last several years and no way do I want to gain it back! Drinking lots of water and working out will be key to keeping the weight off.

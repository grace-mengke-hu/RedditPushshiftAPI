What I learned from my last relapse

I was 2 weeks smoke free before, and I knew that smoking didnt really do anything for me, but I still romanticized the thought of a cigarette.

Then when I relapsed I realized, I do NOT like smoking!! I thought I enjoyed it before, maybe if anything I enjoyed seeing smoke pillows coming out of my lungs, but at what cost! Really though everything else I dont actually like about smoking, it was only an addiction that was relieving withdrawal and a habit for my mouth and hands.

After I didnt smoke for those 2 weeks then relapsed, **I realized how shitty tobacco actually tastes like! I didnt like the taste of cigarettes I only tolerated it because of the addiction!** It has been much easier this time around when I get a craving I just think about how shitty it tasted to inhale that smoke after being clean for a while. **There really is nothing to miss about smoking,** now I just have to let the hand/mouth habit leave my subconscious in time.

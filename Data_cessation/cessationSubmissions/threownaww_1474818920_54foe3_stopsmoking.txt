How can I stop my cravings that are triggered by studying?

I quit nearly 3 months ago, at the beginning of summer. Until then I always had smoke breaks while studying and - I will not lie - these breaks helped me a lot get through my courses. I knew it would be impossible for me to quit while I had such heavy school work, and so I quit immediately after my finals. I thought I would have had enough time during the summer to adapt to not being able to smoke. I was going strong for three months, without it even crossing my mind lately, but once uni started again and I started doing homework for classes, the cravings returned. Every time I sit down to study I get cravings to smoke and can't really concentrate. I tried lighting candles instead and just forcing myself to study. Usually, if I found out something triggered my cravings, like drinking or a certain place, I would just avoid it. Yet, I can't just not study. This is turning to be incredible difficult for me. Does anyone have any advice to help me get through this? I absolutely don't want to fall back to my bad habits but I feel like I might have no choice if I want to graduate.

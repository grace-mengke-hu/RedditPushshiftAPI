Just realized it's been a year!

Wow!  I really am a non-smoker!  I smoked a pack a day for 25 years, and quit cold-turkey a year ago yesterday!  I had tried several times over the years, but it never stuck.  And my "secret to success" is no secret - when you quit for the right reason, it's not that big of a struggle.  My SO said he wanted to grow old with me, and I wanted that too, so we quit together!  
When it's right, it's right

60 days and counting.

I feel amazing. When I was still smoking I was afraid I would never be able to quit but I'm already 60 days into my journey and I couldn't feel better about it.

Thanks to everyone for all of the support. My piece of advice for the day for anyone who is struggling with this addiction: Believe in yourself. You are stronger than you could ever imagine. All it takes is for you to want it bad enough. There might be hiccups but as long as you try, you are working to become better than you were the day before.

Quitting Smoking today: Day 0, hour 1.

I am tired of lying to myself, others, and most especially my girlfriend. I love her dearly and this Feb 14, it will be our 1yr anniversary. I am a 31 yr old veteran and this day has been harder than three combat deployments.

But it’s gotta happen. Today is Day 0, hour 1. Wish me luck y’all.

I am as of two hours ago trying not to smoke anymore. Is this really possible? I have failed so many times.

I have tried countless times and failed. I could really use some encouragement, and especially some tips for getting through the first few days. I want to do this. I just don't know if I can. 

UPDATE: I have been smoke free since I made this thread!! it's the longest I've gone without a cigarette in a long time. I have gone through a pack of gum, and last night, I was craving really, really hard. So I took a few shots of Jameson and that helped me get through the night. Thank you guys so much, you all's support has really really helped me stay strong.

Friday will be a big test of willpower.

On Friday at 2pm we have the vet coming to put our old girl (dog) to sleep as she's slowly deteriorating with an inoperable tumour, they are coming to the house to make it less stressful for her.. She's 13yrs old and I've had her for 10.5yrs.. She is my best mate and I know I'm going to be devastated. I just hope I don't cave in and smoke.. Fingers crossed I wont.

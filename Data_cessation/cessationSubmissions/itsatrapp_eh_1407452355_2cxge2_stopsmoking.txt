Just some advice for all who have just quit and those who are about to quit.

I came to a realization yesterday about this journey I have taken down the quit smoking road. What I have done over the past almost 4 months now is not just quit smoking, but I have made a lifestyle change. During the first month I was eating like shit, and looking for anything that I could find to take my mind off smoking. The day I dusted off my bike and went on my first bike ride was the day my quitting smoking became something else. I only rode 6 KM that day and was absolutely pooped after. I have put almost 700 KM on my bike since 03/05/2014, so that is a little more that 2 month ago. That 6 KM bike ride that I took on the first day has turned into an average of 25 KM x 4 times a week and my longest bike ride to date of 40 KM yesterday. Not to mention working out for 45 minutes a day x 4 times per week. The part that made it all worth while was when I saw some good friends for the first time in about 6 months their exact words were "HOLY SHIT have you been working out", validation of my hard work I guess. Anyway..... I think my point in all of this is, smoking becomes such a part of you that you are happy to just sit there and do nothing so that you can smoke more. (Stupid right?) When you quit find a way to make get active and replace your bad habit with a good one. I am now a way more productive person, things that I have been putting off for years a getting done, it feels good! Always remember that quitting is way easier than your mind makes it out to be. Good luck to all!


TL;DR 
When you quit smoking, start exercising, and become more productive.

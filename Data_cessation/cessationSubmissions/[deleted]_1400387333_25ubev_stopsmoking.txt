I am bored, I just want to buy a pack :/ (1 week quit)

I understand the consequences of smoking, the entirety behind the success of quitting it, though I still cannot cure my thirst for smoking when it comes to boredom.  Saturday night, I'm not a very popular guy so I sit home and essentially do nothing.  With that being said, a logical and seemingly appealing thought just comes nicely to my head 'I should drive over to the store, buy myself a pack and have a nice coffee to go along with it'.  I'm not sure what to do unfortunately.

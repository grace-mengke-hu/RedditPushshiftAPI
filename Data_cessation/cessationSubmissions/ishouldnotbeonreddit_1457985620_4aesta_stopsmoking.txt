I can't believe how long I did this to myself: Insight for "light" smokers.

I read [this link](http://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_01_13_gradual_withdrawal.html) a few days ago. I was never a pack-a-day smoker, but I would smoke furiously during stressful times in college, then pare down to just one or two a day, then, trying to quit, I would smoke just one a day, or one every other day. I never could seem to make it past that third day without caving in. And I always wondered why it was so hard for me to quit, when I was hardly smoking at all! 

Sometimes I would be successful-- I've even gone whole years without smoking-- but then I'd have one at a party, or during a fight with my husband, and it would seem like I was back at square one. Now I realize-- I *was* back at square one. I have been keeping myself in chronic withdrawal for *years!* 

It is so much easier even now, at day 16, than it was just a week ago. I feel so dumb. Not one more puff, EVER!

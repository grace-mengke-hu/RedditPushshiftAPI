Today's the day!

I'm sure a lot of us had little smoking routines. I would usually smoke after meals, for example.

I'm trying nicotine patches so I'm not dealing with the physical withdrawals yet, but it feels really weird to not have had a smoke by now, and it's bothering me a bit. It just feels like something's missing because I haven't (and won't!) have that cigarette.

How did you guys adjust to a new, smoke-free routine?

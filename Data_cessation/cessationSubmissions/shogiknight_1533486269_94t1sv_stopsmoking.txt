Not smoked for a month now

I stopped smoking around a month back. Had few cravings (around 5-6) in the first week and then from there no more. I had been smoking for the last 4 years. There are certain tactics which I use, I would like to share on this forum

1. To stop smoking, don't buy cigarettes in the first place. 
2. Try to be with the non-smoker friends.
3. Have a target for yourself. Like for me its better health mentally and Physically.
4. Join a gym or sports team.
5. Don't do things which trigger cravings. I liked to drink tea while smoking. So I stooped drinking tea as well. I am Currently taking milk with protein( Ya joined a gym :) ) as a substitute to it.
6. Say NO at first whenever someone offers you a puff. Most of them will not force when they hear a No. 

These are my tricks for not smoking. Hope these will help somebody.

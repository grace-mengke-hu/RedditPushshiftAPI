Quitting right here. Right now.

I'm quitting smoking right here, right now, at age 24, after three years of smoking. I've quit for a few days to a few months a multitude of times. I'm posting this to remind myself that this is it. This is the last and final time I'm quitting. It's for good this time. I feel that three years isn't very long to be smoking and that I can fully restore my health and the damage I may have done. I've struggled with anxiety and OCD for 10 years and, although I'm not overweight at all, I have always wanted to be in shape. Cigarettes have been holding me back from my dreams of being less anxious, less obsessive-compulsive, and more fit. Anybody have any advice or additional motivation for a guy like me?

Please talk me out of this.

I need a fucking cigarette.

My boyfriend has some health problems (severe insomnia and chronic pain) and I was already at the point of total, can't move, can't get out of bed depression yesterday because I was worn out from worrying about him. This morning his boss at the restaurant he works at Facebook messaged me and said he didn't show up for work. She's worried, everyone worries about him, so that got my anxiety going again. There is a 99% chance he is not at work because he can't wake up and/or his back hurts too much to get out of bed. Meaning he's ok, basically.
I have a massive headache and I'm crying from the stress. I live with my parents and when I told my mom this, she rolled her eyes and said "yeah I know. You woke me up at 5 this morning when you told your dad. Sure is nice you have empathy for everyone except me."

I need a fucking cigarette.

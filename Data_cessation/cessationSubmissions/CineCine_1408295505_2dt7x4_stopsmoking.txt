Forgot to put on my patches

I just finished 2/3 of my nicotine patch rounds (4 weeks) and get this: I forgot to take the patch over the last 3 days. Just remembered! Since most of the nicotine is technically out of my system, I'm thinking I'll just stay off the patch and live the nicotine-free life. Is this a mistake? Any tips on how to deal with urges immediately after the patch?

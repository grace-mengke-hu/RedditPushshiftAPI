130 Days - I'm worried about putting on weight!

So just recently reached the 4 month mark *squee* and I've been working and such...one thing that's really grippling me though is the constant fear of putting on weight.

I've noticed I've developed a lil weight gain, nothing too excessive, but I'm just concerned if this is just a short term thing, I know smoking burned 1000 calories or something a month, and when you quit it slows your metabolism right down...

I finally have the time to start exercising and the money/time to start making healthier foods, going smoothie crazy and eating those horrifying celery sticks.

I was just curious if anybody else has experienced weight gain within the first few months, and if your metabolism sort of goes back to normal after a while? (Prior to smoking, I had no issues with weight gaining!)

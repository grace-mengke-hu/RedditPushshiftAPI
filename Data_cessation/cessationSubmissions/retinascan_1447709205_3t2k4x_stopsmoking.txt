I quit because i got sick...

I know this sounds odd but I went to a Veterans Day dinner last Wednesday and ran out of cigarettes. I didn't buy any on the way home. 

On Thursday morning, I felt like total crap. I had a cough and a stuffy nose and a running fever. No idea where i caught this bug. My  new wife who is newly pregnant was just fine though. Thanks Flu shot!

The thought of smoking was revolting to me and now it's day number 5.

It worked out nicely that I didn't have any smokes and I was sick for a few days.

I'm still not 100% yet and I know I will be soon. Question is: will i give in and buy cigarettes or will I want to keep the streak going?

Hard to say but only one way to find out.

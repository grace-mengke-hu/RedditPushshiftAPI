It's already been a month!

Holy crap, I really can't believe it's already been a month. My manic energy has subsided a bit, I gained a couple of pounds but hey- today I power walked up a hill to catch a bus, and while my heart was racing I wasn't panting and about to die. I feel great! A few cravings here and there, but chewing gum has been my best friend and when the cravings come I try and remind myself that the addiction is gone- it's all mental and Damnit, a stupid craving isn't going to beat me. It wouldn't taste good anyways!! I'm stronger than this, I feel great- there's no stopping me now! 

So here's to all you other quitters! Cheers to a summer of healthier living!!

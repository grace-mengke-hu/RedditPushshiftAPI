Big night last night

Hey all. I’ve posted here a lot but I’m finally a non smoker and it makes me feel way better not to have to keep resetting my badge and feeling guilty. Anyways I am an Allen Carr believer and I’m still within the three week period of being some what  brainwashed. Last night I was a little close to bumming a cig off a friend but was quickly and easily talked out of it.

Keep with it guys! Don’t smoke today!

I want you to hear this.

I've been smoking for 7 years and have struggled to quit for about hundred times if not more. Sometimes I managed to stop for a day, sometimes a week and it has been a few months too but eventually I always started smoking again. And I was asking myself what's the point of trying if I can't succeed. I tried a lot and I gave up a lot. I think I even punished myself for this never-ending failing with some more smoking based self-destruction. But just to let some time pass and then try to quit again. And you know what, I think I actually succeeded the very last time. It's been more than 2 years now and I don't even miss this shit anymore, I don't even think about it. It's possible. So do not give up. It doesn't matter if you have failed before. If you keep trying you will do it eventually. Just keep trying. Fight.

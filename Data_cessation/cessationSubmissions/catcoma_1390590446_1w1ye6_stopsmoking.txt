How do you deal with relapse?

So, I tried to quit for the first time ever a week ago. This was the first time I told myself I was DONE and wanted to be committed. It was disgusting and I was ready to be healthy again. I wrote motivational things everywhere, I planned my days out by the hour to keep myself constantly busy, and I got rid of every single butt that was anywhere near my home. I did well the first two days until I found out my boyfriend was still smoking (we planned on quitting together). In no way am I blaming this on him--this is MY fault, and I should have had a better method of avoiding this--but I gave into a cigarette. And just like that it was like I never even quit. I went on and off with smoking up until now. Earlier this week, I bought nicotine lozenges. That didn't work. And it's not like I just want to give up and just go back to smoking because I failed. I so badly want to give this up but it's crazy how your mind can trick you. So, for those of you that have failed a couple of times quitting, how did you get back on track? Any advice you would like to give me?

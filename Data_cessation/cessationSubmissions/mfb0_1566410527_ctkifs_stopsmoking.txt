Stopsmokers, I need help

I quit smoking cigarettes just over 4 weeks ago and used an e-cig to help. In the first few days I used it a lot, but since have only needed a couple of puffs every few hours. I’ve been on holiday with my mum - who doesn’t know I ever smoked - and haven’t had any nicotine since Sunday morning. I’ve had horrendous headaches and fatigue which I assume is linked to nicotine withdrawals.

Help motivate me to stay away from returning to the e-cig please?

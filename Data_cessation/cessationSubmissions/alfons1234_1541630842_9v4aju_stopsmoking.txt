I need honest opinion on starting vaping with nic-free liquid.

I’m finishing my 4th day without Cig (12 years of smoking). I don’t have nicotine carvings buy my mood is going south. I have noticed that I cry every evening after work. Today the whole day I’m walking and feeling depressed.. my partner even noticed that I stopped talking.. so accepting that something wrong is happening mentally with me will it be helpful to start the vape thing but without nicotine.. I don’t want any more nicotine in my system as I struggled a lot in first two days and I never want to go through that but I really can’t handle the mental game of changing habits. I’m not the person that will start jogging, running, meditation or drink water ( I’m the most unhealthy person ever and I absolutely hate water like I’m literally chocking on it hehe ) so I’m looking at alternatives that will help ease my habit withdrawals :(. Did anyone tried vapes with nicotine-free liquids?

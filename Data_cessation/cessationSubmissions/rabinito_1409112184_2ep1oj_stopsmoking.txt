First month gone!

I can't believe I made it. I quit smoking, went (almost) Paleo and started exercising heavily all at the same time. I really wanted to test myself, but wasn't very confident I was going to actually do it.

I smoked for 17 years (of the 30 I lived) and never ever tried to quite before.

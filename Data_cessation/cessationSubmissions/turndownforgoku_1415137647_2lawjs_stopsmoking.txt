Haven't tried in a while

As soon as I realized I was addicted, i tried, I managed to stop for a month- twice now every time I "try" I it lasts a day. The last time it happened I stopped for a month it took something emotionally jarring. So i'm wondering what does it take to maintain that level of commitment?

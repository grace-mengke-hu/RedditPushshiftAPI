Days 3 & 4 are the hardest. Any suggestions? (More info inside)

So I've tried to quit many times and usually fail around Day 3 or 4 because the cravings become unbearable. I'm on Day 3 now & want to be prepared for how to get through the next few days without eating myself into a coma. I have been waking up & doing sit-ups, jumping jacks, and push-ups with my morning coffee (this is unbelievably helpful). Then to the gym to staunch post-lunch cravings. But at night, that's when the monster starts growling. I'd love advice on how to quell these nighttime urges without potato chips & ice cream. Any suggestions are welcome!

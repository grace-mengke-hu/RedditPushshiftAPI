Feeling good at 253 days smoke free!!!

Yesterday, my SO told me that he is truly proud of me for having such willpower to quit the cigs... that made me smile so much! It is definitely a temptation that I still deal with, ESPECIALLY while drinking or being around friends / loved ones when they smoke cigarettes... but I just wanted to let everyone know who is in this battle with me, that you are not alone! You CAN do this!!! You CAN beat the temptations that cigarettes bring. Good luck, fellow quitters... We are making ourselves healthier with each day we conquer :)

Just Breathe! versus Freedom From Smoking

Folks,

I'm a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the Philadelphia area.  I do a lot of work in behavioral health and I'm really interested in figuring out the best way to help people quit smoking.

I'm curious if anyone out there has actually done something like the Freedom From Smoking (FFS) program that the American Lung Association offers.  If so, was it helpful?  

If anyone out there lives in the Philadelphia area, I'm going to be running some FFS groups and comparing them to a new quit smoking program I have developed called Just Breathe!  Both programs are in person, group format, support meetings.  FFS is often considered the "gold standard" in smoking cessation programs, but I honestly think my program will be better.  It takes the best of FFS, the best of cognitive-behavioral therapy for stress, motivational interviewing, and mindfulness based stress reduction and combines them into a targeted program to help people quit.

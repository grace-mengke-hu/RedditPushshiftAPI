I'd like to stop, but smoking is allowed pretty much everywhere in my country

In bars, cafes, restaurants... People even have places to sneak off for a smoke in my university building. Cigarettes aren't too expensive and I don't really *want* to quit right now. I've been on a health kick though, and I keep thinking 'if not now, when?'

I just don't know how.

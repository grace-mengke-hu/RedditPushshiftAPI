Redditors help this Redditor quit!

Here's my story. I've been a smoker for about 5 years now. Started in high school because I thought it was cool. At the time I was a cross country runner who's name was known throughout the state. 

Fast forward to present day, leaving out quite a few details I recently overcame post traumatic stress syndrome and heavy self medicating with alcohol. Over the past few months I've conquered all of my demons, and am happier than ever. 

During those dark times I met the woman of my dreams. I never once doubted I wouldn't spend the rest of my life with her. Because of my conditions and alcohol abuse at the time we separated, so I could find my way without bringing her down with me. We recently reconnected. Everything is great, we are so happy. Today she told me "Ill be yours as soon as you quit smoking, and visit the fucking dentist".

Smoking has always been an issue I put to the side. With so many obstacles I was facing, I figured that once I conquered those ill quit. Well, the day has come. And I'm scared shitless. 

I've read articles, books, watched videos, you name it. I've been looking for inspiration to quit. It's scary! This is my first reddit post. I never had anything worthwhile to say until now. Fellow ex smokers, I need your help! What was the one thing that really pushed you to quit? Do you have any advice? And how do you get over the "it's just one stoge" dilemma?

Jesus. I need a smoke.

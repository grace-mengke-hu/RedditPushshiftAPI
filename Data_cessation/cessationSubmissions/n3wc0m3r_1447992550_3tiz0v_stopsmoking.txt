How long after quitting was your body better able to handle stress like that of a non-smoker???

It's been 110 days, and I get incredibly stressed out-- I recently went back to school full time as a junior in a difficult program, taking 15 credits, all 300 level plus courses--accounting-- and I thought I had beat the stress thing... but it has become apparent that my body hasn't quite learned to cope with stress like when i was smoking


Sometimes I get so stressed out i cant think when in retrospect i SHOULD NOT have gotten that stressed out given the circumstances..

I realize I need to find something productive like working out or exercising to release tension and etc... but i was under the impression that my body would learn to handle stress like that of a non-smoker without the nicotine--- how long do you think this will take??

I smoked a half-full pack for the first four years i smoked then i was smoking about a pack to a pack and a half for the following 6 years..
I'm a 23 year old male

tl:dr 23 year old male quit smoking 110 days ago. when will body learn to deal with stress on its own

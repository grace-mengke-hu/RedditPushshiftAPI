If you're in the military, read this now.

The armed forces will provide medication to you. All you have to do is ask. I'm on Wellbutrin right now and it's working fantastically and it's fucking FREE. They also provide nicotine patches and gum and if you're too bad, then Chantix can also be prescribed.  

Quit using the excuse "I'm in the military and everyone smokes". 

I am two days clean and can say that I've never felt better. I've never been able to breathe this well in 7 years since I started. And I can taste and smell again. 

And it only gets better.

Get help. It's free. 2 days clean.

44 Days, relapse: smoking makes me a better person

I've avoided cigarettes well enough for over a month. It's been 44 days, not even a puff until tonight. Was drinking with a recent ex-smoker, and she told me she had a stash of cigarettes hidden away. Well, with a fire lit under us, we shared a smoke under the stars. 

It was amazing. Still is amazing. I know it sounds romantic, or delusional - but a cigarette just makes me feel better about everything in my life. Relaxes and simplifies things. It makes visual detail stand out more, it encourages my 'creative juices' to start flowing, makes things make more sense. It's like my brain is confused and clouded before I light up - and sharp and focused as soon as a couple drags get into me. I feel confident and able to confront my problems, motivated to make positive changes in my life. 

Does anyone else feel this night-and-day difference with smoking?

I know it hasn't been long since I've quit, but I've quit for 3 years before this, and found that even as I started up again about a year ago, the same dramatic difference was noticeable. I feel I'm a better, smarter, more put together person when I'm smoking than when I'm not (which makes it difficult to hate smoking). 

Before the posts start rolling in - I'd like to say upfront: I haven't read the book everyone talks about, and I quit this time with patches. 

Just looking for a general discussion, maybe some tips on how to get over this feeling about smoking. I know it's bad for me. I'm back on the horse right away, and won't be smoking again anytime soon. 

TL;DNR: Smoking makes me feel like a better person, so it's hard to stop.

I wanna quit smoking, but...

Hey guys, I smoke a pack of cigarettes per day or more if I'm working and I really wanna quit but I have problem.
I'm working as a bartender and I'm always surounded by smokers, drinks and partys. 
What state of mind should I adopt? I know will be verry hard for me but I really wanna do it.
Any advices guys? 
Thank you and sorry for my english but is not my native languge.
Have a nice day!

Replacements for smoking

I've decided to quit, and I am at day 9 now. The thing is I get really really scared before many things. From exams, to studying to simple things like opening my email. Since I quit, I've gotten no work done last week. The anxiety just builds up and I end up not doing anything. When I smoked I used to go for a smoke whenever I feel this huge bulge of anxiousness build up in my chest. I really need to solve this, exams are coming up and I REALLY need to start doing start doing something. Would it be better to go back to smoking and then quit during christmas break?

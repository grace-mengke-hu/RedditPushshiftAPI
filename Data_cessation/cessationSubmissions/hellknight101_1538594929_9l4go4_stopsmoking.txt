It's been 24 hours since I decided to quit cold turkey. It's worse than I thought it would be.

To give some context, I have never been a heavy smoker. I only smoked around 5 cigarettes a day, which a lot of people would say is not enough to actually get addicted. Instead of throwing away the ciggies, I decided to buy a vape to "quit" (when in reality, I just wanted to try the flavours). I have had a vaping addiction for over 2 years and while it is, in fact, not as bad as smoking, I still felt a lot of negative side effects from nicotine. 

First off, I often had heart palpitation which would make me restless, anxious and prevent me from sleeping. Moreover, it seems that my mental state has also been affected. My mind felt very cloudy whenever I vaped and it was hard for me to concentrate for long periods of time. I have been planning to quit for a long time but it wasn't until last night when I felt a strong tightness in my chest that I decided that it was time to quit. I threw my vape in the bin and made sure there weren't any lighters in my vicinity. 

24 hours later and I feel like shit. In the mornings it wasn't so bad but now my cravings are getting out of control. I tried occupying myself with pretty much everything (studying, gaming, reading) but all I can think of is cigarettes. I also noticed that there are occasional spikes in my heart rate. I called my local clinic and they told me that this is normal for someone who has quit just recently. Holy hell, this is pure torture.

Does anyone know how to best fight the cravings?

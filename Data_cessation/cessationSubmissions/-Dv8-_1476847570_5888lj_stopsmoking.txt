I'm done.

Had my final cig at 9:36 this morning.  I'm at a little over 12 hrs as of writing this.  Was up to about 15-18 a day, more if I drank.  I'm 33, work a high stress job, and have been smoking for about 12 years now.  I'm currently working as a family attorney so plenty of stress and opportunity to smoke.  I'm tired of being tired.  I'm done wasting money.  Started chantex a week ago.  Noticed the cigs tasting worse and worse until this morning I actually threw up a little in mouth after my morning smoke.  Had 4 marked for the day but I knew after that one that I was done.  Been checking this sub for awhile as I gathered the gumption to finally make the leap, just wanted to thank all kind people for the inspiration you've provided me.

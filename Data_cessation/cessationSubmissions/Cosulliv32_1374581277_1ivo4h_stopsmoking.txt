Day 3. Never give up, never surrender.

This is my third day of the journey. Yesterday was rough, I was shaky, couldn't sleep, and grumpy to say the least. What blew my mind the most was how much I ate. I'm proud to say that is over with and I'm on to day 3. I have weird cravings, and it's early, but jolly ranchers and gum are keeping me in high spirits. From your experience, when does it get easier?

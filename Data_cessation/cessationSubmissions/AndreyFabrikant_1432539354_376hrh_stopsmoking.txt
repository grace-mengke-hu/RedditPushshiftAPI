Why quit

My friend, my colleagues asking me why i stopped smoking.
Well, honestly, the easiest way is to say that i quit because it causes serious damage to my health. But my reason lays a little deeper.
Try to remember the most horrible moment of your life. Do you remember what you were thinking? I bet at least once you thought: if I did (or did not) something earlier - it would not have happened. If i say/decide/do it a little before, i would avoid such a horrible consequences. 
My father died of lung cancer. I am sure that at least once he thought that if he quit smoking while he was young - maybe he would not get sick. So do I.
In a difficult moment we regret that we haven't done. And in the end people alway realize that everything in their life is their own fault.
So why wait something awful to start act. Use your imagination and quit smoking in time.

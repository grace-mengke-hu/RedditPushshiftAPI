Three weeks no smoking! Need advice staying smoke-free.

Hey everyone! I'm new to this subreddit. 
I quit smoking three weeks ago because my girlfriend said she wouldn't kiss me anymore if I didn't. I slightly resented that but as days went by, I found it a powerful tool. I smoked for 3 years, about a half-pack a day and didn't find it too hard to quit cold turkey. It wasn't my first time after all, I honestly couldn't tell you how many times I've tried in the past. 

This isn't the longest I've stopped for. My record is a month. I'm worried that I'm going to start up again when I get work. I'm a freelance lighting designer for concerts ect. and everyone I know in the industry smokes. I think another good reason why ive haven't had a smoke in 3 weeks is also because I haven't had work. (entertainment industry slows down during the holidays)

I guess the point of this thread is to ask for some help with getting past that first month. Last time I caved is because I thought I could handle having a smoke with a friend at a party. 

Also, when does this whole coughing up **** stop? HAH
So how do you get past the first month? How do you stay smoke free?

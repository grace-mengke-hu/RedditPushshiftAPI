What do you do to kill 5-15 min of waiting?

My biggest downfall is when I have less than 15 min to wait for something. Under 5min? No problem. Over 15 min, no problem. It's that 5-15 min range that kills me. Not enough time to do something productive on my list, but too much time to sit bored. I keep going back to cigarettes.

I've tried mobile games, but the ones I like take too long to load and require more than 15 min to finish to a stopping point. 

What do you do with your small wait time?

Things to do instead of smoking

Exercise)       is a great thing to do especially if you're starting out. Getting moving can give you energy and make you feel better to help with a stronger quit. Anything is better than nothing, walking is great, stretching, it doesn't have to be super intense if you're a beginner. If you've been working out for a while and know the drill, keep it up and discover the benefits of quitting smoking to your training, better performance and recovery as well as increased dedication to what you do as it helps in the process of quitting.

Food)       Using food as a crutch in the beginning of your quit may help you take your mind off things. I suggest as time goes on you develop healthier eating habits as it can help with focus and energy and just making yourself feel better and prouder. Quitting is about self improvement and eating good can be a big part of that, though I will admit some junk food in the beginning can be helpful to some. Use your heightened sense of taste and smell for foods you enjoy.

Hobbies)       Utilise the benefits to concentration that you will experience to read, write, dance, draw, game, whatever you enjoy. Find new levels of enjoyment to these things when you take the mind off the addiction.

Sleep)     You might find some trouble sleeping in the beginning. Stick with it and take care of your sleep hygiene as best you can. Quality sleep will give you energy and recover your body and mind. Without waking up through the night to smoke or waking up choking yourself etc you can maximise the benefits of quality sleep which will help you with your quit.

I thought I wanted a cig...

I'm not resetting my counter, because 84 days ago I decided to quit, but I broke down and bought a pack today. I smoked half a cigarette before I realized that whatever I thought I wanted, that wasn't it. So yes, I stumbled today, but I'm giving the 19 other cigarettes to someone that is a smoker, and I'm going to chalk this up as a lesson learned. What lesson is that? Cigarettes offer me nothing.

2 weeks smoke free

I was pretty much a closet smoker. I mostly smoked in the car. I don't any friend that smoke and no one in my family smokes. Smoking for about 20 years. I was smoking about a half a pack or more a day. And the cost for a pack is around $11. The next country is about $13. And the big city is around $16-18. I've been told but always wise enough to know not to make that purchase. 

I woke up one Saturday and said I was done. I smoked 4 times that day and once the following day and have been smoke free since. 

I am wearing a nicotine patch. But this is no way has made cravings any easier. I pretty much only smoked in the car. On my way to work and on my way home from work. There is still a split second when I get on the highway when I reach for my cigarettes that are no longer there. 

What has really helped it those green Starbucks stoppers. I twirl it, chew it, fiddle with it. I have even pretended to smoke it. I was stuck in 3 hours of traffic this week when they had to close the highway and there were cigarettes in the car and I could have found a lighter if I thought about it but I wasn't even tempted. 

The best part about being smoke free is not having my clothes stink. And I'm loving my skin and teeth. 

Another accomplishment was at a department store today. The escalator was broken and the elevator had a line. So I walked up the escalator and wasn't tired or out of breath. It was almost, dare I say easy. 

Since I quit, I have been making more of an effort to eat clean. And visit the gym. Walking is becoming a habit. I always used the fear of gaining weight as a reason not to quit. 

And food!!!!! Food is so much better. Which might be why people gain weight. The flavors in some of my favorite meals are enhanced. I also find I'm using more salt. 

Glad I found this group.

I've relapsed, going to crack this again three days from now.

Hi guys. I'm posting here for some motivation, I find things like this easier if I tell other people what I'm doing because I'll feel ashamed if I don't do it. I was a light smoker for three years then a heavy one for a year. I quit around 7 months ago using Alan Carr's book but about a week ago on a moment of weakness I caved. I feel if I can do it once I can do it again so I'm using this long weekend to deal with the crankyness without being at work.

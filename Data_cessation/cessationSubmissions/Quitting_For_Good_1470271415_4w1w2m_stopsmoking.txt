Thinking I should quit now

Hey all,
I'm currently 17 years old and have been smoking for about 4 months (Around 40 cigarettes a week)

I'm thinking that I should stop now while it's still early on because it's getting pretty expensive to smoke and I think it's best.

I know these threads are posted all the time but I'm just looking for some support. 

Do I quit cold turkey or just try ease up on the smoking?

Thanks for reading.

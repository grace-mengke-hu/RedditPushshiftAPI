Stress test

I had my first real stress test today , I didnâ€™t feel the I miss smoking thing I felt yesterday . I felt anger! Rage! I was pissed and damn it I needed that nicotine more than ever . I allowed my self to think that for 10 seconds . I breathed deeply and  acknowledged how angry I was . 1..2..3.. after 10 seconds I said okay thatâ€™s enough feeling sorry for yourself , your still on a mission get back to work . And here I am still on the wagon ğŸš­ğŸš­ğŸš­ğŸš­

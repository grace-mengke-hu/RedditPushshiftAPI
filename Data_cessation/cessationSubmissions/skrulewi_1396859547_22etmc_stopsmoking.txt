144 Hours, Last Day

Sunday night, 1:30 AM, feeling pretty fucking good, actually. Had a wonderful time hanging out with friends all day.

I don't want to rant. I have nothing to rant about. I'm so grateful that I have the opportunity to live a life free of cigarettes. This is my life, and I have a chance. 

Thanks guys for allowing an outlet for these posts, they have really helped me this week. On my 1 week anniversary I'll post one more post and then probably cut way back, and post as needed. It's been insane, and will probably become more so.

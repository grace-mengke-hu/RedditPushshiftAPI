Day 3 but a part of me keeps "reassuring" myself that I will have a smoke eventually...

When I quit for two weeks (twice) in December I didn't find it too difficult because I was always looking forward to that night out with one of my friends. I told my bf clearly that although I was quitting, it would not be the last cigarette I smoked. I didn't want to quit but he had quit months earlier so I felt I had to when I saw him (long distance).

This time I don't know. I don't feel the same way exactly, much less convinced I will smoke again and not looking forward to a potential night out. But it just doesn't feel like I've truly quit for good... I can't lie to myself. And I can't seem to convince myself that I'm a "non-smoker".

It's been almost 80 hours now cold turkey. Best so far since December. My cravings aren't very frequent (maybe 3-5 times a day) but they are *intense*. Today I know I would have given in if I hadn't had a tooth extracted on Monday and wasn't still healing... So what's going to happen when it heals?

Hi all

first time poster here but always look at this sub because I know I want to quit. You all are an inspiration to me and we have all fallen off the horse on a long road but we get back up and continue carrying on striving to become healthier. 

I have quit twice before. 1st time 6months the second time about 4 months. I am looking forward to quitting due to all the obvious pros but I am a little more nervous this time. I have been dealing with pretty rough health anxiety (feel a wierd pain, either cancer or it is the end) I wish my mind did not think that way but it does. Having my health anxiety also escalates and gives me panic attacks. Ive had so many random symptoms from palpitations, feeling like ill faint, arms get weak, outer body experiences etc etc. These two things make me extremely nervous to go through the withdrawal. I have been prescribed escitalopram before to help with the anxiety and will go back on it when I quit.

I guess the reason for posting is to ask you all for any advice on how to not psych myself out with all my other issues combined with quiting. If there are any doctors as well that have any advice to calm my nervous about my health through this that would be amazing. You all are amazing and whether you realize it or not, a lot of people smokers and non smokers are proud of you and look up to you for what you have accomplished whether your 1 day in or years smoke free

How am I supposed to drive now?

Heavy smoker here. I've been addicted to nicotine for 10+ years. How did all of you get out of your routines? 

Today will be my first day not smoking since I was a wee lad, and by far the most difficult thing for me has been driving without smoking. I've heard Mr. Tine call my name at least 20 times this morning so I'd like to ask for some help, what are some small steps you took to nullify these cravings.

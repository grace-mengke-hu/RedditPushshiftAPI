Alright my friends...

It's time to say goodbye. I've been a nonsmoker for quite a bit now and the only thing that reminds me of shitty old smoker me is this sub. I've since began training and I'm more social and I owe it all to this sub. Thank you all for the support and advice!

I'll be seing you when I hit one year. 

To all the people who recently stopped or are thinking of stopping I wish you good luck. For me not smoking is the best decision I've ever made.

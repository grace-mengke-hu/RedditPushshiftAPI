i completely stunk up a hot yoga class. Quitting again after not smoking for two years.

Well, never thought I'd be back here again. I quit smoking 2 years ago. I quit when I was bedridden with the flu so my withdrawal symptoms were masked by my awful flu. By the time I got out of bed, the physical addiction was gone and it was all mental from there.  I lived two years blissfully healthy and never smelling like smoke, doing yoga and cycling and being a pillar of health. Welp, I had an awful depressing experience when I lost my job and I started smoking again to help with the mental pain I was enduring. I hate to say that it worked, cigarettes truly comforted me in a time where I was dark and feeling the lowest about myself I had ever felt. I felt like I had my old friend back, my old edge. Whenever I thought about the mistakes I made,  ismoked a cigarette and felt better. This all changed yesterday. I took a hot yoga class where I was sweating profusely. My sweat, my entire essence was reeking of cigarettes. It was disgusting. Everyone in that class was so healthy and pure and there I was, detoxing and stinking up the entire room.  That's the last time. I am 24 hours in and I am doing this whether my body or mind likes it or not. I'm going to power through the discomfort. It's mind over fucking Matter. If I feel sorry for myself, tough luck a cigarette is not going to make me feel better. I've got to work through the painful feelings on my own. Wish me luck. And best of luck to all of you.

Today is the day

I’m not a huge smoker, but I did it because it made me feel cool and it helped me whenever I felt depressed. But, as I kept smoking, it just made me more depressed and alone. I’m tired another thing feeding into my depression and making me feel lower. It’s 1:19am, and I’m smoking my last cigarette. I want to be better and I want to make myself the person I should be, not the person I am.

In my lowest moments, I just thought of it as the easiest way to kill myself, but that’s going to stop. I don’t want to die. I want to live.

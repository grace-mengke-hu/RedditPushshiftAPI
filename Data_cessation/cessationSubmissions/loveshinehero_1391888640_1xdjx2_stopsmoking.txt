Avoiding weight gain

So I quit 2 days ago. It's sucked but I am using gum as a replacement and I am weaning myself off nicotine slowly but surely. I was so close to having one yesterday as I had to cut myself off from my now ex girlfriend following an incident at a bar but that is neither here nor there. I am exercising almost daily and I find the gum to actually be a better appetite suppressant than actual cigarettes, but I am making sure I don't get addicted to them. I actually just finished losing about 150 lbs so I really dont want to spiral out of control and gain it all back. Is there any methods that you guys use to control the weight gain?

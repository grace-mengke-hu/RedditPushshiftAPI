Vaping

Long time lurker here, first time posting. First of all, I wanna say thank you all for all the stories and inspiration to quit. Nothing has seemed to work for me, I either get too bored or frustrated with whatever. So, I recently walked into a vape store at my local mall and they set me up with something simple to use. I threw my cigarettes away last night afterwards. It's going good so far and I'm only using 3ml of nicotine. I'm hoping to go down to 0 within a few months. So, to the point...I hardly ever see vaping get mentioned as a way to quit here. Has anyone resorted to that? Stuck with it? Did it work and help? Also, is it really better for you than cigarettes?

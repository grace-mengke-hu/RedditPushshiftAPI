First Few Days Have Been Not Bad!

I quit smoking this past Monday. I had been smoking for roughly 4 years and I blame it on the military. Awesome stress reliever and generally something to do when there was down time. However, I get out in 10 days (holy shit that sounds good saying that) and I decided to quit smoking as somewhat a present to myself. Both health wise and money wise.  
I usually smoked like a fiend while drinking since all my friends do it and, let's be honest, the 2 go hand-in-hand quite well. Haven't been drinking with my friends since I quit but what is the best way to not give in to even 1 smoke?

One of the toughest things about quitting - anger/irritability

I want to talk about the irritability that comes with quitting smoking. When I quit I was very irritable and it wasn't until a few months after that I realised some of the arguments and disagreements, and the way I conducted myself and handled situations, probably had something to do with nicotine withdrawal. I've also noticed when my dad tries to quit he gets extremely negative and tends to blow up over small things.

I guess this is a heads up to those of you who are quitting. Watch your irritability and know that quitting may be playing a part!


Does anyone out there have some stories about the irritability and anger they had to deal with when quitting?

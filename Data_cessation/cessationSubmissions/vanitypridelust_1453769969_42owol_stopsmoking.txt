Rash from quitting?

11 days no cigarettes, 2-3 days no nicotine or vaping.

Since Saturday I have been experiencing an occasional rash. Seems like regular hives. Sometimes it's more welt-y sometimes more blotchy. It's in patches on my arms, chest, back, stomach. Sometimes on my neck/chin. Nothing on my legs that I've seen yet. It itches like mad. I thought it was from vaping at first but I stopped vaping and it has come back a couple times.

Basically I'll notice a slight itchy/burny sensation and when I check it, there's a patch of red. Sometimes there's been a bump in the middle, others it's just flat.

Haven't changed anything in my diet. No new detergent but I just re-washed all my stuff in the "Free & Clear" detergent with no scents or additives to make sure it's not that. No new soaps, perfumes, etc. Haven't even been using any body products (out of the shower) aside from nonscented lotion.

Benadryl helps it go away after a half hour to an hour or so but when the benadryl wears off it seems to return.

I've seen mixed things online about whether this is a result of quitting smoking or not. Has anyone else experienced this before?

7 days today

Got seven days under my belt. I've smoked for over 30 years and was smoking about two and a half packs a day recently. We moved about six months ago and made a no smoking in the new house rule. This brought me down to about a pack and half a day just from the inconvenience of going outside or to the garage. 

The biggest event was a trip to the dentist where he told me I had pretty advanced gum disease. I've had dentists tell me I had gum issues but none laid it out in the context of disease before. He sent me to a periodontist for a consult and her opinion was that I needed surgery or else my teeth would fall out of my head pretty soon. She told me that two types of people have gums this bad and need this surgery. Diabetics and long term smokers. I had the first of two laser surgeries a week ago and the second yesterday. I smoked right up until the night before the first one. 

I've quit before for a few days or as long as a couple months but this time I have to stay quit or else this very expensive surgery will be useless and my teeth will fall out anyway. I went cold turkey and am feeling pretty good now. There have been some harrowing moments where I thought I was going to die without a smoke, but they have passed. I've had to give up alcohol in the same time. Not because I have a problem, but because of all the medications related to the surgeries. I can't tell if that made it easier or harder to quit the cigs. 

Anyway, I just wanted to stop by a commiserate with the rest of you who are on your own smoke free journey.

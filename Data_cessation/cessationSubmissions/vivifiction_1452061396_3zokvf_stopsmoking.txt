That 17 looks nice!

17 days in and I'm down to generally having one severe craving a day–generally at night—so I have to hunker down, drink some water, and get through the 10 minutes of craving. 

Quitting has toyed around with some symptoms of my depression, but I'm to understand that generally fades within the first month. So far, I haven't turned back to the sticks. 17 days in, hoping the worst is through and the best is yet to come.

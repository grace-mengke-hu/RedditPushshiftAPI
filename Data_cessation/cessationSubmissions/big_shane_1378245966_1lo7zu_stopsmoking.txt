Four hours in...

Its been four hours since my last smoke. I've got a pack of Camel 99's sitting in the car, and I'm stuck in Calc lecture wanting nothing more than to sprint to my car and light up. I'm sleepy, my head hurts, my neck hurts, and yet, the only thing that would give me energy right now is the thought of a smoke. I know I *should* throw that pack away as soon as I get to the car, but I'm craving so bad I might give in. I want to quit, its time to quit, and my parents think I quit 5 months ago. Fuck, now my eyes are going in and out of focus. 

Guys, tell me this gets better. Tell me it's worth it. Encouragement needed.

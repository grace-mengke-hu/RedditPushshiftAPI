It's a sign...

Long time redditor here, but not using my real account because this is a bit embarrassing. I went out into the back yard for a cigarette (wearing pretty much just my boxers), closing the sliding door behind me. The latch has been sticking the last few weeks, but I didn't think anything of it. Well this time when I closed the door, the latch somehow locked itself -- thus locking me out of the house. My landlord has spare keys, but he's out of the country on a business trip. My phone was inside, so calling a locksmith would have been tough. After about 20 minutes of freaking out, I knocked on the neighbors door and borrowed some tools to break myself in. Finally made it back into my house (without damaging the door), and promptly THREW AWAY ALL OF MY CIGARETTES. This is clearly a sign, it's time to finally quit this nasty habit for good.

3rd Week, nothing is getting better!

Fuck I need dopamine so badly. I just had a HELL weekend, that I successfully managed by walking 10+ miles, going to the beach, trying to be fair to people who aren't fair to me and in general not stressing about how FUCKING UNFAIR LIFE FEELS RIGHT NOW (which is why I've been coping with cigarettes).

But despite all that and the past 2 weeks, I am having the worst quit day on day fucking 15. I WANT TO MURDER EVERYONE, NOTHING AT WORK IS GOING WELL (IM ABOUT TO FUCKING BREAK MY GOD DAMN COMPUTER, I FUCKING EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE AND I DONT SEE WHY THE FUCK I SHOULD CONTINUE QUITTING WHEN EVERYTHING AROUND ME WILL CONTINUE TO SUCK! I WAS SMOKING BECAUSE HOW SHIT EVERYTHING WAS, AND EVERYTHING IS STILL FUCKING SHIT!

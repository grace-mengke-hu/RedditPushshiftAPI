Odd craving trigger I didn't expect

So I'm a bit of a motor head. I work on cars for fun and do a lot of my own repairs.  Yesterday I replaced the brakes on my car, and as soon as I finished I had an intense craving for a cigarette.  I realized all these years I had been giving myself a cigarette as a "reward" for completing some task related to working on a car. It kind of bummed me out that something I do for fun is a major trigger.  I'll just have to work on rewiring that part of my brain.

Anyway, I just thought it was interesting and wanted to share.

5.5 Hours Left

(Until it has been 24 hours since my last cigarette.)  I am 30 years old and I have been smoking since I was 21 or 22.  I was up to a pack a day and I don't know why, but I decided to quit last night almost out of nowhere.  I have tried to quit before, but I have never wanted to quit like I do this time.  When I would try and quit I was trying to quit because it was good for me, would save money, etc.  All of those are bullshit reasons.  This time I just want to quit smoking because I don't want to smoke cigarettes, anymore.

Last night I had some hardcore cravings.  I ran to the gas station at midnight and bought twizzlers, chocolate chip cookies and drank an entire 2-liter of Pepsi.  I remember thinking to myself "I should just smoke because I am spending more money on snacks, anyway."  Luckily that urge passed and I feel alright at the moment although the want for nicotine keeps popping up and my mouth keeps watering.

I just hope that 1 year from now I don't sound like 99% of you asshole non-smokers who say pompous, full of yourself things to people who are quitting smoking.  Whoa that was a little mean. :P

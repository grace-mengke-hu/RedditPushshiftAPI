To the people who have a considerable amount of time nicotine free: what made it different this time?

I'm only 21 years old but ive quit smoking and vaping more times than i can count. I recently tried to quit vaping again and started bumming cigarettes off of people after 5 days with no nicotine and today went back to hitting my vape all day. Now I have a headache. I'm tired of doing something that i know isnt good for my body and doesn't align with my values, I want to take good care of my health and quit again tonight. What things have you done differently when you quit for good vs prior failed attempts?

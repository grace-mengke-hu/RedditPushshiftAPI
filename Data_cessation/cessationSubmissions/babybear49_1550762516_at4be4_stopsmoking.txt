Weird/scary dreams?

Hey everybody long time lurker. Recently went a week without smoking and last night had an incredibly vivid and scary dream. I never really experienced or believed in sleep paralysis I figured it was something made up on the internet but Iâ€™m pretty sure I experienced last night/this morning. Any of you guys experience things like this while staying off cigs for a while? Thanks!

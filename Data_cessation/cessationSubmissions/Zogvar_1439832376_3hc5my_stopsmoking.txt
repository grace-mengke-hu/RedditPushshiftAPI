Problem breathing when exercising after I quit smoking! Is this normal?

So I stopped smoking 14 days ago, after smoking a pack a day for about 15 years. One of the reasons I got motivated was to be able to breathe better when working out. But it actually feels like the complete opposite and it's very frustrating and disappointing. It's almost like if I had asthma. Does anyone else had the same experience? Is this normal at the beginning? Thanks for your help.

Live discussion post daily to know how many people are not smoking with me today

I have this idea that a daily discussion post should be created. Because when I know that 20 people are trying to quit smoking with me today and why they are quiting, I get strong urge to quit smoke.

Question on daily post like
1. Why did you quit smoking today?
2.how many day you have quit ?
3. How you tried quiting smoking today?
4. What was the queue for smoking today ?

I have felt that like Match discussion posts there should be similar Not going to smoke today discussion should be created to help each other quit forever.

How it's going to help ?
1. If I want to smoke ,I will login to Reddit to see the discussion and it will help phycology wise to understand that I am not alone.

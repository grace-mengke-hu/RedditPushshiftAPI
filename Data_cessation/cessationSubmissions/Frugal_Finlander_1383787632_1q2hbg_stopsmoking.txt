**Trigger Warning**: 11 Days without Nicotine Thanks to Electronic Cigarette (E-Cig): My Quitting Story, for Current Smokers

Copying my post directly from the e-cig forum, only in that I'm pretty happy with what it explains. Let me preface by saying, it is an anecdote, my anecdote, and can never be representative of a population. Everyone has their own struggle with nicotine/smoking and so my story can't by any likelihood come close to describing your story. So a few facts to preface my story about me:

1) I've suffered two episodes of drug abuse and alcohol abuse and am now currently just past 3 years sober minus the nicotine I was dependent upon in the years prior.

2) those episodes resulted in antipsychotic medication treatment, which are correlated with an increased prevalence of smoking, to be assumed as a method of self-medicating against dopamine inhibition.

3) Smoking is also theorised to be desired by this branch of smokers (like myself) for the metabolite cotinine, which has known antidepressant effects. Cotinine levels are known to increase with the use of menthol cigarettes, and boy, sometimes I did really did love Peter Jackson Menthols, no matter how "girly" they made me feel. But for the sake of my story, my brand of choice is Camels, as indeed it was my favourite smoke for most of my smoking history.

4) To address the title, 11 days is huge for me. Quitting cold turkey, I could never make it past 2 days. With the Gum and the Patch, I could get clean time, but I always found an excuse to go back. The E-Cig made these excuses impossible by a specific nuance of E-Cigs that I address in my story.

5) Lastly, much of my narrative is left out of this story, because it already is just too long a story, hopefully though it still contains the an experience that may be relevant to you, when the desire to not smoke is strong enough to fight that fight.

1) I do not hold that the E-Cig should ever be considered a "smoking cessation device". It is the best recreational use of nicotine going, and hence should always remain a recreational device (in the government's eyes) first and foremost. I say this having gone through a corn cob pipe phase, a cigarello phase, and of course many many many packs of cigarettes, and tried the gum and patch enough times. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a recreational nicotine high you are after, the E-Cig is where it's at.

**2) How did I get at least this far without nicotine?**

Comedian Ted Alexandro calls it the "as much as you want diet". He jokingly describes that in these diets you "eat as much asparagus/grapefruit/water/cry as much as you want, and lo and behold! you lose weight". I applied the same heuristic to nicotine use through the E-Cig, and as many have described, weened myself down via lowering concentrations from 24mg/mL, to 18mg/mL, to 14mg/mL, to 9mg/mL to sobriety. This is nothing new, and I guarantee this works. I vaped all day all the time, I kept the vaporizer beside my bed so I wake up smoking, I vaped on the Toronto subway (no one complained), I vaped at ball games, movie theatres, in class, and everywhere else, and then before going to bed. I consumed more nicotine in the last 5 months than I was ever used to in any other 5 month period prior when I was smoking a pack of camels a day:

In fact here's the numbers since May 22nd when I started the E-Cig (averaging 90 mL of e-cig juice a month): 4320 mg of 24mg/mL (6 bottles of 30mL *ordered online) 1620 mg of 18mg/mL (3 bottles of 30mL *ordered online) 1260 mg of 18mg/mL (3 bottles of 30mL *ordered online) 1080 mg of 9mg/mL (1 bottle of 120mL *I found a local supplier who sold in this denomination)

That's 8280 mg of nicotine. A pack of camels in Canada (going back to the days when they actually labeled the nicotine content, is about 45mg). I did smoke other brands, and additive free brands were my favourite, but even just using this as the standard, 5 months at a pack a day is 6750 mg.

I estimate that I actually didn't start smoking less nicotine per a day until I was vaping 9 mg/mL solution, and even then the difference was arguably negligible, so why did the E-Cig help me get to this point, when summer/fall of 2012, the last time i tried to quit nicotine, I could never get more than 2 days of clean time?

**3) The nuances behind this question go very deep, so I won't bother giving the entire narrative, I will only isolate the one factor I consider most relevant.**

You gotta hate yourself so much for smoking cigarettes that you are ready to do anything to give up tobacco. You gotta light up a smoke and have just a few seconds of "feeling good" until that deep-seated self-hatred sinks in and you feel like an "idiot" or a "piece of shit" or a "fucktard" or any other amount of self-loathing that is the equivalent to what I felt. Once that happens consistently, and happens so often that you keep trying to quit cold turkey and it never works, you get to a point where you can break down and give up tobacco. Not nicotine. Tobacco. You have to be so convinced that you are of such a broken biology that you have no way of freeing yourself from nicotine because your biology is such that it is the perfect biology to be addicted to nicotine. If you don't like the word biology, find another metaphor, but I found the battle to understanding my tobacco addiction was captured in guessing myself to be of biological design for being a "good" nicotine addict.

Once this mindset sets in this is where it all becomes easy. One little tactic can make taking up the e-cig the easiest solution in the world is based simply on the fact that:

**the E-Cig is the best recreational use of nicotine on the planet. It is the best high you are ever going to get from nicotine.**

All it takes is denying yourself nicotine for 1 single day before your E-Cig arrives in the mail, with a high concentrated juice, and your first vape should convince you there is no better high. A cigarette loaded with additives, and just the mere fact that it is smoke burning your lungs, with the meagre benefit of some nicotine crossing the pulmonary vessel barrier, can't compare to the "smiles"-level high I got from my first day vaping.

Let me put it this way, vaping with the E-Cig was so fantastic at 24mg/mL, that my diet of coffee and potato chips that day made for the unpleasant combination of walking home from a friends house and a fluid of shit leaking from my asshole. If you don't know, nicotine is a parasympathetic/enteric nervous system stimulator, and I kidd you not, the e-cig stimulated my parasympathetic nervous system into such a state of relaxation that I pooped myself. This was a one-time incident, incomparable to any other nicotine delivery device.

After that, every step became easier. Between May 22nd and August 17th I bought 4 packs of cigarettes, I finished none of them, giving away half-packs to the homeless, or just fellow smokers at bus stops. I had adjusted to the e-cig and I wouldn't go back to cigarettes. Cigarettes carry such a feeling of disgust, whether it be psychological or physiological, that the only way I'll ever go back to nicotine is via E-Cig.

Let me make one last point. I have tried the patch and the gum. Both are way too fucking hard. Firstly, there's that oral addiction everyone keeps talking about. Yea that's a problem, but not nearly as much a problem as changing the delivery mechanism. Taking in nicotine through cheek skin (gum) or taking in nicotine through skin (patch) is not the same high. I know people who would agree that the patch can get you wired, but I know no one who would say that the patch is a nice high. That's the difference, E-Cigs get you buzzed. If you don't agree, I don't know why people vape them. **Apparently the delivery mechanism is under debate. Whether it's lung based or digestive system based, my point still holds. I can't get "high" from excessive gum chewing or even get anything from a patch that feels like a "high", it feels more like being "wired". the e-cig provided a non-stop nicotine pleasure that was better than smoking from the first inhale of the morning, to bedtime.**

To go full circle. Start on a high level (ex: 24mg/mL is pretty high for most). Take a day off from nicotine before starting the e-cig to maximise it's effect. Stick with it by the logic that it feels good. Drop dosages whenever you feel like it (dropping every month is good, dropping once every 3 months is good, it doesn't matter, you'll get there if you want it). Then prepare for the shittiest time of your life when you pull the vape out of your mouth for good. My vendor only sells on weekends, otherwise I'm ordering online, so I ran out at the perfect moment (sunday night) and had no way of getting E-Cig juice but by waiting till the next weekend, and I hated cigarettes, and I didn't want to cop out with the shitty effect of the gum. In other words, I had no option but to wait, and I waited long enough that I had no desire but to keep waiting.

Other Observations From 11 Days Nicotine Free:

1) I sleep better. When I first stopped, some nights turned into 13-14 hour sleep marathons. Now I sleep 5-8 hours and feel refreshed and this is only 10 days later. I used to never feel refreshed unless I slept at least 9 hours.

2) My sex drive has dropped. I've read enough to be reassured that it will come back over time. No big deal, it's not gone altogether.

So: If you're that guy wondering why you can't quit cigarettes cold turkey, and you keep wondering why everyone in the older generation can say they did, let's say it's because in their day, they had no other option. In today's world you got the better option, it's the e-cig. It's at minimum a better nicotine rush no matter how you use it, and if you want to quit entirely, try and find out if you can. The worst you can do is end up back on the E-Cig, and be taking blood pressure medication at 50 like every other adult does anyhow.

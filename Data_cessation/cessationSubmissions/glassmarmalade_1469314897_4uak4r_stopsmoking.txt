My partner keeps trying to quit but he's really struggling, what else can I do to help?

He's been a smoker for about ten years, I think; he also vapes but he wants to quit both. He's been trying to quit for almost as long as we've been together, and he made it for over a month at one point.He tried going cold turkey (his most successful attempt, if I remember correctly) and he's tried cutting back slowly. One part of why he's struggling is that it's really hard for him to work when he's going through withdrawal.

He has lots of motivation to quit - he wants to be healthier, I want him to be healthier, plus I have asthma so he doesn't get to kiss me after a cigarette, it's expensive, etc. I've been trying to be encouraging without being pushy - he knows I love him whether or not he smokes.

I'm not sure what else I can do. He's done a little bit of reading about how to deal with withdrawal and cravings, but I'm wondering if there's more I can do to help, or other resources I can point him to. Ideas?

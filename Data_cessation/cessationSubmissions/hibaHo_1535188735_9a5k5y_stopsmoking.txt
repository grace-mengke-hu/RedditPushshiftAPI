Will my dad know?

I've stressed over this so much and everyone says the same thing..... Your dad knows.... I've f16 been secretly smoking since two years almost and stealing cigarettes from my dad except the one pack I found myself. Im addicted now and I know smoking is shitty and I hopefully may quit soon. But how is everyone so sure that he knows?. He doesn't even count. I don't understand 

Recently I was planning on ordering ten cigarettes because I can't keep stealing his and getting constant anxiety attacks. But the problem is that when the order arrives I don't want my parents to know and Idk what to do. I don't even have a safe place to keep them and it's driving me crazy and giving me constant anxiety. I've been not smoking for two days and I'm already having withdrawal symptoms. My chest used to hurt when I smoked now it hurts more when I didn't. I'm so desperately in need of them and it's so shitty to say this. I'm a shitty person but idk what to do how to order.

And is it normal for a person to feel dizzy and numbness in the head while smoking. I also lose my balance sometimes. Is it normal?

I'm also an asian and as they say Asian parents are strict and CRAZY it's true. I don't want to get caught. What do I do?

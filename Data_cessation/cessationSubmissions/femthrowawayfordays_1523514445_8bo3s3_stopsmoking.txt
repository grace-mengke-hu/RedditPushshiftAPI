Day three... struggling.

Hey friends.

I gave up a few days ago. Yay! The first two days weren't so bad, and gave a me a little "I got this!" kind of confidence.

Well, that all came crashing down today. Throughout the day I've  tried keeping myself busy, with work and reading an addictive (lol) new fantasy series, but every couple hours or so, my body/head just distracts me with overwhelming cravings.

Much stronger than yesterday, I start to daydream about the sensation of the smoke going in, permeating my lungs, and moving back out. I've been tempted to walk across the road to the gas station a few times, but have just managed to resist.

I'm using patches, and a 0 nicotine vape, which got me to 6 months last time I tried this (and gave them both up after a month) but this time is super hard.

What's worse it's it's absolutely **destroyed** my libido. Which is rather... unusal, for me.

Any tips or encouragement or anything appreciated!

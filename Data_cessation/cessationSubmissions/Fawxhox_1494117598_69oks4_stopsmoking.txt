Suggestions for quitting dipping and smoking at the same time?

(Back Story skip to the second paragraph if you don't care) I've been smoking since I was 15 and dipping since I was 17 (21 now). I never really felt like I had a problem before because the last few times I've tried to stop I've never had a problem going a few weeks without smoking or dipping and feeling content that I'm not addicted I'd always start back up. However I just realized I haven't had a single day where I didn't both smoke and dip in the last probably 6 months. Dip is really expensive where I'm living now (more than triple the price it is at home) and I just finished my last can I brought from home (20 cans over the last 3 months). I also don't have my drivers license which hasn't been a problem as the cornerstore by me never asks to see it after carding me for the first few months, but they don't sell dip and so I have no where to buy dip now. I've been really antsy and irritable over the last few days due to not dipping and realized I have a problem (though I'm sure it being finals time doesn't help). 

So this is it, I've got two packs at my house which I'm going to use to get me through finals (only 3 more days!) after which I'm done. However I was wondering if it might be better to just quit dipping for a month or so before I quit smoking too. Figure it might be better to ease out of it, go a month just smoking, then a month chewing nicorette to quit both. But I'm worried that's just my way of pushing off quitting to the nebulous "future". Would I be better off just stopping both cold turkey at the same time? I have pretty poor self-control I'll just be honest and admit.

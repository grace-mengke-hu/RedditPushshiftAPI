9 days smoke free today!

Hi all, been reading everyone's stories... Very motivating to see I'm not battling on my own. I have gone 9 days without a cigarette and was a 20-25 per day smoker... Have been for 20yrs... Feels weird not smoking but I've come to far to go back now... To make sure I didn't cheat, I got people to sponsor me for a local charity so if I go a month smoke free... When I go a month I mean... I will have raised Â£200!
Liking the new me.... Still nervous and can't think long term but don't want to start again... I will use this site as inspiration... Thanks all for sharing ur thoughts... It helps motivate me!

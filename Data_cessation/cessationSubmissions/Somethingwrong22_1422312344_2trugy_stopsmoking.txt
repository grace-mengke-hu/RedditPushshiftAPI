Stopped smoking! Now need help with the cravings!!

Hey everyone! 

I decided to stop smoking because my girlfriend had our first baby. A little boy! He's great. Anyway, smoking is expensive. Babies are also expensive. One had to go! So I chose smoking. 

I've been a smoker for 10 years, smoking 20+ a day for the past 6 years. I set myself a date and stopped on that date without anyway sort of aids or help. So far I've been doing ok. That's been a week since my last smoke. I was just looking for some experiences you guys have had. When did your cravings subside? Or at least stopped being really strong? 

I know everyones experiences are different but I just wanted to hear from you guys and see what sort of time you all had whilst stopping. 

Thanks in advance :)

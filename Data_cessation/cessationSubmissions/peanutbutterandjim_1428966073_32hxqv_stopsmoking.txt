First time donating to Relay For Life and not feeling guilty.

Every year, the company I work for has a huge Relay For Life fundraiser, and every year, I help out by volunteering and donating.  So I would volunteer to help raise money for the American Cancer Society while being a smoker.  And I felt horrible about this.  I felt like the biggest hypocrite, because I'd wear a Relay For Life shirt while smoking a cigarette (not at the actual event, just out and about town).  This year will be the first year I'm not a smoker and helping with Relay For Life.  It feels good to have a clean conscience about this.  Good luck to everyone trying to quit out there!  You can totally do it!

Dreams/nightmares about smoking?

Just recently, I've started having a lot of dreams where I slip up by smoking a cigarette on a night out, or else I just start smoking again altogether. Then I wake up the next day feeling bad about it and have to remind myself it didn't actually happen. Does anyone else get this?

I've been smoke free for about 6 weeks now after smoking 7 years so it's not like I'm finding it particularly hard during the day anymore. It's just these dreams man...

2 weeks in! There's no stopping me now, but I'm worried about damage already done..

It's been two weeks since my last cigarette and I AM NEVER GOING BACK!!! A little background, I'm a 29/YO Male. I started smoking socially in college as a way to "fit in" and make myself feel cool. I would smoke a pack every week or two when I found myself at a party or would have 1 or 2 cigs when I was stressed and taking a break from studying. 

I'd take weeks or even months off at a time but would always find myself stressed or drunk and would come back to smoking. I was always a very intermittent smoker. I could smoke a whole pack at a party and then not smoke for another week or two. Even when I started consistently smoking at my office I would have 4-6 cigs daily. I had a son born  4 years ago and I stopped for the first year after he was born, but soon after I started again.  It helps that my girlfriend, work friends, and family are not smokers so there was always social pressures making it hard to smoke as much as I would have liked. I recently became more aware of the risks and decided it wasn't worth it, but can't help but feel worried about the damage already done... am I doomed to get lung cancer? How can I help ensure I live the healthiest life possible? I would guess that over the past decade I've smoked 3-4 pack years, along with a fair amount of weed as well.

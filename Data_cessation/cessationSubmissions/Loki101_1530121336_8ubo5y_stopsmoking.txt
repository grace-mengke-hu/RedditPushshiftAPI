Reasons to Smoke - Day 3

It had got to the point where I couldn't roll the next one fast enough. Chest tight and head spinning with panic, heart thumping with worry, life tasted foul and burnt my tongue. 'You're running out of time' whispered the inner voice and a hot surge of worry demanded the next smoke.

Away for work, left my routine and took the  chance to step back. I've observed and documented each urge. My reasons to smoke. Worry about belonging. Feeling alone. Guiltily looking for a distraction from work. Feeling I'd failed. Uncertainty about the future. 

How utterly idiotic to stand there, stinking, burning paper tube in hand, destroying THE LITERAL DELIVERY VEHICLE FOR MY LIFE'S BREATH instead of doing something to fix it.

Deep breaths. The calm is returning, and the senses. Taste, and smell - the smell of moisture from sun-baked leaves, the fruity evocative aroma of a slowly sipped craft beer, grilled pork from an open kitchen window somewhere, salt sweat on my warm skin. I couldn't be more relieved.

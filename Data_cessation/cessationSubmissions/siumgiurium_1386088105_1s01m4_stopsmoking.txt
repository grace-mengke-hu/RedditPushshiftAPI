How do you know you want to quit?

Hello all,

This is a serious question. I have had this in mind for a while and am already not entirely sure whether I really want to quit or simply 'know' I should do it.

Please disregard any badge visible on my account, I requested it to be removed. My best quitting attempt so far was about a year ago and lasted 3 months. It was entirely based on willpower and the assumption that "nothing bad can happen to me what-so-ever".

This was not the case at all, because it was a struggle and a pain in the ass every single time someone around me lit up. I won't even begin telling stories about when I had some drinks. I also had a mild depression and asked myself what really has changed and whether it matters at all, about two months in. I definitely saw the positive effects - the smell, the energy, the libido - it was all great, but still - I felt like I lead an eternal war against cigarettes, sentenced to never smoke again and deal with the addiction on a psychological level. It just never went away and I am now at loss, having tried dozens of dozens of times and failing again. 

So, any tips and tricks? Does anyone understand this situation?

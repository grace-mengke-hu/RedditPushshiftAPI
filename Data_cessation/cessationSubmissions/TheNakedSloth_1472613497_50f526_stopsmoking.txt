2nd day cig free!

Hey yall! Obviously I am super new to this community, but I have been smoking for 10 years. After much deliberation, I quit cold turkey Monday morning. Im using an app, listening podcasts, reading this subreddit etc... And I truly feel okay. No terrible cravings or irritation, but I do have ONE big issue. I feel like on of my good friends died. My biggest thing is I miss the companionship when I am alone and it makes me SO sad to think that I will never be able to have another cigarette EVER because I truly want to be done. It sounds silly I know, but that truly breaks my heart.

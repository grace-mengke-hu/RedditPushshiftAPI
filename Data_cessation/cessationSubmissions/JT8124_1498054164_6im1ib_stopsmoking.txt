Smoking in the car

My quit is coming up and I'm going cold turkey. I've tried before and made it 66 hours recently. High stress and an emotional event made me give back in. My biggest concern is driving, I drive about 35 minutes to work every day and am hoping to hear advice for what you all did in the car. I haven't had much luck finding techniques on the internet for driving.

Chewing on a straw was the most effective thing last time but would like other strategies. 

Thanks guys

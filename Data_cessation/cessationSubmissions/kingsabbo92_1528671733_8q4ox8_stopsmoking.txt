2 months in I smoked one drunk last night

It wasn't offered to me I sought it out from someone smoking. I've been drinking a few times with friends who smoke but I never asked for one.

Not sure what happened last night but I'm pretty disappointed in myself for doing so. 

I've been smoke free for 1 month and 28 days until last night. I haven't smoked another one since but I'm just disappointed in myself

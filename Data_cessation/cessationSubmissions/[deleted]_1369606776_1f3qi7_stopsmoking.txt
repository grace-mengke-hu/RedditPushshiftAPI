Today is the day.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to share, that right now I am going to smoke my last cigarette.

For the past two weeks, I went to bed with the thought "tomorrow morning I am not going to smoke" and always I broke. The cravings are not that hard or intense, I just broke each time, saying to myself "ok, just one cig to cool down". And than another day and another pack of cigs passed by. But not this time. This time I am going to make it!
Hopefully, when I wake up, I will check the comments and find some encouragement NOT to smoke.

This time I want this for real. Wish me luck and I count on your support! 

I will give you an update in the morning. OP will deliver.

Cheers!

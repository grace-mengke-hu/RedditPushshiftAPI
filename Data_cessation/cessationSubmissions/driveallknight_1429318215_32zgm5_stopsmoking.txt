Threw a whole pack away today

Didn't smoke for 4 days and just smoked one after a long ass day. Tasted like shit. Smelled like "smokers" smell. Took the whole rest of the pack and ripped them in half and threw them in the dumpster. Felt good. Kinda bummed I smoked that one but I'm tired of being a fucking slave to this shit.

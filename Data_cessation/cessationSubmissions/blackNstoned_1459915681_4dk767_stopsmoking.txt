100 days smoke free

I have been smoking for the past 6 years and have tried to quit a few times before. But due to lack of motivation, I would just get back to smoking routine and most of my friends also smoke.


For the first time I have crossed 100 days of being smoke free and it's been GREAT. I feel healthy. My sense of smell and taste have greatly improved. I don't have to spray a ton of perfume to get rid of the cigarette smell. I don't feel the urge to smoke now when I'm drinking with friends. Overall I feel very good about myself. The /r/stopsmoking subreddit has been a great inspiration for me to stay strong and continue to be smoke free.

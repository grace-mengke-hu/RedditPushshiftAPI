Starting over

So after nearly 6 months of being smoke free, I smoked. And not just the one. I think once I had that first one I knew I was going to keep smoking until the end of my holiday. Not my best ever decision but I am back at home, back in my everyday routine and back on track. I've reset my badge and am taking it one day at a time. Not smoking today!

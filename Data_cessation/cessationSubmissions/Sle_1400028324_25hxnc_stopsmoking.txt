Never let it go

Just wanted to make a very quick text post to say: Never let your having given up smoking lose its power.

Never sleep on it. Always remember where you are and how much fucking effort it took. Don't be tempted for that "1" cigarette.

It will lead to a lifetime of stinking and may well lead to some sort of awful diagnosis..

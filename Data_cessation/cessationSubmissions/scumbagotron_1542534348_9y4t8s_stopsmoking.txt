Why aren't I ready to quit yet?

I'm 24 and have been smoking since I was 15, started with one or two a day, now smoke about 5-10 a day. I'm a year and a half sober from alcohol so I know I can do this! I've tried to quit a couple times in the past and usually break at about 4 days, usually because I'm with a group of people and they go out to smoke.

When I quit drinking I'd had several failed attempts also. I had several years of bad experiences that showed me I had to quit for good. I was just DONE with it. I never wanted to have to face the morning after a night of drinking again. Tbh getting sober was...was easier than I expected.

So here I am with cigarettes - I think I'm asthmatic (get a cough after exercising in cold weather) and I've had a nasty cough for the last several days for no reason. Still smoking. A family with young kids just moved in next door and I feel so terrible smoking where they might see or be exposed to it. Smoking makes me feel stupid and unhealthy and trashy, and I deserve better than that.

But even now, writing this all out, I have this feeling in the back of my head that I'm not quitting yet. It's so weird. It's like I'm writing this just for funsies and none of it matters. What am I holding on to??? I just had a cigarette not long ago so this isn't a physical craving.

When I quit drinking I really leaned in - I spent a lot of time in /r/stopdrinking, I read a bunch of books and articles, I brushed up on the science, I kept a daily journal of all the things sobriety was giving me, I wrote the number of days I had on my hand for months. Versus here, I know of a bunch of books to read, and I'm actively avoiding reading them. I almost never check in here because it makes me feel bad because I know I should quit but I don't. want. to. yet. Why???

I'm sorry for this post, it's a lot of text not really saying anything, but I think it's a step in the right direction. Ugh.

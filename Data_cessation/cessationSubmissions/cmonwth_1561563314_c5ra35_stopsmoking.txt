Should i try?

   I'm 20 years old and i've never smoked or tried to smoke in my whole life. I just never thought of it and i always surround myself with friends and people who don't smoke and who believe that smoking is totally unhealthy. But now time have changed most of my friends who never thought of smoking a cigarette they at least try to smoke in social situations like when they go to a party so they won't look weird or feel awkward around the people that i believe  every single one of them was holding a cigarette the last party i went to. Nowadays some of my friends insisted that i should try sometimes to smoke in these kind of situations including how weird i look when i'm the only one who's not smoking, they also tried to explain that smoking irregularly would not make you addicted etc... After trying to convince me that i should at least try, i'm here writing this stupid post looking for some answers if i should try or not and the reasons why should i and why i shouldn't. I decided to post this text on this subreddit because obviously everyone here is trying to stop smoking and probably have regretted smoking for the first time.

Day 1... Almost

I would have been through my first 24 hours by now, had I not had such an intense craving last night that I went out, bought a pack and had three or four cigarettes before tossing it and the lighter in the trash. As it stands in about 5 hours from the time of writing this, I will have hit the 24 hour mark and be one step closer to being free of this nasty habit. Current time for this post is 7:47pm est. I work 3rd shift so my days and nights are reversed from what is considered the norm. Regardless, I'm going to the gym again after work starting tomorrow morning. I've been out of it for almost 3 months now and need to get back in again. Soon it will be another day down and the rest of my life to go. Good luck to anyone who is traveling down this road that I am as well.

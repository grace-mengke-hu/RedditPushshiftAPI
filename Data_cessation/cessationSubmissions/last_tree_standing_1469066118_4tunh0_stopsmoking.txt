Can't stop grinding my teeth. It's been two weeks.

I quit smoking July 3rd. Cold turkey. I also quit vaping because it had nicotine in it. I'm 25 and I've been smoking since I was about 13. I can't stop grinding my teeth. I'm getting increasingly irritable. Currently not working, nor am I in school again (grad school starts inAugust). I have nothing to distract me with. No car to take me anywhere (in Texas) I cook as a hobby, sometimes play games but I'm in this limbo. 

Every time I watch a TV show or movie and they smoke all I think is God when I go to my new city for grad school I'm gonna buy a pack and smoke a cigarette in a new city in a new apartment to start my new life. It's the only thing keeping me sane. I can't stop my temper or grinding my teeth. What have y'all been doing to cope? I've tried push ups at home walking my dog more, meditation but nothing helps. Should I try weaning myself off of cigarettes or am I just making excuses to smoke again?

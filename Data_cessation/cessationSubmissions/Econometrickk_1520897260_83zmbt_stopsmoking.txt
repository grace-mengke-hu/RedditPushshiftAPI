Are Kirkland Signature Lozenges in Chinese Packaging Safe?

I bought these lozenges: https://www.ebay.com/itm/135-Kirkland-Quit-4-Nicotine-Lozenges-4-mg-Stop-Smoking-Aid-New-Free-Shipping/282517554816?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20160727114228%26meid%3D4e72b75750a848dfa4bbfa03704335ef%26pid%3D100290%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D4%26sd%3D282517554816%26itm%3D282517554816&amp;_trksid=p2060778.c100290.m3507 thinking someone may have gotten them free via insurance and resold them. They were mailed to me in Chinese packaging. Before I use them, I am just wondering if anyone here has experience with this from a safety perspective.

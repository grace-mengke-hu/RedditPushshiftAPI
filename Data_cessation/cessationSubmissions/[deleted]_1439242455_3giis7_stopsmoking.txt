I need encouragement.

I've been telling myself I'm going to quit for weeks now, and have only been prolonging it by "cutting back", when logically I know that isn't helping me at all, just keeping me addicted.  I need help with tips for cravings. I haven't had my own pack in two days now, but my brother and my mom smoke, so sometimes I'll sink into the craving and ask them for one. And I always feel defeated afterwards. I just feel like a failure in general right now.

Edit to add: I've been smoking a pack a day for five years now. There was a brief period of time where it was two packs a day, but I quickly stopped that after realizing what I was doing.

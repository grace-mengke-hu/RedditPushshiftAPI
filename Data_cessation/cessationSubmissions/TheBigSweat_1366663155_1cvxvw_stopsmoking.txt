Any advice for a recent quitter?

I had what I decided would be my last cigarette late Friday night for a variety of reasons, mainly so I can get back in shape and enjoy long distance running again but as in the past, I am worried about certain triggers. I am using quit for life with a quit coach and everything but I wanted to know if anyone has any specific advice for those cravings that come after meals, during stressful times or even when out at social events when drinking/hanging out with smoker friends. Any help and/or support would be great because this time I am 100% dedicated to quitting!

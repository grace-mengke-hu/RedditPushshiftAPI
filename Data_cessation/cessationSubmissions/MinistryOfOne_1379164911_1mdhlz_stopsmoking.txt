Day One

Been trying to quit multiple times, and didn't smoke much when alcohol wasn't involved, but since the last 3 weeks have been all about partying and ethanol-consumption, I have been smoking heavily. So. Am 20 pages into "Easyway" and I'm gonna finish it in a couple of hours, after which I'll try to stop again.
Right, wish me luck, beautiful people of r/stopsmoking

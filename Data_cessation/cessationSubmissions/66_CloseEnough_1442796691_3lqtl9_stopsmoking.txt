3 days in!

Here I sit, three days in and not a single puff off a little death stick. I feel horrible in a physical sense, but I'm beyond proud mentally. 

I've smoked for about 10 years now, and within the last 5 I've had become a pad smoker. 

I became a father 2 months ago, to a beautiful little girl, and I never want her to see me smoking, and think it's okay. I was sick of having to wash my hands and beard constantly to even touch her, and I want to be around to see her grow up. 

To all you guys out there, thanks for all the support through countless threads. 3 days in, and I never want another!

Anybody got advice for a casual smoker?

I haven't been a regular smoker for many years as I successfully gave up on my first attempt.  However,if I'm out drinking I just can't help myself after a few pints. When there is alcohol in my system I have zero willpower and always wake up the next morning regretting it. Has anybody experienced the same problem?

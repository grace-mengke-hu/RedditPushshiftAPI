Crazy, horrible dreams after going cold turkey (not taking chantix)

I’m having the most insane dreams since I quit cold turkey last week. Like I’m talking full on scary murder stuff. I’m afraid to go to sleep. I know it’s my brain chemistry going back to normal and my serotonin is going haywire causing me to these vivid nightmares. I’m just hoping it doesn’t last too much longer.  

My plan tonight is to go full on dream warrior and take control over whatever nightmare I end up in. Watch out Freddy, I’m ready.

So I have bronchitis

It's weird, but not having had a smoke for 32 days(woo!  Go me!) month, I'm excited to see how quickly I start to feel better. Usually when sick I always prolong that cough cuz I'll start smoking by day three. This time there is no smoke to have! Only my lungs clearing up with no poison to slow them down!

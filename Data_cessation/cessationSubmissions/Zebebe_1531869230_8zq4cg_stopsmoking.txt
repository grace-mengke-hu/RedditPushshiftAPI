Advice for keeping focused at work?

I stopped smoking on Friday right when I left work. The weekend actually went pretty well, there was a bit of irritability with my husband and I ate more junk food than I probably should have, but overall it was going good. I mostly just stayed in all weekend cleaning the apartment, drawing, binge watching TV, and keeping myself occupied. I was feeling great, stopping wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!

Yesterday morning I walked into work feeling empowered... And then it all fell apart. I couldn't focus on my work for shit. I'm a project manager and it took so much effort just to talk to people let alone get anything done. I was getting up every 30 minutes just to distract myself by getting water or soda, going for a walk, sitting in the bathroom with my phone, etc. As soon as I hit my 8 hours I rushed home for some peace and quiet. Once again, as soon as I was home, I was feeling better about not smoking.

I decided this morning to work from home, thinking that I would be in a better head space to get some work done and that I could return to the office tomorrow with my groove back. Well, I was able to get a solid 2 hours of work in before once again losing my focus entirely. I've spent the rest of the day so far either napping or in an existential crisis. A few minutes ago I caved, bought a pack, smoked one, and threw the rest out.

Do any of you have advice about keeping focused at work during these initial days? I have deadlines and meetings... I can't just goof off all day waiting to feel better. But even going for a walk and deep breathing isn't helping when I get back to my desk. Maybe I should take a few vacation days before trying to get back into it? I don't know... Help!

Over a year so far, cravings are back.

Its been a while since I have smoked.  My life recently went to hell and all I want is nicotine in my system.  No idea where it came from, but I either want a cigarette or a can of chew.  I am literally a minute away from getting either.  A can of chew sounds better than a pack, but with the way everything has gone in my life in the last week, I almost feel like I need it...

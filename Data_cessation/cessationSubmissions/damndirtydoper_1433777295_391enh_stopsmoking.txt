1 day down, finally free

This is hard. Really hard. But I do finally feel free in a way. It's really great in many ways, just when 10 or 12 hits at work I know this is when I normally stand up and go suffocate myself for 5-10 minutes. Well not today and never again my friends!

I've been reading Allen Carr's, "Easy Way to stop smoking" because of how much it helped two friends of mine to quit. It is really really helpful. Highly recommend. 

Now will someone please tell me how awesome I am?

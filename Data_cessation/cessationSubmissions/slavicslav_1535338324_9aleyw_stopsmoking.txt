Any tips on how to quit Juuling?

I’ve been addicted to nicotine for two years now. It started when I was seventeen, going on into my senior year of high school. Now I’m nineteen and in college. It began with cigarettes and then ended with Juuling. I’ve relied on it for the past year now. It’s a huge part of my life - whether or not I want to admit it. It does suck feeling attached to and reliant upon something like this. 

My father found my Juul this morning and was really disappointed. He took it away from me and is using it for himself now, since he’s also a former smoker. I could always get a new one. I could rip his while it charges downstairs. I could borrow one from a friend. I could do all of these things - BUT I don’t want to! I really want to avoid disappointing him. I really don’t want to be addicted to nicotine like he is FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I want to quit this shit. It’s been a few hours and the cravings are creeping up on me. 

Any and all tips are welcome!

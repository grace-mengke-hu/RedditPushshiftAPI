Going on vacation for a week need help !

Hello everyone so I am 196 days smoke free but I'm haven't a bit of a dilemma. Saturday I leave for myrtle beach with a bunch of friends and we are driving (about a 15 hour ride) any ways all I've been thinking about is how I wont be having a smoke break or packing a lip during this ride then I'm convincing myself it's ok to just do it this week but that is such the addict in me. I don't want to smoke I don't plan on it but for freakin sake this has been bothering me all week and I think is going to up until I leave. Any suggestions I know gum seeds but I think I wanted more to get that out in the open. Thanks for listening

One year tomorrow. Some thoughts to share.

The craving will pass whether you smoke or not.

Remembering what you want the most will help you forego what you want now.

You can endure what you are prepared for.  Don't just mentally prepare for 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months.  It may be tough for years.  Prepare for that.

The Allen Carr method worked for me.  I had tried the gum and Chantix and found the side effects unbearable.  I could afford to smoke a pack a day and I was fortunate to be in very good health so my motivation had to come from within.  I quit so I wouldn't be a stinking, addicted, junkie slave.  Today I am free.  I wish you all success and encourage you to spend a lot of time in this subreddit lurking or participating.

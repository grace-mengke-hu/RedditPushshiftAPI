I'm afraid of doing this

So I have been smoking about 8 years now. I smoke about 1.5-2 packs a day plus a can of dip a day. I have tried to quit before and had mild success, for a while. So the other day I told my wife I want to quit and take the money I would use for tobacco and buy a new amp and guitar to give me something to motivate me to not buy anymore smokes or dip. So I woke up the first day at 0530 to head to work and had a crazy panic attack. I was sweating, felt like I couldn't breathe, and felt like I was going to throw up. All because I knew I had no access to tobacco until 0800. Literally 2.5 hours felt like an eternity. I felt like I would have traded a close loved one for 1 cigarette and that scares the hell out of me. I really have to quit. Not only for my health, but for my 3 little boys. I want to be around for them for as long as humanly possible. I have tried all the alternatives and nothing has worked. I'm afraid deep inside of me, I don't want to quit and/or I'll never be able to :/

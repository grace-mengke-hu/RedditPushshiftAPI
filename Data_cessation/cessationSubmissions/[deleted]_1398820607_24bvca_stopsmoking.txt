Day 12...

Day 12 today... I'd like to take a break from posting these but they've really been helping. I was a little more motivated at work today. However, we have this new guy who started on my team last week and I really resent him.

Experience-wise and academically we're not on the same level. Moreover, I've been there a year and he seems like he's intent on blowing me off and thinking he's my equal. He's not. He hasn't earned it yet.

Anyway, I decided to just remain neutral about the whole thing. If he's the type of person I suspect he is... he'll hang himself. I just need to sit back, do my job and watch.

Either way... I'm not smoking over it. And, I'm proud that I have 12 days today.

Thanks.

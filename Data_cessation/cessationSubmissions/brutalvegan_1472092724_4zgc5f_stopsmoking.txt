Attempting the trifecta

Greetings everyone, writing from the land down under. I have been lurking reddit for quite a while, and thought it was time to participate. 

I have an addictive personality which has resulted in me forming some bad habits for the past couple years.

They are marijuana, porn, and cigarettes.

Now I have abstained from weed and fapping for the past 6-7 days, which I found pretty easy.

Which brings me to cigarettes, now this poison is a whole different ball game. I have two cigs remaining and do not plan on buying any more, I am just sick of the lifestyle. I have attempted this numerous times but always cave in within 24 hrs.
Basically I'm just posting this to have my goals down in writing and any advice would be appreciated.

Good luck to fellow quitters

What has made this a permanent change for y'all?

I've tried two or three times the last couple years to quit. Ive tried multiple different approaches and one time actually did quit for over 100 days until I had something difficult happen last year. Nothing seems to stick. I'm just curious.. what was it that made it permanent for y'all? And yes I've read that book.

Using Vaping to help stop smoking

So I bought a vaporizer, and I've been extremely happy with it.

I've been using it as a replacement for cigs and basically as a pacifier. Haven't smoked a cig in about a month now, and have been steadily stepping down the nicotine content in the oils for the vape, started at a 12, now using 3/6 depending on the brand.

Has any else tried it with any success? I'm loving mine, my sense of smell is coming back and now cigs just smell bad to me when I'm around them. 

I recently upgraded from one of the standard vapes to a nice mechanical one, and the hobby aspect of it is fun as well with the whole "build your own atomizer" and whatnot. The mechanical is fun at parties/the bar as well because of the massive clouds you can make and the different tricks like the tornado or the ease of blowing smoke rings.

Day 5

Been smoking for 10 years, pack a day.  Only tried to quit once, but if I am honest, I wasn't really trying.  I was really scared to try again, remembering withdrawal and that one thought taking over your entire being, not being able to focus on anything other than "need to smoke now". This time feels different.  I've been taking Champix (and praying constantly) and (even if it is just in my head) it is really helping me a lot.  The cravings are really not bad, no jitters or that feeling of going crazy.  It's the habit I am struggling with.  It's helping me to know that other people are going through the same stuff, thanx to everyone for sharing!  This is the longest I have ever gone without smoking and I feel extremely proud of and happy with myself.  Feels like I have won an Olympic medal.  Good luck to my fellow-quitters, our struggle is real!!

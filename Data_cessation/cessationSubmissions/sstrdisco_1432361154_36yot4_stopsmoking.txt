My First Month! I got my first star!!!

I am so overcome with emotion.

I really wanted that first day under my belt (primarily due to being ill, it was hard to not smoke even while sick). Once I knew what I was doing, I wanted that first week bad. Then I wanted a solid month of no nicotine more than anything in the world. I did all of those things. There are some days I wake up and the first thought in my mind is, "I'm not a smoker anymore!" I get teary eyed and giddy.

I had to think about this, but this is my 4th quit. This time is much different than the others. It's been surprisingly easy. I'd been toying with the idea of quitting, caught a cold, stayed doped up on Nyquil the first 4 or 5 days, and decided to keep going. I decided I needed a plan and came here. I learned about triggers and cravings and I put together a plan to combat these things. I joined this community wholeheartedly and read Freedom from Nicotine. I could not be more grateful for the encouragement and help I've gotten on r/stopsmoking. What wonderful people you are.

I acknowledge that mine will be a lifetime of recovery and I can only get there one day at a time. I look forward to it.

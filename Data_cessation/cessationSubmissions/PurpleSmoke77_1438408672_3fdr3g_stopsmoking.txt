I have an idea.

Please let me know if someone has suggested this already or something similar. 

I feel like support, when trying to quit smoking, is one of the most valuable things. You could be having a shit day, and someone just saying " you've gone X amount of days without smoking?! Dude! That's huge! Way to fucking go!" Could completely turn it around. 

Would anyone be interested in a sort of PM system where everyone signs up.then once a week, you are given a random name of someone else who signed up to be in the group per se, then just send them a random message encouraging them, or some sort of uplifting, shout out to how awesome they are for even trying to better themselves, or whatever. I think some people would appreciate it, and would help their day.

If everyone disagrees with this post, no harm no foul, and I'll just keep not smoking. ;)

Anyone have experience with this?

     Hey guys, im quitting smoking cigarettes and im going ahead cold turkey. This is day 5 now, and from what ive read, the worst is behind me. I notice my psych and physical symptoms getting better every day, and im hopeful for the future. One thing that is still screwing with me is my heart rate and anxiety. Its gotten better recently but I still notice that during stress-inducing moments I get a panic attack. I feel my heart rate increasing and my breathing quickens until its difficult to breathe. 

     I think this is because I consistently used cigarettes as a means to cope with stress and relax before I thought things out. I figure any stress and anxious feeling is amplified due to the withdrawals im having. 

     Since quitting ive been running every day, eating slightly better than I have before. I am 21 years old, overweight but not by any means obese. I feel some pain in my heart region and I figure its just because its been getting worked alot recently haha. 


I was hoping I could get information/advice/opinions/anything on :

A relative timeline of when withdrawl symptoms should lessen or stop.

What to do to cope with the stress or ways to combat the anxiety/panic attacks.

Whether or not the heart pumping pain is something to be medically concerned about.

30 hours in on my first actual try

Hi there,

I don't really know what to write :/

I have been smoking for 5 years now and I decided to quit for good.
Yesterday I got news, that a person I know very well was diagnosed with lung cancer, although she stopped smoking like 5 years ago...

I am really motivated to stop burning money and lifetime for nothing really. Good luck to me and all of you guys :)

Have a great, smoke-free day!

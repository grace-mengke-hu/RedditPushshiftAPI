Silly questions but I need advice on nicotine gum and setting a quitting time on an app.

I want to be smoke free until the end of October when I will turn 25. Small background: I've been smoking for 7-8years and lately up to a pack/day.

My first questions are about nicotine gum. How good is it and when should I stop chewing it to feel that I've quitted? I really want to quit cold turkey but would 2-4day (4mg) keep my nicotine levels high? (Packs in my country no longer have the nicotine amount information on them-I will check tomorrow online). Do you even recommend  nicotine gum?

I will be going to bed soon and had a cigaret about 2h ago. Can I set my quit time t-2?. I'm thinking it will be good for my attitude to see in the morning that I am already 8-9h smoke free. Does this night count? 

Thankyou!!

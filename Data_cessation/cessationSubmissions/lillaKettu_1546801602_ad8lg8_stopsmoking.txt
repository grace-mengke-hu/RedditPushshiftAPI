I caved ..

I was 8 days smoke free, and I actually enjoyed  being smoke free and it was fairly easy.
But today I caved, not proud of it but truthfully not too mad at myself for it. 
I'm surrounded by negative and toxic people and it has gone so far that I'm afraid to stand up for myself and also afraid to show emotion or speak up ( because everytime I've tried I would get shut down and everything would end up being my fault) 
But the point is that now I'm finally able to get away, it's finally possible ... and I just got so overwhelmed by all negative memories and the feeling of relief.
I kind of wanted to be all " f**k it " for once and not care about everything. 
Somehow I think that maybe this wasn't the best time to try and quit ... because it's hard being positive when people brings you down all the time.. But I did also get a bit of strength form that but sometimes enough is enough and I just broke. 
I didn't buy any cigarettes and I'm not planning to. I will still keep trying and in a couple of weeks I will be moving and I really want to leave my bad habit here and not take it with me.

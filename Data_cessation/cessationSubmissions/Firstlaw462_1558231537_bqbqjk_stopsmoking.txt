Helping my GF quit but running into a slight issue

So, my GF has been on Chantix for \~8 days and tomorrow is her quit day that she agreed on with her doctor. Tomorrow we had some plans for a couple friends to come over but now it's becoming a borderline party with a lot more people than we originally thought. We get off work at 5:30am after a 12 hour shift and have to clean the house and go to the store and run a couple other errands and it's looking like we'll be getting very little sleep if any. Tomorrow is looking to be a overly stressful day.

My GF hasn't said anything about not wanting to quit tomorrow and on one hand I want to stay firm to the deadline and I fear if we push the quit date out once it'll just make it easier to do the same thing in the future. On the other hand I want the absolute best chance of success for her and maybe quitting tomorrow will do more damage than if we delayed by a day.

So, I just want some thoughts. Should I suggest waiting a day? Or should I stay firm to the agreed upon quit date.

Smoking since I was 15

Bad choice obviously... I am 21 now going on 22. I smoke about a pack a day if not more menthol/full flavor doesn't matter to me and smoke heavily first thing in the morning. My last cigarette was over 9 hours ago. I have quit many times before but I am confident I can do it this time. I had a package of nicorette gum for a while chewing a peice now. Taste report: pretty shitty but I am trying to associate the taste of the gum with the taste of victory. Tips are welcome

Day 4.... My journey so far.

Ok. Used Allen carr's easyway. Day 1 was ok, felt confident. Day 2, little harder, mostly emotional. Day 3 was pure physical. I felt nauseous and gross, drank a lot of wine and finally took a klonopin. Day 4 I have had less cravings, but my throat hurts and I have some heartburn. This is the first time I have tried to quit without nrt's, so I'm just trying to understand my experiences and see if others have experienced the same.

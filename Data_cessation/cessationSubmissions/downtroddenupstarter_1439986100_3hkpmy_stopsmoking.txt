ONE. YEAR. BABY.

Well boys, it's finally been one year since my last cigarette. Am I still tempted at times? Sure. I feel so much better than I did. Looking back on last year and the week I quit, I really don't want to go back to that quitting process. I've saved a TON of money, my nose works, and I'm not a slave to nicotine. 

So far so good. Hang in there noobs! 


EDIT: Isn't it amazing that every day, there's someone quitting and someone on their 1, 5, or 40th anniversary of no smoking?

Alan Carr's Easy Way update: day 227

I finished the "Easy Way" book 227 days ago and decided I never needed to smoke again. 227 days later, cold turkey, and I am not even tempted anymore. Smoking is no longer a thought during the day.

I do not regret anything and am still positive that I will never smoke again.

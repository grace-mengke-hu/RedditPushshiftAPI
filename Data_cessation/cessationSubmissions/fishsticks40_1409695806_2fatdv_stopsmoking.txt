Back to the good side

Had a wicked bad breakup, which spun me back into being a full-timer for several months after 6 successful non-smoking years. Enough is enough.

Set my quit date for yesterday, but ended up running out a day earlier, so what the heck. It'll be 72 hours at around 1:00 in the morning.

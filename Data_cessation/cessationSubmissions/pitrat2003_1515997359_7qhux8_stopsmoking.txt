Apparently, i have my colour back

I was told earlier by a colleague that i’m looking a lot better lately, not quite so ‘death warmed up’ as usual, charming..!!
I’m under no illusions though, i wont be running down any cat-walks in Milan, Paris or London sporting the latest threads any time soon. Still, i will take whatever compliments i can get. 
Stay strong folks, it’s so worth it..!!!

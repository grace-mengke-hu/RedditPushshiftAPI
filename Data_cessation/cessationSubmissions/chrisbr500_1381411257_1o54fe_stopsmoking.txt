Was almost at two weeks...

Hey guys/girls. Here's the deal...I quit for almost two weeks (13 days to be exact), but last Friday I was drinking with a friend and had a cigarette. I regretted it as soon as I lit up, but I kept going. The next day I bought a pack and have been smoking all week. I feel really shitty about it, because during those two weeks that I had stopped, I started running and I felt great. The first day of running I could barely run 1/4 of a mile, but I worked up to three miles relatively quickly. Now I can barely run over a mile without feeling like shit. I've only been smoking for about 3 1/2 years, but this time of year is especially difficult for me. I get really nostalgic in the autumn, and that's when I picked up this habit. I guess I'm just looking for some support. I know it's completely my fault for starting up again, and I'll have to avoid drinking for longer than I thought.

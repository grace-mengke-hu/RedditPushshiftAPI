Just smoked my last cigarette and threw the rest of my tobacco pouch in the trash

A few days ago I downloaded the smoke free app and programmed my quit date into it. Monday, May 27. I followed the missions, writing down my triggers, the reasons I want to quit, and made a list of things I can do when the cravings hit.

I've been a smoker for 23 effing years. In that time I've had two quits of well over a year. I came back to it each time via "just one puff won't hurt." Like hell: it hurt! It's been in the back of my mind for a long time now, the desire to quit for good, the horrible fear that I might develop some chronic health issue. Three days ago I just snapped and decided it would be Monday. It's just turned Monday. 44 minutes in. I'm about to go to bed and wake up to my first smoke-free day in a long time. 

I'm hopeful but nervous; anxious but relieved. It's going to be hard. My husband is a smoker, though the rule is we don't smoke indoors (and luckily I also hate his brand of cigarettes -- I exclusively ~smoke~ smoked roll-ups). I live in a city full of smokers and we have no anti-smoking laws to protect me from seeing/smelling it everywhere I go. But I'm prepared. I know what I'm up against. I'm going to knuckle down hard the first couple of weeks and remind myself that it gets easier every day. Wish me luck and send me your best vibes, good people. Reading all your words has been a big inspiration &amp; also a big part of the reason I decided to do this now.

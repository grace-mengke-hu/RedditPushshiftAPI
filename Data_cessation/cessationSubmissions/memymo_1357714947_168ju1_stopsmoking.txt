People with COPD please help scare me straight.

I just recently learned that COPD is not just an old person's disease. I've smoked for 11 years off and on and currently I'm on my 6th day smoke free. Learning about COPD is what triggered this latest quit. I've been reading up on COPD but haven't read many personal stories. Please help make this my last quit and scare the shit out of me.

Smoked for 1,5 years. Why is the withdrawal so strong?

40 days ago I quit for 26 days or so. I felt like shit all the time. I relapsed because of it and smoked for like a week. Felt better after 2 days of smoking. Now I quit again since this monday and feel bad again.

By feeling bad I mean: Very tired (other things as well but this is the worst)

My question is, is such a strong withdrawal normal for someone who has smoked for 1,5 years?

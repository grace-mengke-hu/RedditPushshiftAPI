Going to quit after the Finals on Sunday.

I only do it "socially", or when I'm "having drinks", but the craving is there. I look forward to these events as an excuse to do it, sometimes. I've decided that Sunday will be my last day, regardless if my team wins or loses. I think taking a break from social drinking will help. 

Is it a ridiculous goal to prepare oneself like this, or is quitting something that shouldn't be prolonged even for two days?

Stressing out just thinking about it.

88 days and I am losing my mind HELP!

I am losing it. I don't know why but for the last few days I have been dieing for a ciggarette so bad if I didn't have a gf to disspoint I would have smoked one maybe 30 by now. Why is this happening to me a week ago I despised ciggarettes? ARRRRR I have exams at the moment and I think this may be a factor but I don't know. Is it going to get better?

22 days, very conscious of my lungs and health... feeling so much regret

Woke up, forced myself to breath really deep and hard, have this weird sensation something's not right. Well of course it isn't, I smoked a lot so 20 days isn't nothing... I did feel better before though. Maybe I'm feeling bad because I'm comparing to what a healthy person should feel like? 



I'm fine, but I feel my lungs aren't at 100% and now I feel scared and afraid... who knows if I developed a shitty condition thanks to those cancersticks..

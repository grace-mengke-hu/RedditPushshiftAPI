Lurking smokers: you can quit too!

No matter what your age or how long you have been smoking you can stop smoking.  Save money and don't damage your health.  

It will take years for my lungs to heal and even then they won't be as good as a non-smokers.  This is the stuff you don't let yourself think about while smoking.  I know I had the "It will never happen to me" thought in my head.  It was my way to make smoking ok.  But that is just a delusion.

I smoked 23 years and turned 40 and decided it was time to quit. I tried many times to quit.  Each time I would give in and start smoking again I thought I just didn't have it in me to quit.  But on Sept 25 I just got disgusted with smoking and had my last one.  I had read Allen Carrs book a few months before and it really does help.  You just have to get to that point where you know you have had enough and end it for good.

I am happy to say as time has gone by it is getting easier.  I haven't had a bad craving in weeks.  I think it is because in my mind I am a non-smoker.  I don't miss smoking.  There is nothing to miss.  I feel in control of my life now and it feels good.

For all of you smokers out there still I wish the best of luck quitting when it is your time.  (This was meant to inspire.  I'm sorry if I offended anyone.)

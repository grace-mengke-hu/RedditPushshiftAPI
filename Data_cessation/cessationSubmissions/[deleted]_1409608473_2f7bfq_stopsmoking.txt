Warning: Smoking cigars will totally make you want cigarettes.

Had a nice cigar at a wedding a few days ago.  Since then, I've had really bad cravings.  I haven't smoked in a long, long time, but as soon as I finished that cigar, I wanted a cigarette really badly.  So...let that be a lesson to you all:  DON'T FUCKING SMOKE CIGARS.  

The high from a cigar is so similar to a cigarette that it may as well be the same thing.  Now I get to enjoy withdrawal symptoms for the next few weeks.  Not nearly as bad as I remember them, but that good ole nervousness and irritability is back strong as ever.  Fuck that shit.  

Don't do it.

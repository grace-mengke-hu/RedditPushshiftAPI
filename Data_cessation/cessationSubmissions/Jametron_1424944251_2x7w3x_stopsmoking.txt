Nicotine patch dreams.

I know it's a well observed phenomenon (the extremely vivid dreams associated with NRT) but I thought I'd share my experience. Don't be fooled by my badge, I've been trying to quit for some time and I've had a lot of these dreams.

They're not usually bad dreams but wow when they are they're terrifying (like the anxiety dream where you smoke a cigarette and wake up feeling like you've relapsed). When they're good they can be absolutely incredible like when I played HL3 on an advanced VR system and it was friggin' awesome or last night which may or may not have involved Elaine from Seinfeld (Not Julia Louise Dreyfuss, the character Elaine) naked under a waterfall.

Please feel free to share your experiences.

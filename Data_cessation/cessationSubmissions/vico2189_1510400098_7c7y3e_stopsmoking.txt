Aaaaand 10 days cold turkey!

10 days, and I no longer suffer cravings anymore (or they are so tiny that I don't pay attention to them anymore).

I've had a fight with my girlfriend, and I would have relapsed before, but this time I didn't smoke.

So I guess I'm doing pretty fine.

The only thing is that now, I don't feel proud anymore. Not smoking has become something "normal". And maybe smoking too I guess. 

It's no longer a fight, it's no longer a challenge I'm winning. 

I've mixed feelings about that, I don't know if I should be happy to see I'm not struggling anymore, or worried that I don't feel proud anymore.

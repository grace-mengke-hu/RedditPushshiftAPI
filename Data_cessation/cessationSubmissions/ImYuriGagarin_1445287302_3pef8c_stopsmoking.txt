10 days, can't sleep.

So it's day 10 and I feel great and according to family I even look better! One thing that's throwing my confidence is the lack of sleep, I get to sleep pretty early but wake up 2-3 hours later and then cannot get back to sleep, does anyone else have stories of this happening and it passing? If it passes I'm happy to ride it out. I just don't want permanent sleeping problems because I tried to do something good for myself!

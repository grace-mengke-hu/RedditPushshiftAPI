Possibly Day One. Please Help.

I quit for about 4 months early this year. Then I went traveling through India and Nepal and just fell into it again. They were so cheap, I ended up chain smoking and going through more every day than I ever have. I started when I was 19 and I'm now only 24, but I never planned this to be part of my life and I want it to be gone. I came to you guys because I kinda don't know where else to turn. I live at home and my mum is still a smoker and most of my friends are. It's Monday and I have a party Friday so my mind is in two parts - I can either keep going and stop next week, or I can stop now and have momentum to get me through Friday. Anyway, anything you guys can do to help will be really appreciated. I miss feeling proud of myself.

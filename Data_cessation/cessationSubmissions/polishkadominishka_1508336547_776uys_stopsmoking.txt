Evening problem!

Hello everyone, this is my 12345678th attempt but I really want to do it this time. My smoking is weird though...I have no problem not smoking during the day, I feel fresh, I don’t smell,my face looks much prettier, I don’t have cravings and I feel great telling myself yeah I can do it, this is easy...but then evening comes and literally minute by minute I begin to want that stinker in my mouth...as some sort of stupid reward at the end of the day, when I’m finally home, relaxed, at the window...I smoke and regret it after one, then two then three...
I don’t know what to do with it, what should I tell myself when those moments come? ... i really want to do it this time and I see you guys talk about weeks and months! This seems immense to me when I can’t even do 2 days!
I’ve been smoking for 11 years, sometimes a pack a day and this evening problem began only recently, I don’t get it. I would love some advice from you who seem pretty courageous....

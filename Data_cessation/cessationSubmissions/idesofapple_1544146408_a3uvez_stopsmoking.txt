Smoking when intoxicated

Hey everyone, I think my issue with smoking is that if I’m tipsy/drunk, I automatically smoke. And it’s always a lot of cigarettes (about 10-15). I’m 20 and I don’t wanna keep going down this path, because I started smoking when drunk when I was 17 and then it seeped over into day to day smoking when I was 18, and this year I’ve managed to ween myself off it more and more except for lately my old habits are coming back again. Mentally, I think I get into a mood where I just don’t ‘care’ about the repercussions but I actually do. I don’t wanna die. Any tips on how to help my brain not want to smoke when drunk and when I have less inhibitions?

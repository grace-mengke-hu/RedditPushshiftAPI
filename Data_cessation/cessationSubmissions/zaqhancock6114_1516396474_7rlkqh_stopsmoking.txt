Different perspective on quitting

I understand the effective methods of quitting smoking can be different for everyone, and the reasons for quitting can be different as well. 

I've only been following this sub for a couple months now, but I can't help but notice how many people post a screen shot of their time tracker. I congratulate every single one of you for making that big step.  Before I quit, I couldn't help but think that the idea behind quitting is to occupy your mind so that aren't thinking about smoking. There's nothing wrong with keeping track of how long you have been without a cigarette, but I think in a lot of cases for some people it may be more harmful to keep track just for the simple fact that it keeps your mind thinking about it, which can be counterproductive. 

I was a pack-a-day smoker for 12 years and when I quit I refused to keep track of how long it's been and it really helped me forget that I was even a smoker. I understand it's not as easy for everyone, but perhaps some of you may benefit from deleting your time tracker and find something to occupy your mind until you forget you used to smoke. It may not work for everyone, but it may help someone that's constantly having cravings. The mind can be very powerful when it comes to addictions, so not having another reason to think about it can be a good thing for some.

Stay strong everyone and never let your mind get the best of you!

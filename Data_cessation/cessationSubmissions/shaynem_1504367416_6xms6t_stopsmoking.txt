What new Hell? - 4 Months into quit.

So, supposedly, all those neuroreceptors that craved the nicotine are dead or dying. No smoking since may 2. Bathroom visits are now a bit more regular, so that's something (and no, nobody said anything about that particular side effect to quitting.) 

In the last 3 days i've dreamed about buying/smoking cigarettes, fought of 2 vampire bloodlust cravings and have been eating like a horse. I've also been told that I've been crabby.  Aside from some allergies I feel fine.

What's next?!? And how much more havoc do I have to look forward to!?! Someone give me some hope.

I'm back

Hello darkness my old friend.

I 'quit' the first time in October 2015. It was for a girl really but I managed to make it stick. I absorbed the Allen Carr book, downloaded the apps and used this subreddit daily. A year and a half later I was living abroad and still I didn't smoke. Quitting was the single greatest thing I'd ever done and I was so proud of myself. I could go out, get drunk - do ANYTHING with out smoking then one night I was drinking with a friend in June 2017 and I smoked. From there it crept back into my life. The odd weekend turned into every weekend. Sometimes I'd go 3 weeks without one then I'd smoke. 

It's dominating my life again and I've turned into the slave I worked so hard to break away from. It is making me feel anxious, guilty, edgy and I can't wait to feel free once again! I'm so fucking pissed off that I'm here again but I've made several half hearted attempts to stop in the past few months but this time I will go back to the well and use.

Anyway, it's Friday. Other than the smoking life is pretty brilliant. Let's do this!

So I really want to quit.

Been smoking coming up on near 30 years now. Have tried cold turkey, (only time that worked was in basic training, and as soon as I could I bought a pack) Chantix, patches, nic lozenges, e-cigs...just so tired of the wasted money, the congestion when the weather turns, the freaking slavery of it. I'll need much support, but I'm so tired of it. Will keep posted. once I'm done with this pack (being I ended up broke this week) I'm not buying more. Any tips ? Can't chew gum. 
Edit: Have not quit, yet overstress for holiday made me fearful of losing my damn mind on someone that didn't deserve it. (like my poor mom). Question, do e-cigs count? I feel like I could transition?
Edit 2.0- Thankee-sai to all of you for your help and tough love. Will continue. Maybe actually KEEP a NYR this time. Happy new year all, be safe and take care.
Edit 2.0.01- Smoked last Pall-Mall Red 100 last night. Occasional drags on e-cig. So Far, So Good, So What.

How to help?

I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years this Saturday. I've always had a problem with smoking and he's lied to me about it many times before. The other day we were talking and it came up that I can't pretend that I'm okay with the situation anymore. He knows how I feel and had told me many times he won't quit for me. The other day he said that he would try and I'd like to believe him but we've been through this so many times before. He says he wants me to be more supportive about it and I want to but its hard. He also wants me to talk about it with him besides just asking how its going and I'm not sure how to talk about it or what to say anyways. I was wondering if you had any pointers on how to bring the subject up and sound positive about the situation. I realize that I may sound like a bitch but he's lied to me at every turn about it before and I don't want to be tricked again.

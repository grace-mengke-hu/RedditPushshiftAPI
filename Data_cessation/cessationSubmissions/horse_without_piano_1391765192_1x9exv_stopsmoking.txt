Starting Now

Hello folks, today I feel very happy.
I've been smoking for about 13 years, with a 8 months break (started again to smoke last year around my birth day when I've got into a depression because I was getting older). 
So I've just smoked my last ciggar (after reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1x7lb7/i_dont_want_to_quit/)), with the thought that all this quiting bussiness is about how to you think, so need guidance in the upcoming days for my thoughts.

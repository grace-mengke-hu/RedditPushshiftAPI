Broke 202 day quit today.

I won't make too many excuses, but basically, I have been extremely sad, and I thought cigarettes would make me feel better. They kind of did, but the tradeoff is that I feel unhealthy and my anxiety is 5x worse. It wasnt worth it. I am not going to smoke even one more cigarette, Im getting back on track NOW. I want to know how hard it is going to be so that I can prepare. I had 2 light cigarettes. Are the cravings going to be strong tomorrow? I would think it wouldnt be that hard, but I don't know.

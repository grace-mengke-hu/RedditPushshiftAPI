Cravings are here!

I have been waiting for them! The electronic cigarette has been working wonders for my past week. Not a single craving for a week. Hardly any withdrawal symptoms. My sense of smell is not wundebar and I can run without feeling like a piece of crap.
Tomorrow I'll have finished my current juice cartride and I'll switch to a juice with a lower nicotine content.

So ya. But today I've had a few cigarette crawings. At this point I know they are not becouse my body phisically craves nicotine. I get enough nicotine to have a mild and slow and easy withdrawal. So I know that my cravings are purely psycological. I might still be in love with those sticks. After all I was smoking them looking at the sunset on the Bolsena lake during a wonderful summer night.

I "miss" the taste of tabacco. But I KNOW that if I smoke one now the taste will be awful in my mouth, I will probably cough and I will be disgusted by all the tar and the ash. And the smell of those slate cigarettes sitting in the ashtray... So nah.

Can you give me other reasons to resist temptation? I counscioully know that if I keep smoking forever I'll eventually end up damagin my lungs, my skin, my hair, my teeth, my sence of taste and smell. But like all humans my mind works better on the short term and long term consequences of present actions are difficult to be seen.

Back to zero

Went out today to find a pharmacy to get some Piracetam. Walked to the 5 pharmacies that are in an acceptable distance from my house and they were all closed. I was mad because school is approaching and I need to start studying yesterday and I can't find any fucking piracetam, so I bought a pack, smoked a cigarette and immediately regretted it. Fuck cigarettes and fuck pharmacies for being closed.

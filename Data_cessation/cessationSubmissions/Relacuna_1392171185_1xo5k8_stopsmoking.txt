You can all do it!

I just came across this subreddit, and happy to post that I'm a couple months over my 3 year mark. 

Unfortunately I can't offer much help as I quit cold turkey. Smoking with asthma wasn't a good idea. I woke up from coughing one morning because I couldn't breathe. Figured it was time to quit!

It's just 1 day at a time, it can be discouraging but you can do it!

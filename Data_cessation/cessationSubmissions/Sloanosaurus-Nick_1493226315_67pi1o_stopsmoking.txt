Oral fixation alternatives besides chewing gum?

Hi quitters!

I've been smoke free for two weeks and 3 days and nicotine free for 5 days. Doing well so far with fighting off the cravings. Whenever I start wanting a smoke, I chew a piece of gum and that helps take my mind off it. I started with the patch and nicotine gum supplement. I got off the patch last Thursday and switched to just regular gum on Saturday.

The thing is though, I'm not a huge fan of chewing gum. It's just not my thing but having that oral fixation is helping a ton. What other alternatives have you used for dealing with the oral fixation? I'm not feeling the physical withdrawal anymore but it's just the damn ritual of it that I'm struggling with! 

Anyway, any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

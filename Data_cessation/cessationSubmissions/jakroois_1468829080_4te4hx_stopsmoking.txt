Energy out the wazoo!

Always thought I was just ADD, never ADHD. Turns out I've been bouncing off the walls like a 5-year-old since I quit. I don't even need coffee anymore! Still drink 1-2 cups a day out of habit but lots more water than I used to. Working on focusing but at least I'm not lethargic anymore. Plus I work a job that's average task length is about 10 seconds (deli work) so my new found energy really helps. 

Could not have done this without a certain "stop smoking" book I'm sure you've all heard of, and I sound like a commercial saying it, but I really didn't have any withdrawal pangs and I did actually enjoy quitting just like it said throughout the book. Especially since I was in a detox facility that did not allow cellphones/computers OR smoking until we went to meetings. 
Seeing my roommates craaaaaving the next meeting just so they can have their cigarette was like a victory for me every time I watched them. 

Sorry for leaving you guys for so long! I thought I was actually enjoying my cigs there for a while but now I can taste food and do hyper things and not be out of breath... and I feel like I've almost got all the shit out of my lungs! Hope someone takes something from this. Thanks for being here! And I'll be trying more to contribute now :)

And yeah, try the book. Couldn't hurt, right?

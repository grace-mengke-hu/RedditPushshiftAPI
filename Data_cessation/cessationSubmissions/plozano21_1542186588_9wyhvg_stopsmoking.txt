This sucks!!

3 days ago I slipped and took a drag, after 2 months of not smoking, I regretted it immediately and don't really feel the need to smoke anymore, in fact I rarely think about smoking anymore, however I feel like my anxiety has spiked and I keep having night terrors and can't fall asleep without going into a panic attack that'll wake me right up. Could this be withdrawal again? I figured since it was only a drag I wouldn't get the symptoms ðŸ™ƒ

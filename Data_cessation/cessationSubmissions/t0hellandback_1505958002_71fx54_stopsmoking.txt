I managed a full 24 hours before I smoked again.

I got to 24 hours before I smoked again on my first attempt to quit. My feelings are mixed. I'm proud I got to 24 hours as that's longer than I have gotten before, but after having the cigarette I felt really silly and like I didn't even need it or enjoy it that much. I can see now that all the things my brain was telling me and my anxiety about never smoking again was silly, and it was just the addiction to the nicotine talking. 

I feel like I will be better able to work through those feelings next time. I'm going to start again tomorrow.

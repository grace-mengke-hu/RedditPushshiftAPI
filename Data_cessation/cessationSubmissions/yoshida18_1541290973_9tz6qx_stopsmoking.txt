Almost 500 days without nicotine... This week was the hardest in a long time but I think I made it

  My goal here is not to get politic here, but I'm brasilian and last sunday we elected a Fascist nutjob that makes Trump looks like he is sane.  I am a historian that dedicated my life to study fascism so you bet I was really paranoid lately and this was really soul crushing for me.
  
  Monday I was feeling really depressed, mixed sleeping pills with a bottle of wine and passed out for 12 hours.

  Tuesday was by far the worst and I nealy bought a pack there. I tried to force myself to be productive and after 2 hours in the library (hangovered), I was feeling overwhelming anxiety pared with the strange metallic taste in my mouth that severe nicotine craving makes me feel.  I Drank gallons of water trying to help with the cravings but failing, bought a 6 pack of beer and drank myself to sleep ( again )

  Wednesday things were a bit better, I went to the groceries and bought a lot of candies, mentos, popcorn, grapes, doritos and those kind of things that you do when you kill anxiety . They lasted until Friday and I didn't spent a single second without some food in my mouth.

  Finally Saturday came and I slept all day, I'm feeling refreshed and even thought this week was hell and I barely made it, I **did** *make* it.

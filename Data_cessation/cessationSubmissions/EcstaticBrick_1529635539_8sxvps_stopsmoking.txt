Cancer risks

I started smoking when I was 17 and I’ve recently quit at the age of 20. I’d usually smoke up to 5 cigarettes a day, sometimes even less. Now that I’ve quit I’ve noticed my throat is getting a lot more sore and it is tender to the touch. I suspect that it might be a swollen lymph node. What are the cancer risks for someone that has smoked for the amount of time that I have?

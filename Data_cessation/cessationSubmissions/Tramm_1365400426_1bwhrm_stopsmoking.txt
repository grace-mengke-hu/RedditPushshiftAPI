Where to start?

I've been smoking for nearly 3 years, and there's not a day that has gone by that I haven't thought about quitting. But I just don't know how. 

I'll go smoke free for a day at the most, sometimes a couple times a month, and I just break down and say, "I'll quit some other time." and then I go buy a pack. The problem is, I've said that to myself, damn near every day.

Typically, I pride myself in my strong will, and ability to say no... But cigarettes seem to be my kryptonite. I miss the days, when I could see someone smoking and never thought anything about it, now when I see someone smoke, I immediately get the urge and I find a place to go light up.

Quitters? Where should I start? I'm really tired of it. I want to quit.

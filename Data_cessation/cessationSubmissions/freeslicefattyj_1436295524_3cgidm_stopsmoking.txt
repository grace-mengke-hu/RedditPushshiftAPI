Thoughts for those starting out after 200 days.

I have many thoughts, none of which involve wanting a cigarette. 

For those of you starting out and struggling, take each day at a time and concentrate on the benefits you haven't enjoyed in years.  Your clothes smell better, your chest feels better, you don't have to leave social settings, you're more attractive to the opposite sex, you're saving so.much.money.

Check in to this subreddit often if you're feeling stressed. Get an app to track your progress, drink lots of water, keep yourself full, buy yourself something cool. Do things you've put off for awhile.  Ride a bike or go for a walk.  Stay busy.  Feel bad for people you see smoking, they haven't figured it out yet but you have.  You are awesome.  And oh yeah, F*** cigarettes.

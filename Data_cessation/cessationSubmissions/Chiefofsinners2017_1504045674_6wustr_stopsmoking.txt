Nicotine-Free Dream Worlds -- and Nightmare Lands

This is my umpteenth quit attempt but I'm feeling really good about it. Have made it to nearly a month cold turkey, and I've combined it with an aggressive running regiment. The cravings have decreased down to one or two a day. I've even managed to avoid smoking in the face of one of my biggest stressors and triggers: coming home to help my ailing mother and grandmother.

The only thing that remains is the terribly vivid dreams/nightmares. I'm not even sure I mind them. Sometimes they're even kind of cool, and going to bed each night can feel like an adventure. But sometimes they are terrifyingly real, as if quitting smoking has unlocked some dark ans mysterious corners of my soul.

Anybody experience similar? Do the vivid dreams go away?

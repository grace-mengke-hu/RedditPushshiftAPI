It's a choice.

Almost felt a sadness about not smoking and I realized its such bullshit. There isn't some universal force keeping me from smoking ever again. I'm *choosing* not to smoke right now. And it'll be my choice if I do smoke again and you know,  all of this smoking crap is 100% under my control,  according to my choices. No excuses, no tears, no bullshit.

Stopping Chantix side effects

I started taking Chantix in February and I'm happy to report that I am no longer a smoker (47 days!)

While taking it I didn't have severe mood swings, but I did have a lot of nausea and horrible, vivid nightmares. I stopped taking Chantix about 2 weeks ago because I didn't feel the urge to smoke anymore. 

Now I am having severe mood swings. I have started crying hysterically on a regular basis. I get angry easily. I've gotten into fights with my SO on a regular basis. 

Has anyone else had this happen? How long did it last for?

Also - I know I should consult my doctor. However, I got the medicine from a CVS Minute Clinic so I do not have a personal doctor I see on a regular basis. I am going to go by the Minute Clinic after work to talk to them.

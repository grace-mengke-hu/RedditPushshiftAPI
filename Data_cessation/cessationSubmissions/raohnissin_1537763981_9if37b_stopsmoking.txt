Why do I keep smoking?

Longtime lurker. First post, nervous but here goes:

I have no idea why I smoke. I have smoked various amounts over the last 20 years. Never a full on pack a day but at least 3-5 cigarettes and as may as 10 on occasion - out drinking/smoking weed etc. for the last 5 years I can wake up and go about my day without a cigarette no problem. Like I don’t even think about it. As soon as I am home though and start to unwind I have to have one. It’s like the day isn’t over unless. I hate it. I hate being weak. 

My kids have never seen me smoke (4 and 6) but I know they aren’t stupid. And you can’t hide that smell. I know one day they will figure it out. I hate it so much. My wife also smokes. She is more of a “regular smoker”. I want us both to stop but don’t want to push us and it become a thing. Marriage with young kids have enough stresses. 

Where the f*** do I start? 
Thanks for reading and for those of you that have stopped I am a big fan of yours so keep on keeping on.

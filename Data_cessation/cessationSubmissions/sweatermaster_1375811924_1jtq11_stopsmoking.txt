So long, and thanks for the all fish.

Welp, I think it's about my time to mosey on out of this sub. I finally feel like I am good to stand on my own and leave the comfort this support system behind. It was great to see the struggles that everyone else was going through and realize that it wasn't just me that it was happening to. 

To all the people who are deciding to make a change - realize that it will be one of the hardest things you will ever do,  but it will be oh so worth it. I am thankful every day that I made that choice to quit. I am so glad that the shackles of smoking are finally broken! 

Thanks and good luck to everyone - you can do it!

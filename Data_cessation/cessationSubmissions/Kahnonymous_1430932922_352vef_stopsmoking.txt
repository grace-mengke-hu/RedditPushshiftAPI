Five and a half hours since the second time I've stopped.

I smoked a pack a day for 11 years before, back in 2007, I realized during a period of being unemployed, I was only leaving the house to get or smoke cigarettes.  It was easier then, I just played wow and ritualized breaking up "trees" to pack a mini one hitter, and it worked.  After spending a week of breaking the addiction but weening the habit, I went 26 months without a single smoke.  I caved a few months after working as an EMT, was just surrounded by smokers so much and chose to give in.

That was over 5 years ago now, and I want to quit again.  There's factors like finances, health, and SO non-approval, but it's ultimately about getting control and doing this for myself.

It's not easy, I'm broke for the next two days,  but have a bit left on a Walmart gift card from xmas, I never shop there personally so I don't know if they even carry smokes or not.  Friday I get paid, and then it'll be really hard to not go grab a pack first thing.  I figure now is as good as any time to stop, as bad as I feel craving right now.  I know from experience the first 72 hours is the hardest, and while there will be ups and downs after, it'll get easier over time.  


By posting here, I feel more committed; it's not making a promise to someone close to me that I could just break some day, it's just saying it aloud and promising myself.

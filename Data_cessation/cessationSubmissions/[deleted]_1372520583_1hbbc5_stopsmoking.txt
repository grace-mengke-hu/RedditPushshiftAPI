So I quit tuesday night...

I quit on the night of mon-tue at 01:00am because I had a cold and was coughing. Wasn't really "quitting" at first, but now I am not coughing anymore and held out more than 110h (the longest I have ever gone without cigs for ~2 years). Tonight I'm meeting up with friends for beer and fun but I don't know if I can hold this. Any tips?

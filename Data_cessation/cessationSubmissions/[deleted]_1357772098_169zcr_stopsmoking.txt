A small tip

A little background for you all. I am 28, been smoking since I was 14. Yep, 50% of my life was spent as a half pack to full pack a day smoker. On avg. I would say I smoked probably 15 smokes a day in those 14 years. I tried to quit MANY MANY MANY times. Always failed. This time has been different and the main thing is I didn't look at it the same way.

Before I would always think "oh man, this will suck. the withdrawls, the anger, fuck that shit." and back to smoking within a couple of days. 

This time I went into it with the mindset of "Dude, it's really not that bad man. Oh you want a smoke for 2 minutes? Fuck you, move on." and it has been working. Not only with the quitting, but with everything I do I just think of it as "Dude, its REALLY NOT THAT BAD. GROW UP." and now I am working out, eating right, waking up early and shit.


A small tip to remember, ITS NOT THAT BAD.

Good luck everyone. You got this.

EDIT: I don't mean to belittle the suck that is quitting. I know it sucks, I am simply trying to say if you change your mindset on it, it makes it a little easier.

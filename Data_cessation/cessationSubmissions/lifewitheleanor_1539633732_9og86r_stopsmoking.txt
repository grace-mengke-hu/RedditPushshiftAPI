One week since I've stopped. Anyone else found day 5&amp;6 harder than day 1&amp;2? It was a tumultuous weekend filled with horrible guilt-ridden overeating

I read Allen Carr's book and I am confident in my decision. I already feel better! However, something must not have stuck when he discussed weight because I started substituting. I was fine initially for the first couple of days and then the weekend hit.

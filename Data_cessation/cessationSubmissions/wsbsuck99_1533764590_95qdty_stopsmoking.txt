Day 9 of Chantix was awful.

I've been smoking for the last 10 years, a pack a day. And finally decided to quit about 3 weeks ago. Day 1 of Chantix I felt depressed but by day 3 I was back to my normal un-depressed self. 

So this morning I was had 2 cups of coffee, a couple bites of a bagel, and a nice blue pill of Chantix than ran out of the house to work. I was about two thirds of the way to work and I started to fell nervous. About 5 minuets later my heart was racing. My arms and legs were starting to shake. I started to get a crazy head rush.  I was huffing and puffing for air trying to calm myself down. All this was going on when I'm driving down the bridge. I get off at the first exit ramp and floor it to find a safe place to pull over. I sat in the car for 10 minuets on the side of the road  trying to calm down. I felt I was having a panic attack or or something. I saw a doughnut shop about a block down the road. I stopped there and ate more. 30 minutes later I felt better and showed up late to work. 

So moral of the story ALWAYS EATING BEFORE TAKING THIS STUFF and watch out for the coffee. I thought I could get by without and a big breakfast but I was completely wrong. Now at 5 I fell mentally tired. Like my brain was working x10 this morning. Although I haven't had a cig in 72 hours, so that's the bright side I guess.

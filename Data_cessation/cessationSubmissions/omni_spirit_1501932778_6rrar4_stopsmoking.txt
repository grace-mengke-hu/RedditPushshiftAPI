It's official, it's time to quit (and hopefully for good this time)

I got up early this morning with that all too familiar urge. So I did some internet prawling, washed some dishes, got something to eat, and then....smoked. But this time, it only served to confirm something. I didn't get that temporary "high" like I used to. All it did was made it yet harder for me to breath again (something that's started happening over the last few days) and took the energy out of me. I would've been better off meditating honestly (which is objectively true, but my mind had other plans this morning). 

Taking this all into account, I'll use a vape at the very least, and when I'm ready or if capable, quit nicotine entirely and possibly all stimulants as well (coffee I see you!).

With that said, what are some foolproof methods of getting through withdrawal? I quit two times before (8 weeks for the first time, and 21 days for the second) and weed (which I don't have access to) and Gatorade (which I can't really afford atm) seemed to helped me through along with an exercise routine.

ANY advice is appreciated :)

Generalized Anxiety Disorder + I want to stop smoking

Hi,

I smoke "few" cigarettes in one day and I am a "new-smoker" (started smoking two/three years ago). But I decide to quit for a lot of reasons:

1. My teeths are destroyed.
2. I have anxiety, so if I don't smoke, I start to feel really bad.
3. I don't have "power" to walk. If I walk 1 mile, I start to feel tired. Same to taking the stairs instead of elevator.

I decide to quit a few months ago, but everytime I return. Because of anxiety, because of the "side effects" of this horrible drug.

There is any tips of you guys who have Generalized Anxiety Disorder to minimize the side effects of "stop smoking" thing, so I can really quit? I know there is no magic, but any suggestions, I'll take it!

Also, sorry for my english, english is not my first language and if I don't write for long time, I start to forget how to write LOL.

Thanks.

36 hours in...

So I’m 36 hours without a cigarette. I don’t really know how I feel. It sucks for sure, but doesn’t seem as bad as the past times I’ve tried. Granted I have been home playing video games and napping for these 36 hours. I bought a Juul ecig and feel very guilty about it. It helps though. I was very dizzy and nauseous yesterday so I went out and bought one. I feel like I’m cheating. I’m happy I haven’t had a cigarette in the longest time in 16 years, but don’t feel like I’m doing it “right”. Can anyone reassure me that what I’m doing is better, or on the flip side, confirm that I’m cheating? I feel like crying either way.

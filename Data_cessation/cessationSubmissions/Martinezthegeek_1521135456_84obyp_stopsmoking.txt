2) CONFUSION 
3) MEMORY PROBLEMS 
4) GREATLY REDUCED ABILITY TO READ EFFECTIVELY AS NORMAL PEOPLE DO. 
5) ROUGHLY PERSISTENT BRAIN FOGS (though it may come and go sometimes). 

6) DIFFICULTY FOLLOWING UP CONVERSATION ( due to FORGETFULNESS PROBLEM) 
7) ANXIETY AND PANIC ATTACKS 
8) LACK OF MOTIVATION 
9) DIFFICULTY READING, ABSORBING OR DEALING WITH NEW AND UNFAMILIAR INFORMATION. 

10) DETACHMENT FROM REALITY. 
11) DIFFICULTY IN REMEMBERING RECENT INFORMATION OR THINGS JUST READ (some find themselves repeating the same word/lines the read over and over again to retain to retain it but it's mostly futile). 
12) DEPRESSION. 

 So Ex-smokers, I would love you guys to list the symptoms listed here that you have experienced by writing their numbers eg. 1,2,4,5,7,8,9,10&amp;12.

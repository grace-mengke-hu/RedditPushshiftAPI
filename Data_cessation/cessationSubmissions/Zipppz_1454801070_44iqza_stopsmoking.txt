77 Days

I quit smoking 77 days ago, I plan on making a longer post about all of my ups and downs, along with the things that seemed to help me along the way. Theres just one thing I need to get off my chest. At about the 62 day mark, I started using chewing tobacco again. I had quit chewing, probably a good 2 months before I had made the decision to quit smoking, and then on my birthday, I made the conscious decision that I wanted to start chewing again. 

I haven't had a single slip up when it comes to the cigarettes, but I want honest opinions on what you guys think of me starting to chew again.

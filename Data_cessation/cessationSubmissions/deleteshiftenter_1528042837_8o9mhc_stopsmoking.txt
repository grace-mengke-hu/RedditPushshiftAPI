Day3

For the last 6 months or so, I've been attempting to quit smoking.  I think the longest I had was 18 days or something.  During these attempts, I learned what triggers me and leads me to smoke.  Strong emotions are by far my biggest trigger in combination with a "I don't fucking care, I can quit later" attitude.  

There's a part of me that loves smoking.  How it makes me race and heightens things.  I used to be able to take it or leave, get the effects I wanted, and move on.  I can't do that anymore.  If I buy a pack, I smoke and smoke and smoke until its gone and it's disgusting, utterly disgusting.  I've crossed the line and can no longer get the positive effects of nicotine without the bad.  Cus I can't fucking stop once I have them.  So I am done, and most importantly, I want to be done.  I don't think you can do this by "needing" to be done.  Wanting to is essential.  

So anyways, for the past 3 days, I have been lying super low.  Literally not engaging in much of anything to avoid relapsing and I will continue doing this for as long as necessary.  It's incredibly dull, but I guess there are worse things.  The day I can feel anger, sadness, joy, excitement, and not want to simultaneously puff on a million cigarettes will be a fabulous day.

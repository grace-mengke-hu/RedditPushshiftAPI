I feel like I should quit smoking, but in reality I quite enjoy it. What are your thoughts on this?

I've been smoking around five to ten cigarettes a day for three years, about 3/4's of a pack if I'm drinking. I know I'm addicted, and I know it isn't healthy and I probably should do something about it.
However I really, really enjoy smoking. I'm not sure if the reasons I enjoy smoking is either because I like the taste and the nicotine rush or because my brain tells me I like it.

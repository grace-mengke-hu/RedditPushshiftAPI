24 hours down.

I've quit too many times to count.  I always have the hardest time in the first week and fight really hard.  Then when it seems easier I get complacent and think I can have one at a party or something.  I'm not going to stress about the future yet.  For now, I'm just happy that the first 24 hours nicotine free is done.  I'm going to sleep and tomorrow I will not smoke.

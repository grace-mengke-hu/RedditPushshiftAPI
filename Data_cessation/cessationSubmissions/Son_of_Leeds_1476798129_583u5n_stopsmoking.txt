Day 1, Minute 1

I've been reading everyone's posts for the past 20 minutes or so while out on a smoke break. At the end of the summer, I managed to quit for about a month before relapsing to a pack a day. I planned on quitting after I finished this pack, but right now I'm throwing out not only the butt I just smoked, but the remaining 8 in my pack along with my lighter. 

Wish me luck guys... I want this one to be for good.

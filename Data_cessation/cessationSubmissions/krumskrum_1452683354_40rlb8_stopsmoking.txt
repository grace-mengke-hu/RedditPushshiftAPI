Bad habits to replace smoking with?

So I want to quit smoking, but for some reason I don't want to just drop it and have all healthy habits; I have some sort of mental block that makes it seem undesirable to be one of those "healthy people" who never does anything thats bad for them. I'm looking for a habit that is similar to smoking that i can use to replace it. Basically, any time that i would take a break, go outside and have a smoke, I need a new habit to do instead that is not good for me, but also not as addictive as smoking. I am not only addicted to nicotine but also the ritual of smoking, so i need a new ritual to replace it with. any suggestions would be welcome.

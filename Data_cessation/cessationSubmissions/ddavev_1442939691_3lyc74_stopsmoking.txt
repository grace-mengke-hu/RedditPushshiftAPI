2 years today

Today marks 2 years since I quit smoking! I started smoking when I was 12 years old and smoked over a pack a day until I was 42. If I can do it, anyone can. 

As so many have suggested here, I read Allen Carr's book and really took it to heart. You have to really believe what Carr tells you: you're not depriving yourself of nicotine, you are freeing yourself from it! I did the patch for 6 weeks (2 weeks/stage) and haven't had a single puff in 2 years. That was really the key for me... I know from past failed quit attempts that just one cigarette is all it takes. Hang in there!

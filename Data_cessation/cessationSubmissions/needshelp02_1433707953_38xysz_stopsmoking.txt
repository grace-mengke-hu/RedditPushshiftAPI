Spouse quit smoking, depressed, what to do

It's been about 3 months since my husband quit his 20 year habit of smoking over a pack a day.

He's had it rough since the quit. The first week was awful (it reminded me of that scene from Trainspotting where the guy's trying to get off heroin) and each successive week has been better than that.

Still, he's not quite himself. While much of the initial rage is gone, he recently seems to have fallen into a deeper depression for the past few days. He's lying in bed, has closed the door, and doesn't seem like he's going to get up any time soon. I'm not sure what to do to help him. He seems both angry and sad, and doesn't want me to interact with me at all today, so I'm staying out of his way. 

Not being a smoker nor having had much experience with depression myself, I'd appreciate any suggestions.

Emotional af

Just over 24 hours with zero nicotine and I'm an emotional mess.  A guy I mess with is being a jerk, and it's taking everything in me not to lose my cool on him.  I haven't, and I'm not smoking or using nrt.  So, I'm just crying and raging and having really rapid mood swings.  I also can't sleep.  I know I'm posting a lot here, but it helps, so hopefully you guys don't mind my ranting.  I'm sure some of this is just the withdrawal, but knowing that doesn't lessen the intensity of my feelings unfortunately.   If I could go back to 15 year old me, I would tell her 2 things... don't start smoking, and don't fuck with this guy... of course, if I changed those courses there would just be other hardships to replace them, bc that's just life.

I hope I can sleep soon.  Ugh.

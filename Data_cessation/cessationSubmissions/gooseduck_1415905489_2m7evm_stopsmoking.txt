A Month, This Is It

If you'd told me a month ago that this was 'the quit', I probably wouldn't have believed you. I started smoking when I was 17 (6 years ago), and ended up smoking about an average of 10 per day - though it fluctuated a fair bit. I also smoked spliffs (weed with tobacco), and these were the things that destroyed previous quits, along with alcohol. This time, I bought out my vaporiser for the weed, and I've tackled the triggers head on, beating the alcohol one many times. I spent a lot of time around here to reinforce in my first few days and now to offer encouragement.

Allen Carr's book was how I quit, and it's been surprisingly easy. As soon as I got 2 senses back I was convinced. Never been happier to be a non-smoker. For anyone just starting out, after the first week nicotine free it gets a lot easier, we have all got this!

That star :D

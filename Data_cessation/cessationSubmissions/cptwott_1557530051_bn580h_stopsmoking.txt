Today was a good day.

I'm 50 days in, and I can't remember having a craving ,  or even a long thought about cigarettes today. So, to all stoppers that think this is hell forever: it isn't.   
I'm ready to tackle my next challenge, I went 5kgs up in body mass. So I started keto. Maybe it kept my mind of the smoking.

Good night everybody. Keep not-smoking!

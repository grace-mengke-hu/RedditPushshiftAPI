The toughest day...

High all. Today was the toughest day for me. I told my father that I quit smoking for almost 10 days now and he says only 10 ? That means you were smoking all this time ? He thought I had quit a long time back. Not a word of encouragement followed. A family friend offered me cigarettes multiple times. A few hours ago, that same person, drunk, called me a spineless person who is spit on by everybody. He said as I am now, I don't have it in me to succeed in this dog-eat-dog world. To top this shitty day, the only person I've ever been in a relationship with is getting married today. 

I didn't have a smoke. I was close to buying one 3 times and taking up offers for one much more than that. Tell me I'm doing something right.

**Update**: That guy told my father that she said what he said to me. My father told him to GTFO. Feeling much better!

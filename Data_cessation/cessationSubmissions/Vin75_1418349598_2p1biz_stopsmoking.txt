First Massive Test Tonight...

It's the work Christmas Party tonight, so it will be my first big test of drinking out in a crowd while nicotine free. In the past, I have had my trusty lozenges to fall back on if I was gravitating towards the social smokers circle, but this year I am going to stay off the smokes because I know I can do it. There is absolutely no point or value to having "just one" or " a couple while drinking". 

So fellow legends of the quit brigade, do you have any tips for me to get through a night of heaving drinking without taking any dirty darts on board? I am 99% sure I'm going to get through without an issue, but at that midnight hour, with my belly full of wine and my head dizzy with alcohol, what's your one tip for staying away from the stray smoke?

Seriously - not drinking tonight is not an option. I'm not a heavy drinker, but I will be having a few between 7 pm and 4 am... Any critical tips will be appreciated!!

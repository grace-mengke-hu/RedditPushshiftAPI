70 days away from day one

December 26th I was a wreck.  Glued to utubes, websites on how to get through that hell week, detox.  I remember sitting there that week longing to be here.  Two months, ten days and still going strong.  A few urges, they pass so fast you dont even remember five minutes later.  And they are not every day:)  Keep going, keep going, keep going.  Each day is a better day.  It is true.  Feels so good to pass 7/11 each week with no need to go in there.  I did it!

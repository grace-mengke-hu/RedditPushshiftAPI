Does smoking cause acne/ blackheads?

Hi. First of all gratulations to everyone who quit as well. Keep going! 
I struggle with bad skin for like 3 years. Exactly the time i started smoking. But all the people i know who smoke dont have any problems with their skin. So im asking is smoking connected to acne and stuff? Will the skin get better after quitting or is it an unchangeable damage?  

Thank you beforehand:))

I've made a huge mistake

I took some adderall to write an essay and now I am experiencing a craving for a cigarette a hundred times more intense than any I have ever had. I will never take adderall again, at least until cigarettes no longer have a hold on me. Jesus christ this is a nightmare. At least my essay is done.

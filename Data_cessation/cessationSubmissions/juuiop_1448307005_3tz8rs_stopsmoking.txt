48 hours

I've tried NRT last time I quit which lasted about 5 months.
I was on vacation first month. Working is a huge trigger for me. 

This time I'm going cold turkey because I just want to rid my body of nicotine all together. 48 hours smoke-free!!!

I'm using smoke free app (found this forum from one of the "missions" of the app) and love how it tracks time, $NOT spent on cigs and cravings.

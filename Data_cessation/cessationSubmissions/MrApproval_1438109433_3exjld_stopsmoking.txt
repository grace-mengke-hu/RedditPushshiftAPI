It's not much of anything at all but it's a step forward.

Been smoking for about 8 years now (24 years old) and I decided that I was done with cigarettes two days ago. I was walking to the convenient store with some cravings but I continued to fight them as I was walking. My intent was to buy cigarettes because "One more pack can't hurt." But I went in and tried to take my mind off of it by buying some snacks instead. Went up to the counter and almost blurted out that I needed cigarettes. Decided against it. My only regret is that I opted for smokeless tobacco. While I'm ashamed for doing that I'm proud of myself for not getting cigarettes. This tin of chew is fucking unbearable as well. 

I know I can fight the urge to purchase them and that's still going to take time, now I just need to start fighting the cravings. 

Being subscribed to this sub for over 3 years has always been giving me motivation.  Now is my time. I hope other lurkers will follow.

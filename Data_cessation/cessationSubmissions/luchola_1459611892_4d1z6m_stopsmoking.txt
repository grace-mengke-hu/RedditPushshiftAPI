Very drastic shortness of breath after quitting smoking.

I quit smoking 2 days ago and I feel awful. In the last year I have quit like maybe 40 times? and none of those times have I experienced something like that. My chest feels very tight and I feel like I can't fill my lungs with air so I start gasping for it. I can barely talk or walk without shortness of breath getting worse. I was in the ER yesterday and they took blood tests and had a lung X-ray and everything was fine. I really don't know what to do at this point, has anyone else had experience with this? I feel like i'm dying and it's making me so anxious and I start panicking which in turn is making the whole breathing things worse.  
Also it's REALLY ironic that in the last year I kept trying to quit and physically all these quits felt like a breeze, but my mental state always made me suffer, break down and start again. This is the FIRST time where I do not want cigarettes, basically as soon as I snuffed out my last cig I knew then and there I will never see it as something good again. And of course just as I'm finally free something like this happens. I even thought about having a cig IF there's a possibility that a cig will make these symptoms stop.  
I literally can't do anything and I'm so worried. I haven't eaten in two days, even when I try to force myself to eat I feel like I can't breathe and the whole panic cycle starts again, I have never in my life felt so bad. I'd go to the ER again, but I was there just yesterday and like what else could they do anyway?

Resetting my falir

Hi guys. A while ago I posted here saying I'm going to quit, and to be perfectly honest, I failed miserably. I went half a day without smoking, then felt like a slug and decided I can't afford this while having exams. Today, I smoked my next last cigarette and borrowed an e-cig from one of my friends. My plan is to keep smoking the e-cig until my exams end, then slowly kill it off completely. I know some of you guys heavily object the idea of vaping, but I know that I'd just jump back into smoking if I felt like the withdrawals are making my performance worse. On the other hand, I hate cigarettes now. I enjoy 3 a day and still smoke more than a pack. I hate the taste and the smell. The sensation of smoke filling my lungs, nicotine and the little break from everything is the only thing that keeps me going back. I can replace these with a healthier alternative until I am ready to stop this dirty habit completely. Thanks for reading this if you have! Wish me luck!

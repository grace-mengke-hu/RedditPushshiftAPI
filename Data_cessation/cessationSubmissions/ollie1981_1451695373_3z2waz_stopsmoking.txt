Losing my goddamn mind

I'm on day 2 (37 insufferable hours) and I'm losing my fucking mind. This is just as bad as I remember from the last time I tried quitting a couple years ago. I'm either crawling up the walls, uncontrollably sobbing, or filled with homicidal rage, and I can't even begin to do the slightest productive thing. Also having a problem with eating, as I'm starving, but food makes the cravings even more intense. This all sucks so hard right now.

I CANNOT stop eating. What do you do?

For the past two days my appetite has been ravenous. I want to start exercising but it's wayyyy too hot to jog in south tx right now. I've been jogging in place in my apartment, which I realize is nowhere near as good as real running is. Still, I'm wanting to eat every few hours; it's like I never get full.

Do you guys have any coping ideas I could use when I want to stuff my fatass face (which is constantly)?



EDIT: Thanks everyone, I think I survived the binge eating phase -- I hope that's the only one I go through. I did end up eating everything left in my house unfortunately but I went shopping and got apples, carrots, and watermelon. Plus a lot of veg including cauliflower because the texture is really satisfying. The apples are also especially helpful. Thanks again guys, I feel great now!

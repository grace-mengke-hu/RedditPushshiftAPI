Last night..

I was at the bar and ran into my ex boyfriend who I dated for over a year and we smoked the same type of cigarettes. He is the only person so far that has pressured me to smoke again even though I told him I quit. A huge victory for me was that he got me to hold his cigarette for him while he did something and I didn't smoke it. I know you're going to say I need to distance myself or that he's horrible for that, but we were both drunk and I see it as a victory. If I can get through that, I can get through anything.

One week in! Woo!

I made it to one week! Woo! 

A couple questions though, how long are these damn cravings going to keep popping up? Things have been really smooth sailing so far, minus a ton of cravings. 


And did anyone have issues with motion sickness and/or acid reflux before they started smoking, only for it to disappear while you were smoking, and now it's come back with a vengeance when you quit? Or is my body just weird?

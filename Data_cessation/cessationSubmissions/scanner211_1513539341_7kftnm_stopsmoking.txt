Help !

Hi, I'm new to this sub (been here for 2-3 weeks) and it really motivated me to stop this horrible addiction.
So I've never been a chain smoker, I really can't smoke a pack a day, or even half a pack. I've been smoking for the last 2 years, like max 5 cigarretes a day. And I only smoke when I'm in college or having a beer. Hate to smoke in discos. I only really smoke a pack if I'm drunk.
I don't feel like a need it that much, I just like to have a cigarette in certain moments. 
I haven't bought a pack in a month but I've been smoking like 1 or 2 cigarettes when I'm with friends having dinner or walking the dog.  Those are the cigarettes that I really enjoy. It's hard to explain but I hope that someone undestands. 
I wanted advice on how to not have that 1 or 2 cigarettes daily!
Thank you for the motivation redditors ;) !

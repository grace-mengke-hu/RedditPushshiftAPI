Day 4 No cigarettes flu like feeling?

I went from about 7-10 cigarettes a day to a 3mg on a vape that I kinda take it easy on through out the day and then vape a lot when I get home. For some reason I am having a fever and some flu like symptoms but I don't think it is the flu. Anyone have these issues before?

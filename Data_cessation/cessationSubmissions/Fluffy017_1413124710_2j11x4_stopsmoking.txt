[Need Advice] 2 weeks in! Experiencing odd withdrawal symptoms

So usually when I get this far into quitting, I begin using adverse reactions/withdrawals. I'm still vaping (6mg nic liquid), but a few notes:

- I'm dreaming of smoking. Like, VIVIDLY. And in these dreams I'll get halfway through it, only to throw it out in disgust. I'm going to talk with my therapist about it (since I already deal with PTSD and chronic depression) because it just doesn't seem normal to subconsciously dream about something I have no desire to go back to.

- Physical issues. I'm getting sporadic joint pain throughout the day (not sure if it's related to quitting), and my acne has actually gotten worse. I'm also coughing up a LOT of phlegm, which is normal for me when I go through these withdrawals, but I'm beginning to wonder when I won't be coughing this crap up anymore.

Overall though, I'm happy I've made it this far, and plan to celebrate my 1 month with some friends over Halloween weekend. Enjoy your Sunday and stay strong, guys and gals <3

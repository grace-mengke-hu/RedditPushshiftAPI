Bioresonance therapy

Sorry if this was discussed before but I could not find anything related. 

I've been smoking for nearly 27 years, on average 1.5 pack/day. I've tried pills, patches, and some other methods. The max i managed was around 3 months.

I have an appointment soon for bioresonance therapy. A friend has quit after this, and now I will give it a try.

What are your thoughts on this method? Any experience?

Also, wish me luck :)

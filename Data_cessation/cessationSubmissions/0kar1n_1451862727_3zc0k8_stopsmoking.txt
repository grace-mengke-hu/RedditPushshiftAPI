Weed helps

Sorry for the blunt post. It really does though, get yourself a nice big bong and hit it when you feel stressed (twice a day, two hits each time was the magic combination for me), after about 2 weeks start to taper off smoking weed slowly. No withdrawal symptoms. No agonizing mental anguish.

Don't do the above if you have suicidal tendencies or a history of mental health issues or if you're pregnant and you don't want to give birth to something that enjoys the music of Flava Flav

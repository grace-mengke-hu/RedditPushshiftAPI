1 week end, this is hell. I can barely function.

Smoked for the better part of 10 years, I quit 1 week ago and I feel extremely exhausted these last few days.  I am so tired and unmotivated its starting to cause issues with my relationships and work. I have been sleeping 10+ hours over the weekend...  I am so lost, I don't know what to do.  I want to tell my boss my sudden change is likely because I quit smoking but I feel like they would just think I am making excuses. My boss is the type of guy that doesnt think Depression exists, and if your depressed your just being a pussy and need to man up.  He just doesnt get it... 

I don't even crave cigarettes anymore, I crave ENERGY! Has anyone else felt like this?ï»¿

**Edit**

Shortly after I posted this I came down with a 102 Fever.  I just find it strange that I have been otherwise okay for the last few days just weak and tired and then boom fever all of the sudden.

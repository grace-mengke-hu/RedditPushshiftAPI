Major stresser testing me.

I am pretty stressed.

My son's mother and I have a custody agreement signed by a judge.  We have 50/50 custody and everything is outlined, including a rotating cycle for claiming our son on taxes.

I get a letter a couple months ago from the Minnesota IRS stating that his mother also claimed him (this is my year to claim) and we are both being audited.

I sent in the court ordered agreement saying it was my year to claim.

I get a letter yesterday saying I owe $1,400 because my claim is being taken away.  I called the IRS rep and she said that even though the court order said it was my year to claim, his mother wrote in claiming that she had him for 207 days and I only had him for 156 days.  

The IRS took her unsubstantiated claim over a judge signed court order.  I am going to appeal this but what the hell?

I know a cigarette will not fix this nor will it make me feel any better.  But damn do I want one.

**TL;DR The IRS is screwing me over and trying to make me pay money.**

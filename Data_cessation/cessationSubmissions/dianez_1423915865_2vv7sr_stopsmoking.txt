First thing in the morning

I know it hasn't been that long since I quit (2 weeks ago), but it is still the first thing that crosses my mind when I wake up. And not in a good way "Hey, I've made it, I'm still smoke free" but "Oh oh, I don't smoke any more. Now what?". The last 3 mornings were really miserable because of this and the weird part is I know I don't want to go back. I am very determined, I've done my reading, I know my reasons, I changed my philosophy to "I want to be able to enjoy life without harming myself", I know smoking doesn't make anything better (unless you are addicted to nicotine - and by now I am not). Is it still too early to not think about it? Or to not be miserable sometimes about it?

I quit a week ago on this day [my first week]

I smoked for about 6 years now. About 5-6 a day. I picked it up because it looked cool, kinda stuck with it because I had nothing better to do in breaktimes, and once I realised I really (fucking really) needed my early morning smoke, I knew something was wrong.  Not only that, I started to have issues with my hands, they were cold all the time, so cold I couldn't even move my ring finger once in a while. It started to interfere with my work. I am sitting on a pc daily, I am a graphics designer, and it really fucks with me. I couldn't bear it anymore.


What really helped me was this one tip: you make out one day in the next week, and you mentally prepare all week to stop that day. and I did.


So I stopped now, what about the social aspect of it. I was worried my friends (most smokers) would make a fool of me. Once we were outside and all lit their smokes, I told them I quit. Preparing for the humiliation possible from  20+ yo young adults, I realised that most of my friends really struggled to quit, they told me about their plans to quit in the future, having similar issues as me.  It really opened my eyes. It felt good.

Just passing the time

Yesterday I woke up and decided to see how long I could go without one. Now here I am 24 hours later. 

I keep wanting to grab one purely out of habit, like if I eat or I’m about to do something it’s so automatic.

But I made it 4 hours and then I was like well, no point in having one now or all that will have been for nothing. Same thought at 8 hours, then 12. There is NO point in having one once you’ve started your quit. It would be like trying to climb Everest and jumping off every time you made progress. Extremely inefficient climb if you ask me. You’ll have to keep treading through the same treachery you had previously fought- how needless! How exhausting!

The thought of having to start all over again is the only thing that’s kept me clean so far. If I fail I know I have to try again, because I’m doing this due to a health scare. Now I finally HAVE to quit. Why start all the way over after you’ve made it through the worst parts? If this has to be done I’m going to get this over with as quickly as possible!

You’ve just gotta let the time pass. It’s going to take TIME to no longer have cravings. So you may feel horrible in the moment, want to change how you feel by giving in. But distract yourself for a few minutes and the time will pass all the same. The time will pass equally whether you do the right thing or not. It will require the same amount of time, you only control how often you keep resetting that timer. LET IT RUN! The minutes are ticking by towards freedom- LET THEM PASS! You’re moving FORWARD towards a time where your cravings are fewer and weaker- you cannot avoid this discomfort, you are only postponing it! Let time do it’s thing while you keep doing yours.

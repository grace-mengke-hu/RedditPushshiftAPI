I screwed up.

As you can see by my badge, I went 100 days without smoking.

Well, I've started again it seems. I'm 4 cigarettes into it again. I could stop now, but I feel like it will probably lead to more cigarettes.

I'm so disappointed. I was going to the gym, I was doing better. Things were improving, and so was my health.

I'm really sad and disappointed right now. I started thinking about my ex again and became super depressed, and that's when I caved in.

going on 10 years or so

Never browse this sub but saw it and realized it's been nearly 10 years no cigs.  Sure I smoked herb a few times here and there, but with no real frequency.  

I was waiting tables back then and we could only get breaks if we smoked, so I smoked.  I remember the week i quit, the first 5 days sucked, felt like a hand gripping my brain, then around day 6-7 time just slowed down and I finally felt clean.  If you can get to that point it's pretty eye opening.   For those out there in their first few days, grab a glass of water and some gum.   It's worth it.  Give it a week and you'll be amazed.

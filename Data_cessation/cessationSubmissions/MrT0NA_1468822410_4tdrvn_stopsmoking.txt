Doing great but scared of relapse

After being a half pack/more a day smoker and smoking for 14 years, Im  proud to say it's been a month and 12 days. How ever I feel the thing I miss most is the habit, not the actual nicotine. I was thinking of getting a vape with no nicotine juice to use when I drink. I think I miss the oral fixation the most. Anyone have and luck or try this? Thoughts? Thanks  in advance.

I just can't let go

I read Allen Carr's book and understand the psychology behind it but I simply cannot make it register in my brain. Every time I get a craving, I remind myself that it's my body returning to normal and that it was only the last cigarette that makes me feel this awful. But I just want to keep smoking and I just lit one up. Any words of advice?

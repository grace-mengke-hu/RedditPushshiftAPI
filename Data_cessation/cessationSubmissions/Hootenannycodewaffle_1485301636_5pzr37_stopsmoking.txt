Quitting tomorrow!

I have had tomorrow as my quit date for 2 weeks. I've been smoking for 12 years. I quit twice before due to pregnancy and meant both times to remain a non-smoker afterwards. But clearly that didn't happen. So, tomorrow I'm quitting smoking for me. Not because I am pregnant and not because I can't afford it. Simply because I want to be healthier and happier and not smelly. Any words of encouragement or ideas to help me not want to kill people will be greatly appreciated! Wish me luck!!

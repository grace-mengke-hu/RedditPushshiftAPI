Pls. help me make my wife quit smoking...

Hi,    
I'm turning to this sub-reddit for help. She has been smoking for a decade   and is currently 31. It has been between 10 sticks - a pack / day and I'm worried for her.     
What can I do to help her quit? She's ready to take Champix but the sideeffects seem scary....     
Thanks!

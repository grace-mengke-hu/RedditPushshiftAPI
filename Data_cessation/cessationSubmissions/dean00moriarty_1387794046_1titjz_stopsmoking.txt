Cigarettes have been my outlet

When I started smoking, nine years ago it became an immediate outlet for me at a time when I was going through a lot emotionally. I was quitting a vast amount of drugs cold turkey and the cigarettes kept me grounded. If the withdrawal was too much and my emotions were running wild and making me deluded, a cigarette would be a quick way to resolve the issue.

It has been over two weeks since I smoked my last cigarette but im feeling some of the ways I used to feel: paranoid, withdrawan, insecure. It is affecting my ability to enjoy life. I'm dreaming up scenarios I know not to be true in my relationship, I can't focus at work...

I'm spending just as much money on e cigarettes which do nothing for me, so right now I am failing to see the advantages. Cigarettes have always taken away that glossy, affected view of the world and its perceived hostility.  Now I am desperate for another outlet--a means to externalize or deal with my sometimes delusional insecurities.

I will not: see a shrink, get on psychiatric medication, do yoga, listen to a catch-all advice about mental health. I am an active, functioning member of society--totally rehabilitated but going through an adjustment period. Please advise!

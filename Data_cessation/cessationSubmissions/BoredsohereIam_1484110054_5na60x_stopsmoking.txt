Reading Allen Carrâ€™s Easy Way to Stop Smoking, curious if others felt like I do about it.

I'll start this off by saying I'm still reading it and plan to finish it. I've seen enough people saying it worked for them and even one who offered to pay for a copy for me (found it later for free but just thought that was super cool to offer). 

I have a digital copy, there's quite a few paragraphs that are repeated multiple times. I understand repeating a phrase a few times but it's to the point I'm convinced it's either an error with my copy or there are some serious editing issues. 

The reason I'm posting is while he makes some very valid points and has definitely opened my eyes a bit to the nature of addiction....is it just me or does he sound like a jerk? Can't count how many times he used the word pathetic. Saying ALL smokers hate themselves and have dark thoughts about how much everyone hates them. If you haven't read it, this is coming from a former smoker! Most of what he said had a valid point behind it, but he chose to word some of this in the most insulting way. 

And a few things are just wrong. Saying the less a smoker cough the more tar builds up in their lungs and that's what causes cancer. What? Non smokers are only non smokers by the grace of God? No they didn't pick up that first cigarette. 

He seems to have some solid advice though, and if it's helped you guys there's got to be something to it, but I just can't get past some of this stuff. I plan on re-reading it once I'm done just incase I misinterpreted a few things. Is this just me?

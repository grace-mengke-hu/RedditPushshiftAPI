It Took $11.00 to Finally Quit!

I need to write this, mainly for me to look back on should I get weak.  I want to remember the final straw with myself & cigarettes...

Yesterday morning, I threw away a pack that had about 5 cigarettes left in it.  My plan was to quit.  I'd be in the company of non-smokers all day, so I figured it would help.  My resolve lasted until I got on the road to my Thanksgiving dinner and I impulsively bought a pack.  I panicked.  I freaked.  You know how it goes...

I didn't smoke at the dinner and by the time I went to bed last night, I had about 15 cigarettes left.  I was so angry and frustrated with myself and I flushed the remaining cigarettes.  I realized that between the 2 partial packs, it equaled a full one and I basically flushed $11.00 in American Spirit Light Blues... that got me even angrier!!! 

There is absolutely NO FREAKING WAY I can justify buying another pack!!! NONE!!! I flushed $11.00 down my toilet, for crying out loud! In fact, if I ever think buying another pack is a great idea, I might as well head straight to the bowl with $11.00 and flush!!! 

So there is the final, defining incident that made this 28 year, pack a day smoker throw in the tobacco towel.  If I am going to act like a lunatic over cigarettes, then I know what I need to do.  I am not letting that shit control me any more.

Sorry if this post is hard to follow, withdrawal is making my brain a little loopy and foggy...

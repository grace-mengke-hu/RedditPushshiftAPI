I was wondering if y'all could help me

I quit smoking for a few months, but I had a lot of stress and anxitey hitting me and started up again. I don't know why it's so hard this time. I keep breaking my last cigs but end up asking friends cigs. Then next thing I know I'm buying a pacl as soon as I have enough money to do so. I don't know what I'm looking for. Words of encouragement or something. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel bad every time I buy a pack it's like my mind screams hey you need cigs. I need a daily reminder or something. I want to quit for my family and friends nephews and niece. Sorry for the long post but I'm just feeling like I don't know where else to turn. I don't wanna bug my family theybgor a lot going on. You guys are a great inspiration and I hope to quit smoking like y'all one day. Hope you guys are having a good evening. Take care!

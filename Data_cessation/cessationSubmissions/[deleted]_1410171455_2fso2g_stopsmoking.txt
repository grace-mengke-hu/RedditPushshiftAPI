Again...

Hey, I thought I'd try sharing online this time.
I quit a many times before (like for 3 days, 7 days, 11 days, 15 days, and once 30 days!). I smoke a lot, usually a pack a day. But often its up to 2 packs.
I would continue smoking, since I like it, but sometimes I feel physically terrible for hours if I chainsmoke (which I do if I have cigs), and I get winded easily, so let's quit.
But fuck! shit! if I smoke I can just sit and smoke and chill out for a bit, you can't do that as well if you don't smoke...

Has quitting nicotine led anyone else to quit drinking as well

What I have found is that by not smoking, I also have no desire to have a glass of wine or a beer. To me, the two are so intertwined, I don't feel the need to have the alcohol if I can't have the cigarettes. My best friend quit a year and a half ago and he said it took him quite a while to be able to have drinks without having the overwhelming desire for a smoke. 

I don't know. I guess at this point, I'm okay with giving them both up. Getting a bit older and it seems as if less and less of my friends smoke or drink much anyway.

I feel stupid and angry

3,5 weeks now and cravings are mostly gone.
I feel stupid i smoked. I feel betrayed that I was trapped in an Illusion. I feel angry nobody gives a shit that people willingly kill themselves. We don't stop the arms dealers and we even play the whole thing down. This Society is pure garbage. If you still smoke i want to punch you into the face and scream "Stop it!". Please! Your fears are an Illusion, it's all a lie. Think about the movie "The Matrix". You are trapped inside of it and you are being exploited. Get yourself out of it.

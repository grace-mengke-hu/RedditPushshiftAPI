I've made it a year!!

With a lot of support from you guys and gals I have reached quite a milestone.  I really didn't think I would make it this long based on my previous attempts.  I remember seeing posts like this one when I was only a few days in and feeling both hopeful and overwhelmed.  I went from smoking a pack a day for over 15 years to being completely free of the addiction. Since quitting, I regularly go running and have saved enough money to buy a mountain bike and get back into a hobby that I used to love.  It hasn't always been a piece of cake but it has always been worth the effort.  To all of you who are just starting out or still feeling overwhelmed, I hope that you will stick with it.  It has been one of the best decisions that I've ever made.  It's gonna suck sometimes but stay strong.  A huge thanks to all of the folks on this sub. It has been a huge help to me to read of the struggles, successes, and all of the advice that have been offered up.  Cheers to you all and here's to many more years!

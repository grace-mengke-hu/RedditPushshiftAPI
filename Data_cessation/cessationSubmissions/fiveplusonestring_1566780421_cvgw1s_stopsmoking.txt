Does anyone else have a hobby where there are strong associations with smoking? How did you continue with your hobby and work through the urge to smoke?

My hobby is woodworking and over the years, I have trained my brain to smoke while I do it.  Encounter a problem? Smoke.  Sand something? Smoke. Finish a project? Celebratory smoke...etc.

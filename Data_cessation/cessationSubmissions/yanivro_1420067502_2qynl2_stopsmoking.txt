Had the worst new years eve.

Hey guys , so it's already 2015 and I had the worst new years , I live currently abroad and I couldn't pay for a flight ticket home , so..had to go all alone in -20 too see the celebration , and then drank a beer all alone in the bar , I became one of those people , I hate that time in the year when I can't go back home , but still I didn't smoked , I thought about it for a brief second but I didn't caved , so at least something positive came out from this night.

Stay strong guys!

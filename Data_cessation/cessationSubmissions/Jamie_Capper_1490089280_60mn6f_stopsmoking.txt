9.25am (UK time) I gave up.

I have given up. I am sick of smoking. I thought I was smart just smoking socially for a few months, even posted that on here, I thought I was strong enough to be a 'casual' smoker, but everyone on here is right, there's no such thing. I found myself going out Wed, Thursday, Saturday just so I could socially smoke, when in truth no one I was out with smokes!! How stupid eh. Even more stupid I just had a cry, too. I listened to the Allen Carr hour DVD online and I am hoping I am now free. 

I hate smoking and I do not want to smoke ever again, I would like to be able to go out for a beer without having to go out in the cold every 45 minutes. Every two hours when at work. Yuk.

Sorry for the waffle, I just needed to get how I feel off my chest. 

Good luck to every one of you on your journey, too.

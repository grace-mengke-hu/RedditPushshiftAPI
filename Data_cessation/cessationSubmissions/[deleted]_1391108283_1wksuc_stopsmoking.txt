It is time

Been smoking for four years now and the best I've done before is a couple of weeks cold turkey. I've slowly been smoking fewer cigarettes, not because I've been trying to cut down but because I've been enjoying it less. Lately when I have a cigarette I've smoked half and thrown the rest - it's become just a habit that I apparently can't shake fully. So I'm going for it. I've got some tobacco left. Tomorrow morning on my walk to work I plan to scatter it into the wind (although the bin might be more eco-friendly, if less symbolic).

I hope I can do this, wish me luck!

Edit: If I haven't had a cigarette by this time tomorrow I will come back here and reward myself with a badge.

:-D I Made it 1 week, ya'll!!

Wow! I seriously did not think I could make it a solid 7 days without a cigarette. Day four was hell on earth, though. I had a huge headache and seriously just wanted to poke somebody in the rib-cage super hard! Day 5 was alright, 6 was fine, and 7 was even better! I was even hanging out some smoking friends of mine and was able to decline a cigarette. It felt great. 

Keep up the good work, everyone! You can do it!

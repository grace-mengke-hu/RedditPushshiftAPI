Two weeks and 101 cigarettes not smoked!

Quit cold turkey for the new year after about 10 years of smoking. Still getting regular cravings, especially when stressed, but have managed to beat it so far. We can do this!

Reading everyone else's posts has been a lifesaver. Thank all of you guys for posting, especially people who have quit after 25+ years or people who come back to post after being smoke-free for years. It's a huge inspiration.

EDIT: One question - does anyone have advice for how to beat triggers when you're on the phone? I used to chain smoke when on the phone and that still feels like a habit to me...

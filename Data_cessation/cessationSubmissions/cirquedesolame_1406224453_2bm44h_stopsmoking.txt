Quitting on my 26th Birthday

I heard once that your lungs can regenerate up until your 26th year(ish). Now, as arbitrary as that hearsay might be, I decided to stick with it. I want to believe that I have to quit on my 26th birthday, otherwise I fear I'll never do it. I started smoking when I was 17 and have been at a pack or so a day up to this point. Every year I'd say, well, I have a few more years until I turn 26 and now ...  I turn 26 on monday. The day I always told myself and others that I'd quit is approaching and I'm so nervous. My girlfriend, although she smokes much less than I do, is quitting with me on my birthday. I've got 28 21mg nicotine patches and some tea tree oil sticks. 

All of my friends are supportive of this too, of course, but some of them have even said that it is difficult to imagine me without a cigarette dangling from my mouth. It feels like smoking is part of my identity. How did you guys get over that identity element of it? Any other tips? The clock is ticking...

Thanks in advance!

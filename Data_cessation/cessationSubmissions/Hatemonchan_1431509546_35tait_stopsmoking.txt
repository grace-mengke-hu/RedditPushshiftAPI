28 days in! This is the longest i have been without smokes since i started 6 years ago

Started smoking about 6 years ago (I'm about to turn 23), finally gone and quit, 3rd attempt, this time with a e-cig. Slowly lowering my time on the e-cig until i dont need it anymore. Any tips for using e-cigs to quit?

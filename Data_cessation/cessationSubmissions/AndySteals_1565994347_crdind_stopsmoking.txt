After 2 weeks, I fucked up

So, I just finished the work week. And as I walked out the door I got a real bad craving, I was headed to the Gas station to grab some beers for a game night, and I caved, I got a pack of camels.

I drove back home, and sat in my truck and lot one up and it didn't do it for me. I still had that craving. I don't know what is wrong with me? 

I quit because I was relying on cigarettes to manage stress, but this afternoon I wasn't stressed, I just wanted to smoke, and honestly I still do, but smoking doesn't help. I feel like I'm going crazy.

What advise do y'all have? I want to stop but the penny pincher in me doesn't want to waste the 5 bucks.

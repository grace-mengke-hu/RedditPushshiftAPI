Day 3 coming, it was a very hard quit

Friday I ran out of my lozenges and was determined to quit. I reread some of Allen Carr's book, and tried not to think about how my SOs number was going to a repeated message. We've been together for over 2 years now, so I'm stressed beyond belief. I have their number now, but it hurts thinking about it.

But hey, I'm feeling positive about this quit. Things have a way of working out, so maybe it means something :-)

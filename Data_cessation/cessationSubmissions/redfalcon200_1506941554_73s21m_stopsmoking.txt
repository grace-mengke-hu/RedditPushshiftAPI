Stupid mistake on holiday but moving on anyway

Hello all!
Just putting my thoughts to paper but had stopped smoking for 11 months then got caught up in all this hurricane business whilst on holiday in Florida and picked up a pack of smokes :O 

Smoked for the holiday for which I feel stupid however not picked up or really craved a smoke since I've been back in the UK so not going to be angry at myself just going to carry on smoke free (hopefully!!!)

Anyone else managed to continue okay after a short relapse?

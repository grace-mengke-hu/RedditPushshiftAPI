This is it

I'm 34 and I've been smoking since I was 14. 20 years of smoking a pack a day, and I'm done. I bought a vaporizer to help me transition off the nicotine, and change my habit of holding something between my fingers. I figure if I can go 8 hours with a group of kids and not want to smoke, then I can do this. I literally just put my last one out, and I'm not buying any more. That's it.

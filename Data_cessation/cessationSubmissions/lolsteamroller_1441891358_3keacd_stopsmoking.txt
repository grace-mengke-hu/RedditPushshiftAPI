Tons of relapses, but this feels different

Long story short - 5.25 days in, about 25% of the 3 week period.

Didn't even want to post here early, afraid of getting hyped. I wanted to drop them years ago, I think I woke up each and every day as a non-smoker, but just submitted to cigarettes, like a slave. This time going strong, only got 2 major cravings (both times saw easy and available cigs ready to smoke) - and both times just crushed the tobacco and throw that to burn. 

I used to be miserable, going insane lengths for a fix. The main things I want to say - i feel really free lately, and especially thanks to couple of articles here, which totally reassured me to try and try  and try again. One thing that really helps is the insane amount of gained energy. It's really true, what the Carr tells about it. I used to be tired all the time, and just 5 days in - I'm swimming, getting with the bike up to the hill with no exhaustion, want to do a lot of stuff, and that really pushes me up to limits.

In 5 days, I dreamt about smoking 2 times, and was pretty scared - but waking up knowing you didn't is wonderful.

I'm pretty assured that this is steady progress and there will be no problems, but I've fallen through the trap by smoking casual joint in company of friends. Not sure how to handle that one. That joint has relapsed me 2-3 times already in previous streaks, usually the bummed rolling tobacco in the same day - that's the only problem I see. 

Anyways, thank you dear community for support.

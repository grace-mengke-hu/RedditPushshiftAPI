Quit post

Ok so I started this tobacco habit with dip in high school.  It grew to cigarettes when I was maybe 21 and been off and on until now at 27.  I tried vaping, nrt, reading books like alan carr and I've had maybe 9 months on my most successful attempt.  I'm ready to quit.  I will use this forum more than anything else to lean on other people's experiences, ideas, and build on my own.  Right now I'm probably around 10 cigarettes a day.  I had 2 months cig-free about 2 months ago but started again when I moved to a new country.  Been trying to stop ever since.  That one cigarette thing is so true... so so true.  Anyways, I am happy to kick this off and get back to the version of myself that isn't an addict.

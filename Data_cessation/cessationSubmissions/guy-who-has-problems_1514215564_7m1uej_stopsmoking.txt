49 days (7 weeks and almost 50 days)

7 weeks ago, I just decided to drop the habit.
I had enough.
I didn't want to do it anymore.
Hardest was at the outside bar around tgiving in the middle of week 3. Had the willpower to not give in.

Hardest emotionally was the roller coaster ride around week 3. It was less of a roller coaster actually, just a depressed week.

Now here I am - Let's go!

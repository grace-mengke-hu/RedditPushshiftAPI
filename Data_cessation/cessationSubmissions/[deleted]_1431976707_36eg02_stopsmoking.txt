90 days of vigilance. I can do it.

I have quit smoking before, once for years. I have slipped on and off track several times over the past few years. I am resolved to quit smoking, today. No more excuses. I have done it before. I can do it again. I will be hanging around here to keep my mind straight. I will help where I can. I need 90 days of vigilance. Thanks for having me.

5 Days In, made it through a party without smoking

I was skeptical, since this was entirely outdoors, back yard, pool party. I was the DJ, it was a friend's birthday, so I was there early. Also I didn't really know anyone. So, lots of waiting, awkward waiting, awkward waiting while drinking beer outside, around other smokers.

So, even though my friend (the birthday girl) insisted that she didn't expect me to actively DJ, just put on a playlist with big speakers and lights, I kept myself busy by managing the playlist, and actively DJing if people started dancing. 

Pretty soon the night was over (noise complaint from the neighbors) so I packed it up and went home.

I knew this was going to be the biggest hurdle, and I'm really surprised I made it through.

I think the best advice is to have your girlfriend come to the party and threaten to punch you in the dick if you smoke. That's a big motivator.

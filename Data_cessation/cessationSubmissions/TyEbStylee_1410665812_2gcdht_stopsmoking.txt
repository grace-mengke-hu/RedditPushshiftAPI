I quit at 2pm This Thursday

Because I went out Tuesday night.  And I decided that was my last hoorah.  And I finished my last cigarette at 2pm this Thursday.  And I was fine.  Mostly because I was prepared.  I knew it was coming.  But partially because I was broke.  I had 0 dollars.  Well... I had 12... but it went into the gas tank.  I needed to get to work and back.

But now it's the hard time.  It's the hard time because it's Saturday night.  And I got paid.  And instead of going out and drinking and smoking and playing and maybe getting laid... I'm here.  I'm eating this fucking hamburger helper and watching bullshit on Netflix and ranting to a bunch of fucking strangers on the internet because I can't face that trigger yet.  I can't go out and drink.  Not tonight.

Maybe tomorrow by myself while I watch football in my home so I can baby step the trigger.  The big trigger.  The reason I'm here again.  For the hundredth time.  

I feel so old.  Not in life.  But in this one thing.  I'm fucking 26.  I've wanted to quit for so long.  But I always end up back here.  And if you tell me to read the book I'm going to jump through your fucking computer screen and snap your head off.  

I can't figure out what's going to make this quit stick.  I want it to.  I need it to.  Maybe I'll take up smoking weed or something to replace the ciggies.  I mean... the gym obviously.  And all things healthy.  But I just feel like I need another comparable vice if I'm going to give this a real shot.  I've already got plenty.   The drinking.  The gambling.  The girls.

But... I always go back to the cigarettes.  And I don't want to.  I know I don't.  How do I keep my resolve from fading in the next week.  Or month?  I've never made it longer than 3 months.  I want to do it this time.  I want to be free.  Maybe I'll try the weed thing.  It's legal here you know.

First time as an adult, I can taste so many tastes.

This is really crazy guys. I never ever ever thought that I’ll get this far, but whenever I get a craving I open this sub up and read something and it makes me not want to smoke. 

I am on my fourth day, yesterday was really difficult but it’s better today. I can’t believe I missed out on so many complex and amazing tastes all these years. 

I am also getting dreams in which I am smoking cigarettes like the Marlboro man. 

I love you guys and thanks to whoever decided to make this sub back in the day. And love the smokebot.

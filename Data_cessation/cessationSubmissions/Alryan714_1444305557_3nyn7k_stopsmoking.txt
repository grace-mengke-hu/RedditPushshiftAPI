Just wanted to check in

So I made it. My best friend was here for 2 weeks and I did not smoke at all. I REALLY wanted to the last night he was here and almost broke but he ran out. I found that to just be perfect. I am happy I did not smoke. I would have felt so shitty if I did. I really want to get to a year. Less than 2 weeks till I am at 4 months. I got this!

Final time quiting

Hello, this is going to be the last time I quit smoking. My journey in nicotine dependence started almost 18 years ago. I was cigarette free for two years, but stupidity brought me right back into nicotine's comforting embrace about a year and half ago. Today I quit for good. I'm tired of coughing, food not tasting like it should, the smell on my clothes and in my car. I'm doing it for my daughter and also because I want to run again. I will run that half-marathon on my birthday this year if it kills me.

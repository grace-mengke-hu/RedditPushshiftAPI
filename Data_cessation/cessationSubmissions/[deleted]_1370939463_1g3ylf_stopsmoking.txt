You don't see it coming

At least I didn't. I kept telling myself that "*I wont become addicted*" and "*it's only when I drink*."  Welp, officially quit yesterday and it's obviously been a rough day. Especially when you live with another smoker. I know this is a horribly written post but it just feels good to type it down. Reading through everybody's stories on herr has really helped right now, so thanks internet stangers.

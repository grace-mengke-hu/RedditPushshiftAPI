68 hours

I have had barely any nicotine withdrawal, just having a really hard time getting my brain on board to the whole quitting thing.  I don't know if I'm ready to quit... But know that I should which is making it hard.  I can make myself get past the habitual routine of one after lunch and one on my way home, but I just can't get over not being fully committed and knowing that people fail when they try. Which I use as a scape goat. I caved.. It tasted terrible, then I had 3 more.  Here's to hoping I can get my mind right and make it longer on the next try!
Just saw this on another post.  Haven't watched the whole thing but im starting to get my head right!

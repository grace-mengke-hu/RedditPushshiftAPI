Today's comfort food is lemon meringue pie

Today's comfort food is lemon meringue pie. Probably should be humble pie, for being so dumb as to get hooked again. Well, there it is. So here I go getting through physical withdrawal. My attitude is good, but my brain is tweaking me with little tricks, injecting little shots of sadness to suck me back in. Not me partner. I've got reddit stopsmoking on my side. That and lemon pie. It's summer and everything lemon tastes better. Lemonade, lemon ice tea, lemon meringue pie. A little comfort food to cheer me up.

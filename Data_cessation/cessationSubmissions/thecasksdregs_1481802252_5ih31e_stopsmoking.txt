For those who are having trouble.

For those who are having trouble: There’s a free app called “Quit That!” that tracks how long you’ve quit and how much money you’ve saved over that period of time. Mine tells me I’ve saved almost $10K without coffin nails in my life – that's a lot of vacations abroad. And that’s just the monetary aspect. My life has improved immensely over the past few years.

That said, vulnerable moments occur out of the blue. I have found that the app and rehashing the many benefits of quitting to be helpful in refocusing my perspective during moments of weakness. They don’t ever go away but they do get far less intense and fewer in between. 

Wishing you all the best of luck with your commitments and a joyous holiday season.

Over 2 months and randomly starting dreaming of smoking?!

Obligatory on mobile, formatting may suck.

I stopped smoking cigarettes in December and used a juul til the end of February when I stopped using nicotine completely. I did have about a pack worth of screw ups while drinking in April and felt withdraws. So for that fact alone I’ve been considered myself as actually quitting in April. But the actual habit/routine has been broken since December! I’ve drank to the point of being drunk a few times since April and never once smoked. 

So why for the past two weeks EVERY night I dream I’m smoking. Sometimes I wake up relieved, sometimes I wake up sad that I “can’t” have a cigarette. I don’t like smoking! I don’t like how it makes me smell, how it ruins my breathing, how it makes me unhealthy and will prematurely age me. I have NO reason to want to smoke! Yet I keep waking up depressed and craving a cigarette as if I just quit yesterday. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there some kind of logic to why now?

Day 10 &amp; Struggling

I started smoking earlier this year (after about a year of not smoking) and had my last cigarette the Friday before last. I've been using nicotine lozenges and the Smoke Free app.

I've been struggling with depression really badly all year but doing a bit better the last week or so. Today I am depressed but at work and functioning and I just want to walk to the store and get a pack. I am going to try to power through, but it's so hard. I read recently that nicotine contains serotonin and dopamine which maybe explains why I have the urge to do so when I'm down.

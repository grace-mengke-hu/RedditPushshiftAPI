The healing process

What is the healing process like for you, or what has it been like? I am on day 9 and suddenly I start sneezing a lot, but breathing is already a lot easier (until a few days ago I had a sharp pain on my stomach while breathing, and this is now much better). I can breath in deeper than a few days ago, it just feels like everything is clearing up. It doesn't feel totally clear yet, but many times better than when I started.

I am curious if you feel similar. Also, do you have ways to accelerate this process? I try to get plenty of fresh air, exercise and I eat healthy food. I believe that it is a matter of time, but if there's anything I can do then that would be great.

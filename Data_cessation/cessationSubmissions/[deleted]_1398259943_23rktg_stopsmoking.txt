The morning craving

Ugh! This craving I get in the morning is the absolute worst feeling all day. I'm used to waking up each morning and having a cigarette. Without it, I feel like I'm somewhat missing the best part of my day.

There must be others who have felt this way? Did you replace it with something else? The other day I got myself a Starbucks ice coffee instead of having a smoke. It seemed to help.

Today I was around my smoker friends and didn't give in!

I've tried giving up so many times in the past but I always give in when i'm around my smoker friends. Today I was around them and they were smoking and I FINALLY had the will power to not smoke. It was close, I held it in my hand but I just couldn't light it. This time i'm so serious about not smoking and I'm feeling really good right now. 

We can all do this!

3 months but a bit discouraged

I reached 3 months smoke free! It would feel so much better if I didn't have all these cravings this past month. I don't know why, maybe because the weather is better and I am thinking "How am I going to enjoy the sun and the cold beer and vacation in the summer without smoking?" 

I am not smoking ever again, I just feel discouraged and disappointed that I still have cravings. Some of them are really intense, like I had my last cigarette an hour ago and it is time for my fix. Weird after so many days. 

I even tried acupuncture 4 days ago. Didn't help a bit. I hope I don't have to go through the entire summer feeling like this...

Let's keep not smoking and hopefully not craving!...

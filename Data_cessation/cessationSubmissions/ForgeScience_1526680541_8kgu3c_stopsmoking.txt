Day 5, what an awful week.

I'm deeply unhappy with my life right now, but that wasn't a good enough excuse to keep smoking but between fucking work and my emotional shitstorm of a brain this week has been absolute garbage. I just want to cry when I get home today. I'm not going to start smoking again, but dear god I need things to get better.

Maybe I'll murder my shit\-eating dad if he plays his fucking awful records till 3am again. That sounds fucking lovely.

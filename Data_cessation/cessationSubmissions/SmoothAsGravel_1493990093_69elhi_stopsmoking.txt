Ending this filthy addiction tonight and forever!

After enough attempts to go into the triple digits I'm ending this addiction once and for all by never taking nicotine again. Im sick of being sick all the time. Im sick of the constant asthma attacks the wheezing. Im sick of the lack of confidence and peace of mind i once had. Im sick of always spending the little money I have on the number one killer drug. Im sick of constantly quitting and failing. This time it's different, after all of those countless attempts I have proved to myself that there isnt a single thing in cigarettes I need. They are nothing but an addiction and a lie created by the withdrawal. Im moving onto a better life filled with happiness, peace of mind, self confidence, health, money and most importantly more life to enjoy with the people I love who know I'm no longer slowly committing suicide through drug abuse.

I'm a week in and my mom is making it SO difficult....

My mother lives with me and my husband. She has a ton of health problems and nowhere else to go, so she has been with us for the last 3 and a half years. 

We live in Canada, where cigarettes cost a minimum of $12.50 a pack, and we've been talking about quitting since we moved here.... Several half assed attempts later and this is the furthest that I've ever made it.

My mother, on the other hand, talked a friend into buying her a pack a day or so in, which she made last for several days, but now she won't stop going on about them every time that I'm around.

Not only that but she has been trying to sell some of her stuff in the hopes of getting enough for a pack.

As you guys know, it's hard enough to quit when you only have yourself to worry about.... I really want to do this but she makes it so that the want, the cravings, are constant. When I'm not around her, I can put them out of my mind for a while... Only have cravings here and there but when she's around, she makes it so that it is a constant battle.

I want to do this but I don't know if I can.

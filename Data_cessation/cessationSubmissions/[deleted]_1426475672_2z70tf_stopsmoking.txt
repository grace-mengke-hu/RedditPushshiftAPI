40-some days, feeling pretty rough

Is it normal to feel depressed this far in? I kind of forget what it's like to feel normal. The term is so relative, what is normal? I forget... Don't get me wrong I have good times with my friends and there are still plenty of things I enjoy. It just seems as though everything is just coated with a layer of bitterness. I just don't know anymore. Did I feel like this before I quit? It just seems as though I'm too far in to attribute these feels to smoking. When I look at the grand scheme of things, I'm happy about living a healthier, smoke-free life, but the day-to-day depression is eating away at me. I feel like I'm starting to snap on people again. It's like my anxiety subsided but now I'm just left jaded and apathetic. I don't think this is what y'all wanted to hear but I feel like I just needed to write this down somewhere ; share this with someone. On a positive note, I have no intentions on starting up again. It's been one hell of a ride and I don't ever want to do this again. I'm pretty thankful I found this community, been lurking here since day one. A lot of the stories are so relatable and there's some really good insight that gets thrown around. Since all my friends are smokers, either regulars or socials, this thread has acted as my crutch. Sorry for the novel guys and join me in not smoking today.

bah relapsed

I had three weeks! Then a crisis happened, and I started smoking again without hesitation. I was so disappointed. Also though... I was sick. When I quit, I had a bad head cold, and when I started smoking again it came back with a vengeance, and turned into a nasty sinus infection. 

Anyway, I smoked for about a week, and today is day one again. I am wearing a patch and I actually don't feel all that bad! Or maybe I'm not noticing because I'm sick haha. 

Oh well. My favourite expression is "fall down seven times, get up eight". So that's what I'm doing! Stay strong kids. We can do it!

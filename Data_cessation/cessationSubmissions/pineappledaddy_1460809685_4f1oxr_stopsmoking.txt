19 days in, thank you everyone for helping!

I quit smoking 19 days and 1 hour as of right now, a lot of you suggested that I find something to keep my mind off of smoking. I only had the gym and that only worked for so long, so I took up cooking. 

I know this post is very different than what everyone usually post, but I found a new hobby that I enjoy because of you guys. I just wanted to share some of my favorite things I've cooked since I quit.

Once again I really do appreciate everyone here!!

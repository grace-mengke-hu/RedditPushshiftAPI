You Guys - First Time I'm Drinking In A Month & A Half.... Coming Here Instead of Going On A Walk To The Mini-Mart

You've no idea how bad I want to smoke.  Sitting watching Mad Men ... drinking homebrewed Everclear and orange juice... I'm smashed, watching a show with MAJOR triggers.... and of course all I want to do is smoke.  Smoke.  Smoke.  Smoke.  I was messaging one of my best friends on Facebook (he's still a smoker) - and he made an offhand remark "Just do it."  He's not being an asshole.  Not trying to sell me on smoking again.  He didn't mean it.  But after that... Oh baby.  So I got up.  I washed all the dishes.  I came to post here.  I'm going to brush my teeth and go to bed.  Fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK I want a cigarette.  Fuck.  I want a cigarette.

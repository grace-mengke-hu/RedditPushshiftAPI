My story (quit for 4-5 years now)

I started smoking in 2009 and quit in 2011, back when I in highschool. I was the only person in class that smoked and my fellow classmates would shun me for it. A lot of stuff happened those three years, I quit once in the middle of 2010 for 2 months then relapsed, My first approach was to replace cigarettes with coffee. I'd drink 5 large cups a day. At times I felt my stomach was being squeezed from all the caffeine, but it was worth it. When I relapsed I utterly felt like shit, I didn't give in because of cravings but because of boredom. I used to walk to school and cigs made the walk more enjoyable and frankly I'd have ditched school back then if it wasn't for those lovely morning walks.

In 2011 I was pretty stressed up preparing for college, my academic level in school was down the drain and I wanted that to change in college. I knew what I had to do first, break the habit. So I told my smoking pals I won't be seeing them for a while. What I did next was quit cold turkey! I locked myself in my room for 5 days, I'd only go out for toilet, water and snacks so I'd leave my room about 2-4 times a day... most miserable 5 days in my life... but I managed to get into college and actually function without nicotine.

So my advice to quitters: Keep trying like an ant. Do whatever you can. Be creative in your abstinence methods.

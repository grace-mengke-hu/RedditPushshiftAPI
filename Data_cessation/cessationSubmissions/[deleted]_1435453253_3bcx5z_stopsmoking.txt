It's not easy but it's alot easier if you WANT to quit and stop making excuses.

I'm only 4 days in BUT i've made the decision that I'm never going back and i mean it 100%. I've also stopped drinking for the time being because anything other than complete control of my actions will lead to a smoke. Been using the QuitNow app which, believe it or not, does wonders. It's helped me so much just because i can visualize my progress and have goals to achieve. I paid the 5 bucks to get the pro version because i figure that's the price of the last pack of smokes ever. Give that app a shot and if you're a drinker maybe try to stay away from the bottle for awhile. Good luck!

EDIT: Today is my 4th day, so not a complete 4 days.

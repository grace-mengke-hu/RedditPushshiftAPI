End of day 3, the cravings are getting stronger but I just can't go back

I've smoked for over 5 years of my life.  I'm sure many of you have smoked longer, but that's a long time for something I said I'd never do.  I don't even really like it. I smoked for relief after something stressing but I don't even really feel that de-stressed from smoking.  So I'm done.  At this point and time I can't even justify why I went so long without quitting.  Quitting was simply one of those things I was afraid of, I was afraid that it would be this horrifying experience.  It's not even that bad.  I'm a fairly foggy headed and a little short tempered, but the line "I'm quitting cigarettes" has given me a longer leash to drop snarky comments.  So, I'm actually kind of enjoying the buzz that's accompanied the withdrawals.  This is the longest I've been without a cigarette since I picked it up again 3 years ago.  I don't care how bad the cravings get, I'm not breathing that crap into my lungs any more.  I'm just not going back to that.

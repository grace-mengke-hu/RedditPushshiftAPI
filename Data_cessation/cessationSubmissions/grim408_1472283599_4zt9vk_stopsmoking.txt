2 years 8 months

Hello everyone!  New to the sub!

2 years 8 months ago, on New Years Day, I made a decision to "stop" smoking cigarettes.  It wasn't a new years resolution, it just happened to be New Years day.  There wasn't any specific reason, it was more of a "fck it, lets give it a try."  Cold Turkey!  The reason I say STOP instead of QUIT is because I have been smoking on and off since I was 16 (I am now 33).  It's just that 2 years and 8 months is the longest I have ever went without a cigarette.  If I say I quit and then start up again, then it seems like a failure.  But if I say I stopped, (and maybe it's just to me), and I start up again then it wouldn't be so bad.... More like I took a break without a commitment.  The thing is I don't want to start up again.  But everyday since the day I stopped I have had strong cravings for a smoke.  None like that past few weeks, though.  I know after 2 plus years it may seem like it would be easy to continue NOT smoking....but it's not.  I don't know why all of a sudden I have such strong cravings.  I see people smoking and I want a cigarette.  i watch movies or TV shows where characters are smoking cigarettes, and I want one.  Anytime I drink I want one.  There is nothing stopping me from buying a pack of smokes.  I didn't make any commitment to anyone that I would quit smoking.  This was just a random choice.

It's so conflicting to want a smoke and yet equally not want one.

Thanks for letting me vent /r/stopsmoking!

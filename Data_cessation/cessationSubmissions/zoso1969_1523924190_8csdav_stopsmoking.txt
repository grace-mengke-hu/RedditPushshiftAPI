2 weeks today, using NRT lozenges


Still feeling very spastic, but very much in control. Able to ride the waves, and hit the triggers of first thing in the morning, and when getting in my vehicle. I notice I'm better at work when I fight through the need to walk outside on my break. Smell is better. Taste is better.  Cough is still happening, but I'm not spitting phlegm. Glad spring is here because I can get outside and walk the dogs. After work is still a big trigger, but it's one day at a time 👍

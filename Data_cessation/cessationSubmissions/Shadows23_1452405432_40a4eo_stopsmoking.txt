I feel pretty bad, I just messed up a four day streak.

Im trying to put this failure in perspective as i only smoked one cigarette in four days, but i feel pretty low for breaking the streak. I went three days without smoking on the patch and one day not smoking without the patch then went and messed up! I hope im stronger the next five days.

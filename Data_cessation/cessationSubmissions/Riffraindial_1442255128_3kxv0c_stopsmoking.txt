Feeling desperate

I need to quit. I can feel it killing me slowly I just can't make it past a day or two. Something happens and I just cave. Then I feel bad about myself. I've tried listing all the reasons I want to quit. Tried picturing my beautiful daughter at my funeral all kinds of stuff. The craving is so intense. It feels like being possessed. I am driven to smoke even though. I don't want too. Can someone explain badges and flair to me? Maybe something like that would help?

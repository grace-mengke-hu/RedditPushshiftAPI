I bought some nicotine adhesives

I just bought some nicotine adhesives and I'll start using tomorrow. They say there is a plan to stop smoking.

The first 6 weeks I'll use a 21mg adhesives.  
Then for 2 weeks I'll use a 14mg adhesives.  
The final phase is 2 weeks using a 7mg adhesives.  

At the end of each week I'll report here my progress (if it is okay).

I tried stop smoking at my own, didn't worked.

Also, I'll start doing gym next week :)

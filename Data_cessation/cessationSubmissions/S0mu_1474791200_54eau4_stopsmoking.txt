I'm trying to quit smoking using NRT. But I don't feel anything while using the nicotine gum!

So, I've recently tried to quit smoking after falling off the wagon yet again. I tried using NRT in the form of nicotine gum. I'm using Nicotex 2mg gums, and using it in the prescribed method. I'm supposed to chew till I feel tingling and then park it. However, when I try the gum, I don't feel any tingling, just the mint flavour of the gum. Is that how it's supposed to be? 

Nicotex is an esteemed brand in India (where I'm from) and many swear by it's efficacy. So I'm sure the gums are legit. Am I supposed to chew till I feel the flavour(mint) release and then park the gum?

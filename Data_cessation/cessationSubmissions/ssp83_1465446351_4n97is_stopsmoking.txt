I went to the store twice and didnt buy cigarettes

So this morning i had my last smoke. I tried to quit before, but I know I can do it this time. I stopped by a gas station on my way back to work during lunch, parked and  I said NO. I dont even think i turned the car off. I just coasted into the spot, stopped, said no and put it in reverse and went on my merry way. Sorry if Im blabbing, but it feels good. This afternoon I got the urge again, i made it into the 7-11 and ended up just buying a bottled water and gum. Its hard and it feels harder this time around.

I quit smoking yesterday. Thank you for the support

I had a weird epiphany yesterday. Every time I smoke it is always case of this will be my last pack. I feel bad as I stink and I just slouch as soon as I come home. I picked up this habit three years ago due to a roommate.
My idea is sometimes it is not good to be rational. Just grow up a pair and commit to it. Even my smoking buddies see the pitfalls of smoking as it tremendously affects our health. I couldn't play soccer as I used to.

I have a vape just in case so that I don't slip back and I'm going to order a fuckton of gums. Thank you r/smoking. Count me in on this journey.

Obligatory apologies for typos. English isn't my first language.

Stay strong!

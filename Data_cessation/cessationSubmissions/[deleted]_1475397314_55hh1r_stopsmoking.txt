Bad day

Today was pretty a pretty bad day. Full of stress and crying (I'm a dude) and just want a cigarette. The only thing that's stopping me from having one is the fact that I love watching the days on my badge go up, all the money I've saved and how my health is improving. But god damn do I want one...

Stay strong friends.

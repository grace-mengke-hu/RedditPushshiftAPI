Just wanted to say thanks

17 year old here. I have asthma. And yes, it's something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The coughing fits at night are frustrating as hell. Normal colds are also amplified for me because of it. Makes me feel like death. Thankfully I've only been hospitalized for it once, and that was years ago. Almost died. Seriously. Thank you to everyone here. You have no idea how much people like me suffer at the hands of second-hand smoke.

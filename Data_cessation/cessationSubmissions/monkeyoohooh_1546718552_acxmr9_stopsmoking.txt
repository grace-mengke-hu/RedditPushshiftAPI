Day 5 - my mother died of lung cancer

And still I kept smoking.  My husband was so disappointed that I picked it back up after each kid.  But caring for your dying mom and a 1yr old  was stressful and I promised myself I would stop.  Then caring for 2 under 2 was stressful and I told myself I would stop when they were out of diapers.  My mom was only 59 when she died.  She was a 20yr smoker and quit when she was 40.  I was a 20 year smoker and quit when I was 41.  Her mother died at 48 from smoking - when my brother was only 1.  I hope I don't make this story a 3-peat.  The cravings I think I can handle.  It's the guilt and shame that may do me in.  Day 5!!!

Can't buy cigarettes if you blow your paycheck on retail therapy...

I've never been so thankful to have overspent. I was not prepared for this quit. I got pneumonia and I'm still dealing with traces of it so quitting was the natural order of things.

But I've quit so many times before that none of it is exciting anymore. I low level crave constantly. I can't exercise right now because of my cough and breathing issues, which is my usual go-to replacement. Low impact exercise like walking is actually a trigger for me. The good news is that I can't smoke either because of it, so there's that.

But I also blew my whole check this weekend except for my share of the rent. Some went to pay for the doctor and antibiotics but an embarrassing amount of money went on impulse buys and eating out.

I'm also on a steroid for this infection and it's adding to my sleeping and restlessness issues.

But nothing would be worse than buying a pack of cigarettes right now.

Is this the smoker's version of rock bottom? Haha.

Tldr; shitty life pro tip: go on a spending spree to ensure that you can't buy a pack to remain quit

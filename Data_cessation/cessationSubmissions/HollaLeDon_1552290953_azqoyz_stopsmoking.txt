It's been a year since I smoked the last one

(sorry for my english, not my language)  
So, here it is   


After 8 years of intensive smoking, last year, on 11/03/2018, I told myself that it was enough. I simply knew that I couldn't  link my happiness with that temporary pleasure of smoking, that was also an illusion. I stopped drastically : no e-cigarettes, not any form of extra-nicotine and without replacing it by any other addiction. I truly believe that stopping " gradually" is absolute bullshit, and if you want to stop, a drastic change is necessary.   


Never understimate your willpower, sending hope and strenght to all of you

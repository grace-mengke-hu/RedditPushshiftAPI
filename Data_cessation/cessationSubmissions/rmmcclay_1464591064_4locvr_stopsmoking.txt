Had A Smoking Dream -- Over 500 Days In

In the dream, I wasn't actually smoking but I was hold an open pack with only 6 smokes left.  I thought, "damn it, why did I smoke all those cigarettes?  I thought I quit!"  Then I lamented that I had smoked them and thought about letting people and myself down.  Was so happy to wake from that dream!  I haven't had a smoking dream for months. 

What might've triggered it is that I was at a rooftop party and was chatting with a young fellow from France who was smoking away.  There was a fresh pack of Marlboros, an ashtray, and a lighter.  Gah.  It was a bit tempting.  But nope.

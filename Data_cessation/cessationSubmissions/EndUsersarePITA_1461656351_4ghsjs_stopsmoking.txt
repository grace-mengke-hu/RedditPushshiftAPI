Wasted 1256 days

Alright guys, I messed up. I went on an all boys 4 day holiday to Bangkok and it was smoking and drinking all the way. I'm going to reset my badge now. 

Its currently day 2 of non smoking and its harder than I remember. But fuck it, I will push through. Just remember guys, be on guard even when on holiday

Edit : Thanks guys for all the kind words. You guys make things much better. Badge is reset and off we go for life this time.

So tired of failing, I'm doing it this time.

 Every time I try and quit I come back to saying "I'll just have one or two while I'm drinking", and every fuc**ng time I get right back on them. Not this time. I'm feeling so confident, also Allen Carr's book is far better than I had imagined. I cannot recommend it enough for putting things into perspective. Any ways, day 1 is in the books, come on 1 week!!!

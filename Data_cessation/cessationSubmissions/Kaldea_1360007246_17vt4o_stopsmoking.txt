If not for you (part 2)

A few weeks back I posted my immense gratitude to this subreddit for it's support and inspiration to keep me going strong during some incredibly tough times. I wanted to give an update to any of those who wanted to know.

This time a month ago I was afraid I was about to be evicted due to a mass pile of late fees from a messy fall with an ex. I had an issue with my college preventing me from taking classes, I had health issues, I had just a pile of stress on my shoulders, but I stayed strong and didn't give in. 

Here I am at 45 days and I am completely uninterested in smoking, being around smokers, anything. I HATE that I used to do that! I can't believe I used to smell like that and be so addicted to it. I got through the worst of it because of YOU guys. I only had myself in mind when I quit but now I have this amazing future in front of me that I'm ready to enjoy without the reliance of nicotene. I am so proud and thankful of all of you. 

**Thank you so god damn much!**

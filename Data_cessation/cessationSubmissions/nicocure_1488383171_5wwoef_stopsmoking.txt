2 weeks in :)

It's been two weeks since I stopped smoking cold turkey and I'm doing pretty well. It's nice to wake up every morning, be able to take deep breaths and not have to get out in the cold for a smoke (or worry that I'll run out of cigarettes in the evening). I bought some teeth whitening strips to try to get back whiter teeth. My facial skin looks a bit healthier. I still think about smoking often but don't miss being a smoker. This is my first quit attempt and I hope, my last. Good luck everyone!

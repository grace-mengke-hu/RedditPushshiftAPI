Is building down an option?

I always told myself I’d quit smoking after university but I don’t feel like waiting that long anymore. I want to smell, taste and being able to breath again, though I don’t want to quit smoking entirely. I want to narrow it back down to those 2/3 sweet moments a day.

I’m almost 1 day in and i feel sick. I’ve smoked 2 sigs and they tasted terribly somehow. I used to smoke a pack a day for the last 6 years.

I’ve always been told to stop entirely. Is my goal achievable? Does anyone have experience?

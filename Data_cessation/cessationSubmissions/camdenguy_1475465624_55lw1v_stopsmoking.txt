feeling low

I'm feeling quite low about the [irreversible damage](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/177ib0/what_happens_to_the_deposit_of_tar_and_other/c8376uj) I've done to my lungs. There is of course a little voice saying "sod it might as well smoke, it's too late to recover" and I'm finding it hard to ignore it.

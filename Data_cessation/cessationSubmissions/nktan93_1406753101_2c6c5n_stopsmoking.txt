1 month, 8 days, 16 hours, 41 minutes and counting

...and my body feels pretty great. It's insane how much more energy I have: how much more I can do at the gym, how much more alert I feel at work, how much more focus I can dedicate to actually living life instead of constantly waiting for the next cigarette. At the same time there isn't a day that goes by where i don't crave taking another drag, where i don't try to rationalize and convince myself that i might be able to smoke in "moderation" (we all know how well that works), where i don't pass a smoker on the street and close my eyes and inhale as much as I can. Gotta stay strong!!! fuck you nicotine!!

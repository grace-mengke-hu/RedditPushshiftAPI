Why do smoke anymore?

My life feels like one cigarette to the next. Every cigarette makes me feel better but it also makes me feel worse.  I've "quit" many times, but whenever I throw away the last cigarette, it creates an emptiness, like I'm saying goodbye to an old friend. My father is a lung doctor. I know he feels betrayed. Sometimes when I'm in the other room, I hear my mother say "Where's coffee_34? Smoking?" My girlfriend won't kiss me except a little peck.

I feel like it's never going away. Even when I've quit before for several months, my father still asks if I'm smoking.

But fuck it. Fuck all of that. This time, I'm quitting for me.

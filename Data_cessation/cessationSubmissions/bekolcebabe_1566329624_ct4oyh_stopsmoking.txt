I wanted to smoke so so so badly today-but I didnâ€™t! Just kept telling myself it wonâ€™t take the stress away, donâ€™t let the monster get itâ€™s claws back in you after nearly 17 days free-the craving will pass, stay ðŸ’ª-&amp; I won the battle ! Very proud of myself,&amp; really happy! Now for some chocolate ðŸ˜‚

Will quitting smoking help me study better for exams?

It’s exam season and I’m revising a lot. I tend to get really stressed and anxious, and smoking is the only thing that can calm me down. But if it is hindering my ability to study, then I’m willing to stop.

So, I’m wondering whether quitting smoking will actually improve my memory, cognition and focus?

Closing out the week.

This is day 7 for me cold turkey. So far I've slayed the triggers of waking up, finishing a meal, commuting to work, finishing a long shopping errand, boredom, bickering children, working from home, annoyance at the husband, hanky panky, drinking and a hold em' tourney. 

It's been rough at times, but I have to say the week went on much like every other- I just wasn't poisoning myself anymore. 

Looking forward to week two and more triggers slayed.

It's different for everyone

I've been struggling with something for awhile now until I had a realization. Actually I think most people who come here know this and I'm probably being Captain Obvious stating this lol.  
I've been coming here for a few months and I love reading about everyones experiences and I absolutely love how supportive people are in here!  
But sometimes there are certain posts or comments that just were so awful for me. Like someone making a post and talking how they've been quit for a year or years and they list all these wonderful things that this has brought along. But then they end the post with saying how they still miss smoking/have to fight some cravings. Or people sometimes making comments where they point out how they had cravings for WEEKS and MONTHS and imply that they had to struggle and fight with that. Oh man. Every single time I read something like that I felt like someone just punched me in the stomach. Even if I was in the middle of one of my 'quit attempts' and felt pretty confident and happy I immediately got an urge to run to the store and get a pack.   Because these posts and comments scared the flip out of me and made me feel like this is how it's going to be for me. I'm going to have to keep fighting and craving and suffering, maybe even YEARS later.  
Until I realized that just because these people have had this experience does not mean that I will! Because it IS different for everyone. Yes there are people who still feel like they are missing something in certain situations even years later, but that doesn't mean that it will happen to *me* or *you*.  
Idk I just thought that it's something to point out even if it's something very obvious lol.

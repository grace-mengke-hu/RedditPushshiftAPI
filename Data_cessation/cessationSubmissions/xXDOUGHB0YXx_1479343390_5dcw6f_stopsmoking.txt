Quit Day on Monday/using Chantix

Hi all.  I'm on day 4 of Chantix, and down from half to 3/4 pack a day to just 5 cigarettes per day.  

Monday Is the big day.  I'm a bit nervous, as I've been smoking for a little over 20 years and have failed multiple attempts, both cold turkey and using Wellbutrin and nicotine replacement therapy.

Can anyone that has used Chantix share their experiences with me?  I get how it "works."  I am wondering how it made you feel.  Did you just stop craving, or was it at Least less severe?

I look forward to hearing your experiences and thoughts!

I don't know how to ask for support

I bought Allen Carr's book two days ago and tried to quit yesterday. At first it was going really well, and I felt confident that I would be able to talk myself out of smoking. All my previous attempts at quitting had lasted minutes, so I was feeling great about going 4 hours. 

Then I went to my boyfriend's place after dinner, and I just fell apart. I was already missing my post-meal smoke, so I felt like I needed to be mentally repeating things like "I don't need a cigarette", but meanwhile, he was trying to tell me about his day and I just felt horrible that I kept tuning him out because I couldn't focus on anything except that I wasn't smoking. I explained what was going on, and he was very understanding, but I still felt awful about it and after about an hour, I caved and bought a pack of cigarettes. After I smoked one, I went to another room and just started sobbing.

I don't know what to ask him to do to be supportive. He was sympathetic, but he clearly felt unsure of what would help and honestly, I don't know either. I feel incredibly self-conscious and isolated. I kept trying to talk to him about it, but I would just wind up crying, and that made me feel worse because I wasn't expecting to get so emotional. I decided to call the day a failure and try again later. 

I do want to try again--today, even--but I'm worried I'll fail again because I don't know how to react in that situation or even what I would want from him. I don't want him to just not talk to me so I can keep a mantra going, but I felt like I was horrible to be around. 

So I'm wondering--how do I talk to him about this? What can I ask him to do or explain to him to make myself feel less isolated? And if it's inevitable that I'm going to be a downer for a while, how can we both deal with that?

Day one

Been smoking since I was 15, am 20 now turning 21 this July. I always told myself I'd quit once I came to University, but here I am at the end of my third year and still having trouble... I've tried patches, gum, cold turkey, and I have not been successful. I've posted to this sub many times, unsubscribed due to the guilt I've felt seeing posts from here after I've failed, but as they say "never quit quitting" so here I am back on day one.

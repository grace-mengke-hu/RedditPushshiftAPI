Did you have insomnia when you quit and how long did that last?

I have been having trouble sleeping all week. I'm on Day 7. But I did relapse on day 4 or so and had a few after drinking (realized I need to just cut out drinking for the time being). But my sleep schedule is totally out of wack and I didn't sleep a wink last night. Just considering staying awake so I can get some sleep tonight. 

Did this happen to you and how long did it last?

First nicotine-free day

1 day and 17 hours had passed since my last cigarette.
I always think how stupid i was to smoke for 2 years. Quitting cold turkey was the best decision of my 2019 and everything feels amazing.
On the other side i have to admit i feel a bit "weaker" physically speaking, almost at the point of feeling sick (temperature, big lymph nodes, coughing)

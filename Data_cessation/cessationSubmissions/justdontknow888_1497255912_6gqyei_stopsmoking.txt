Nothing seems to help

When I try and quit no NRTs seem to help. I have nearly used all the NRTs available and today I'm starting the Nicorette QuickMist to see how it is. I seem to just enjoy the action of smoking. Keeps me from napping during the day when I'm not at work and makes time go that little bit quicker. 

But now that I'm married and moved out of my parents where I lived a cushy life I can not afford to smoke. I have cut down as I'm now not allow to smoke in the new house. But I just cant seem to quit. 

Today I hope is the start of my journey where I will be cutting several "habit" smokes out of my day. I'm in work and left the cigarettes at home, brought my QuickMist and so far so good. But I'm not sure if I will just make up for the smokes missed during work later when I get home. Is there anything I can do that will distract me while at home outside of cleaning and cooking and watching TV I think a lot of my smoke breaks are out of boredom?

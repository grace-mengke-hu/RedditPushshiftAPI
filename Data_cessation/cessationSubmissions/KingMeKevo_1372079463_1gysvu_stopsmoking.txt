2 Weeks in

Hey guys,

I set a date about a month ago to quit the monday after my friends wedding and I came through with it. I quit 2 sundays ago now! I wanted to make a post earlier but wanted to make sure I got through at least a week before doing so. Amazing how I can be around it this time around and it rarely bothers me. 

I still get winded during my workouts but its takes a good amount of running to start losing my breathe, and when I weightlift I usually do around 5-6 excercises and I used to be winded by the 2nd now I'm never winded! I start C25K this week to get my cardio up even more.

I had a pretty big test this weekend when I went to the Jersey Shore for the weekend. My one friend said I asked for one in my drunken stupor but he knew what was up and told me he already gave me one and I simply replied "Okay"

It's been a lot better though lately!
Keep it up; and if you are thinking about not smoking, it's literally 3 days of hell and then it's just a coast with less and less thoughts about it as you go further. 

Thanks!

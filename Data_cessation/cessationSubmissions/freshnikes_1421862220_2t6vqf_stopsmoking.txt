Today's the the day! I've been lurking this sub since the beginning of January, when I decided that I'm finally ready to get serious about kicking this nasty habit, and I'm proud to say that it's go time!

I'm ready to get healthy, ready to save some money, ready to smell nice, to taste good food, to shave some seconds off my minutes per mile (I started running a few months ago, too!), I'm ready for all of it.

The community here looks incredibly inspiring, and you wonderful folks have pushed me over the edge. Can't wait to share this journey with everybody!

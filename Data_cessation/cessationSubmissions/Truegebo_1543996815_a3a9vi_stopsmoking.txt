One Week and a Half. Feels weird but proud

Hello everyone,

I stopped smoking one week and a half ago. Even if I still don't feel *free* of this s***, i feel proud to have achieve this. 

Since I stopped, my chest hurts a lot but I think this is normal. 

Yesterday i had a really bad day and I didn't smoke. Also this week end I ve been drunk and no smoke for me. 

Just wanted to share it.

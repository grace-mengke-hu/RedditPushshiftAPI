Day 3 and drinking is different...

So i’m happily quitting at the moment, it’s been a long time coming and i’m noticing the positives already of dropping the "evil weed" as old mate Allen Carr calls it. 

Last night I drank for the first time, just a few glasses of wine, and I noticed I got drunk a hell of a lot faster than usual. Or at least the affects of alcohol were far more prominent. I can usually drink to a pretty heavy excess and remain lucid (I’m Australian, make of that what you will...) so this caught me off guard. 

Honestly I enjoyed it, I felt giggly and silly again like when I was 16 drinking for the first time, as opposed to kind of numb and heavy like i’ve felt drinking the last few years. 

Just curious if anyone else found this upon quitting?

Cheers :)

Tips for fighting the craving while driving

Just a little background info- Im now 21 years old and Ive been smoking since I was 16.

Ive been smoke free for 3 days now (yay!) 
I dont crave too much, but my main concern is when I'm driving. Since i started at 16 and my parents (still don't) didn't know I was smoking, I would always go to the store to grab something just so I could smoke in the car, and it's become a habit for me. 

Any tips for ways to stop smoking in the car? When I'm inside i can just keep my hands busy or browse reddit, so something to take my mind off the craving, but in the car I can't do that!

This is it. I'm quitting smoking.

Hi.
I don't know exactly why I am doing this. But I feel I really need to or I will fail. I'm not doing this for atention, even if absolutely no one replies it is not the important thing. But I feel the need to make a commintment, even if it is online, even if it is on this format I need a commitment for myself, and just typing that I am doing it gives me strength.

I am 22 years old and have been smoking since I was 15. These last years a pack a day, so rather heavily. And I'm done. I don't want to do it anymore. I'm feeling my breathing a bit heavier since this morning, and honestly maybe it isn't even relatable to smoking, but I'm a hypocondriac and for once it has done some good in my life.
I haven't smoked a cigarrette today, and it is already night, this is amazing for me as I have tried to quit before and if I achieved what I achieved today it was awful. But today i feel good about it. My breathing is so clear so clean, there is no taste on my mouth and I just want it to be forever.

So this is it, like I said, I'm not exactly sure why I am writing this, but thinking about it gave me so much strength instead of picking a cigarrete. 
I don't expect replies, and I want to use this as a vent "blog" for when I am carving. As I found that writing that I need one usually makes me so much better.
Don't know what else to say. I hope this time is the one, and I am feeling it.

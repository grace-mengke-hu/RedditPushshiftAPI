It's quit day, and I'm happy and sick.

Today is quit day, and I'm four hours into daylight, crushed my last butt out at 8pm last evening, a total of 14 hours since my last tango with tobacco, somewhere over 22 years since the dance began.

I'm happy and I'm sick, and I know this is *nothing* compared to what is about to come. But I'm not scared any more...that's a lie. I'm scared, but I'm confident I can handle the pain. So this morning I've been telling myself "you're a non-smoker, and you're just getting sick, it'll pass". And then I tell myself again and again. 

I'm lucky I'm at home for the next while and can sweat and bitch and cry this out is private. People at work going through this, my hat is off to you, and, I recommend you consider taking sick time if you can. Because that is what we are with these withdrawals; non-smokers feeling sick. It's a flu that demands cigarettes as a cure, it's a sneaky bastard of a bug. But we'll beat it.

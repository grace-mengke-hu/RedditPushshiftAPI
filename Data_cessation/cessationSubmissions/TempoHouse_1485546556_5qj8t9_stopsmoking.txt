Dumb way to get re-addicted

I gave away my e-cig last night. I never liked it much anyway, and it certainly didn't help me quit last time.

While demonstrating how it fits together, I manged to get vape juice all over my fingers. Today has been one of my toughest days for cravings since I quit. Maybe coincidence, but I do wonder.

Made it through!

Every week I get together with some girls at a friends house for grilling out and swimming. They all smoke, and since we're doing outside activities, they can just smoke freely. Every week I breakdown and smoke on that day, and start the cycle over trying to quit, but I give in every time. But last week I didn't! They all smoked and I didn't. I stayed strong! As of today I'm 2 weeks no smoking! They cancelled this week. And as much as I love the weekly get together, I'm glad to skip the temptation. By the time I see them again, I'll be almost 3 weeks smoke-free, and I'm excited to keep powering through. So proud! :D

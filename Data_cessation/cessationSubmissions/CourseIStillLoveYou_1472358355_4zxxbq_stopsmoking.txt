Update - Day 3! Badge broken?

Hey all, I posted a few days ago. Still going strong. I am on my third day now. I've taken things really easy and I'm enjoying life outside of the cravings. Had a really nice dinner with my Dad and went to go see a movie tonight.

I hear things kick in even worse around day 3 when the stored nicotine finally goes out of your system. Anybody else notice a difficulty bump? I am girding my loins regardless.

Also, I can't figure out how to get my badge to work. My quit date was the 26th. Shouldn't it be up to 2 or 3 right now? (Depending on if it only counts days completed or what day you're on)

I tried removing it and readding it and it just stays at 1 day. Is it something wrong with my browser?

3 week report

In the past 3 weeks I've had 4 cigarettes, 3 which were from my last pack that I didn't want to "waste," even though I wasted them on myself, and one last night after an 11 hour day of work at Domino's. But the desire to not smoke continues and I accept these minor falls as part of the path to quitting.

Stay strong everyone, cold turkey isn't the only method to quitting. Sometimes just cutting back significantly is a great first step. :)

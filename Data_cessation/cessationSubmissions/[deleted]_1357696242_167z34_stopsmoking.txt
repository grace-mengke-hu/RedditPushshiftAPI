I quit today, I can do this!

I have been smoking since I was 16, I am 22 now. It was a stupid decision to make in the first place. Last night after a few drinks I decided to quit smoking and threw my cigarettes and lighter in the bin. 

I quit before over the Summer for around three months, I'm going cold turkey as I did then so I am expecting similar withdrawal symptoms: not being able to sleep well the first few days, waking up really warm, sweats etc. But here it goes again, I can do this and stay nicotine free! And also save money! What helped me last time was exercise so I will be doing more of that also. 

Any advice/tips on how you guys/girls got past the cravings? I find chewing gum helps.

Good luck to all of you who have decided to quit too, you can do it!

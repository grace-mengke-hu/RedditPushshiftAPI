Day 5

Another night of sleeplessness and waking to feeling super uncomfortable in my skin.  Has anyone else had these sort of symptoms??  For what it’s worth, I’m 40 and have been smoking since I was 16. I’ve enjoyed smoking the herb too, so with this quit I laid everything down and my body feels like it’s going fucking crazy.

In any case, I’m committed to the path and am seeking out all the things to help.

- lots of water
- rest when I need it
- steam room at the ymca 
- staying busy
- constant reading of this sub reddit
- talking about it to others
- no drinking alcohol
- exercising a lot..keep moving 

What else should I consider??! Any ideas??? 

Thank you all so much for the support. I so appreciate it.

Things that helped me: re hormones, AM cravings, anxiety

I'm 14 days "smoke free" today. By that I mean that I took a one night vacation and drank too much too quickly to control myself and bought a pack. Smoked maybe 3 and saturated them in the water before junking them that night. As I sobered up, I felt so terrible and as I was smoking them, my lungs and throat were so unhappy. I think I needed that-- that even drunk, smoking is disgusting. 


Anyways, this is the first time in a while I've been able to get past a few hours. As someone with a mood disorder, the anxiety and depression would get so severe that id relapse very quickly rather than endure crying and feeling suicidal. 

What made this possible:
-fermented foods like Kim chi, sauerkraut, etc. Great to balance mood and anxiety and social behavior (the urge to escape for 10 minutes is lessened).
-balancing my hormones. I'm a woman and I suffered severe PMS for a decade.  closer to PMDD. Terrible acne, pain, awful mood. Since February I've been taking an herbal hormone regulator by a doctor named Jess Peatross. If you Google it'll come right up. 
-wheatgrass and ginger lemon shots. I work at farmers markets and there's a juice company. I started getting wheatgrass there before i quit and it gave me so much energy. During the first week of my quit, id have some juice to keep my blood sugar up when craving. To counter the craving of a cig with coffee id have a shot of wheat grass followed by a ginger/ lemon/ cayenne shot. Was suuuuuper helpful!
Now, its mostly boredom that makes me want to smoke and nice weather lol. Also, stressful situations and crying so avoid that to the best of your ability. 


Stay strong every one :)

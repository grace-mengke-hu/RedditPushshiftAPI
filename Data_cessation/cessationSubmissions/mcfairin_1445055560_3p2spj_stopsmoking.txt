Almost caved in today

I had a bad day today. I fought with my fianc√© and I was super emotional. I have PMDD so I get a little crazy from time to time. It's really hard to think logically and I had a melt down. After work I wanted to get my oil changed. It was long over due and I had the time so I figured why not. The entire drive there I thought about how nice it would be to smoke a cigarette. I even imagined someone smoking at the oil changing place and asking them for one. I played the scenario out in my head and everything. Well this like change/car wash took over an hour. I was waiting there and I just happened to smell it.. I look up and what do you know. Some random person was sitting there smoking a cigarette. I thought about asking him and it was just what I pictured on the drive there. It was honestly strange because it was just as I imagined it. I stayed strong and thought about the long run. Of coarse one smoke will turn to another and then another. Before you know it I'm buying a pack and hiding this disgusting addiction all over again. I'm really happy I stayed strong and I have you guys to thank for it. Don't give in guys, it's not worth it!

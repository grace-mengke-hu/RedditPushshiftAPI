Thinking About Your Hormones

This might seem obvious but I'm finding that timing my last cigarette with the right part of my hormone cycle has made a HUGE difference.

In the past, I've always tried quitting at the point in my cycle when I'm most grumpy and self-loathing. After three days, I would be back to smoking to just lift the brain fog and depression that always comes a week before my period. The cravings for food, restlessness, and anxiety of quitting were compounded.

This time around, I decided to quit while in the positive, borderline manic, part of my cycle. This time of month, I need less sleep, eat less, and am more happy and active. Not surprisingly, it's made the first week a hell of a lot easier.

Just wanted to share for other women out there who might not be taking their hormones into account. If you've tried a few times without success, might be worth looking at a calendar to see if your attempts line up with an unfavorable hormone storm.

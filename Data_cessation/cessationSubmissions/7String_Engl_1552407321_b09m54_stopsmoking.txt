Today is day 10 nicotine free and I want to give in more than ever.

It's been a pretty smooth ride so far, and that was worrying me. I crashed into a wall yesterday and I've been an angry emotional mess for the last 24 hours with no end in sight. I didn't even choose to quit, I just moved to an AIO vape and it was shitty and kept flooding and not giving me good hits so I set it down to give it a try and here I am 10 days later about to pull my hair out. It's been maybe 3 weeks or so since I've smoked a cigarette, but 10 days nicotine free and the way I'm feeling right now is beyond awful. It's embarrassing because I know it has to go away here soon, it's been almost two weeks like what the fuck? I've smoked for about 8 or 9 years. For now I'll just continue to be an asshole with this feeling of impending doom hanging over my head because apparently it will go away, but I can't take much longer of this. Thanks for listening.

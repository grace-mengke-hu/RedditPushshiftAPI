I live with three smokers who have no interest in quitting, my family, and it's stopping my quitplan

I hate the pain and cognitive dissonance I feel. 

They don't care, they don't listen to reason, they just don't want to quit enough to try to do it. Besides, if they did it would be a huge mess. There's no way the stress wouldn't kill my pops. 

I've gotten over their habits as much as I can, but I can't shake mine. I am down to about 8-10 home rolled cigs a day. 

I'm 27 and terrified of a heart attack such that I literally worry about it every day. 

I want to quit. I'm moving back out now that I have the funds and I want to use that as a springboard to quit and start an exercise habit. I'm not overweight but I'm definitely out of shape, never been capable of running a sub 10m mile. 

I need support. I just feel like I'm crashing and depressed. 


Whatever, I'll probably die of a heart attack a year after I quit anyway. 

Fuck, nights are hard.

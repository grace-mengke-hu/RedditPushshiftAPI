Committed

So I quit smoking completely last July. About a week into the month. Was going fine; no problem. Mind over matter mentality. Binge drinking  started to take it's toll and I gave in; started smoking again; 4 almost 5 months after quitting. Now I've found in the past 2 months when I go out drinking I'll smoke a pack for the night and be fine for the next week. Just had my last smoke 5 minutes ago left over from this weekends drinking shenanigans. Came here to say I'm going to hop back on the wagon again for a triple grand slam of /r/stopdrinking and /r/NoFap

Day 301

It's actually been really easy for me, I was ready. Then today rolls around and I find myself around a bunch of like minded people...but everyone smokes. I almost broke and bummed an American Spirit of some dude trying to convince myself it would be OK.

Fuck that. Tomorrow will still be 301!

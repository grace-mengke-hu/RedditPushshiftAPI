Rough day

Had a very rough day today. Found out my dog needs an expensive surgery, have to take out a loan to pay for it, I messed things up at work because I was worried about the dog and money. Just overall a crappy day!
In the past, a day like today would have caused me to smoke way more than normal. Today, I only thought about smoking once and resisted the urge. 
I'm happy to say I'm 9 days smoke free!

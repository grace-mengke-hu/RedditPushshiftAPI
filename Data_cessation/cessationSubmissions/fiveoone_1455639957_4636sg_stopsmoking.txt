Very high cholesterol, gonna take stop smoking seriously now.

I've tried so many times with this. Last time I was on this forum I've apparently not smoked 180 days. I even unsubscribed because I felt bad. But today I got results from a blood test and the doctor said my cholesterol values are extremely high and if I don't start taking medication, stop smoking and start exercising I will see my first cardiovascular problems in my 50s. Maybe earlier. 

So you could say reality hit me in the face. I've been smoking on and off for about 10 years and before that I did snus (Swedish tobacco-teabag you put under your lip) for about 5 years. I just went cold turkey 6 hours ago and although the feeling is creeping a bit, I actually feel pretty good. 

At least now I have a better motivation, past times its generally been other people forcing me. 

So now I say fuck it. I'm gonna quit. 

[TLDR; Fuck you body, I'm gonna save you by quitting right now!]

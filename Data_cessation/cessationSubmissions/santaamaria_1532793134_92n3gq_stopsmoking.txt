60 Days

Today is day 60 of my quit.

Smoking still crosses my mind everyday but it has become less frequent. And even if I am thinking about it, itâ€™s not necessarily a craving.

Not sure I have a point to this post, but I guess what I want to say is- Just keep going. Keep quitting. We are better without smoking. I believe in you and you will be able to live a wonderful life without cigarettes.

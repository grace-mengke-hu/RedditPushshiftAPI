My gums feel so soft and smooth.

I'm using a vaporizer/e-cigarette, haven't smoked since last Wednesday (so not very long). My gums feel not at all in a bad way like when you feel a piece of meat at the grocery store. Just nice and smooth and clean.

I've read that smoking is the same but much lesser as when you smoke a piece of meat. So it makes sense that my mouth is feeling "raw" again.

I also had this dark spot on one of my front bottom teeth. It's been there for quite a while. It was just in, like, the natural texture on my teeth. I've learnt that other yellow stains surrounded it, and that that stain wasn't yellow, it was dark brown.

I have pretty nice teeth, and I regularly used whitening products while smoking. But, holy shit, nothing from Crest can ever compare to how much cleaner and whiter your teeth are after quitting smoking.

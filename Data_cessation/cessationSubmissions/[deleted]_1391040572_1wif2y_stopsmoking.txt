I wish you all well on your journeys, but it is time for me to unsubscribe.

It's been a while and it feels great, yet I still have urges. Not saying this sub is a bad thing, I feel my time here is done because the only time of the day I get reminded of cigarettes and get urges is when it pops on my feed. I've sort of cut ties to all smokers I've known, it helped with the process. Farewell and good luck on your journey, hopefully soon the day will come that this first world problem becomes yours too. cheers

4 Years Smoke Free Today!!

Thanks to r/stopsmoking, who pointed me toward Allen Carr's life changing book.  If you're beginning your quitting journey today, don't feel discouraged or nervous!  I was a pack and a half a day smoker for many years, and I quit cold turkey the day I finished Easy Way.  I truly see myself as a non-smoker now, and I have to say I never even think about picking up a cigarette.  You can do it!  Read Allen Carr's book!!!!

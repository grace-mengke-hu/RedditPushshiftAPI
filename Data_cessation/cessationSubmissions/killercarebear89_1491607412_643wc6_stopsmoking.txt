I'm about to take the plunge.

I've got 1 cigarette left and decided today's the day, I'm not going to buy any more. I've been wanting to try for a while but I keep making excuses. So instead of smoking I'm going to start using my vape. But I'm scared. The lifestyle change is monumental. Any support would be very appreciated!

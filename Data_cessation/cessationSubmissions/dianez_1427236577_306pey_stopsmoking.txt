Has anybody gone through the same thing?

I want to ask if anyone has experienced bloating, gas, trouble digesting, constipation or diarrhea in the days or weeks following quitting. I have been like this for the past two weeks. I found very little information on the internet, some people think it is because the body undergoes a lot of stress when you quit and it needs time to recover, others because your eating patterns change and this upsets the digestive system for some time.

Anyway I am really suffering right now from this. I have an appointment with a doctor in a few days and of course I am not thinking about smoking again. I have decided I will never smoke again!!  I was just wondering if others have experienced it too and how they coped with it. 

Thanks a lot!Congratulations everyone for quitting!

PS. Maybe I should add that it is like having irritable bowel syndrome. But I have never had that before. It is not only constipation, for which I have taken laxatives these days. The bloating is the worst of all the other symptoms. Everything I eat, even a small banana, I feel like a balloon.

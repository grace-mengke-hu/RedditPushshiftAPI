Cigarettes hold pleasure for ransom. That's why you can't quit.

Quiting smoking is hard because it feels like quitting everything you enjoy in life. You smoke when you relax because if you don't you cant relax. You smoke after a meal or you still feel hungry. You smoke after sex or you don't feel satisfied. If smoking was enjoyable in and of itself, it should be that a coffee is good, and a coffee and a cigarette is even better. That's not how it works, though. A coffee without a cigarette for a smoker is just misery. That's because cigarettes aren't pleasurable. They take pleasure from you and only give it back once you light up. You aren't giving up cigarettes, your taking back pleasure from them.


 They've become associated to us with good conversations, and nice walks and morning coffees because a good conversation is bad one with nicotine withdrawal. a walk is a chore and a morning coffee is incomplete. They give you nothing. They take everything, give it back in 2 minute sessions then you thank them for it.

Its simply Stockholm syndrome.  your'e not giving up smoking. Your taking back the little pleasures.

11 days and I blew it.

I was going strong. Honestly, I didn't even think about a cig and purposely left mine outside 11 days ago so they would get rained on. A little back story. I have an adderall prescription that I use for studying and tests. Today I had a spanish test and I took an adderall. I was fine for half of the day. As test time came closer and closer, I slowly got more and more stressed. I told myself no a few different times. After lunch, with adderall, I just couldn't hold back any longer and I bummed a cig. I still haven't bought any but I did it. I don't understand why adderall has this effect on me. Does anyone else experience this? I'm disappointed and don't know why I did it. I felt so good and was going so strong. I even had numerous beers on Saturday for college football and never even had a craving. WTH. Sorry guys.

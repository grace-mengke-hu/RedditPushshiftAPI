Short lived life as a smoker

I picked up my first cigarette about a year ago, but only really started smoking seriously just about a month or two ago. I know its bad and I read all about the various risks and negative health impacts but it just doesn't really sink in with me. I guess I just constantly make excuses like telling myself I'm still young and I won't die from just a few sticks. 

I really want to stop though. I feel guilty everytime. But the more days pass between each stick the more I just feel like hey its been a while, no harm in going for another one now right? 

I've made the decision to stop now for real, and I really hope this time its for good. Will report back a week from now.

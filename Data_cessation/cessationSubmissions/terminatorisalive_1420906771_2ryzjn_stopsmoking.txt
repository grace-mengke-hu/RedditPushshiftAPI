Hey, can I ask for some support?

Ok So here we go again. I am a repeat offender, quitter over a hundred times. I dropped off the deep end after a nice break from smoking and seem a little extra hooked these days. 
Smoking these last few today then gonna give it up not for good but my new goal as opposed to NEVER smoking again is to go as long as I possibly can. Days/weeks/years(Hopefully)
Now as a guy who just seems to subconsciously start again over and over I am certain that I have a problem with addiction in general and am thanking my lucky stars that I never tried any hard drugs cause the weed/porn and cigs have been enough of an ass kicker for the last 20 years. But if I do start again, I will be seeking professional help. And might have to go to the doc and get some of this chantix I keep hearing about.
So I must say that REDDIT is a great supplemental tool for support. So if I can humbly ask for advice, suggestions, and if I am struggling I'll check in here and just say it. Would be awesome to have some backup!
At this point I'm willing to try anything so feel free to tell me what's been working for you. I am interested in trying meditation and will be getting out for a good exercise almost everyday.
Thanks in advance. I wish all the best for you in your journeys away from tobacco and whatever else ails you.

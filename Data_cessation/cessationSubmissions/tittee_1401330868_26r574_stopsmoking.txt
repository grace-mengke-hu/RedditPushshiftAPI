Day 1 for my second attempt

I attempted to quit smoking about 2 months ago and made it 3 weeks until I cracked. My friends wouldn't stop saying in the meantime, "if you could make it 3 weeks, then you could just stop again right" but it was honestly really really hard. The cravings never went away and I was ready to throw my head against the wall.

Any advice or past stories of when cravings went away would be appreciated and also how do I properly deal with cravings

Quit smoking after 18 years, relapsed, now quit again

I'm 32 now and I've smoked since I was 14. I think a year in I started smoking a pack a day, so I've wasted an incredible amount of money and health on it.

I've tried quitting for hundreds of times, but this januari I finally managed it. I was smokefree for around two months, the longest I've ever held on. Thing is it really felt different this time, I started to feel the benefits (warm, good smell and taste, easy breath, more sexual interest) and the cons (irritation, stress, nausia, bowel movement) started to fade. I really started to feel like a non smoker. The 'pangs' were further and further in between.

Alas, end of februari I made the mistake of picking one up again while drunk. For a few weeks i still saw myself as a non-smoker, even though I started buying a new pack every few days, lol. The last couple of weeks ive been smoking a full pack a day again. And I was so happy I kicked the habit..

So, here we are again, Im quitting again. Havent smoked for 16 hours now and had quite some panicks and almost went to to buy a pack the past couple of hours, but Ive managed it and now I start to feel better. Its almost as if its a bit easier to do now that I know that I can kick it.

Looking forward to feeling better and healthier each day!!!

Day 50. I'm not going to smoke but it's so hard today

I will have a drink. Just 2. I think it's good to enjoy  the things you like without the filth.  

Update. 

Thanks everyone. Your comments kept me going. I went out, I live in Thailand, Bangkok and I had a  one or two more than I should have . but I didn't smoke. Wow. I feel great . I realised after that I hadn't. OK. Give me some slack. I'm now a little drunk but I felt I owed it to you to report back honestly. No smoke and happy. Listening  to retro Neil Diamond, Nirvana, Tim Hardin, Tim Buckley, Bob and others. By myself. Tipsy. Smokeless. Happy.

Giving this another go

Day 2 without a cigarette my friends. Seems every new year I get the urge to quit. Not that the new year new me shit means anything to me, but it just seems like a convenient time to stop so it will be easy to know how long lol. 

However, quitting is the easy part. Staying quit is hard. Make it about 6 months everytime before inevitably one drunken night, or stressful day, I'll have just that one cigarette. It's not an immediate failure, but it is the beginning of the end. Every. Single. Time. 

I dont want to do that this time. I want to stay quit for real. But damn I miss it lol. 

Anyway. What's the best app for seeing how long exactly I've quit for? And can it calculate how much money I've saved? I smoked 1.5 packs a day and they're about $4 a pop. Cant wait to see that add up as motivation. Thanks in advance. And wish me luck brothers.

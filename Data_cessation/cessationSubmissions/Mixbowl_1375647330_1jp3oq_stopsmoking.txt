Are E-cigarettes cheating or a good alternative?

I recently quit smoking and I got through 2 weeks cold turkey but then something bad happened that sent my stress levels through the roof! I needed to smoke it was the only thing i knew would calm me down! So off to the shop I go and i am just about to pay for my carton of 20 when i see these E-cigarettes on sale ( the ones that take liquid ) i thought why the hell not! bought and tried and just like that it controlled my cravings! but does it count?

( dyslexic sorry =[ )

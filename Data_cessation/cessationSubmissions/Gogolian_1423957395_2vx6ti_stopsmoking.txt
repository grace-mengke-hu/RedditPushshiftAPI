I promised so i am delivering, goddamit!

I promised few people over here that i will post an update on my first go-on-a-beer with friends since i quit. If i may, i will describe my whole day. Sorry if it will be long.

Today started a bit harsh. Big carvings  started when i woke up. I went running but it was just a temporary relief. So i tried to get myself as busy as i could to get past it. I went shopping, made great, cream tomato-meat soup but still the carvings didnt want to go away. The worst part was smoking tea & salvia. (yes i made tea & salvia cigarette by myself - no tobbaco) IT. WAS. DISGUSTING!!! (seriously do not try it, i nerly puked) 

So i wored out a little more. I found by coincidence that i still have 2 cigarettes lying on my shelf....

I resisted. I distroyed them, then dispoed the remains.

I stayed strong.

But the big challenge still had to be.

My girlfriend came home, we ate some soup and went to pub with my friends.

Even though i told myself countless times that it is a challenge that i can proove myself i was terrified that i may smoke. That i may give up. 

Right now, when i'm writing this message we're on our way back home. 

I didn't smoke.

I didn't even feel the need to smoke.

I found it repulsive when my friend's smoke. (Although i didn't judge them)

They went out 5, maybe 8 times. Obe time even my girlfriend went with them.

Not only i didnt go. I didnt feel the need to go.

After last one my friend asked me how do i do it and asked me to point to my resources and i agreed to sent him some links tomorrow.

I am proud of myself.

I made it.

You can make it too.

Stay strong. Stay yourself.

Love you /r/stopsmoking

Peace out \m/

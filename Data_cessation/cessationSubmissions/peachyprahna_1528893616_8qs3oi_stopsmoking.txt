a strange journey it has been

such detours such routes.... the mind is fascinating &amp; only now do I have an appreciation for the varieties of ways in which you guys warrior through. 

so, I've been hammering quitting into my head for at least a year now, and more seriously the past few months. it went from resisting for a few hours, to a couple of days, to here. I am still smoking, although barely, and in previous attempts where I'd throw everything out only to stock up again soon after, the cravings were almost unbearable and I became an emotional squiggle of a human \- this was a hideously painful pattern that only came to an end recently. 

as of then, I have not been experiencing cravings during cessation, no nightmarish withdrawals either, everything actually becomes more enjoyable and more beautiful than it ever was before \- eating, spending time with friends, concentrating for long periods on work. this is down to endless research and reading (Allen Carr, Joel spitzer, NLP, generally re\-wiring the brain in allll the ways) I really think this is it. 

AND YET! there is still a sabateour of a voice in my head that convinces me to pick up a cigarette. there isn't even a visceral feeling to this, it just a fleeting thought that I'm so well trained to respond to. 

All that is needed now is just to jump off the cliff and commit, not just now, but forever to keep making the commitment to myself that this IS what I want, and rest assured that the only thing that can spring my parachute open is myself. 

Guys, are there any words of encouragement or stories you'd like to share which are similar? 

I would love to hear them!

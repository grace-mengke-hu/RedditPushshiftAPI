Dealing with the withdrawal symptoms

So, I quit smoking for a few years...and then picked it up again when I was dealing with some life events that left me pretty frustrated and depressed.

I've been smoking every day for a few weeks, now and I'm at a point where I really just don't like it anymore. I *want* to quit, and I can deal with cravings, but when I try going a day, or two without smoking...I've noticed that the withdrawal leaves me *exhausted*, makes it hard to focus and makes me *incredibly irritable*. I've started a new job, and I'm really worried about how this withdrawal is going to affect my performance. 

For those who quit: Did anything help you deal with the withdrawal symptoms? How did it affect you at work?

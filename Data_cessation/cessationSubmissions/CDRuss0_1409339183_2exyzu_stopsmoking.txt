Just relapsed last night after a month free

And wow, do I regret it. I think I'm finally convinced. I only caved because they were around, I had been drinking, and I was tempted, and its hard to stay away when you're at a gathering of people where you're surrounded by ecig vapor inside and cigarette smoke outside. I got no satisfaction whatsoever from it, and can feel the negative effect its having on my body. I can safely say that last night was the last time.

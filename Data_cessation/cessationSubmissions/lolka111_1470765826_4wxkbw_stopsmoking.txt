One month without smoking and it's pretty bad.

I quit smoking one month ago and it was alright in the begining, but after a week or so depression and anxiety kicked in and since then i feel like shit. It' really bad and now i really don't understand why they say that quitting helps you with depression. It's exactly the opposite. I will try to hold on for a week or two and if it won't get any better i will buy some cigarettes. What's the point of quitting if i'm like a zombie now.

Made it 100 hours without smoking, but...

So I have been smoking since I was 16 and it's been 10 years lol. The other day I decided since I went the whole day without smoking a cig, I would give 2 days a try and then I challenged myself to keep going, man I haven't tried to quit since i was 18. But today, I decided to smoke 1 cig just to see what I was missing and man was it miserable! I have been vaping for about 3 years and the whole time I was hitting my cig, it tasted like crap and I felt way worse then I did before. I think this is really my time to quit, I had no craving for the cigeratte ,since I am getting nicotine from my vape I don't have to worry about that part, but what get's me is all the other chemicals my body is used to, in order to function. So I am in a weird place at the moment, where a cig will not cut it anymore and wishing my vape was more like a cig. But at the end of the day I will pick the vape as the winner every time. Even with having smoked one, I am going to continue saying I am 4 days and keep on trucking along and honestly I mainly let the cig burn way more then I puffed, maybe 4 or 5 puffs. So I don't feel nearly as bad seeing if I really needed it or not.

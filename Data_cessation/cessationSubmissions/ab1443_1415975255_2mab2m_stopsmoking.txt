Still having smoking dreams

Two months in and I'm still having occasional but very vivid dreams about smoking. A medication I take causes me to dream more vividly than I ever have, but when I have a smoking dream it comes with a bad cigarette taste in my mouth and all the guilt that smoking a pack would cause. Is this still the toxins leaving my lungs, or could this just be my mind being a jerk?

That being said - coming to this sub always renews my resolve. I am going out this weekend with people I used to smoke with, and I know that I can't have even one cigarette! Thanks to the community

Quitting smoking with a stressful job

I'll admit, most if not all jobs are stressful in their own ways, mine is certainly no exception. Any advice on how those of you who quit smoking did so while still dealing with stresses at work? How did you cope or take your mind off the daily frustrations. Thanks in advance!

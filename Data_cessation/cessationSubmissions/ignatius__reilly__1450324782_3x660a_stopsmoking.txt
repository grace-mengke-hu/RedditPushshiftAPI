Grieving the loss of an addiction

Eleven days without a cigarette (!!!), and I am okay. This was by far one of the finest decisions I've made in my life. That said, one thing I've noticed is that - as ecstatic as I am about finally becoming a non-/ex-smoker - quitting nicotine is a lot like getting over a certain kind of relationship. (One of those sensual but entirely toxic relationships that you remain in for an extended period of time, despite knowing how much more self-sufficient you'd be if you could just stop succumbing to instant gratification and cut yourself off from it.) I really feel like I've given my emotions a run for their money this last week and a half, between recollecting the good ol' days when my head was in the sand and I could indulge freely and with zero guilt in a pack of smokes, and then wholeheartedly rejoicing in the fact that I am no longer poisoning myself with cigarettes. I am so proud of myself for having quit, relieved that I have zero desire to smoke a cigarette, and grateful that that part of my life is secured in the past, so it's weird to have these sensations of grief and recovery. Anyone else going through this?

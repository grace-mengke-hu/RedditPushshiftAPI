Help?

Hey guys. So after a long time away from the sub and a very nasty 6 months, I've come back to reset my badge. I've tried quitting at least 6 times in the last two months, but always seem to go back "after this pack". Any tips, tricks or advice anyone can offer would be very much appreciated. I want to quit, I'm 18 and have been smoking on and off (mostly on) for 5 years now. 

Thanks a bunch in advance!

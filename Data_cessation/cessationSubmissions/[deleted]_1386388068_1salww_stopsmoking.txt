It's been three days, and when I scooter to work I'm getting 2 or 3 houses further than I used to before I'm out of breath!

I live at the bottom of a long, slightly inclined hill. It makes pushing my scooter up to the main highway a pain in the ass that requires almost constant pushing and no cruising. When I was a smoker, I'd scoot to class ten minutes early, often exposing myself to more cold than necessary, because if I smoked before scooting up that hill it was **hell.** Now, I have ten more minutes to sleep and I bomb up the hill in what seems like no time because I'm not exhausting myself and stopping frequently! I have loved coughing up all of this shit; it feels like I'm healing myself. Finally ready to comit! Thanks /r/stopsmoking!

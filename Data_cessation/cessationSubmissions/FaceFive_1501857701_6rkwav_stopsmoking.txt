1 year today!

I can't tell how how many times I've reset my badge. I know it was a lot. 

This year I survived a week long trip to Las Vegas, selling my house, and putting my two 14-year old dogs down. I wanted to break. I didn't. 

Think you can't succeed? Think about this....I am employed by the largest tobacco company in the world, I am literally surrounded by cigarettes every day of my life. 

If I can do it, then so can you. Although I am mostly a lurker, this sub helped me tremendously. Stay vigilant, not one single puff. Good luck, you CAN do it.

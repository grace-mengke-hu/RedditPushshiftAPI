New member. 10 years on, 10 days off.

New reddit member here, I've been smoking for the best part of 10 years and quit 10 days ago. I've been using vape devices now n then and up till now i've been fine but today is an absolute struggle.

Feeling exhausted, drained and so mentally shattered. Just want to go buy a pack and sit in my car and chain smoke. Really horrible feeling.

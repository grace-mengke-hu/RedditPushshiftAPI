Not a good day today

I finnally did it 10 days ago! I still can't belive I did it. Been smoking for 7 years, every day, no exception, not even when I was in the hospital with throat problems (!!!). 

But I still feel sometimes that this is not permanent eventhough I never want to do it again. And I've been a depressive shmuck for several years now, believing that cigarettes are my only friends and source of confort. I know it's a lie, but I still feel as though sometimes smoking one is going to make everything better.

I'm proud I've managed to go out with smoker friends three times. At work I take breaks sometimes and go as usual to talk with a colleague while she smokes. I've been through 2 fights with my parents and resisted the incredible urge to fuck all the progress. But I'm still feeling as if this is temporary and that the not smoking thing isn't going to last long. I haven't felt this strong in a while, but I'm getting weaker by the day and I'm afraid I'm going to fail at this.

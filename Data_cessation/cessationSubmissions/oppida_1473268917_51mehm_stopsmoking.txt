I will stop being a mean, grumpy, angry person, won't I?

I'm on my 7th day of not smoking, after smoking off and on for 20 years. I'm fully committed. I love that I'm a non-smoker. I am glad I got the burden of smoking off my back. 

But, I'm a raging bitch! Everything pisses me off. I have no patience, I'm full of negativity. It's completely irrational and seemingly uncontrollable. 

I have had pretty bad insomnia, which is not normal for me at all...so lack of sleep is probably contributing...

Please tell me this gets better? I will go back to my normal optimistic, nice self? I fear I will scar my poor kids for life with my nastiness!!! 

It gets better, right? When?

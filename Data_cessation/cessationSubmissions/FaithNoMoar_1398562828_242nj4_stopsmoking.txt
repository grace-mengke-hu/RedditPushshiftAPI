...at least I don't smoke.

Over a year smoke free and I still get cravings from time to time, maybe once a month, maybe less, maybe more. If you're a glass half empty person, that's a great reason not to quit, "I'm always going to have withdrawals, might as well keep smoking."

I'm a pessimist in many parts of life so I know I've felt that way before. I'm not like that anymore though: my glass of non-smoking is half full. I may have cravings for ever and ever, but at least I don't smoke.

Of course the great irony is that as a non-smoker I'll live longer statistically which that means I'll have withdrawals for longer. Such is life under the spell of nicotine.

Anyway, I had a few spring Saturday afternoon beers which is a trigger not dealt with much and green-eyed, I watched a smoker light up. I still have cravings but I deal with them one at a time. It sucks for a minute or two, maybe less, maybe more, but at least I don't smoke.

Being an ex-smoker sucks sometimes, but at least I don't smoke.

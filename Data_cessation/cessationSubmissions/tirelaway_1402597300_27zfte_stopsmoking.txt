Quitting using the patch and a dentist.

I am/was a pack a day smoker since I was 19.  I'm 43 now. The smoke (and neglect) destroyed my teeth to the point that I recently had to get two molars yanked out. I also got a new car which I didn't want smoked up, so I decided that this was the perfect time point for quitting the habit. I patched up, got the teeth out (horrible), and followed the dentists advice for once in my life.
  I haven't smoked in three weeks. The patches help with a majority of the cravings and irritation with other people, but when the urge DOES come, it's intense. I remember living in New York ten years ago with a girl I now call an ex. We were midtown during lunch hour. She lit up on a corner, and some guy bounced out of the crowd and smacked the shit out of her before melting back into the general scenery. We were too surprised to do anything.  NOW I KNOW WHY HE DID IT. The anger I feel at other smokers in public is palpable and deadly. HOW DARE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENJOY THESE THINGS? It's not concern for THEIR health, reddit.  It's my own selfish greed.
  I can smell everything.  EVERYTHING.  If someone is having a smoke two cars ahead of me, i KNOW.  I am the Sherlock of the olfactory world. You had an egg with paprika on it for breakfast. You use neutrogena sunscreen. Your father wore Drakkar Noir in High school.  You can't fool me. Food has taken on a frightening new meaning to me.  Perhaps I smoked to be able to eat.  The overwhelming scents make the meals almost unpalatable. 
 Mostly, I miss the ability to disengage and step out for some me time. Smoking afforded me a nice social crutch.
 "Never again" is such a big phrase to utter.  How about "not today?"

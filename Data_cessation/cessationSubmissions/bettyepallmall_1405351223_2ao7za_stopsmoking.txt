Day 0. I've been here before.

This time for real. I've always tried cold turkey and I've always failed, I have a patch on now and am hoping I'll have better results. I've read Allen Carr's book, I'm planning on drinking tons of water (seemed to help last time) and I've got two young children to keep me motivated (and busy!). I'm not even religious but I am praying I am strong enough this time so there won't be a next time!

I really messed up.

I quit smoking about 6 months ago, but as of two weeks ago I started up again due to relationship issues. I was suppose to get married on April 27th, but he started having doubts and also decided he didn't want children. I really screwed things up and gave in, and now I need to find that drive to quit again, but I'm having a hard time. We are working on our relationship, and things are getting better but the smoking hasn't decreased nor has my stress level.
I havent been on this subreddit in a few months, and I just noticed my badge says 272 days. I'm so disappointed in myself.

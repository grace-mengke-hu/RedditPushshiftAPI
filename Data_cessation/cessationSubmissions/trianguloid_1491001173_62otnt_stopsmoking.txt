so done with smoking that I didn't even want one when drunk

been trying to quit for about 6 months now. been the scourge of my existence. tried everything and could not kick it. Finally sat down and listened to Easy Way while doing nothing else except smoking and listening. and just like that, I'm done. so done, in fact, that I didn't even want a cigarette when I was good and drunk last night out with friends. Drinking has always been how I started or started back, it's always been my weak point for smoking. I knew I was done, but waking up this morning and realizing that I turned down a cigarette even when hammered made me know for sure that I'm really, really done. 

so grateful. good luck to everyone trying to quit. I was the most addicted smoker ever, if I can quit, anyone can.

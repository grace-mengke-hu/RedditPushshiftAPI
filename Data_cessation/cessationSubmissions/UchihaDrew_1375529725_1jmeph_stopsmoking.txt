When do cravings stop?

Hey lads and lasses of /r/stopsmoking.

I'm on week 8 of quitting with nicotine patches.
I feel like I'm getting enough nicotine, but despite that I still get cravings for cigarettes sometimes. My brain misses the rush. Between the patches and chewing gum (just ordinary, not nicotine) I get past the cravings, but I'd still prefer to not have them in the first place. It normally happens when I see someone else smoking and I wanted to ask if these cravings eventually go away.

If so, is there a time-frame for it or does it vary from person to person?

6 beautiful months

So I quit initially because I'm a broke college student in Chicago.  Lit my last cig and knew I couldn't afford that $12 pack the next day. About a week in I found this sub, got my badge set up, and downloaded THE book. Honestly, I only read maybe half of it.  I got the point of it and it really helped.  During the first month I avoided most social situations.  I went to a buddy's bday party and left like 20 minutes in. I made it through a finals week. Adderall, coffee, all-nighters. That was probably the hardest thing.  Now 6 months out its smooth sailing. I'm not going to lie I still get cravings now and again.  Mostly when all my friends. Go outside to smoke but it ain't a big deal.  I've shared the book with a few of my friends and as of now 3 of them have quit. I quit all by myself but if I had a quitting buddy maybe it would have been easier.  I have tried that in the past but when one fails both fail lol. Anyway that's my story. Keep it up yall.

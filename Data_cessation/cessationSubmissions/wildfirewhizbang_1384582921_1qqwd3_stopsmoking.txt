casino smoke

So I'm in Vegas for the first time since quitting smoking.  
The thing that's so odd to me is the sheer volume of people who are smoking everywhere indoors. 
(For perspective I am from New York where smoking in restaurants/in bars/anywhere indoors/in parks/at the beach is illegal and has been for some time now)
When I smoked I always felt like the odd person out. 
In Vegas it's a whole other ball game. Everyone is smoking! I've tried to avoid it, not because of the temptation anymore but because I've just now gotten to the point where it grosses me out. 
It's impossible!
What an interesting problem to have at this point.

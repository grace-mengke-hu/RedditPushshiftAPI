Getting off nicotine lozenges

What's up y'all
New here. Wanted some thoughts/experience on getting off nicotine replacement therapy. I've been taking 2 mg lozenges for the past week and really want to get off them and simply not have any nicotine in my system at all. I was a 1 1/2 pack a day smoker and the withdraws have been pretty brutal up until now, and I know if I get off the lozenges they will be bad as well. Does anyone have any experience with getting off of these so early (8 days) and not following the instructions on the lozenges?

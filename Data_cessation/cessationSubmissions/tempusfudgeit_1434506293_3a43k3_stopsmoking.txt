20 hours

I'm almost a whole day down, and this sucks. I feel like my brain has been set to vibrate. I can't concentrate, even typing this post is a chore. Dreading driving 4 hours tomorrow for work with no cigarette. I have vapes, it really seems like they are little to no help. Mentally exhausted after work I went to lay down, only to be forced to get up and move or my head would explode.

Sorry for the incoherent ramblings. Not sure why I'm posting. Don't know what else to do right now.

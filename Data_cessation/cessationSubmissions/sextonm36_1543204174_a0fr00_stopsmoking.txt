Having trouble with cravings recently....

   Just wanted to introduce myself! I quit smoking when I found out I was pregnant and it was quite easy in the beginning in fact (I was a pack/day smoker who never tried to quit before for 15 years). However, now that I am in my second trimester at 22 weeks, the cravings have come back and have been excessive considering I just found out I am now (due to unrelated cause) a high risk pregnancy and have to be on modified bed rest. 
    Some days the only way to get through is to think I can smoke if I want after I give birth but the thing is, I don't want to be a smoker anymore so I don't want to give in after birth but this is seriously the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life! I get very depressed when I think that I can never feel that relaxation from a cigarette ever again. Anyone else feel that way? Thanks for listening!

Geez, didn't even notice I had hit my 90 days.

I have had so much temptations, especially since my roomie finds it ok to smoke in out apartment. I have still held out though and have been jogging about 3 miles every other day. I haven't felt this great in years. A runners high is much better at relieving stress than cigarettes ever were. For those of you who feel discouraged and don't think you'll ever be able to not think about smoking, it does get much easier. If you find yourself getting bored, go outside, take a nice jog around your neighborhood, and for once, be able to take a clean breath of fresh air!

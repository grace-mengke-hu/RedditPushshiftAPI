Quitting... again - 11hrs Smoke Free

I am 29 years old and I’ve been smoking since I was 13, which is more than half my life!! 

Growing up I said I would never smoke! I hated when my brother and parents would smoke. My grandmother also suffered from Emphysema caused by smoking which led her to a painful and early death. 

When I moved to a new town, I started smoking because I thought it would help me fit in and look cool. I am not sure when it no longer became the cool thing to do but rather something I needed to do. 

I have been on my quit journey for over 8 years now. I’ve quit several times using several methods (Allen Karr - Easy Way to Quit Smoking, Vaping, Nicoroette gum and cold turkey) but still manage to slip up somehow. However, Cold Turkey has been the best method for me so far. 

The good news is that every time I fail, I start to realize and learn more about what my triggers are. A few of them are; hanging around specific people, going to the pub/ drinking.

The longest I have gone without a cigarette is 3 months. I felt amazing! I was able to live in the moment, had energy, my skin was clear, I didn’t smell and I didn’t have to live in fear of getting caught smoking. I hide smoking from the people I work with and worse- the one I love -my partner which just feels awful! 

I feel like the novelty and excitement wears off after the 3 month mark and the motivation to continue to fight the cravings becomes less powerful.

Does anyone have any tips for when your out drinking or how to keep up your strength after the hype wears off at the 3 month mark?????? 

Here’s to a new quit day! I never want to quit quitting. I am praying that one day it will stick. 

As of now I am 11hrs smoke free. I’m irritable and tired but know this too shall pass. 

Thank you to everyone who has shared their success stories and struggles. Reading these stories has kept me so strong in many times of weakness.

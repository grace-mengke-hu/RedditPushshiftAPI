My 8th day!

Hi guys, I just wanted to post my progress. I started smoking at 14, and after 11 years, I have finally decided to quit for real. I quit last year for 3 months but had a really tough time at work that contributed to a slide back into addiction. My previous attempts before that lasted no long than 5 days, so in all honesty that 3 month quit period last year really made me happy and I realized I COULD beat this habit...that I just had to keep my willpower up in times of stress. This is a great subreddit, and I am glad I found it! I can't wait to post my one year update :) !

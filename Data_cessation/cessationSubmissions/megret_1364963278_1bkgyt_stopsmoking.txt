Six months!

If you're thinking of quitting and just perusing posts here, let me tell you that you can do this. I did this. 

I smoked 3 packs a day.

I chose buying cigarettes over buying food, pretty much every time.

With cigarettes at $10.81/pack, I sold off my stuff (books, DVDs, CDs, *car*) to afford smokes.

If my family offered to buy me a plane ticket to visit them for the holidays, I wouldn't go if it meant I couldn't smoke due to my niece with the respiratory issues.

I'd get up two hours early so I could smoke nearly a pack before leaving for work. I'd get to work at least half an hour early so I could smoke at least two cigs before going in. If the bus was coming in fewer than 10 minutes, I would just wait for the next bus and just chain smoke until it showed. If my lunch break was cut short I'd just drink coffee and smoke four cigarettes instead of eating the free, hot meal in the cafeteria. 

Basically, if the choice was "have a cigarette" or "have anything else on the face of the planet," cigarettes won every single time.

It took many, many tries before quitting took hold. **Keep trying.** You'll get this. 

You've heard this from other folks, I'm sure, but believe me when I tell you - if I can do this, you can do this. Maybe six months from now you could be the one gloating to strangers on the internet about having money and not smelling gross!

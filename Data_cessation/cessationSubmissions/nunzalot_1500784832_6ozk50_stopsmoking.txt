Smoked myself to disgust

So last night I consciously took the initiative to quit. I decided to try the approach a friend of mine told me about when he quit. Basically lined up a few boxes of smokes and chain smoked myself into utter disgust, taking note of every pull, how it tasted, how it made me feel and what each pull gave me in return.. I went through 2 boxes and felt utterly disgusted and broken after taking that last pull and almost threw up, multiple times.. currently munching down on every apple I can get my hands on. I'm done

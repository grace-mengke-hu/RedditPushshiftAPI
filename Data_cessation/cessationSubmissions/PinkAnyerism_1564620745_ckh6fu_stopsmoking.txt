Day 26, it's been a rough few days

So I have some pretty bad anxiety issues but I've been dealing with them pretty well even while quitting so far. Well tomorrow I leave to travel 2 hours by car then 2 hours by plane to pick up my 3 year old son from his dad. Then after waiting 6 hours at the airport we will be flying back 2 hours on the plane and 2 hour car ride home. 

I don't travel much at all and doing this alone (well as the only adult anyway) is very stressful. I have to wake up at 3:30am tomorrow to be on the road by 4am so that I can be at the airport by 6am to make my flight at 7am. I'm scared, I'm nervous and feel very alone right now. It doesn't matter though because I will do anything for my kids so this is just another hurdle that I will overcome for him. Just like quitting smoking. 

Thanks for listening, just wanted to feel like I was connecting with someone for a minute. It's lonely here.

Over twenty five years clean.

I just blundered across this subreddit whilst playing with the random button.  When I quit I was working in the medical building of a three hundred bed state mental hospital, the local chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous held their meetings there.  I read all the posters and all the pamphlets and although my problem was with nictine not alcohol it all started to look very familiar to me.

I quit, and adapting to the strict AA line resolved to never partake of nicotine again.  I am a recovering nicotine addict.  I will live all of my days as a nicotine addict, I remain one puff away from falling all the way back to square one in the quitting process.  

It's that one puff I'll never take.

It can be done, take heart and tough it out it's worth it.

AA has a term for the "I'll just have one.." mistake, they call it "Stinkin' Thinkin'"  Beware of it.

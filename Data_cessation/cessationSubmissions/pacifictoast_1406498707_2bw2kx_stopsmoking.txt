Rounding the bend on one week

What's worked for me:

1) Stay busy, but don't push yourself to the point where you're exhausted and feel like you deserve to smoke.

2) Let people around you know that you're quitting, and try to spend as little time alone as possible. (I'm staying at work late until I know my wife is home so I don't have too many gaps where I could smoke without anyone knowing).

5 hours to go. Keep posting, I'm reading everyday.

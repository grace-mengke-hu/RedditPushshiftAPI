I didn’t give in

In my last post, I was extremely stress  and was contemplating smoking. Well, I didn’t give in and I’m so glad I stayed strong. My life lately has been a little rocky &amp; unsteady but smoking a cigarette wont make me feel better. Thanks to all who take the time to read and respond to my posts. Your encouragement gives me strength

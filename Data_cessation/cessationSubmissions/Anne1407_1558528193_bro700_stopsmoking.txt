Nicotine is as addictive as heroin

As explained [here](https://www.councilonchemicalabuse.org/ndfw-nicotine-vs-heroin.html):  

&gt; Research has shown that nicotine is just as addictive as heroin. The progression of addiction is the same for nicotine as it would be for heroin, or cocaine, or alcohol.  

I just wanted all of us to realise that we are quitting a drug that is as addictive as *heroin*, the stuff they warn you against in highschool, on our own! While it is legally available in so many places! We are doing this and we are good at it. Think of that, when your next craving hits.

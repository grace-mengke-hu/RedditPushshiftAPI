Don't forget to drink water. Nope. More.

Just a PSA. Water is your best friend. I'm Having a huge exodus of tar from my lungs right now and it probably wouldn't happen if I weren't drinking water. I chugged about 48oz of water an hour ago and immediately hacked up a few loogs with those nice brown spots in them. 

There are a lot of other benefits to drinking water (I say its more important than fruit juice which I think is a bad suggestion for raising blood sugar levels). 

So.. Don't forget about your good friend, H2O!

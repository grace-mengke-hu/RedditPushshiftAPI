Day 1 - Feeling great

Today is longest duration I have gone through without cigarettes or vaping. Its 3:30PM & the last time I had a smoke was ay 8:00AM.

I had quit cigarettes towards the end of December 2016 & switched to vaping. I feel in love with vaping. Loved the amazing sweet delicious fruity & bakery flavors. But hated coiling & wicking. Whenever I puffed on the vape I used to get this instant rush of energy. I loved it. On Thursday night I stopped vaping due to reasons which I have no answers to. Plus due to a series of incidents I experienced on Thursday night.

Went back to smoking analogs\cigarettes this Friday afternoon . Smoked analogs on Friday evening & all day on Saturday . TBH I had a love \ hate relationship with the cigarettes ; one part of me loved it..other part was like why am I smoking this disgusting stick. And I could smell the stink from the analogs.

Today morning I woke up & said to myself I wont smoke. Yet had two cigarettes in the car at 8:00AM . 

Reached the office at 9:00AM & talked to a colleague about it. He said me to handover the cigarette box to him & asked me to browse /r/stopsmoking  . Haven't smoked since then & I am committed to fight this battle. 

Looking forward to your support.

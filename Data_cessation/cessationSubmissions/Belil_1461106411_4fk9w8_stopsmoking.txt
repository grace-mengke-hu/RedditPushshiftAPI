Today is my last day as a smoker

I'm 35, and have been smoking pretty heavily since I was 18. Pack and a half / 2 packs a day. It's something I hate about myself, but something I've never been able to stop regardless of how many times I've tried to quit, or how many different ways I've tried. I've done pills, patches, gum...etc. etc. and nothing ever helps. This time I'm going to try cold turkey, which scares me a little bit since I have absolutely no will power. But I've decided I'm tired of this disgusting habit. 

I want to be a non-smoker, but the closer tomorrow gets, the more afraid of it I feel. It's something I want so bad, but I'm also afraid that I will fail. I've read Allen Carr's book, and have been looking into other things that might help. I've stashed suckers and gum in my desk in my office, as well as at home, and have gotten rid of all of my lighters and anything else that will make going back easier.

I want to quit for my kids, for my bank account, and for myself in general. Wish me luck!

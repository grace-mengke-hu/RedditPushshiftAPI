Dunno if this is funny in any way or not. Barely much craving, just more triggers.

I don't know why I am not crying to Marta, the girl downstairs for a cigarette or checking the butt can for cigarette buts, like mad. I just wonder how I am doing it. 

Oddly enough, since I got up, I haven't used the nicotine gum like I thought I might.

77 Days

As of midnight tonight, I will have not smoked a cigarette in 77 days. This is the second time that I have quit smoking cigarettes and as I did the first time, I just decided to stop smoking one morning (this time it was April 20). I am completely shocked that in all of the nights of going out drinking, laying outside by the pool, and long-distance driving trips, I have had zero drags of any cigarettes. I still have cravings just about every day, but even when I'm sitting with people who are smoking, I can still hold out.

I say all of these things to make the point that quitting sucks and it's damn hard but it CAN be done. Cravings are real and intense but just as quickly as they come about, they also go away. A friend of mine reminded me that sometimes you need to take it five minutes at a time -if you can make it five minutes without smoking, you can definitely make it another five minutes. Stay strong and keep your reason for quitting clear and vivid in your mind.

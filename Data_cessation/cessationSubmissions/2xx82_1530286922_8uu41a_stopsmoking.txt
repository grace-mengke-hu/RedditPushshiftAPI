A week into my relapse I'm back up to a pack a day. I can feel, see, smell, taste, and even hear the difference in my body. I'm so tired of this.

When does it end? Why am I afraid to quit again? Guys and gals, if you're smoke free right now remember this is your destiny if you take even one more puff.

Day 1

I have half a bottle of chantix in my drawer from when I quit 6 years ago for 3.5 years. Started back up slow, full blown smoking for 2.5 years now. I've quit drugs and alcohol recently, so now it's the next step. I figured this sub will help me stick to it. I'm about to bum a smoke from a friend, eat a meal, and never smoke again. I'm 26. I will succeed this time.

Best.

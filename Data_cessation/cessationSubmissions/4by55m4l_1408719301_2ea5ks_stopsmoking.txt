Getting Sick After Quitting?

Hey guys, so my quit is going quite well, I'm feeling very mentally stable and am not missing it at all, I haven't been overly irritable and it's going on 2 weeks!

About 4 days ago I started feeling really sick and just attributed it to coincidence but the symptoms have changed rapidly (felt like strep, then a head cold and now it's just a dry cough with a bit of phlegm). The symptoms have changed almost once every 12 hours. I've been feeling progressively better so I didn't go to the doc yet but a friend said this might be from quitting like it's my body healing/purging? 

Is this true? Or possibly true? That's scary to think about but good at the same time I guess.

Need Help Please

Hey all, I’m new here and this is my first post. I’ve been smoke free and nicotine free for over a year now and 4 months. I quit cold turkey. I started smoking when I was 14. I am 28 now. I was a pack a day smoker and made a promise to my oldest son (8) that I would quit for him (I wanted to anyways). Anyways, here I am a little over a year and I’m still craving nicotine, I think. I don’t want a cigarette, can’t stand them. But I have had a damn good craving for some Copenhagen long cut straight. Used to love the stuff from time to time. The reason I’m here is because ever since I quit, I have been depressed, really short tempered, short patience, and have no motivation to do daily tasks, and it is hard to find enjoyment in things I used to. My wife has threatened to pack up and leave from time to time. I have a hard time finding joy in anything. I’ve gained nearly 40lbs since then as well. I worked really hard to be nicotine free and free from smoking. I’m afraid to pick up dip because of getting addicted to nicotine again but I have really been wondering if it is what I’m missing in my life (nicotine)? I actually had a 30 minute phone call with Dr. Brad Rodu(tobacco harm reduction guy) yesterday and he said that out of his entire career he has not seen smokeless tobacco related cancer. I understand the gum problems but I have great oral hygiene. What I’m getting at is, is dipping to see if that’s what is wrong with me worth being addicted and the risk (I know is very small) cancer worth it? I need help and guidance everyone. I’m afraid my brain will never be how I was with nicotine. I used to be such a laid back and fun guy. Now it seems like I can blow up in a rage for almost no reason. Sorry for the rant but I’m just a dad and husband needing some advice to try and collect my sanity and be happy again. Thanks.

Looking to cut out vaping soon, looking for help!

So I'm over 70 days without a cigarette, and I was hoping by before 100 days I could cut out vaping. I currently am on 12g nicotine, should I go to zero, or is it worth attempting to just drop it all together. I was also looking for ideas on how people would fill the void. Thanks for any suggestions and help!

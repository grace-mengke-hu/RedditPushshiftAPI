17 years old, wanting to quit badly

I've been smoking for a year and I know how much of a stupid habit this is. Smoking is awful, I spend a shitload of money on cigarettes, I smoke 2 packs of cigarettes a week and it is pretty bad since I can't really control it. Whenever I go out to a pub or a club I feel empty on the inside without a cig in the hand, I feel anxious, this has become part of me and it's really bad. Whenever I'm outside I smoke non stop so the only thing keeping me away from cigarettes are staying inside.
I am on day 2 without cigarettes and I'd love some tips on how to stay away. Tomorrow is a big chance that I'll end up with a cig in my mouth because school starts so please any motivational shit is appreciated! Thanks a lot.

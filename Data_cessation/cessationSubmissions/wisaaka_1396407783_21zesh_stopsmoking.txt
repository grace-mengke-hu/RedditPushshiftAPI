Just hit a month for the first time in a long while...

I'm an occasional lurker.  I drop by from time to time to get inspired by all you fine folks.  I was just messing around with my widgets on my computer and dug up my "how long since I quit" widget.  Just set the date for my current effort and it was nice to see it sitting at 31.  I feel pretty good overall.

For those of you pondering the effort to quit and those who recently quit like I did, I can only share how I've done things so far.  I bought a crappy Blu menthol for the occasional cravings.  I had thought about getting set up with a nice vaping kit, but after having recently spent time with a couple of friends who also quit, I really didn't want to end up trading one expensive habit for another.  (Granted, vaping IS cheaper than cigarette smoking, but it's expensive in the mental/physical habit sense as you never really kick the nicotine habit if you feel it's now harmless.)

As of last week, that Blu is done and I have yet to feel a super need to get another.  I think I may end up with one more, or maybe not.  I think the most important thing here is attitude.  Did I want to quit?  No, I really didn't.  I had to override my desire with my intellect and love for my wife.  I don't want her to outlive me because I'm making stupid choices.  I also don't want to end up with a permanent hacking cough or other debilitating health problems.  

So, in short, please quit now while you have a bigger chance to positively impact yourself and your loved ones.  Actually, think of it this way... how long ago did you smoke your last cigarette?  That's when you quit.  It's up to you to not start back.  You can do it.

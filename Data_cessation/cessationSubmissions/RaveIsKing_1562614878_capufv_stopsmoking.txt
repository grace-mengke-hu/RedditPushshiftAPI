Giving It A Go

I’ve been smoking for about 10 years. Sometimes a pack per day but it usually takes me 2 days. On July fourth I hurt my back playing sports on the beach and went to a chiropractor who told me my blood pressure was way too high and he couldn’t work on me just in case of problems. I’m 29 so i really shouldn’t be having these problems yet and it really scared me. I’ve been checking my blood pressure daily since that and it’s gone down but it’s still worrisome and so I’m making a commitment to changes: eating better, drinking more water and less alcohol, and most importantly finally quitting smoking. I realized that I’ve just not felt great for a while and with this wake up call, I need to really do it this time. I’ve quit for 3 weeks before, but this time I have this sub and I’m buying the Allen Carr book and I hope that it’s enough. I need it to be. So far, reading these posts has been inspiring and helped me get past a couple of cravings. 

Yesterday I only had 5 cigs, and today I’ve left my pack in my car to make it just that much harder to get one. I’ve had 2 so far today, there are 2 left in the pack and I’m going to try my best not to buy another when it’s empty. Please wish me luck

do you want to quit smoking? here are few psychological tips will help you.

i am not going to lie i tried to quit so many times i just come back. what i realized is the junk thoughts that made me go back to smoking. three easy steps you need to do in your brain to quit smoking.

1. hate the smoking just hate the cigarettes  try your best to hate them and remember the worst experience in smoking them. remember the days when you smoke and feel dizzy sometimes and unhealthy. remind yourself of how you failed last time and how you felt after you smoked you felt like shit.

2. always remind yourself that your braid will bring junk thoughts so you can go back to smoke because it's craving to it and wants to fool you into smoking. like good memories on good old times when you smoked and how good you felt. just remind yourself all your hard work of trying to quit will be gone and this feeling wont last forever it's only first three weeks. your brain will try to play tricks on you into smoking. you would say something like just one cigarette only and that's it. no once you give up and smoke you will smoke again.

3. relaxation- always relax yourself and stay away from coffee or what ever makes you feel like smoking. keep yourself busy by eating food and and exercise by exercising you will feel more healthy and replace your bad habit with a good one.

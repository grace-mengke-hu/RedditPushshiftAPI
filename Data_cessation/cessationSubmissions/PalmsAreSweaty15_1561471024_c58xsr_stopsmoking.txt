I dream of Juuls .... almost everyday

I am in my first week of quitting vaping. After considerable research, I’ve realized that all though safer than cigarettes, vaping can be quite harmful. I’m even more addicted to nicotine than ever before, thanks to my JUUL. It has started to show on my skin and I feel sick and disgusted with myself every time I give in to the temptation. 

But it’s been 6 days without it and I can say I’ve spent the last 3 nights dreaming about it. I keep wanting to postpone my quit date and give in to the temptation. I feel weak. Yet with every passing hour that I don’t vape, I do feel strong. It’s weird. It’s uneasy. Help me. Please motivate me.

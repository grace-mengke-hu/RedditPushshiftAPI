Quit while you live with a smoker

I've been smoking for almost 10 years, I quit 5 months ago but I relapsed due very stressful situation , I relapsed 2 weeks ago, I used to smoke a pack a day, but nowadays I smoke around 10 cigs/ days. My mom is staying with me for couple of month and she is a heavy smoker , I wanna try to help her but she is something 60s years old and she been smoking since she was a teen. Before I help her I need to stop smoking. 
How can I do that while living with a smoker?
I can't kick her out 
I can't tell her you are not allowed her
I can't force her to do anything 

She is not the problem , I mean she is because she is smoking around me , but I'm looking for an advice so I can quit smoking and still be around my mom

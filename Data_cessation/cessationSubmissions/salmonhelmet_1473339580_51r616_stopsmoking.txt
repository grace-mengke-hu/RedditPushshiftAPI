Lost 100 lbs in 6 months. Reversed my diabetes. Stopped being a junk food junky...can't quit smoking.

Don't know what I need or what it'll take. Made it as long as a year and a half quitting with an e-cig and various 1-3 month stretches on pretty much every other product out there. I'm exercising. Running. Still clutching to my smokes. It's counter to everything I'm doing and everything I've accomplished. Why can't I quit smoking?!?!?!

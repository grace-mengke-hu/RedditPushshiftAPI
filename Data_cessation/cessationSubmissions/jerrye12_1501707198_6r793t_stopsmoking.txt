Time to quit. Day 1 of Chantix

I have been smoking for about 7 years. I quit for about a year after my daughter was born, and I vaped instead, but after my vape broke a few months ago, I picked up smoking again. I don't want my daughter to grow old enough to have memories of her dad being a smoker, so I need to quit now. Today is my first day of taking Chantix. I've read some horror stories about it after searching reddit for it but have a hard time believing it can be that bad. I am a very mellow guy. There is very very little that can get under my skin or bother me, and I haven't had a nightmare in 5 plus years so I can't see myself having them all of a sudden. I'm wondering if knowing about the side effects in detail before experiencing them can help cull them. If not, I think nightmares are worth finally quitting. Has anyone else known what could happen beforehand and still have the side effects (nightmares, anger, depression, etc.) happen? I also plan to read Alan Carr's 'Easy way to quit smoking'. I honestly don't enjoy smoking anymore and feel it is just a habit that is hard to break at this point, and I really hope I will be able to.

Day 5, the hardest for me, so far.

I've been smoking since I was 15 (36 now). Usually around one pack a day. 

Never really felt my health was deteriorating because of smoking, but this last year I started coughing randomly and I was a bit worried. I have 3 boys and really want to see them grow up. 

Last friday I decided to quit smoking. First 4 days were easier than I expected, really, but today I'm having a harder time. I'm confident I can manage the urge, though. 

Feeling that I'm able do beat the addiction is great. Feeling that I actually did beat it must be much better. We'll get there.

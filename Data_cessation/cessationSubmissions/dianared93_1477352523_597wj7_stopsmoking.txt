Day two of no cigarettes.

I feel like complete and utter shit. I'm starting to get sniffly and having a horrible cough, which I have realized now is a quitters flu. I really want to quit, but I'm seriously so on edge that I feel like punching someone and crying. My mood swings are out of control, and I'm scared of inducing an anxiety attack (I started to smoke because of anxiety). I need to do this, though. For me, for my health. Reading through other's posts have really helped. I just need to get through today, and start tomorrow again.

Update: I caved and bought a pack last night and I smokes about four. And I feel horrible. It really wasn't worth it and made me feel even more sick. I locked the pack up, my finances safe actually. Starting over again. Thanks for the encouraging words guys!! I'll have these to read in my times of weakness.

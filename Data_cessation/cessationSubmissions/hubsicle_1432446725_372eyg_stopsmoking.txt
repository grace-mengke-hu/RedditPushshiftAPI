I'm back for more quitting!

Hey everyone! This place was a big help to me quitting smoking a few years ago, I stayed quit for 2 years!!! But I hit some hard times, and started up again. I'm not sure how long, I don't even  want to figure it out, I just need to stop. Almost 2 years ago, I had a minor heart surgery, I was born with a heart thing, it was 2 years before that I became aware of it, and quit out of fear. Well, since they fixed the problem, I slowly lost that since of impending doom, and started slowly thinking I could just do it here and there...now I'm finding myself doing it A LOT every day. The thing is- I just have to stop. I don't really want to, I love doing it (just like everyone I know ), but smoking is bad even without a heart disease. And while it wasn't caused by smoking, it for sure isn't helping it. It was so stupid of me to start back up knowing how ridiculously hard it was on me to quit. It was about 2 full weeks of real hard core depression. I really am in a tough situation in my life right now, and I know that it might be bad timing, but instead of that, I'm looking at it like its a symbol of starting again. I have some big deal things to face in the coming weeks, but if I can quit this too, by the end of the year, I think everything will be in a much better place.  I've relyed on smoking heavily these last few months, and I feel some tiny motivation to quit tonight, and I am just going to run with that feeling! So here's to all around a new life, and taking the big leap (once again...sigh). Today I quit smoking!

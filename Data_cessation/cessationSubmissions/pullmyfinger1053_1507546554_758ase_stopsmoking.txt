Feeling well gutted.

So after my post over the weekend beating drinking and smoking I had a moment of weakness and ended up bumming a few cigs last night right at the end of the weekend. 

Everything has really built up all at once and the stress is unreal.

One thing is for certain though, my resolve has never been stronger! Those couple of filthy soldiers of death tasted/smelt completely disgusting and never in a month of Sunday's were they ever worth it. 

Time to reset that counter and cowboy up!

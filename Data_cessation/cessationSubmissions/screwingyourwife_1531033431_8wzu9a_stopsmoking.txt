The uptick in personal photos/stories in this sub

I’m tired of people trying to get attention and turning Reddit into Facebook.

Don’t want to unsubscribe but I’m also not trying to put people down but I’m also not trying to see people’s faces that I don’t know or care about. If you need support, use some other means than posting your big face on my phone. 

We are all here for the same reason and it’s not a sob story or your face. It’s to stop smoking. So if you need support, please reach out.

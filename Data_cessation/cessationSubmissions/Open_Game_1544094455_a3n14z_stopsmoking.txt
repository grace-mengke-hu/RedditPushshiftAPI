Hi all; Just found this sub and subscribed right away.

I just recently quit smoking(again) two months ago, and this time I’m sure I got it. I turned to vaping and it helped a lot. 

I realized I wasn’t addicted to cigarettes, but nicotine. I don’t plan on vaping long; I want to ween off within a year. 

I thank you all for your stories and support. Keep fighting.

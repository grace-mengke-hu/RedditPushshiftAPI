90 Days, getting my strongest cravings since 2 weeks in

So today is my 90 days.  I'm super stoked about that, and have no plans on stopping stopping anytime soon.  I just needed to chat a bit cause I'm getting some pretty strong cravings today.  
  
Last 90 days have been unreal.  My last post was at 10 days in I think, I mentioned I was gaining weight.  Well, I've been able to gain 30 lbs since I quit, which is a huge accomplishment for me.  I was previously at only 1 meal per day, pretty much anorexic was 6'2 and weighed 140lbs.  Gaining 30lbs has basically renewed my lease on life.  
  
I've never felt stronger, more confident, or more attractive.  I know people often say 'do it for your health', but my body has literally changed completely.  I can gain and keep muscle, my cheeks aren't sunken, and I can't see my ribs or tendons anymore.  
  
It's amazing how intertwined aspects of one's life actually are.  Smoking impacts so many different aspects of one's self.  The change can be startling, but I promise if you stick with it, you'll only find positive things building.  
  
So, even though I'm hurting today, I have no intentions of going back to cigarettes.  I can actually see the benefits accruing everyday, and I love who I'm becoming.  
  
Hang in there people!  I believe in you all, and know that you have what it takes to become/stay non-smokers.

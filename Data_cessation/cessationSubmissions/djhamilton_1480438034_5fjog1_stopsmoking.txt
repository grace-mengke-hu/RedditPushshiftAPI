Here we go! Tomorrow we stop! Nicotine free! Yup Cold Turkey!

Almost hitting 30 and still smoking, Enough is enough and now this time, i am Physical and Mentally ready for this life changing step.  i set a date and Its coming tomorrow, Last day of smoking today!

I have attempted to give up in the past using replacements, some methods more successful than others. 
My longest period was 9 months, But at the time i lost someone who was very close to me. 
Moment of weakness and relapsed (I was using Champex at the Time, i had finished the course many many months ago)

You all know the story, a single Puff or Cigy and the whole cycle continues. 

This time i am more determined than ever, I dislike the taste, i hate smoking, and the amount it costs! I actually have nothing i can say i like about it, Other than it helps to keep me at bay when things are hard! 

Well enough enough you filthy addiction, I want you gone and i want you gone for good! 

Why did i decide to go Cold Turkey, Apart from Champex, its the quickest way to remove Nicotine all together and stop feeding the addiction, Am a strong minded person (I think) 
So ill be dammed if i see myself break or crack! 

Here i am making my stance, Announcing it to the world! and not turning back. 
I will look forward to returning and giving you all an update how i get on, and how torcherous going Cold turkey is.

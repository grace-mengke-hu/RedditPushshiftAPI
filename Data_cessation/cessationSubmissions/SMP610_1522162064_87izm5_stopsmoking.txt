Using vaping as a method to quit

Hi everyone,

I recently have decided to try to quit smoking and to much of my surprise switching from cigs to the sourin drop was done with semi ease. I guess why I’m posting here is I’m wondering if anyone else had made the switch and if it really counts as quitting since I’m still dependent on the vape? Any help is appreciated I’m continually hard on myself for using it but am terrified of quitting

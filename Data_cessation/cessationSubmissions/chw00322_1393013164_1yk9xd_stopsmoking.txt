Two weeks in :)

Hi everybody, I stopped 14 days ago today and I am still going strong and happier than ever. I have tried to quit a lot of times over the last ten years, but for some reason I smoked that last one from the pack and decided never to buy another pack. For some reason, this time it wasn't even hard. I just want to say to those who are thinking about it, if you keep a positive attitude, breath deep and actually want it you can do it! Good luck everybody!

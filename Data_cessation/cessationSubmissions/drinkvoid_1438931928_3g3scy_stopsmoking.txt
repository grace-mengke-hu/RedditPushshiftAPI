333 days!

Checked the sub coincidentally to find out it's halfway to 666, hahaha! The 1 year mark is approaching fast! Also, apart from the occasional smoking-related dream (followed by a terribly bad conscience in the morning, I'm sure you know what I mean!), I have no relation to cigarettes in any way. No cravings. Nothing. It feels very nice at the moment (And yet I think it is wise to always stay wary, because going back to square one is as easy as taking a single puff) 

Speaking of dreams, I dreamt of baking hash brownies tonight, haha. I thought it was a sweet dream because I thought "Thank god it's just a brownie, no smoke for me!" the entire time. Haven't had any hash brownies in over half a year, so no idea where that came from, haha! 

Anyways, will check in back again at the 1 year mark! 

New (and regular) quitters don't feel shy to ask if you have any questions or need some advice! That's what this sub is for after all! (you can always message me if you don't feel comfortable about posting, too :) )

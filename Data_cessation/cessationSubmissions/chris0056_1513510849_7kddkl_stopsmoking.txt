Going to quit Monday....

I've tried to quit many times and what really gets me is the sadness of not smoking again. I tell myself it's just my brain fucking with me but I get so sad I tear up.  It's absolutely crazy. I can handle the crankiness and the cravings but it's really the what thing that gets me to cave. Do you guys have any advice to overcome this feeling?

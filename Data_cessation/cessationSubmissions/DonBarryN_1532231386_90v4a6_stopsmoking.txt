Anyone quit smoking when everything else went wrong?

My business just went under, I lost all my money, nobody wants to hire an old failure. I have health issues, I’m in AA so no  drugs and alcohol, also started In another program where I’ve cut off other fun, I live in a dull place with zero friends, I’ve been fighting depression for 40 years and things have recently gotten much worse, my wife says I don’t love her as does my mom, my step-daughter nicknamed me “Lint” because that’s how much I matter to her, and my Dad, the only person I was sure loved me, just died.  With all that I’ve chosen now to quit smoking, the only thing I enjoy.  So am I insane?  Frankly I don’t see any of the rest getting better, so I just figured “Why not quit smoking” I’m already suffering.

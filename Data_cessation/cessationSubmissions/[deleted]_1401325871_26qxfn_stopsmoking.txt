40 days smoke-free and pounding the treadmill!

I had my last cigarette well over a month ago. I have asthma, so when I smoked I could barely run 1km on the treadmill without nearly passing out.

But since I've stopped smoking, I've managed to run 4km in 30 mins! It's not much, but it's something and I feel great! 

I went cold turkey, and even though it was hellish for the first two weeks and the cravings are there, I really feel like I can do this.

I just want to say thanks to you guys because this subreddit finally gave me the motivation to quit. Thank you! Keep posting your success stories because they really give me hope. :)

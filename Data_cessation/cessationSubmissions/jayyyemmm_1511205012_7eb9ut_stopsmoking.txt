It’s been 2 days, 9 hours and 5 minutes since my last cigarette. Proud of myself.

Been smoking since I was 12/13 years old and now that I’m coming up to 21, I finally decided enough is enough. I did not realise how much time I gave to smoking and how much money I spent after becoming a regular full-time smoker (roughly $3100 annually!!!) 

I really just want to enjoy my twenties (and the rest of my life) and not have it controlled by an addiction to cigarettes. Wish me luck!

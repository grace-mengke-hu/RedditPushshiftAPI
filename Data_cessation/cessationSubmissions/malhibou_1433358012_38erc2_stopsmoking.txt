Feeling good, but insane eye twitch!

Second smoke free day, but first nicotine free day (was using gum) and I have the CRAZIEST eye twitch going. Does anyone else get these? I am actually feeling pretty good: no big cravings, chewing regular gum and drinking a lot of hot water with lemon. But this eye twitch is making me feel like maybe I'm only pretending to feel fine, when really I am bubbling under the surface?

Except if I am pretending to feel fine and I believe it, then isn't that just feeling fine? AGH. Nicotine withdrawal = mindfuck.

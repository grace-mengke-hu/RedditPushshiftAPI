Quitting vaping

I have smoked cigs off and on previously, mainly when drinking etc. Not as a regularly daily thing since I have been an adult. (i'm 30m now).

About June 2014 I started to smoke e-cigs and vapes, that my friends had, more commonly as a replacement for those times when I would usually smoke a cigarette. Which is a good thing.
Except, mark10 kept sending me free shit in the mail, and my friends and sister would give me their free shit as well. 

Then I discovered that you can actually refill the mark10 cartridges with any old vape juice and carry around extra batteries. I even had a more typical vape pen but I liked this other method better.

I think around September, a girl I was dating all the sudden disappeared, among other problems in my life, I was vaping more, and I think both of those things in particular lead me into working out less (from 3-5 times a week to like 1) which probably also lead to more stress and depression and less motivation overall. And it seems to have been getting worse and worse, even though I am over the silly girl.

I started smoking more and more constantly on 15-18mg juices typically. And it also helped to keep me alert and curbed hunger because I haven't had a good sleep schedule and often don't have time to eat properly if at all.

So yesterday was my last hit, and today I have been feeling really fuzzy, tired, restless, and even lacking concentration. I rainchecked a date I had planned tonight and dodged calls from people all day and didn't do fuck all when I have a ton of stuff I need to do, I think because of the withdrawals or effects of the nicotine etc.

TL;DR Accidentally became addicted to e-cigs and am quitting cold turkey in the hopes that I can start working out regularly again and feel better overall. Not sure how long this takes, hopefully I will be back to normal in a few weeks.

edit- had a dream last night that I was vaping and i was mad that I just gave in so early.

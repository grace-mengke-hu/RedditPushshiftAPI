Thinking back to 101 days ago and why I finally quit smoking

I had just gotten home from a family reunion in the mountains of Colorado. We had a 16 person cabin we rented up in the mountain. With wonderful fresh air, and perch temperatures. Every morning I'd wake up, and hike up the mountain and have a smoke. When I came back down, I would have a coffee and chat with one of the family members who where up at the time, and for 8 days straight it was "oh god, did you just smoke?" I would ask can you smell it on my clothes? and invariably they seem to have just been on the patio and could smell it waft through the pines and boughs. 

I felt incredibly guilty, and tried further away, button it was just on my clothes. I tried downwind but it was still on my clothes. Everywhere I went in this serene habitat the filth of cigarettes followed me around.

Then we get to the actual reunion/grandparents 60th anniversary being held at Frot Collins State Park. In a group of 40+ people or so there will always be the sub section of smokers, I went to hang with them and have a couple smokes. Turns out, I have nothing in common with that side of my family. They are a bit like the "Swamp People" of the "Mountain Folk". They are wonderful people, for the type of people that like those type of people.

Now my grandparents (why did i mention them) well, a 60th anniversary is totally astounding. I had just gotten married in April. Being here in Fort Collins, with my newish wife (75ish days at the time). I realized that if I where to ever have a 60th anniversary with her. I needed to Quit. Immediately.

Leaving the park I threw away my last couple smokes and at 6pm on June 30th I became a non-smoker. 

TL;DR at Grandparents 60th made e want to have my own 60th so I quit smoking.

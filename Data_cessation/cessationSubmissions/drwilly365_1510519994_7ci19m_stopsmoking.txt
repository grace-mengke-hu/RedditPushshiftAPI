When are you a non-smoker?

Just curious, when did you feel that you could really call yourself a non-smoker? 

Having tried so many times to quit I am still having a hard time to knowing if I actually made it.

I quit 21 days ago, but I slipped up last weekend and I am still dependant on nicotine replacements, so I really don't feel that I can call myself smoke-free.

I think my own definition is when I have made it 1 month without smoking or any other nicotine in my system. For me that would be the line between trying to quit smoking and officially having succeeded.

Any opinions? When will be/was your line where you could officially call yourself a non smoker?

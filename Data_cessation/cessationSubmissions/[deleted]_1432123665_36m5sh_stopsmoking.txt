Extra projects that have consumed me too much. Part of a smoking cycle?

Just as I've quit smoking, I find myself walking away from a bunch of sideline projects/hobbies that have consumed me too much over the past months. Is it part of a cycle?

I get these bursts of energy in which I quit smoking, get super healthy, do great at my job, and take on creative sideline projects/hobbies. Months go by during these bursts, and I seem to manage it all just fine, the one thing feeding energy into the other. 

Crash. Things get too just much. The whole pattern falls apart, one plank at a time. I keep up my job commitments, but minimally so. I start smoking. Drinking too. I don't work out. 

Inevitably I get sick of this and try to reboot. I dump all the extras and just focus on the important things. Quit smoking and drinking. Do my job properly. Have some fun. Workout. My energy balance is restored. 

Soon I even have surplus energy. I get a neat idea for a project ... it all starts over again.

Cycles? Sound familiar? Any thoughts?

Quitting...Again

After more than a year without smoking, I started again during a trip with friends. It was a huge mistake, made because I was surrounded by smokers, in a city where everyone smoked, and because I love smoking. Even though I hate that I love it, I still love it. 

So today marks Day One all over again. Oh well, you live, you learn...

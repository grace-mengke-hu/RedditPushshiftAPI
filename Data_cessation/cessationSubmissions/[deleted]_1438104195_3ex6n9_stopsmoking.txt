It's not long but I'm proud!

I've always quit on and off but had never been able to resist smoking while drinking. I've decided I'm done now! I recently started seeing someone new who doesn't smoke and always tried to mask the smell of cigarettes everywhere I go. So far, I've only had a few bad craving. I've also decided not to drink for at least a month to keep myself from slipping. Wish me luck you guys, I know it is going to get more difficult. Any tips are appreciated!

Over the hump?

So it's day 4 for me, and yesterday was a doozy. I couldn't concentrate all day, experienced a sort of "out of my body" feeling, and just felt numb in general. I was extremely tired and ravenously hungry all day. I planned to sleep for 7 hours, but just couldn't get out of bed--I ended up sleeping for 13. Today I feel a lot better; am I just kidding myself, or have I gotten over the hump?

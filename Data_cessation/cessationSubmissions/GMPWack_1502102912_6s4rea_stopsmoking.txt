The start of day 4!!

It's back to the grind! I had a distraction filled weekend of cleaning out mom's basement. Her late husband was a fucking pack rat, so I'm going to have work for months! It helps that I can't smoke in mom's house, but when the cravings hit.....just keep working!!! Sort the scrap metal, take out the trash, sort out all of the tools he had (how many fucking circular saws did her dead husband need?!?!? He didn't even do construction!), and just don't think about those evil tobacco sticks!!

Gradual quitting with nicotine supplements?

I just bought nicotine gum today and want to start using it to cut back on my cigarette consumption. I have tried to quit cold turkey several times and I have never been successful. My thinking is that a gradual approach will be more sustainable to me, to slowly detach cigs from my routine and the activities I associate with it (which feel more imprisoning than the physical addiction honestly). 

So my questions are 1. is it safe to use nicotine gum in between cigarettes for the first few days or weeks? (I canâ€™t imagine it would be unsafe but I just feel nervous for some reason) and 2. has the gradual cessation worked for anybody else?

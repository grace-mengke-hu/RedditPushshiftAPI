Does quitting lower blood pressure over time?

I have had blood pressure in the high 140s low 150s. Im 23 years old and now im trying to quit. Has anyone had any luck with blood pressure lowering after quitting? I mean not just immediately but over time. Alot of articles say it doesent have an effect. Thanks.

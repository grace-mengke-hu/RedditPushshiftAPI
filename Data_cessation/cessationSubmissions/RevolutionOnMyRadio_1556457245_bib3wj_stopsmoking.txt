Moving from no hope to a little hope

Yesterday was my (M23) first full day without a cigarette touching my lips since I was 15 years old. I am using a vape pen. I had zero hope for myself, have known all the fucked up things about cigarettes and continued to chain smoke through it and just feel a little guilty about it. I've even bought vape pens in the past and still winded up smoking cigarettes along side it. I am still very skeptical of my self control but I didn't think i could go this long, either.

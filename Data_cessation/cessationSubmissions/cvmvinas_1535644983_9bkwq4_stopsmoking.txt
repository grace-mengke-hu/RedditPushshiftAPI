Is it advisable to quit smoking and use the alternative which, for me, is vaping?

I'm a week away from my graduation and actively decided to end my smoking habit with it. I kinda thought that it would be great to reminisce my college life in the near future and think that I was a heavy smoker then. I reached out to my friends, and though they discouraged me and negates all my efforts by still giving me a stick or two, we broke even and told me that 'go the vaping route' which is buying e-cig/vape (no idea what it the difference is).

Is this a good next step? Or nah?

Need help from pros here. Also, my first post in this sub. Be nice to me

Day 1!

I'm pretty psyched. I've been wanting to quit for years, but for some reason it just seemed impossible until the other night. I've realized that I'm my biggest stumbling block, always turning cravings into these epic battles of willpower, which they really are not. I think I've reached the point where smoking doesn't seem like a cure-all and I can't even say I enjoy it much anymore.

So, I'm signing up here to keep track of my days! I hope I rack them up quickly, or at least have patience with myself if I stumble one or two times on my way to the ultimate goal!

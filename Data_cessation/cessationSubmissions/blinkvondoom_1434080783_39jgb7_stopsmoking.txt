Okay so here I go....

Alright so I have been a smoker of 15 years of a pack and a half a day for for maybe 8 years. I have "quit" smoking for about 3 months. I say "quit" because I always smoke 1 or 3 when I go out to the bar or play D&D with friends. 

Here's what what I want. I actually want to be smoke free. Like not get drunk and have a smoke. I'm not asking for kudos or praise. I'm just looking for somewhere to be accountable and post that I'm not sucking... 

So here I go. Day 1.... wish me luck or not. I will post updates of my not hopeful failures.

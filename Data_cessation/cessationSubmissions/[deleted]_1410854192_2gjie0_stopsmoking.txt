Mind if i join ?

Hi there,  

I finally decided it was time to get serious with dealing with my worst habit. Having managed to quit a few times in the past (the longest being 2 1/2 years) i want to get myself clean and stay that way till the day i die. 

Just wanted to say hello and see you on the otherside!

Non-stop Energy

Day 4 here. Anyone else feels like they have way too much energy throughout the whole day? 

I feel like i've been on uppers since day 2 of my quit. It's very good for my productivity, but I get this feeling that a crash is waiting at the end of this, when my body gets used to this no smoking thing.

Anyone had this experience early on? What can I expect in the upcoming weeks?

Great job to everyone staying strong through this process, keep it going!!

Hard Time

Boys ‘n gals, I’ve been quit for a few weeks now. Had been quit nearly a year until my ex-friend lit me up on a bogus tobacco filled joint. But that’s neither here nor there. 

My real problem is love making. I make love. Then I want to smoke. Making love makes me want to smoke so bad that my love making partner has a hard time concentrating and our made love is not as sensuous as it needs to be. So what do you people do pre-during- and post love making?? Any tips would be helpful. Not just the tip though! LMAO! HEY-O

I really miss that in progress love making cigarette. When your bodies are slithering against each other, grunts fill the air and you pause, reflect on your current love making sesh and light up a hot one, take a major haul and then burrow yourself in for another bout of carnal love making.

Willpower is a muscle that can be strengthened

I've been thinking a lot about willpower today; for some reason, 11 days in, this has been my hardest day in terms of cravings. In the past, my excuse doe relapsing has frequently been that "I have no willpower," as if my tendency to cave was a genetic tic I was born with. But now I think that's bs. Willpower is a muscle that gets stronger the more you use it - every cigarette you say no improves it. Just a thought.

I genuinely wanted to quit and these 4 weeks I’ve been tap dancing with joy and energy the whole time... And now I’m crashing. The sleep deprivations and nightmares are finally fucking winning.

It’s been such a fucking high, and now, stress is kicking me in the fucking balls and I’m spiralling.... My lovely girlfriend is coming home soon, worried at how depressed I sound.... I know it’s hormones or what have you... But FUUUUUCCCKKKK 4 weeks in? REALLY? IT DOESN’T STOP YET?

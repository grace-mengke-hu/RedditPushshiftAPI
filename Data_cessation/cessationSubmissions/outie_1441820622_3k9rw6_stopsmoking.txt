Been a while since I've had these issues, but my wife and I both are having increasingly intense cravings over the last few weeks.

Idk what the deal is. Just within the last month or so I've been getting cravings for the first time since I can remember. We both quit when she was pregnant with our first daughter, almost a year ago. I thought we were free, but the days at work just keep getting longer and longer without that release to look forward to. 

I think thats the problem, I used to look forward to a nice smoke break I would tell myself I deserved after working hard for a few hours. But what is there really to look forward to in taking that smoke break? I have enough control and sense to know that it isn't worth it, but the cravings keep coming. Anyone have similar experience? It's nothing I can't handle, but it's really getting annoying as they become more frequent throughout the day.

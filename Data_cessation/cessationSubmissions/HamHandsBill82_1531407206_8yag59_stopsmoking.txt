Slipped up.

Light to moderate smoker for about 12 years. I can make it about two days cold turkey, then I just routinely slip up. The thought of a smoke just consumes me. The urge just comes at work during times of "stress" but sometimes I feel I'm just inflating the "stress" in my head to get to have a smoke. Does that make sense?

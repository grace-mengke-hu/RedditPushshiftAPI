Tomorrow, at 7 am, I will smoke my last cigarette.  Who wants to be my quitting buddy on this horrible journey?

I have one cig left in my pack, and it would be a joke to say I'm not going to smoke it.  I am going to smoke it before class tomorrow at 7 am, and was wondering if anybody was planning on quitting tonight/tomorrow and would "join" me metaphorically on my 5th attempt at quitting.

PMs and any other responses are welcome.

Thanks for all the motivation!

I beat the nicotine monster, but lost when I had my guard down...

After 16 years of smoking I decided to battle the nicotine monster and after too many retries, I won. I was a nonsmoker for three whole years, until one night when I had a beer with a friend and thought I actually could smoke ONE cigarette. And I did. Damn I regrated that decision. 

So today I've been smoking nonstop for 6 months. In the mean time, I've tried and failed 20 times to stop once again.

It's really hard this time and not even Allen Carr's book helps (have read the book 10 times now).

Any suggestions? Am I screwed?

Please bear my bad English, it's not my native language.

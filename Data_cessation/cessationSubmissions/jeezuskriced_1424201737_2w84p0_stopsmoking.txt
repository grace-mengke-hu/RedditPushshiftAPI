Smoking weed for cravings? Helpful or counter productive?

I've been smoke free for almost two days now. I only had one major craving, and I ended up smoking a joint (rare for me) last night to help me relax and get to sleep. I noticed that the act of smoking the joint, which was very similar to smoking a cigarette killed my craving completely and I ended up sleeping like a baby. Is it a bad idea to smoke weed especially in joint form after recently quitting? Or can I use it as a relatively safe tool to fight cravings? It certainly helped but by no means do I want to replace a 10 cig a day habit with a 10 joint a day habit. I also don't want to slow down my body's natural cleaning process. I've been vaping (weed) for medicinal purposes for years now, I rarely smoke it any more, but I noticed that smoking the joint totally killed my craving where as vaping only relieves them. Anyone else have experience with this?

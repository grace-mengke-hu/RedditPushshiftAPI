Very happy to have reached 100 days.

It seemed difficult/impossible to think I could go 100 days, but here we are! The first few days sucked, but then it was much easier to stay strong. Cheating is the absolute worst thing - you convince yourself that you're giving yourself a break, but you're really plunging yourself back into that first few days of hell and fresh withdrawal. Stay strong! Reading this sub is a great source of inspiration and support.

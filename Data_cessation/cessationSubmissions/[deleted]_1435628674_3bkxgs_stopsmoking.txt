Tomorrow is the day. I'm not turning back again. I have to quit once and for all.

Yesterday morning I bought a pack. Thought it was gonna last me at least until today. Last night I opened it and had 4 left. If I don't stop now...I don't know when I will. I bought a pack this morn and finally finished Allen Carr's book and this is my LAST FINAL CIGARETTE. I have been hacking up shit all day, coughing so bad,
Throat is killing me. But really the cigarettes are killing me. Fuck. Just have to vent. I'm done smoking. I'm ready to be a non-smoker.

Edit: I meant last final cigarette of my life. Not in the pack. There's still 17 in the pack but I'm done done done. Throwing it out. Sorry, I should have specified.

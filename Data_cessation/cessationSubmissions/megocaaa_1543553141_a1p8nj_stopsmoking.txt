I hadn’t smoked in ages and broke down on the side of the busy ass interstate and relapsed for a day. I’m about 72 hrs into being cigarette free again. I ran today and I’ve been smoking a little pot which I’d been doing less of. I’ve been coughing shit up all day after a cold 4 mile run. Any ideas?

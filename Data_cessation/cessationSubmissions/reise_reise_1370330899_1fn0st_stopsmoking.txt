I snapped.. but it's still a positive experience.

It had been 2 days, approaching 3 today. I'm not in a good place - I'm medicated for depression and an anxiety disorder, so I get agitated easily. The medication helps, but the anxiety and depression is obviously still there. For these past 2 days I've been fidgety to say the least. Restless, haven't been sleeping well, etc. I snapped about 10 minutes ago and bought a 20 pack of smokes (which, I think is an achievement in itself. I usually buy around 45-50 smokes at a time). I'm not particularly a "heavy" smoker, never been on a pack a day or anything.

I smoked one, and while I was smoking, time went very slow. I felt like I was just waiting for it to finish. I never used to feel like that. I used to think cigarettes never lasted long enough, I had to make myself not light up another after one finished - not this time. I put it out, sat there and thought.. how did this become a vice for my anxiety?

I'm not saying I'm going to throw the rest of them away now. I'd end up getting anxious over throwing $10 in the trash. A lot of people like throwing them out because they don't have the temptation to do it. For me it's a little different.. I like to know I have the strength to avoid them when they're available, right there on the table. 

All in all, I'm proud of myself in a first attempt. These past 48 hours are the longest I've gone without a smoke in almost 3 years. Although I'm disappointed that I had a few minutes of weakness, I'm ready to try again soon, and I know that I can trust myself to say when I'm ready to do it.

I don't think I would've made it for those 48 hours without reading encouragement from you guys here at r/stopsmoking. You're all awesome.

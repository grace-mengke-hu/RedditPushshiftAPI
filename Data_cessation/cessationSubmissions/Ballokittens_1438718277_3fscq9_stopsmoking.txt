Stress getting to me

Cravings have come back hard!  The last couple days have been rough man.  I am working a lot and getting to the end of this class I'm taking which all together has me very stressed.  In my first week without cigarettes my biggest triggers seemed to be being around people who smoke and driving.  But now that I'm feeling stressed around the clock I feel like I want a cigarette just as bad as I did in the beginning.  Jobs and school will cool down in a week.  Is it worth caving for a week to get me through this and then starting over after that?

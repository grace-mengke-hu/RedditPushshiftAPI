Hello stopsmoking!

As I'm sure many of you have, I have quit many times at various times for various lengths of time.  My most "successful" was many years ago after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way.  I quit for about 3 months then and felt great, no urges, just a happy non-smoker.  New Years Eve rolls around and we're partying and having a good time and I decided that quitting was so easy that I could easily manage to smoke just for that night and be fine the next day.  That was sometime around 2002 or 2003.  Since then I've gotten married, have 2 kids, moved states, changed jobs, etc.  but kept on smoking.  So here I am about 20 or 21 hrs into it and doing great so far.  I've got my mind in a great place and looking forward to checking in with you fine folks to let you know how it's going.

Oh, BTW, I'm also over in stop drinking with 127 days under my belt there.

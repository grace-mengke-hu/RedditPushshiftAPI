How do I convince my father to start quitting smoking?

My father has been smoking since he was 15; he is now 48. I want to convince him to stop smoking, or at least be on the road to it. I know that convincing someone to quit an addiction is next to impossible, but I want to try at least. So I started by asking him why he smokes and what stops his from quitting. He came up with four reasons after some convincing:

1. I only smoke 5 a day

2. I exercise daily which helps get rid of the accumulation of bad chemicals in my lungs

3. I only inhale a little so not much of the bad stuff go into the lungs and I do not smoke the whole cigarette

4. My life is not dictated by cigarettes but by fate (hard to translate, kind of like "If I die by lung cancer, then it was meant to happen")

I just want to prove his points wrong so that he can't blatantly say smoking isn't bad at my face. I am wondering if there is any good responses to these points (especially 4, which is very philosophical). At least that will plant the seed in his mind to maybe start the process of quitting

Quitting Vaping

I know it's not exactly the same a smoking but this would be the closest place I can find for a support sub-reddit.  If I don't belong here let me know.
I had been smoke free for nearly 3 years when I started vaping.  It was just about a year ago actually as I had returned to school and the stress began to pile up.  Yesterday I came to the realization I needed to make a lot of changes in my life and getting rid of nicotine was near the top of the list.  I had my last puff around 1:30 yesterday afternoon.  I can tell you that coming off of e-cigs is very different than tobacco but still a struggle.  I don't have the head aches I had from tobacco but I definitely feel the light headedness as well as the inability to concentrate on anything (I apologize if this feels disjointed).  Again sorry if I'm in the wrong place but I just needed something.

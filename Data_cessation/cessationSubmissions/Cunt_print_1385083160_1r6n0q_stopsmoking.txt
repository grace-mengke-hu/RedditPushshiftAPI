Help me convince myself I'm not a smoker.

So to start off if like to say that I'm so overwhelmingly happy that there is, in fact, a subreddit for everything. 

I have been smoking an average of a pack a day since I was 15 years old. I'm now 29 and still smoking. I have had many, and I mean many, failed attempts at quitting. I want to so badly. I've wanted to quit since I realized I was addicted to nicotine at the age of 16. I've tried everything known to man to help both prescription and OTC as well as cold turkey. I find myself appalled daily at how big of a hold cigarettes have over my life. I hate the smell, I hate the taste, I hate everything about it yet I still can't stop. I'm desperate this time. Please give me your best tips and tricks for quitting cold turkey.

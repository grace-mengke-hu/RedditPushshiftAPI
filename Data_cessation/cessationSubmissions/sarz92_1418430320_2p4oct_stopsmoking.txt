11 days smoke free ðŸ˜Š

I've not had a cigarette for 11 days but I'm on nicotene replacement  and I have a e cig is this cheating?? I can't go without n.r or the e cig as all my family members I live with smoke in the house. people say I should be proud I haven't had a cigarette but i feel like well I'm still having nicotene but in a different way so I don't feel like I've acheived anything ??

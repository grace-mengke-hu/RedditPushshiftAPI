A good starting point.

Howdy all. I spent all of last weekend in the hospital for an MRSA infection. Of course there is no smoking in or around the hospital, so it was a 5 day forced quit. When I got out of the hospital I grabbed a smoke and lit it then put it right out. It was just nasty. So I figured that it was a good way to start quitting.

I started smoking back in '91, always with the assumption that I would quit soon, because I could. There were several times me and my friends would see who could "quit" the longest, with money on the line, but it was never a serious stop smoking event. Throughout all the years I kept convincing myself that I would quit when I got bored with it... but I never got bored with it. 

So here I sit at 9 days smoke free. Every once in a while I get the itch to go outside for a smoke but I distract myself with chat, games, or tv and pretty soon the itch goes away. Biggest test was yesterday and today with drinking a few beers. Gotta have that smoke with a beer. So far so good though. Looking forward to not craving it anymore.

Thanks for being here /r/stopsmoking

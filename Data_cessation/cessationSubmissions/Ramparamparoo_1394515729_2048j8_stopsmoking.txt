How can I get my dad to stop?

Hi guys. First of all I know this is probably asked a million times a day but I need help because it stresses me out and it also stresses my mom out. Okay first the story. Both my parents have been smoking since early 20's ( now early 40's) and they both quit very successfully almost a year ago with e-cig's. Then one day my dad had my uncle over and my uncle had a pack of Colts rum and wine. My dad had one and something visibly clicked and from there he went crazy with them. Every day he is going through a pack of these gross smelling little cigars. Every month he says he will quit but he never does.  It stresses me out so much because how amazing he was doing before these stupid fucking cigars. I have tried doing everything. I pester him and get mad at him. Every morning I put his e-cig where he can see it. I just don't know what to do. My mom fights with him about it everyday and so do I.  I just really need help. You guys are my last hope so please come through. Thanks for any help.

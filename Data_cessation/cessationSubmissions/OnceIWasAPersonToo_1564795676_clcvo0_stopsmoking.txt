Why is this $@!% so hard to quit. Need advice!

Been smoking since I was 12, regularly since 19. Im 24 now, and I can't kick this disgusting habit. Cigs are nasty and taste like garbage, vaping makes me feel like I have Asthma. Nicotine Gum just makes me want a cig.

I have attempted to quit numerous times, and when I do I cant stop thinking about nicotine every 5 minutes. I throw a pack in the garbage, 4 hours later i buy another pack.

I see the improvements so quickly when I do quit, I can taste things, breathe better, etc. within 24 hours. 

I have experience with other substances, and nothing even comes close to nicotines grip. Like I went from drinking 10 drinks a day for a year to quitting cold turkey, and the craving I got is 1/10000 what I feel when I attempt to quit nicotine

Im at the point now contemplating if I should quit my job and check myself into a rehab for a month for nicotine, this sounds ridiculous but within a year it would pay for itself and add like 10 yrs to my life.

Its like my brain schemes to find reasons to continue to smoke, ie I dont want to lose my temper and be fired.

It seems my dependancy is greater than the average smoker's, 5 cravings a day? For me, its like a minimum of 50. Longest ive ever made it was 5 days, and while those days progressed I only craved it more.

Tl:dr - How does a person quit smoking when   they tried seemingly everything ?

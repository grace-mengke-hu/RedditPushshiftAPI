farewell

I'm upset by the negativity I got exposed to in another thread when I admitted (honestly) that in making it to three weeks I had slipped once and had a single cigarette. If I had lied, then I'm sure everyone would have been supportive. Instead, I was honest, and the tone was quite unsupportive. That seems backwards to me. I understand the intent was pure, but I feel like it was a bit short-sighted and discounted the positive too much.

Wish you all the best in your particular brand of quitting. I'm going to go a different route, but hopefully we all end up in the same place. :)

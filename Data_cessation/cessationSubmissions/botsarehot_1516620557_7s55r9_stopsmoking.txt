Cannot stop eating

Hey everyone, I have quit 6 days ago with the help of chantix/champix. My side affects haven’t been too bad until yesterday. I simply cannot stop eating and before quitting I had a diet of 1200 calories a day and lost a good amount of weight. If I don’t eat when I want to I’ll get extremely grouchy, and eating feels so good I forget about losing weight.

Does anyone have some tips to stop binging? My lungs feel so much better and I want to exercise but I always wait an hour after eating and I haven’t been able to stop haha!

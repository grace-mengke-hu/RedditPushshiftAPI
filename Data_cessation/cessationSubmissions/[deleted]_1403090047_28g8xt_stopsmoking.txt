Just... How?

I am a 21 y/o male here from New Zealand. I have been smoking since the young age of 15 (soulless bastards used to sell smokes to kids). I have attempted to quit a few times now and I have to admit, the nicotine wins every time. I am constantly making excuses to have one (work is stressful, work is boring kind of thing) and over the past year I have started smoking about 25 a day, which is absolutely disgusting.

I have been having mild chest pains etc lately which I can only attribute to smoke, which has lead me to quit smoking marijuana, but now I am looking at the enormous mountain that is quitting smoking. To boot I have just come out of a 4 year relationship and when I get back into the dating game I don't want to put people off with the smell and other nasty effects.

In the past I have tried e-cigs (made my chest pains way fucking worse and just made me want a real smoke) patches, and gum but nothing is enough. Every time I try I get this feeling in the pit of my stomach of pure frustration, and it makes me want to flip tables and shit. All the while my I'm sitting there thinking "one smoke man and this all goes away NOW".

I understand it takes a great deal of willpower to quit smoking which I admittedly lack, but I wanted to ask you guys;
Do you have any helpful tips or tricks that specifically helped you kick the habit? Are there any invisible obstacles you found in the process or anything like that?

Thank you random button for taking me here and thank all of you in advance for any help you are able to offer. I figure the longer I wait, the harder it will become.

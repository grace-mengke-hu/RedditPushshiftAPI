Don't let people smoke in your car.

Everything was going great and I was at ten days. Holy. Freaking. Shit.

Then I hung out with a friend of mine, gave her a ride home, and although I planned to tell her no if she asked to smoke in my car, as soon as she asked I said sure. I was lonely and hadn't hung out with anyone for a while, and I don't know, I let her smoke.

I thought everything was okay but when I went to her house I ended up asking for one. I shared one with her. Then I smoked a butt later. Then the next day (yesterday) I smoked two at the bar. Today I smoked three on each break at work that were given to me by a friend from work.

I am incredibly upset with myself. Looking through my message history I can see message after message from that stupid fucking bot that tells me new quit dates. I have tried to quit at least 30-40 times in the past 3-4 months. I just can't do it. I'm losing hope. I already read the Allen Carr book. I don't know.

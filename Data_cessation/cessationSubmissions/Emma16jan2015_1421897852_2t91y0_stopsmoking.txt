Nighttime is the worst

So here we are fifth night of no ciggies and I've had cravings galore (but found out thanks to you wonderful people) this is normal! But at night I cannot sleep I tried no coffee and hot chocolate, hot water bottle, meditating (not an expert) get to sleep then exactly an hour later I'm awake and my willpower starts to wane any suggestions (I would add five days is my longest quit it's why I keep asking questions)

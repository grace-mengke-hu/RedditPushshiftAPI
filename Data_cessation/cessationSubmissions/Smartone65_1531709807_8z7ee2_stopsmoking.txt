So damn proud of myself!!

I am addicted to cigarettes and always will be. I smoked up to two packs a day for 34 years. However, almost two weeks ago, I made the decision to live. Nothing in my life improves by smoking - it actually makes things worse. I am using the patch, life is difficult, and quitting SUCKS! But every flippin day, I get through more cravings, I can breathe better, I don't have to hide, I don't smell like an ashtray and I am choosing to LIVE better! Patting myself on the back? Yes. Yes, I am. 5 minutes until I'm at two weeks. Right On!!!

Amount of Permanent Damage?

I wonder what's the amount of permanent damage that smoking causes. 

For instance, in my case: I started smoking around 15... then smoked until 25. - After 25 I was a non-smoker that relapsed a few times ... and occasionally smoked only when drinking. From 30-34 (today), I completely stopped.  So 4 years totally smoke free, not even socially or when drinking, and almost 10 years without regular smoking.

I wonder though, can I ever fully repair the damage I caused my body from the smoking? I searched this online but I am getting mixed medical opinions on this.

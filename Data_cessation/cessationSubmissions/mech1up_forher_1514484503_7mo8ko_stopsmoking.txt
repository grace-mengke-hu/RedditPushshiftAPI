Smoking and kissing

Me and my girlfriend get to see each other 3 or 4 times a month. now i've been a smoker for about 6 or maybe 7 years around half a pack to full pack a day depends on the day. my girlfriend really really hates smoking and if for that day she finds out i've been smoking she just goes home. so i really try to hide it, i stop smoking at least 4 hours, brush my teeth multiple times and eat before i meet her. i plan on stopping completely for her and myself but its tough as my entire household smokes. i either do it the right way, quit and hope for success or i keep on with this shady act i'm doing. so a couple of things to ask. is there a way to really cleanse out the smell and taste of smoke effectively because sometimes i mess up. i might stop smoking and sleep which keeps the smell/taste inside and it sucks when she smells it. i had an idea to try those E-cigs. maybe that has a smell/taste that doesn't linger? anyone with experience on this matter?. sorry for the long ass post people. 

Regards  a smoker

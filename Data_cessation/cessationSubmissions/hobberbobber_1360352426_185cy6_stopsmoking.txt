One week today!!

I made it a week so far.  Feeling pretty good!  I stopped using the patches after 3 days because it was giving me a rash and causing some muscle aches, so technically 4 days without nicotine in any way, shape or form!

My cravings are getting less and less.  My breathing already feels 100% better.  I can walk up stairs and not get winded.  I walked/jogged 2 miles in 35 minutes (I know, not great, but I just started this exercise routine the same day I quit smoking) yesterday and felt awesome about that.  Before quitting, just walking fast for a block caused me to start panting.

I think I am going to make it this time!  I want to thank this board for existing.  I come here and read a couple posts whenever I have a craving at work and it is really helping.

Thank you to all, and good luck to us all!  We can do it!

Edit:  I spoke too soon about being okay.  I have not smoked, but literally 10 minutes after posting this I yelled at a lady I work with.  To be honest, this women drives us all crazy, and is a f'ing moron.  And to be fair, I was being trained by the office manager and she was hovering and butting in and repeating what the manager was already telling me (she is not a manager and is little more then a receptionist) and I just snapped and said I did not need 2 people training me, in a pretty snotty tone of voice.  She walked off in a huff, but I think I made my point.  Now I feel bad for snapping and want a smoke.  I am not going to give in though!!!

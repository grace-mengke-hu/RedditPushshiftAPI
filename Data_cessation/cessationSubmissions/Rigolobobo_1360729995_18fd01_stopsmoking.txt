Really going for it this time

I've just finished the last cigarette in my pack, and am about to go to bed. I started smoking at 14 and am now 21, and been smoking a pack a day for almost 3 years now. 

During the past few months I've been feeling like shit. Sore throat, chest pains in the morning...So today I've decided that the cigarette I smoked 5 minutes ago was my last one. Wish me luck!

Serial Quitter

Long time listener, first time caller. 

So, I am a serial quitter. I recently found a journal of mine that was dated Jan 1, 2010 where I told myself enough was enough, and I was ready to quit. 5 1/2 years later and I was still telling myself the same story. 

I began to romanticize the last cigarette, saying I had to do it on a Sunday, I had to do it at night, it had to be on an even day, or an odd day. It was as if I had a mental disorder. Every day I would try and quit; it became a cycle almost as vicious as quitting itself. I kept finding ways to tell myself that the last one was the real last one. 

Until I made the realization that I just have to fucking do it. If I wanted to get control I had to make the first step, and treat it as a day by day task. I will constantly be bombarded by that so called "nicotine monster" and I will make the conscious choice to say "NO" and to win every day. I know my decision will be put to the test many times, but I feel truly confident this time around. 

Thank you to everyone who writes such encouraging posts here, it has helped me immensely. I am happy about my decision this time around; I know I am only 4 days in, but I feel better than I have felt in a long time.

Doctor Visit

Kinda relieved after my recent appointment with a new doctor. He took the time to explain a few things. I've always been a very anxious person and smoking has always been a short term fix for my ratcheted up nature. I went to discuss Chantix but was steered towards starting to manage my mild gloom and anxiety. He started me on Lexapro. Has anybody here had a similar experience?

It's been said that smokers might as well just hang a sign around their necks to advertise the fact that they are just anxious people with coping issues and I never really understood until he described the chemical processes and what dependency really is. 

Anyways, I'm nervous still just to take it and try it. Any feedback would be appreciated.

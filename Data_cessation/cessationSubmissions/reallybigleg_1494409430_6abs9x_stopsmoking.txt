Is it normal I still constantly think of cigarettes?

I've been finding it really tough. I'm in trouble at work because I frankly haven't done any. I can't concentrate through to the end of a sentence and I've also stopped caring about my job/self/life. I think it's more that I was already really unhappy and stopping smoking has probably just meant that I can't mask the unhappiness anymore so I'm feeling the full force of that unhappiness.

But it's definitely being made harder to cope with by the constant cravings. I had a meeting yesterday that was one hour long and realised when I came out I had had the "I'm gasping for a....wait, I don't do that anymore. Shit, stop thinking about cigarettes, you're supposed to be listening to the meeting" conversation in my head three times during that hour. It didn't feel like I was craving more than usual, either. It seems like it's just a constant: "I want....nope!" over and over and over again in my head.

It won't fix how unhappy I am, but it would make it easier to deal if I had fewer cravings. I was just expecting them to be less frequent by now. In other people's experience is this pretty average craving frequency and will it stop soon?

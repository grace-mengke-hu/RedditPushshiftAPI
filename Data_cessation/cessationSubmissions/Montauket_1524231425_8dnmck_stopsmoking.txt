Just a "thank-you" to whoever made the counter flair.

The other day my girlfriend asked me "how many days has it been?" since my last cigarette. I took a good long minute to think about it and I couldn't remember for the life of me. I remember celebrating my month-free a week or so back, but it was nice to see the "41" next to my name when I logged in today. 

It's a totally arbitrary number, and it feels like I was a smoker a lifetime ago, but I'm really happy to know I can just check in here and see how many days it's been - so kudos to whoever made the flair thingy.

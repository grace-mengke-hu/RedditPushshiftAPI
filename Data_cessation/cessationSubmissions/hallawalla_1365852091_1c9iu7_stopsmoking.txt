Quit smoking on parties?

So, I consider myself a non-smoker now. Never felt better and I haven't smoked in nearly three months. That is when I'm sober. As soon as I get drunk (which isn't too often) I suddenly get the idea that smoking is a good idea. How do I stop this? I never want to smoke again. Maybe I just shouldn't get drunk.

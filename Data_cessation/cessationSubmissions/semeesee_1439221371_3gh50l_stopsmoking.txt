Time to quit

I love climbing and I really feel how smoking is keeping me from being the best climber I can be. Not just getting out of breath. I've heard from science how cigarettes can reduce my joints' and muscles' ability to heal themselves and recover after a strenuous workout.

So that's my biggest reason to quit. I also strongly suspect that smoking is a crutch for me that keeps me from dealing with real problems and stresses. Like being 29, single, under-employed. There are real problems in my life I need to address but smoking cigarettes gives me an out. A way to feel OK without actually dealing with it. So today is day 1.

I rarely smoke more than 2-3 cigarettes a day so the addiction is probably more psychological than physical. The hardest times for me are evening and before bed.

OK I feel like I'm rambling. Now where do I get a badge?

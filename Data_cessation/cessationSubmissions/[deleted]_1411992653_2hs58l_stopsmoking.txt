It's my first Monday without a cigarette

And I'm already late in leaving haha. I always have one on my way to train and then from the train to my office.

It's going to be hard to prepare for the bullshit that is my office ;(

At least the CVS in the train station stopped selling cigs so I couldn't even get them if I wanted.

Good luck today everyone!

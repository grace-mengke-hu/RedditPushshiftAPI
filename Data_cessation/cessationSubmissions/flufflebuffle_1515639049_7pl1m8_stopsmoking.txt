Hate having decisions I was working toward being forced on me, but it’s been two days since I’ve smoked!

Edit: it’s been a day and a half 

Was a pack a day smoker for the last 12-13 years.

I have a history of being a hypochondriac. Been to the er dozens of times due to anxiety and panic attacks that tricked me into thinking I was having a heart attack or a stroke. Was told I was fine each time.

The other night I went to the er due to the usual panic and anxiety and the doc performed a test that no one ever did before, a cat scan of my chest and abdomen. He was checking for a ruptured appendix or a lung issue. He didn’t find anything and sent me home.

The next morning I get a call from a different doctor informing me that she was going over my cat scan and noticed that I had some plaque beginning to form in my heart. 

I’m 27 years old, in okay shape, and I have the beginnings of Coronary Artery Disease.

I quit smoking immediately.

And while it’s kind of a lot to deal with and have on my mind, I can’t help but think of how lucky I am. I don’t think most people who have heart disease find out until something very bad happens first. I have the chance to do something about it.

Tl;dr
Smoking is terrible for you
And this withdrawal sucks

Depression 2 months in

I had been a smoker on and off since I was 15 years old (now 26). I actually did stop for 5 years between 19 and 24-25. I also stopped many many times for periods of a week to 6 months here and there. I usually get bad cravings, a bit of mood swings. 

My mental health is far from being the best, but my specialty is usually anxiety (OCD, treated with antidepressants and very much under control). If I get depressed a little, it's more from the anxiety.

I was very happy with my life before I quit smoking, no sign of depression. The first 4 days were cravings. Day 5, extreme sadness, depression. Started getting pretty serious suicide thoughts. I thought it would stop or maybe it wasn't related to quitting. Now two months later, I'm just constantly sad. I'm not much of a "cryer" and I cry all the time, will even start sobbing in public. I told my psychiatrist about it (she follows me for mainly OCD, and has now added the diagnosis of BPD following the suicide thoughts). I just really feel like the depression was never there before, and now that I stopped smoking, it's very obvious it appeared at the same time. If this is it, will it go away?

Started Chantix today

Hey y'all, so I'm just looking for some support because today I started Chantix. I've been smoking about 8 years and the last 4 about a pack a day. Anyway, thought I would share, first day on it and cravings have been less I think, I had 7 cigarettes today and by next Sunday need to be down to 0. I feel good so far. Anyway, thought I would share. 

UPDATE: Day 5 on Chantix, yesterday I had 2 smokes and did not enjoy either of them, today is the first day without any at all and I'm going to try to keep it that way!  Thanks for the support y'all!

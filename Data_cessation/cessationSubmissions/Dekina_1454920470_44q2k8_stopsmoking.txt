4 days down, feels like I'm cheating.

I've been smoking for 16 years, and one of the things I wanted to do before I turned 30, was stopping. That happens in august, and I figured I would give myself the space for a couple of attempts.
I am 4 days in (I think, it's sort of early) and I don't feel like smoking at all. The smell is getting to me, when I walk on the street, when I stand at a bus stop, when my friends are smoking, so I really have no desire to smoke. I get cravings, but I let them pass. Some more severe than others.
I am using NRT though. And it feels a lot like I'm cheating. I am using an e-cig with 6mg, so I am barely getting any nicotine compared to what I used to get. I don't know how to shake the feeling, and it's starting to get to me. I am starting on the thought process, that since I am still "smoking", I might as well just smoke cigarettes.
I am not really getting a lot of support, when I told my sister that I was quitting, she snorted at me and told me 'Good luck with that!'. My former boyfriend just laughed and started talking about something else. That is basically the response I have been getting, and it's not helping on the feeling of being a cheater.
I desperately want to quit the vapor as well, but I need the crutch for a little bit.
Anyone have a similar experience? Any advice? I am not doing all that great today.

Day 5

I'm working on day 5.  Day 1 and 2 weren't that hard, but day 3 and 4 were pretty terrible.  I've been using the Nicorette lozenge and supplementing really bad cravings with a vape pen.  I'm scared of the vape pen though.  I've used it before and it's really easy for my brain to trick myself into thinking I can have one cigarette than go back to the vape pen.

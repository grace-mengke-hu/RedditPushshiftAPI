What major health improvements did you notice once you stopped smoking?

I’ve been a pack a day smoker for 10 years. I have cut down to 5 a day for the last week. I was planning my official quit date tomorrow. But I also feel like I’m not ready. 
I am aware of the long term health risks. But I feel I need personal stories to really give me more motivation and inspiration. 
I hear people say, I haven’t felt this good in years, but can you elaborate?

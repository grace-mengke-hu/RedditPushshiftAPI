100 days!

I woke up 100 times and lived 100 days without smoking.

The part of my life that I was a smoker lasted 16 years, I can't believe it lasted so long, Bill Murray in "Groundhog day" is a novice!     

I still have some issues (insomnia and restlessness) but it is such a relief not having to put up with all the shit associated with smoking. Life is easier and simpler, I feel clean and I do not have to face my dark side that justified smoking.   

I broke free from a destiny of inevitable decay, now the future is unknown,  exciting and a bit scary, which is the hallmark of freedom.   

Now I feel that I was a smoker in the distant past, that phase and its logics are not relevant anymore.
Smoking is not part of who I am anymore.

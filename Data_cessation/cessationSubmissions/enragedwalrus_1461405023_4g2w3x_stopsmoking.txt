When you guys quit smoking, how quickly did you experience withdrawal symptoms? I'm 8 days in (using an e-cig) and I feel like I've felt decent. Are there symptoms that take awhile to start bothering you?

I've been smoking about a pack a day for about 7 years. These past 3 months I've been really stressed and started smoking almost 2 packs a day. It started really making my morning coughing and wheezing bad. Then I got really sick last week and vomited everytime I smoked a cigarette. I got so fed up with the cough-vomiting and phlegm one night that I just totally swore off of them. I haven't had a whole one since. Two days in I took one puff of one and vomited again and it was terrible. I'm now using an e-cigarette with the 3ml liquid, and I barely use it throughout the day, maybe what I would call 6-7 sessions of puffing on it for ten minutes a day compared to my usual 20 cigarettes. 

So I'm 8 days in and feel like it hasn't been too bad at all and I'm kind of wondering if there is some terrible wave of awfulness coming I haven't experienced yet? Are there withdrawal symptoms that take weeks, or months to start? I haven't looked too much into withdrawal symptoms because I don't want to psyche myself out worrying about getting them. I honestly feel like I could drop the e cig in a few days even and be fine. The only symptoms I've experienced are the occasional headache (that I can decently relieve with the ecig) and on the third day I woke up with my hands shaking in the morning, but it passed. Other than those, coughing up a little bit of nasty crud now, and minor irritability here and there, it's been easier to me than I expected. Do I have another thing coming or does it sound like I'm doing okay? Do you guys think the e-cig may just be temporarily withholding the worst of it?

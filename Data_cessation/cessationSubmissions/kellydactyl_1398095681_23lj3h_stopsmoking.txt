week 2 of my chantix sample pack

went to my Dr last week and told him i wanted to quit, so he gave me a sample blister pack of Chantix. week one i was nervous, but had slowed down smoking considerably (i was about a half a pack [give or take] a day smoker for the past 6 years. i had slowed to about 2, maybe 4 smokes a day, then when i started the blue pills in the blister pack, all desire to smoke completely vanished and i've been smoke free for 3 days now. i have a follow up appointment with the Dr tomorrow and want to discuss with him Zyban. the only reason i want to discuss the switch is with my insurance Chantix is over $100, and Zyban is less than $10. has anyone here had any experience switching between these meds, and if so what was your experience like? So far with Chantix, i'm pretty pleased, aside from the upset tummy it gives me, but i just eat a granola bar or something when taking it to abate that. any and all help is appreciated, guys. thanks so much!

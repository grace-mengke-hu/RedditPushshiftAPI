I stopped smoking 8 days ago and now I'm crying for no good reason...

...last night I cried myself to sleep. And I don't know why. I'm really happy actually, but I was thinking about a business trip that's weeks from now where I don't want to go to and I couldn't stop crying. This morning too, my boyfriend and I had sex and afterwards I had to fight really hard to hold the tears back. 

And now I'm crying because there was a sad episode of Grey's Anatomy for fucks sake. And I'm not a crybaby usually. I cry maybe five times a year, tops.

I guess it comes from the withdrawal. I tried quitting smoking a few times already (who hasn't?), but I don't remember these sad episodes... Can anybody relate and maybe tell me how long I'm gonna have to deal with this bullshit?

21. January 2016 8:17am I had a smoke

I've been smoking for about 7 years and almost 3 weeks ago I had a smoke before work and felt horrible. I had a full pack and I threw it away. I haven't smoked since.

I was afraid that it'll be hard to stop since I've been meeting up with a friend for years. Every week we try to meet at least 2 times a week for coffee or to just chill and we'd smoke a lot during that time. Another point was drinking. I have nothing against drinking I find it to be a good way to rewind every now and then, but whenever I had a drink I really wanted to smoke. Since I stopped I've had no issues or withdrawals and I haven't been using anything to help me stop like patches gum (also some spray thing that my friend tried and said it tastes fucking horrible). 

I still miss smoking, it was great, but I think its time I closed that book.

The friend I meet up also wants to quit, but doesn't quite have the willpower, is there anything I can suggest to him? Hes also a bit depressed which might be related, but I'm not sure.

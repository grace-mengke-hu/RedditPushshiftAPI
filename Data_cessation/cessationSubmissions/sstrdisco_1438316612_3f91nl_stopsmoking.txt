Ate Chinese food tonight & could taste it!

Taste and smell have been a slow return for me. I'm excited and anxious to see what the end of my first year holds for me in regards to those two; I'm hoping I didn't do permanent damage. Anyway, I'll go for several weeks with no change in either and then I'll have a couple days where they're exaggerated. Tonight I was able to taste celery in the chicken that it had been cooked with (husband got Kung Pao Chicken) and my General Tso chicken  was wonderfully seasoned.

If you're just starting out, keep going! It's so worth it and it just keeps getting better and better :)

Yo yo yo! New Year quitters! Check-in!

Sorry peeps, I have been super busy with everything. Didn't have time to post recently. I just noticed that we are 82 days deep! Holy hell where did the time go?

Nothing new on my side. I don't think about smoking at all anymore. I can go have couple drinks with buddies, even smoking ones. I don't care. Doesn't bother me anymore. It's been so long since I had one that my cravings are all gone. I really don't remember last time I thought about cigarettes. 

Hope you guys are hanging in there! It feels great doesn't it? keep at it!

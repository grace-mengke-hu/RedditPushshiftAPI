Quit smoking 5 days ago, today was not an easy day

I smoked from when i was 17 until 5 days ago (I am now 29yo). Last few years a pack a day smoker. My wife got pregnant and stop smoking so I felt was time for me to do the same. Read Allen Carr and tried to quit in march, lasted 2 days. Re-read it and did laser this time. And I am on my 5th day.

Just is not being easy, first I guess the laser doesn't really make a difference, I didn't notice my craving where any different from my first try going cold turkey. As per the Easy way to quit smoking book, is an amazing book and helps me specially want to quit and stay quit , however I still think about cigarettes and the memory I have of them is good, pleasure and thinking about smoke is like a sensation of pleasure. Although I know it was bad and relieving the nicotine addition, still can't avoid and change the way my brain remembers them, which makes it harder to quit.

As well I am loosing my temper very easily, I am usually a patient guy (or it was when i smoked) and now at minimum problem or set back I feel like punching everything and scream a big fuck you to everyone ! 

Just venting and looking for any tips or empathy on this symptoms. Since one thing is for sure, I will not smoke, doesn't matter how much i miss it, since I always said I would quit when my wife got pregnant and I will keep my word on that! Just feeling like a beast losing my temper and arguing with wife easily for stupid reasons. Even her already told me to smoke, saying she doesn't care, just wants me back! 

No matter how much she says I will not go back to smoke, therefore just want to get better! Read that 3rd day was the worst, but actually I feel worst today and craving more than on my 3rd day!

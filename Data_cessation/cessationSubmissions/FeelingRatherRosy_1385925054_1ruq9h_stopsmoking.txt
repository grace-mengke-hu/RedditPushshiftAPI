100 days!

I just want to say thanks to everyone in this subreddit. I appreciate all of the support and encouragement. To everyone who is thinking about quitting or is on their way, hang in there. It's difficult at first but you just have to put your mind to it and understand that you are more powerful than cigarettes. It's such a wonderful feeling being at this point, thanks again everyone!

You new guys are AWSOME!

As I read these posts, I realize the new guys (single and double digits) are the meat and potatoes of this sub. The advice you give is inspirational and unbelieveable. Guys like me can show you anything is possible. However it's the new non-smokers that newbies resonate with. Thanks guys. Join me in not smoking today!

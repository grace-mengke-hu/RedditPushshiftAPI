Preparing

So i hate my job and finally had balls to say i want to quit, my job makes me smoke 3 times more than before. Now i have this and next month left, i already am peeking another job and i will move to bigger city. I decides that when i get out of this job and have my move done, what is the best way to beat cravings, stay fit and what to do if i'm bored.

Today's the day - finally

Been a smoker for many years, didn't start until 28. Then on for 5 years, off for 5 years, then on for past 20 something. Been sick all week and smoking was yuck. So after 5 days of trying to enjoy it I decided I should just quit while I was ahead. Being sick and quitting still stinks. But it's official today- thanks for all the success stories. They're helping!

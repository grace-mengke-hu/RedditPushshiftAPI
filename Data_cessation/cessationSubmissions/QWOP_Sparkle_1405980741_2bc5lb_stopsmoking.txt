Been a few days without and my chest feels really weird...

Like breathing weird...

I dunno. The last time I quit I found it easier to breathe and stuff.

Maybe it's different depending on how often you smoked? Last time I quit I was literally on 1-2 a day. I've quit this time after smoking between 5-10 a day.

In the 3 days I've had non I've had maybe a couple of puffs from the ecig but that's about it.

Is this normal? Like I can breathe but if I sit up straight or take a deep breath it's sort of like there's a slight pressure against it?

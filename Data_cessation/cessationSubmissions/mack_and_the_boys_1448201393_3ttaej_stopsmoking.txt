Quitting for love

I met a wonderful girl over the summer...tried vaping in her company or just plain suffering. It became an irritation so enough was enough and now I'm into my fifth day of cold turkey. It's funny I actually started smoking after being dumped 7 years ago...so I think it's only fitting that its a bit of love that should make me want to stop...its the best tonic eh?

As I mentioned I'm into the 5th day and Allen Carr's words have helped me through the really wobbly moments (and there has only really been two or three of those)...it's helluva feeling. Whenever I get a craving I remind myself who is the boss...that feeling of empowerment is a waaay better buzz than lighting up.

Always thought I suffered from the 'fuck it' reflex, when it comes to drugs...booze...Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream. All the main vices... I always thought I was weak which is why these last 5 days have felt like such a revelation! Still wary but taking baby steps. Managed to go for a few pints with my Dad yesterday too and wasn't even slightly tempted.

Will report back at two weeks...good luck to everyone else behind me, and in front of me :D

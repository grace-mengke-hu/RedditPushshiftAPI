Is it normal to have depression and anxiety from 2-3 months on?

I feel like there’s no end and am bound to be unhappy no matter what. This is my third attempt and at 2 months. My memories may fail me but my last two attempts didn’t feel this hopeless. I’ve barely left bed and feel extremely fatigued. It started around 3 weeks ago. Is this normal? 

Thanks everyone. I’ve lurked a lot and this sub has been very helpful.

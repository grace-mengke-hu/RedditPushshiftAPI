Christmas quit

Hey everyone, I swear this is probably the one hundred millionth time I've tried to stop but I wanted to come and say something before taking the plunge today.... On Christmas.

Sometimes I last a few days, sometimes just a few hours.

One time, I quit for three months but I just can't get it to stick after smoking for about 13 years (I'm 27, so for about half my life now)

I've been trying to think of what has gone wrong in the past and why I haven't seen success and I think it's really just been a true desire to stop. I get hit with even the slightest pressure and I crumple

I'm hoping not this time. I'm sick of the money, my coughing fits, the smell, the way my teeth are stained, and the forlorn looks from strangers.

This is me peeling off another addiction, sorta like an onion or a Brussel sprout.

Anywho, wish me luck. Updates to follow!

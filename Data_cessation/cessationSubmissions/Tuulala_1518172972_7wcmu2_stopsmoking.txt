Family support

Just send a message to my family that I've given up smoking and have been smoke free for 100 hrs. Anxiously waiting for their response, hoping it won't be dismissive or negative. My brother can be a bit of an ass on occasions, especially when he's been telling me to quit over and over again for 13 yrs. Afraid he will say something hurtful.

Had to vent, thanks for hearing me :)

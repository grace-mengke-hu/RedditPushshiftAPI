Tentatively checking out this subreddit. Heavy smoker for over 13 years.

Guys and gals, I could use some help. My last gold standard test didn't give back the best results (pointed towards emphysema but I don't know, honestly. My doctors are lame) and I have a bit of scar tissue in my lungs (unknown if from cigarettes or from contact with asbestos as a toddler- I'm afraid of finding out). I've been smoking since I was 17 and I'm now about to turn 30. My husband and I recently lost a baby during pregnancy, too (and I will forever hate myself if it turns out I was at fault with my habit). AND I've got serious mental health problems as well. It's a freakin' barrel of laughs over here. 

I don't know how to quit. I haven't really tried in the past, and the first thing I do when I wake up is smoke a few cigarettes... I average 2-3 an hour, and when stressed I can just sit and chain-smoke all day long (and I'm stressed a lot). I've recently quit another habit which I won't mention (doing fine, thanks) but I think I'm starting to console myself more and more with extra ciggy breaks throughout my day. 

I don't want to quit, these little deathsticks are my best friends and have been since I was a teenager. 

But I know that I have to. 

I could use any and all support and resources you can throw my way, and I hope to join you guys with the badges one day soon, if I ever get the willpower.

Kindest regards from a wheezy ol' bitch.

General Check In

Stats: [here](http://i.imgur.com/kFptMIR.png). SO back from Japan with the flu and I'm determined not to catch it, so I've sequestered myself in the lounge. I feel like I'm back in my first flat with the mattress on the [floor](http://i.imgur.com/aDeOaL2.jpg). Other than that, enjoying the rain and being smoke free. Why did I not set up my bed in the other bedroom? It's his office and his germs are there too! I will not get this. I will not get this! Happy smoke free day everyone! :))

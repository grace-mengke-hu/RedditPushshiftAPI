Back from a night of drinking

Okay so I made it, but honestly it was so fucking hard. Went to the bar with a bunch of friends and could not get cigarettes off if my mind. It feels good now knowing I didn't give into the temptations, but I don't know how I will be able to handle these cravings on a long term basis. How much easier does it truly get?

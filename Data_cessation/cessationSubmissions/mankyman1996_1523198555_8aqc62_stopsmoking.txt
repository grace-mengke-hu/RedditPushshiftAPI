Spent the weekend in a country where they still smoke inside. Didn't relapse, but throat hurts now.

Hi guys, I just came home from a weekend in a country where smoking inside hasn't been banned yet. Obviously the urge was strong to relapse but I kept my cool and kept my streak of merely 8 days. I don't know why, but my throat now hurts.. might not be related. Does anyone here have any experience being exposed to extreme amounts of 2nd hand smoke for two full days?

How does the frequency of smoking affect health?

Im trying to quit period, but I find myself wanting one every once in awhile. As of now I only have a single cigarette in the course of a month. This is a significant improvement, because I used to smoke 3 a day, and obviously better for my health.

Does anyone have any links to anything examines the frequency of smoking with its health affects? Like how does someone who smokes one cigarette in the course of a month health different from someone who smokes 10 a day?

Thanks everyone, just wondering.

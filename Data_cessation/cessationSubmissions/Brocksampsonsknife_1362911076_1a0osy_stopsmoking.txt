21 days...

I honestly can not believe I have not smoked in 3 weeks. I am one of those weak bastards that last 7 to 10 days before braking down. But to take it one step further I am 121 hours with out patches, e cigs, or any other form of nicotine. If any of you are quiting and want some truth, we will always crave smoke. It will never stop. To be successful, you have to not want to smoke, just a little more than want to smoke. It sounds snarky but it's true....

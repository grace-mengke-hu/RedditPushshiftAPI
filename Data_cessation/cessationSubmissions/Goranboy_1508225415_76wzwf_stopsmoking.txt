Getting more and more depressed over here

Hey guys, I'm just curious: it's been almost 2.5 months since my quit and after a first high I seem to get more and more depressed and anxious every week since about 3 weeks to the point that I don't see a sense in life no more. I read, that depression should be an early symptom but should slow down by month two-ish. So here I am in the complete opposite scenario. 
Did anyone experience something similar?

3rd Time quitting, starting to get experienced at this.

Some back history, I started smoking when I was 14 years old and quit at 23 for the first time.  I made it 5 years and relapsed which turned into 2 years of smoking.  I then went on Chantix and was able to quit for another 2 years before relapsing again.  This time around; I have been smoking for 2 weeks and have made up my mind to stop cold turkey today.   I got up this morning, had one last one, and then smashed up my whole pack and put it in the garbage.   A big difference this time is that I have experience smoking, not smoking, and know what it takes to quit.   During the last 2 years I got really into fitness and have been able to save quite a bit of money. I am not going to let this habit ruin all my hard work.   That's my story.  Smoking sucks.

My teeth seem have got whiter since I stopped, don't know if in just imagining this or the stain goes.

First, I'm going to make a confession. I have started to use an e-cig because it was just too hard when I was getting stressed at work and also when I'd been drinking down the pub. 

Anyway, my teeth seem to have got less stain and whiter since I stopped. I still have dark specs between my front teeth but the rest seem to have gone back to their hay day. Anyone else noticed this? If so, all the reason more for you cigarette smokers to stop!

Quiting, but still have Erectile dysfunction/impotence

Started smoking about two years ago and I smoked 1 pack in two days consitantly, I spit up blood twice. But what finally made me quit was the fact that I couldn’t get hard or stay hard with my gf or on my own. I only see my gf 4 months out of 8 so 8 months waiting only to be let down.  I haven’t smoked for 2 months but I still don’t feel the bone back in my boner. I’m 24 turning 25 in a month. Should I visit the doctor?

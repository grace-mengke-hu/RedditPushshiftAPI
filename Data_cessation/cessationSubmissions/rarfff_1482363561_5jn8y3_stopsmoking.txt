3 weeks in - Is it unusual to hardly have any cravings?

Just passed 3 weeks without a cigarette.

I quit the day I set off walking to work without my lighter. I had a 45 min walk ahead of me and could feel myself getting all tense. 

This went on for about 10 mins until something kinda snapped, and i thought 'wait a sec, dude, you're totally fine', and suddenly that was it. 

I smoked 10 a day for 4-5 years and looking back I see this was mainly routine. I always thought the key to stopping would be to break this routine, however surely the chemical nature of the addiction should be taking it's toll by now. 

If this is as hard as it gets, then awesome, i'm just concerned that its gonna have to get harder at some point?

My best friend married a hot doctor on Saturday

I smoke so much and cant workout because of it. I was in the Marines and used to be shredded and thin. Now all I do is smoke and eat. I was his best man and was so ashamed of my too tight suit, my double chin and so much more. During the wedding I decided to quit smoking as first step. It was an early morning wedding and afternoon reception, so I was home by 4pm. I haven't had a cigg since then and even got up early enough to lift weights before work. Almost 2 days in, but I don't really care about the length of time since I quit. The amount of shame I felt on Saturday was life changing. Being out of breath for the best man toast, being asked by several people if I smoke, my hot ex was there with her new bf and one of the reasons she dumped me was because I wouldn't quit smoking. I'll never touch another cigg as long as I live.
Edit: Thanks for all of the good will guys

2 weeks today!!!

I've made it two weeks which is awesome. Didnt think I'd make it this long. Only thing that worries is the only reason why I quit in the first place was bc of a job I applied for (it's a hospital and they test for nicotine). I just had the interview and if I dont get the job I might fall back into smoking. Even though  I've set up an awesome incentive to keep going with quitting, I might be too bummed bc of not getting the job to really care at that point. 

So yeah I'm kind of conflicted keep going with the quitting (incentive is for every $30 saved I get to spent $10 on a book I want) or just f it all and just breathe smoke.

I know what the obvious answer is right now, but when the time comes will I feel I'll be too depressed and disappointed to really give a crap.

I know I'm really not physically addicted to cigarettes any more but mentally I do miss it every now and again. And with no real reason to not smoke anymore I'm internally asking myself what's the point?

Sorry for the rambling, run on sentences, typo's, etc. Thanks.

Tomorrow is day one of attempt number three in the past month

Hello all:

I am a 30 year old, half pack a day smoker.  Have been since I was around 17.  I recently went 10 days, cold turkey, with an assist from some cinnamon flavored toothpicks.  After a relapse of about a week, I attempted again, and succeeded for another 10 days...only to relapse again.  Needless to say I'm a little frustrated.  

Looking for any sort of guidance/advice that anyone can provide me with.  EasyWay did not work for me (read it three times).  Recently, my cravings have been so unbearable that I feel like I'm going to break something or hit something.  I can honestly deal without smoking a cigarette, but what I can't deal with is the craving.  Any advice would help.  

Tomorrow is day one of my third attempt.  Trying to remain confident that this time it will stick.

Thanks

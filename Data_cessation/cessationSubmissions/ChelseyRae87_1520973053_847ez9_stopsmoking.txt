Massive emotional breakdown at work

I've had some serious insomnia since quitting, so I'm tired during the days, but I've worked hard to stay perky and positive anyway, but I just LOST IT at work. Total meltdown on the stairs. Crying, snot, hyperventalating... All of it. It's like all the tired just slapped me at once and i broke. The whole time my junkie thoughts were saying stuff like "you know what helps calm you? Smoking." and "you wouldn't have the insomnia that has made you crazy if you just gave up and kept smoking."

All that being said, I've calmed down and i didn't smoke and i feel good because i made it through another major battle with my brain. 

Anyone else feel like life is just throwing ALL the bullshit your way since you quit? It's like a test and the moderator is the nicotine monster. "Hmmmm.. She's managed to drive her car for over a week without smoking... Time to smash her windshield. Crap she got through that... Time to hit her with the mood swings. Damn she's getting past those... Okay get her sister to light up in front of her."

It's just one thing after another that seem like something is working hard to sabotage me. Too bad I'm a badass bitch and refuse to fail this time! Suck it nicotine monster.

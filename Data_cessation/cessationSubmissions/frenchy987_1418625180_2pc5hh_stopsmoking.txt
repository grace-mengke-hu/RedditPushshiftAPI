3 weeks in, urges now worse - am I alone?

So my first few weeks have been a lot easier than I thought, mainly due to my mindset. I have attempted to quit numerous times before, but something felt different this time - my desire to stop sky rocketed.

However ver the last couple of days, my craving to smoke has surprisingly increased. I find myself putting the peace sign up to my lips - something I had never in the past few weeks. I even found myself looking forward to New Years because it was then I would allow myself to have a few cigs for all my hard work - something I know will only end badly. I've quit cigarettes, weed, caffeine,  and jackin off because I do all of them too much. Extremely addictive personality here.

I guess what I'm asking is how many of you felt these serious urges 3ish weeks into your quit date, because as much as I love the benefits of nt smoking... My mind can wander on its own sometimes.

Lol sorry for the la k of format I'm a little drunk right now.

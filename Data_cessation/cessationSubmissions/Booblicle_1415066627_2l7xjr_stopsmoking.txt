You got this! To both new and old alike.


Smoking throughout the years we tend to constantly self evaluate or make excuses for our choice to have a cigarette. "Do I need a smoke? Are my emotions in check? Maybe I should have a smoke so I won't have to worry about it" On and on and on.

Even after a year of not smoking this self evaluation is continual. It took quite a bit of thought to realize this and that it is the reason  I keep thinking about cigarettes when I 'should' have moved on. 

I'm not even sure where this is leading, it's just something I figured someone else might be interested in. It's just one of those little  things that kind of keeps cigarettes in your mind, long after you're done with that crap. But then, I've smoked for 25+ years. 

But don't get this message confused, if you're new. The above statements are an afterthought. I have no desire to have a cigarette. In fact the shit smells gross to me now. If you can make it to the 3rd day, you can make it to the 3rd month. and If you've made it that far you have at least broken the chains.

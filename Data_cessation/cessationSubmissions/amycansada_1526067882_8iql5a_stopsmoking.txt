T-minus 48 hours till Quit Day

Iâ€™m nervous as hell about dealing with the first few days. Tried to quit before a few times, but stress and social situations alway drag me back in after a week or two.

I downloaded the Smoke Free app - what else works for you to get through the first few days/weeks?

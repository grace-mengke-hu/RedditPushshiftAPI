When I reset my badge after two years, I was so disappointed in myself. Told myself to forget it, start over, and move on. Felt like just yesterday, but it's been 72 days!

Another random note: I did this calculator thing yesterday, and it says that since I quit smoking cigs (I reset my badge 72 days ago because of a hookah that I have since packed away in a closet), I've saved over $7000  (NY/NJ prices). Holy shit.

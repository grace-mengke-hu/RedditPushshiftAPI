Two months and counting!

Two months have gone by. That's not a huge amount of time, but it's enough. It's enough for me to know that I will never have another cigarette again, only in my dreams. I don't mean that I dream about smoking again; it's quite the opposite. I don't miss them in the slightest. Occasionally I have a moment where I think that I miss them, but it doesn't take me but a few seconds to realize that I really don't. 

To all of those thinking of quitting, do it! It's easily the best thing I have done in my entire life. Not a day goes by that I don't realize how grateful I am that I quit. Whether I smell it on somebody's clothes or see a group of people smoking, it's incredibly liberating knowing that I'm not a slave to my addiction anymore. It's amazing to think about the amount of time I used waste away smoking. Not only did I waste time physically smoking, but I have realized that a large portion of my brain power was spent each moment thinking about when I would get to smoke my next cigarette. 

I think the thing I don't miss the most is the fear. Oh, boy was I always on edge. Nothing was more scary to me than running out of cigarettes. No longer do I have to walk out of my house late at night , because I smoked my last cigarette. I always meant to save that last cigarette for the morning, but I always found a way to smoke it.

I am so grateful that I quit. To anybody thinking about quitting, I assure you that it is the right decision. There are so many reasons to quit but only one not to quit - the fact that you are addicting. You don't like them; they aren't fun, and you certainly don't need them.

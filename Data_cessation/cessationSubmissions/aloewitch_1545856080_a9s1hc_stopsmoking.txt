How do I stop?

I have severe anxiety and kind of manageable OCD. Among other things. 

Unfortunately, I smoke to deal with the anxiety and OCD. Smoking is one of my compulsive actions. 

I don’t even enjoy smoking. If I do it at work, I have to socialize with other smokers. If I do it in public, other people ask me to bum a cig/yell at me/give me dirty looks for smoking. I don’t enjoy social interaction irl period, and smoking makes me have to deal with it. 

So I smoke compulsively, it quells my anxiety, and then riles my anxiety up again, which also makes me wants to smoke more. Never ending cycle. 

I don’t even mind the withdrawal. It’s my OCD telling me I NEED to smoke (I have a routine when I ash them, and it makes me feel better), otherwise all is wrong and out of balance. Something bad will happen if I don’t have this next cig. But something bad always happens when I have my next cig. 

I’m trying to find a new routine that isn’t so unhealthy, or something new to obsess over. Still not healthy, sure, but I’d like an alternative that isn’t as bad as smoking. I’ve tried video games, vaping, baking, knitting, running, even alcohol. Nothing seems to be able to beat my current obsession with smoking. 

Therapy/help is out of the question (I’m on my parents insurance, and they have a no-tolerance opinion of therapy. And there’s no way I can pay for help on my own).

After 14 years of smoking, I think I may be done.

I've been smoking since I was 12, when I would steal them from my mom and enjoy them behind a church down the road. I never smoked because it was cool, or to fit in, but because I have always suffered from Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and Borderline Personality Disorder. Smoking has always been my calm, my escape. I have recently gotten out of a relationship, I am working again (after being a stay at home mom for a year), and am trying to learn to love myself. I have 19 cigarettes left, and after that I'm done. I know, and expect, that I'll relapse in certain situations, but I know that this is for real. I don't enjoy it as much as I used to, and feel that if I find a new calm that my life will change for the better. Wish me luck!

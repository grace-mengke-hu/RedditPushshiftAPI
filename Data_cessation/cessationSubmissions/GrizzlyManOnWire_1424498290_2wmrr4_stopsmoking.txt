Do drunk cravings ever go away?

I go through periods of smoking 4-5 times a day but can quit those relatively easily. It's difficult at first but eventually the cravings go away. However every time I go out drinking I can't help myself. Do the drunk cravings ever go away the same way the sober ones do?

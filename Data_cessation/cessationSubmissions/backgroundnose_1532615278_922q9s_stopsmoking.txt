WTF is wrong with me...

... I miss that burning sensation at the back of my throat. 

It's pure self harm and as a bit of health nut I don't get why I would miss it.

Anyway, took it super easy today even though it was a long-ass day. Just tried to stay chilled and even sat next to my friend on the way home who was puffing on an e-cigarette and I didn't smoke. Yay!!

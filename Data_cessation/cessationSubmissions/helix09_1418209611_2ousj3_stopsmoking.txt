How does one quit smoking and keep calm at the same time?

I'm giving quitting a go today.. again.

However, any tips on how to keep calm and not lose your shit the first few weeks? I'm in a new job that I love and absolutely cannot be anything but lovely to all my coworkers. 

I just don't want any excuses I can give myself to shake off my resolve. Help? Please?

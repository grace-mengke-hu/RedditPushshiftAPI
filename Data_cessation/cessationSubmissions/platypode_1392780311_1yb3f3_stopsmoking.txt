About a week in

I'm about a week smoke free and I just started to cough shit up.  It seems like it's probably a good thing, getting the crap out of my lungs, just wanted to see if I'm on par with the normal time line.  Other than that, I feel great!  It's amazing how easy it it to wake up in the morning now!

This is my 8th attempt at quitting

So i have been s smoking for a few years.... Ok i was 14 when i started and i have a really hard time when i try to quit. This morning my husband wouldn't kiss me because i still smelled like smoke. My daughter is always telling me to brush my teeth. I caught myself scrounging the the couch for change last night so i could run to the store and get a pack and.... I'm done.

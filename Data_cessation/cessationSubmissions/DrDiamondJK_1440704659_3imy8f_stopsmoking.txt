Two months since I quit smoking, but my lungs still get sore sometimes.

First of all, I wanted to thank the people here who talked about Allen Carr's book. That book is the reason I am a non-smoker today. I read it two months ago as a smoker, and it turned quitting from a process into an event. I was able to quit cold turkey because of that book, and I will never have another cigarette again. 

Here's why I'm writing this today: back when I was a smoker, I smoked a pack a day for about 21 years or so. Everyone I talked to who quit smoking talked about how they hacked up all kinds of garbage out of their lungs for a couple months after they quit, but so far I haven't coughed up anything. And every so often, my lungs start to feel like I smoked a pack or two at the bar the night before. 

My girlfriend (who is the reason I read Mr. Carr's book in the first place) says that while I don't taste like nicotine anymore, everyone in a while I'll taste weird when we kiss. I'm wondering if my sore lungs might be a part of this? 

At any rate, if any other kind redditors have any insight into this part of quitting smoking and are willing to share, I'd be most appreciative. And to anyone out there who is wondering if they should stop smoking, the answer is YES!

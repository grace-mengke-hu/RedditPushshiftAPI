May 17 quit date

Im gonna see if setting a quit date 3 months after starting NRTs works. So far I still smoke, but rarely compared to when I'm off them. The patch wasn't working alone, even tried the expensive nicoderm patches, so I'm doing the combination therapy with lozenges. That has been pretty successful, as I seem to stop craving them for a while after a few cigarettes. Day 5 seems like my challenge right now.

Lol I'm really trying guys. I've been trying for a long time, so I'm experimenting. At least I'm out of my old area I moved from, seemed like it was impossible to go a few yards without second hand smoke, as I primarily use the bus. Smoking laws need to be enforced bad. Still have to deal with living with a smoker, but he's trying to help and quit too.

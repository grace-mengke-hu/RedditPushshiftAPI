So I'm on day 3, attempt 2, and got an email that made me lose my shit.

My uncle just called my mum to tell her to tell me he sent me an email because I hadn't replied to his previous 2 or answered his last 8 calls (he called me from a blocked number 8 times in 2 hours, I was in uni lol). i checked my email, and it was pure vitriol about how I was rude, negligent and disrespectful. A few choice words about how I'm arrogant as well, it was chock full.

Now I am typing this because I want to reply to this email with every fucking word I can about how much I despise this prick, but I think it's 99% withdrawals talking. Can I get some help here? Someone needs to throw me a bone and tell me to calm my goddamn farm I reckon. Also I REALLY WANT A DURRY FUCK

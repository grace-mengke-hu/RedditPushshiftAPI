Quit smoking cigs a year ago, took on vaping. Now I'm quitting vaping and I'm re-reading Allen Carr's book to help. Anyone else here quit smoking cigs with vaping, and quit vaping later?

At first when I quit smoking cigs and went to vaping it was tough for a bit, despite the nicotine addiction being met and still having the smoking feeling. Now I never want a cigarette, but I'm just as addicted to my e-cigarette as I was paper cigarettes. 

I'm really dedicated to this. My breathing, coughing, voice, has all improved since I switched to the vaporizer. But I want to be FREE from addiction, not trading one for the other. I'm hoping re-reading Allen Carr's book will help. 

Anyone else here ever been in this boat? What was it like?

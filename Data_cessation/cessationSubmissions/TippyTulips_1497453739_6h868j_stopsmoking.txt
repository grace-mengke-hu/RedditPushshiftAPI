First day and my last smoke ever. Cold turkey.

So I am nervous and about to start a really big change in my life. I am going to quit smoking, cold turkey. I just smoked my very last cigarette. I have attempted this in the past but never a seriously as I should have. Today is the day but I know the time ahead of me is going to be rough and I have come here to learn from your experiences and maybe even for a bit of encouragement. Although I know there are going to be some difficult times but the benefits will out way that, this is the first step to a new healthy life change. I have to remember the best things in life are on the other side of fear. Wish me luck fellow Redditors.

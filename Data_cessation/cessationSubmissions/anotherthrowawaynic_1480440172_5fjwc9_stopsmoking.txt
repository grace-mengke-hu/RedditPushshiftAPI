Ugh.

I picked up Easy Way several months ago, and skimmed it. It made sense then, but I didn't act on it.

Last Thursday, I read it cover to cover, carefully--taking extra care to make sure I understood everything.

Some of it sounded hokey as all, but so much of it resonated with me.

So Friday night, I did it.

Carr was right.

Saturday was easy.

Sunday was easy.

But then came Monday. 

The day started off ok. But then I made room in my mind to question the part where he says **not even one** because *it cannot be controlled*. 

I am amazed how little it takes. That tiny little sliver of skepticism, and now it's noon on Tuesday--I've had 7 since yesterday afternoon. One at 4:30pm. Two late last night. Two this morning. Two more just now.

Carr was right. Again. The trickiest thing about his method is that it seems too easy. And that is one path to relapse.

I'm sitting here now, knowing what's wrong. But I'm outsmarting myself. 

Please help... I need this. My marriage is at stake. My children's future is on the line. My life is at risk.

EDIT: fixed badge.

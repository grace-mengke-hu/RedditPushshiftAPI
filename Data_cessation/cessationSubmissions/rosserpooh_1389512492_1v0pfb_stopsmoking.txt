Should quitting be planned out, or is that just procrastination?

I'm 23 years old and have been smoking since just past puberty. cigarettes/day fluctuate dramatically. Normal days it is probably around 5-8 cigs. Though some rare days when i'm busy and distracted i can find myself going to bed with only having had three or so throughout the day.  I know and am thankful that it isn't as bad as it *could be* which is why i'd like to cut the habit while i'm still young. 
Is it best to just pluck up the courage and commitment and just DO IT (seems like i already know that wouldn't work...) or better to plan it out? (one less cigarette every other day...set day to stop entirely...goals... that kinda projection) and if the latter, any suggestions on the best way to plan your revival?
I want to be smoke free by Valentine's Day. (to me that idealistically removes even cravings or impulsive trips to the corner store....[maybe unrealistic, but i think i have that kind of mind power])

TL;DR  Anybody have any tips on planning out the quitting process, or just attempt that cold turkey leg?

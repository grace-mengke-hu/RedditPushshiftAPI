It's getting harder

Over a month in. The first four weeks seemed like a breeze. I always had an answer to the cravings. Now I can't talk my way through it anymore. It's like my mind has caught on to my lies and I can't find a way to calm the cravings. I feel a little lonely and depressed at the thought that I can't ever get that wonderful calm feeling smoking gave me ever again. It's like losing a close friend.

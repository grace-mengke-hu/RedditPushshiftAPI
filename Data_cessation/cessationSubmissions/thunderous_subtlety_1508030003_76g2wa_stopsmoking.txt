Missed my 2 year anniversary!

My 2 year anniversary was on the 11th and I didn't realize till the day after.  The could tell me the world was ending tomorrow and I still wouldn't pick up a cigarette.  I smoked for 27 years .  I have zero temptation, zero urges.  I don't think about it and can smell it a mile away.  Good luck to all the newbies!

Who else made it through the Super Bowl smoke free?

Parties/get-togethers/events involving food are huge triggers for me, or at least used to be. After last night I am more confident about being a non-smoker than ever before.

 A couple hours of beer and good food with only one noticeable craving (triggered by the host kept going in and out to the balcony for smokes) and I made it through smoke free. And last year the super bowl is what caused me to cave the first time I tried to quit.

 Anyone else have any similar stories or want to discuss dealing with any cravings during any social event around the game?

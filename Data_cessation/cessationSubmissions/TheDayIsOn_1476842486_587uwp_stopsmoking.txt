I realized I can't relate to the new quitters on here any more........

I just hit my year mark last week and realized I can only really relate to people on here who are at my stage and I thought pointing this out might help some of you new quitters actually.

I am now a non-smoker, not a former smoker, ex-smoker, some one trying to quit, etc.  I don't smoke.  PERIOD!  

The point of this I guess is that I can't relate any more to someone who is on day three or their second week and craving a smoke because I can't remember what that's like any more.  My thought when I see your post is "just don't smoke". Hear that new quitter?  One day you'll forget what's it's like to crave a cigarette. I'm not discounting the torture you're going through.  I know it sucks - been there-but I simply can't really remember it enough to feel your pain any more.  There is a whole new world awaiting you and it's good! Stay strong! Good luck!!!

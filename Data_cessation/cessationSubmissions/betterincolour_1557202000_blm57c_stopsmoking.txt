8 days and it’s tough.

Just hit eight days about an hour ago and I found today to be one of my hardest days yet! Anxious, haven’t slept properly (less than five hours a night) since I quit.

Just trying to remind myself that resilience is what builds character and in the end it will all be worth it. But this journey is definitely testing me... lots of “ideas” of smoking today.

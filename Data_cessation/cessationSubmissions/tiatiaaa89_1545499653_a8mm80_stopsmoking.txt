Almost 6 months in and the dreams are wild

Hey guys! First I want to wish you success in your quitting during the holiday season. I know it can be stressful but you can do it. 

So, I’m closeish to 6 months quit.. and I’m having dreams now rather than before of me just smoking like I used to. It’s so weird, I wake up every morning feeling guilty like I smoked but then realize it was a dream and I move on with my day. No cravings at all. Is this normal after all this time? I figured within the first month or so, but now they are every night. It’s so strange, and real feeling.

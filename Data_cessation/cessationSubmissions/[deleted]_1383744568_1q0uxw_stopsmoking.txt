Learn from my mistake, don't get complacent

As you can see I’m on day 5, but I’ve actually been “quitting” for over a year now.

I quit smoking in October of last year when I was making some changes in my life and honestly found it very easy. There were no dramatics, no withdrawal symptoms, no need to talk myself out of smoking again.. it was too easy. So I remained a non smoker for about 4 months and couldn’t have been happier, then it happened. I was with some friends and decided I could have a smoke and be done with it, it was so easy to quit before right, no problem. Wrong. Since then I have been in a cycle of smoking for a week, then not smoking for a week. Non stop for nearly 9 months now. Because it wasn’t constant I deluded myself into thinking I wasn’t a smoker, I was just someone that happened to enjoy cigarettes occasionally. Of course those occasions kept getting more frequent until last week I couldn’t hide from it any longer, I was a full time smoker again. 

I’ve learnt from my mistakes and I’m recommitted to quitting once and for all. I’ve felt better this week than I have in a long time, both physically and mentally. Coming back to this subreddit, downloading a tracker app and reading Alan Carr have given me the kick I needed so I want to thank you all and contribute with a small reminder, you can kick this vile habit, we all can, but when you do make sure you don’t let it back into your life. You’ll regret it.

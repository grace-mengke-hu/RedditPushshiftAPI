Vivid dreams?

Since my partner stopped smoking, she's dreamt every single night. She used to have dreams on occasion, but never as frequently as she has now that she's stopped smoking. Sometimes multiple dreams a night, that are very vivid, and she's been suffering from sleep paralysis more frequently as well.

Has anyone else experienced this after stopping smoking?

Smoking for 8 years, quit yesterday!

Im using the patch and i feel great! I have the cravings but only to perform the act of smoking if you get what im saying. The hardest thing is my triggers ie. after a meal when i wake up and when i see a pack. I know I am not very far in but its been so much better than trying to use the gum. My Girlfriend says i smell better no more "Bleck" kisses from her it makes me so happy!

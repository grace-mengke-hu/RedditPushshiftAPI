Been three weeks - had a dream about accidentally smoking a cigarette

It's been three weeks since I quit and it hasn't been too rough since I don't really happen hang out with any smokers these days. The worst was a music festival I went to last weekend and was surrounded by it for about 8 hours straight. Last night though, I had a dream that I was hanging out with some of my old friends and one of them gave me a cigarette. I took it and didn't remember until I was about half way through that I had quit and wasn't smoking anymore. Felt terrible at my lack of willpower after making it this far, but when I woke up was quite relieved that it hadn't actually happened.

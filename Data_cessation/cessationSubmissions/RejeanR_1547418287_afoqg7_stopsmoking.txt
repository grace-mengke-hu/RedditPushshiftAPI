Trying my best to quit smoking

I had a simple case of colds and developed to a bad cough because of my smoking. I smoked since I was 18 (now 37) and just 5 days ago, when I was having a very hard time breathing, I decided I would seriously quit smoking. Now 5 days and 2 hrs and Iâ€™m already so proud of myself. I wonder how long I can keep myself from it. This is the first time that I am really trying to quit.

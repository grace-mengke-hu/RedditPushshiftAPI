Quit date in five days. Afraid i'll fail.

After doing the math of just how much i spend a month as a pack a day smoker, i've decided after my work week is finished out, I will be quitting.

My skin has a really bad reaction to the patch, and my teeth are shit from genetics / smoking / soda addiction, so gum isn't really an option. Decided I have no choice but to suck it up, put my big boy pants on, and just go cold turkey.

This time around, I actually want to quit. (I've had a few prior attempts) It's expensive, and the ~200 i would save a month could be used to start a savings account and start saving up money for a better couch, down payment for a car, whatever big ticket items I would actually want and need to save up for. 

I'm terrified that I'll fail. I don't want to go with an e-cig because then it's just trading one vice for another. I don't want to spend money on anything to smoke, unless it's the occasional pick up of the devil's lettuce. 

So i come to you dear reddit. Help me help myself. Advice, solidarity, stupid puns that make me want to go commit seppuku having heard them. It is all welcome and much appreciated.

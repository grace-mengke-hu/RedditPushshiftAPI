I'm scared of summertime

Howdy. 

This winter I've gave away smoking, like I did winter ago and winter before that. But I always came back on summertime - holidays, lots of free time, beautiful weather, alcohol involved. I also did quite a lot part time jobs with most breaks for ciggs only. Now when I think about those work breaks, summertime I'm getting scared and I feel like I'm vulnerable again and I'm going to pick up the habit again. 3/4 of my friends are smokers so that'd be a huge factor in that case, although half of them switched to e-cigs so it's not tempting for me, yet few are still conservatives that'll smoke nearby on social events.

What shall I do to overcome my fear and kick that crap out of my life for good? 

I'm trying to read Allen Carr's book as I heard it helped lots of people but I cant force myself to doing it, mainly because it's on .pdf, so many distractions. Should I force myself to doing it?


I need your help, fellow non-smokers!

Almost a month and suffering insane cravings :(

Folks - I'm on 29 days today. Will be a month tomorrow. Strangely, last few days I've been suffering INSANE cravings. It's like, I'd give anything for just 1 cigarette. Ugh! I'm aware of Not Another Puff Ever... but sometimes I just want to rush to the store and buy a frikkin pack and smoke it all up and feel shit. I really hope this goes away soon :(

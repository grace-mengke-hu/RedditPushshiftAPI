My great success

It isn't much for you who quitted a year ago, or few months ago, but for me, this is the best result I had and it is awesome! I am so happy, I can't describe, also, I didn't have a craving today, but I was just thinking about them and I realised how I missed having a cig in my hand, and I told myself: well you ain't gonna have one ever again and that is it. First time in 2 years 12 days cig free :D I just love posting so I see my badge andeveryone can see I did it! Thanks a lot!

I've set my motivation, Today is the day.

SHE hated that I smoked, SHE didn't want me to, SHE told me countless times to quit. Now she lives miles and miles away and I'm stuck here alone and smoking. I spend 90 Percent of my free time on my computer so I've set up my motivation there. A photo of her. Not because i'm doing it for her. But because I'm doing it for ME. She is just there to remind me of one of the things i've lost to cigarettes. The most important thing. Relationships. It ends today.

One year today, the longest I have ever officially gone

Life has gotten so much better in the last year. I've started running, working out, and the money I save!! I am so confident that I will never go back, but I will be smart enough this time to never let my guard down. I think I'll go treat myself to a nice supper tonight :)  Happy quitting everyone!!!

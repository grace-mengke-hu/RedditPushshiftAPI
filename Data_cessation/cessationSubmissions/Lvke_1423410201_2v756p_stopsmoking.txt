I screwed up.

Long time lurker here. I have been smoking for 11 years. On feb 1st I decided it was enough and quit cold turkey. Yesterday I was at a party and drank some beers and just couldn't resist it. I screwed up and smoked about 6 sigs that evening. This morning I woke up feeling like a loser because I smoked. I really want to stop forever but how do I not make this "mistake again"?

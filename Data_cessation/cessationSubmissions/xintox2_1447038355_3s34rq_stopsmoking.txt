Smoke and dip...need to quit nicotine outright

I smoke about a pack a day. I quit smoking for 2 years but still dipped, then I fell off the wagon about 9 months ago. I dip about 2 cans every 5 days.

Any advice? Right now I'm timing myself to only have half a cigarette every hour...see if I can taper it down.

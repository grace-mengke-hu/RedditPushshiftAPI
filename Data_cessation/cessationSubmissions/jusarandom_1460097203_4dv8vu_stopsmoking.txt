I quit smoking

I quit smoking weed about a month and a half ago. Only bc I like the feeling of truthfully being able to pass a piss test for work. Makes me feel good. Plus I quit smoking bc it puts me in mute. Literally will not talk at all. 

But aside from the weed, I have officially been 7 days cigarette, tobacco, and nicotine free. 8 if you count the fact I havent slept yet but going technically by the time of the day. Ive left it behind and this is my third time cold turkey. And now this time I am done. i WILL be making it til next year without anything nicotine/or tobacco. And the thing that I hate worst about the first month of this crap is the fact that I have a never ending bottomless pit of a stomach. I could eat, eat, eat. And if I dont, I get tired, sick, and slow at doing productive things. Like working and such. 

This is the start to never smoking again. Now when that weed come around shiiit. Haha. I might try it again in the future. But not for awhile. Btw im bout to be 21 in 2 months. And ive been smoking cigarettes since maybe 2009/2010. Freshman year of high school. (I honestly dont even know what got me started)

Any tips to keep myself away from the urge to smoke is greatly appreciated. I got extremely good self control when it comes to this but usually what gets me started on it again, depression. Bc when I get depressed, its severe. But I think being 21 and young and stupid ill be able to cope. Away from cigarettes that is. (Ill eventually not need alcohol for that) im just young and still figuring shit out ya know?

I can't stop using nicotine!

I used to smoke cigarettes, but I moved onto vaping.....and I want to flat out stop using any form of nicotine.

Frankly I think vaping is more potent and harder to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried cold turkey, by leaving my kit at home when going to work - which 1 of 2 things happen - I bum cigarettes at work....or I come home and immediately vape.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried a reward system "if you go x amount of days you get to do this" - which just results to my brain going "Wait you're an adult if you want 'x' just get it....life is too short"

&amp;#x200B;

How did you get willpower to continue.

My record was 11 months, but I had one horrible day, and I lit up.....I regret having ever done so.....

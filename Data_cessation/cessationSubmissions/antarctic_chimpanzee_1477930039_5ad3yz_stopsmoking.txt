38 days cigarette free but I miss it every day

I quit on the 23rd of September(which was probably my fifth time trying) and got an E-Cigarette. It helps but every single day that goes by I want another real one. There was nothing better than a fresh rollie and a coffee every morning and evening. Does it get better?

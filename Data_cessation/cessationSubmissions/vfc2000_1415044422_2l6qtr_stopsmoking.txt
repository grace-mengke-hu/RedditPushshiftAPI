My manly mustache still smells like delicious stale cigarette smoke.

I quit smoking about 2 weeks ago and my sense of smell is starting to return but now anytime I smell stale smoke I think it smells amazing.  I just want to stand next to smokers and put my nose on them and breathe their stench in the least creepy way possible.  I have a dudely Fu Manchu rocking on my face and I haven't shaved since I quit smoking.  Now that my sense of smell has returned a little bit I can smell how bad it reeks of stale of cigarette smoke but I don't want to shave because I can't stop pushing it up to my nose and taking a whiff of what used to be.  My car has started to smell less like cigarettes to me, though so driving home from work I  no longer get this smell.  It's for the best, though.  Stale cigarette smell can set off cravings sometimes and then I have to eat a bunch of joke food and chug energy drinks until they go away.  I wish there was a regular soda that tasted sour like energy drinks.  The sour taste helps for some reason.

Caution you long time quitters....

So my badge reads about a month but it should read over a year because I thought I was out of the woods.  

So 2 months ago I went camping with my wife.  I had quit smoking in December of 2013.  That is right, I hadn't smoked in 9 fucking months.  Since we were going on vacation and camping in the great out doors I thought we should have a few cigarettes.  Just around the campfire at night like we use to do.  Well I got us one pack and we smoked though that and then got more and more.  We said we would not smoking any once we went home.  Well that didn't work out either and I smoked for almost a month after we came back.  I finally got the brains to realize that I wasn't going to just magically stop so i bough some e-cigs phased down and now I have been without for almost a month.  I feel fucking great.

**TL;DR  When you quit, aim for never smoking a single cig ever again.**  Just one or two can snow ball you right back to where you have fought so hard to get away from.  Just know that one cig isn't worth the danger of a relapse.

*Sincerely,*

14 days smoke free, but feeling bad

So I am on day 15 and the withdrawal symptoms atm are worse than the symptoms at the beginning. It is not getting better, it kinda gets worse from day to day. Is it normal ? My willpower is completely distinguished, it just became routine to NOT smoke, but I think about it a lot.

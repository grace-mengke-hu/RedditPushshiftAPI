My god damn lungs hurt all the time.

Hi guys, I've been lurking here for a long time.  I've been trying to quit a lot of times, and now I'm trying again, so I came for some encouragement and advice.

I just wanted to ask you should I be worried 'cos my lungs hurt all the time and I'm getting somewhat scared. Should I be worred about something dangerous? I'm 25m, and have been smoking for 6 years now.

Also, what is your experience with e-cigarettes, are they any safer, did they help any of you to quit?

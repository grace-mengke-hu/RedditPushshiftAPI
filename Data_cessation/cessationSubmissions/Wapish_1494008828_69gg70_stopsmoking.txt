A really true story

Once, a usual guy of 25 came to an appointment with me. He had been suffering from nicotine dependence for more than 7 years. He used to smoke a lot, about 15 cigarettes a day. When we started talking about motivation, he told me about his dream. It was rather simple. He was from a poor family. There were many restrictions in his life. And he had a dream. His dream was an image. Imagine, he rushes on a luxurious convertible down a spacious street in Las Vegas taking over all other cars. A warm breeze is caressing his skin, his favorite music is playing, and bright lights are shining all around... This image was filled with feelings and color. When he was talking about it, his eyes were glistening and tearing a little. He wanted to breathe some different air so much. That was a sub-image of success and independence, of a different distant and exciting life.
We reached remission thanks to the therapy, and then the man moved to another place, so we were forced to stop the treatment. However, two years later I got a call and heard a familiar voice in the phone. 
He came to an appointment in a few days. I will not spend much time describing what happened to him, but the point is, he made his dream come true. He managed to earn money and experienced in reality all the images mentioned above. 
Now, ATTENTION!!! I asked him what he felt. Was he happy?
‘I was feeling weird,' he said.  ‘In my mind, I knew it was the success I have been looking forward to the most in my life. But SOMETHING was missing. As if THE JOY WAS NOT COMPLETE. I cannot describe it in words, but I felt a little SAD...’
‘What did you do?’
‘I borrowed a cigarette from my friends and SMOKED. Everything was in place now. I was finally feeling good!’

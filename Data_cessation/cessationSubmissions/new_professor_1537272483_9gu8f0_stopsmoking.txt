What do you do when you stop feeling guilty?

I've been trying to quit for the past year. I would stop for a few days, then get back on. Everytime I did, I felt guilty, and like shit. But the more I relapsed, the less guilty I felt. It's almost like I resigned to be a smoker for the rest of my life, knowing that I am too weak to quit. What should I do???

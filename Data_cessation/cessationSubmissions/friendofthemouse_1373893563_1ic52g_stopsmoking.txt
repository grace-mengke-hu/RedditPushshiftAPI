Smoking dreams are coming and going. But fake memories are new to me.

Yesterday I was at some party and someone posted a photo of me standing and eating something. My first thought was: how great they did not catch me smoking - everybody I know would find out that I am actually still smoking and just talking about quitting. Then I realized that I, in fact, do not smoke for many weeks now and did not smoke at the party either.

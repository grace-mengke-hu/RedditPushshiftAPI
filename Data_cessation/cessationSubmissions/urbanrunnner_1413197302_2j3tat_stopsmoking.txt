Not posted much but I think I made it

I still sometimes think about how nice it would be to have a cigarette and a beer. But nearly three months without a smoke more than six months without alcohol ... there's no excuse to go back.

I can't say I'm thrilled with either achievement but it's what I set out to do, so I guess I should be happy.

Not being able to breath sucks! This is why you shouldn't smoke, kids

Was diagnosed with early stages of chronic bronchitis. This is what motivated me to quit smoking. 

My lungs had been feeling a lot better since I quit (25 days ago). Then today it rained and voila! I couldn't breath again. It's truly a horrible feeling when you can't grasp air. 

Breathing! We take it for granted until you can't breath, and then you realize the obvious, breathing is kinda important to stay alive, ya know? 

Sucks to think I'll have to live with this forever. 

So quit now, resist that urge, stay strong and be a non-smoker.

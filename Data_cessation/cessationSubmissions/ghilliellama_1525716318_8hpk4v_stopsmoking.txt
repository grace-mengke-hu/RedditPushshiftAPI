Looking for motivation

I have been smoking now for 4 years starting at 16. I know how bad it is but I honestly enjoy the feeling of smoking. I would like to quit however before the long term effects start to kick in. I have always been the type of person to "live in the moment" so that makes it hard for me to quit because I justify it as if today is my last day I would rather spend it doing what I like *smoking* then not. I browse this sub often so Im sorry for the long text but if anyone can help out and share your experiences I know its you guys.

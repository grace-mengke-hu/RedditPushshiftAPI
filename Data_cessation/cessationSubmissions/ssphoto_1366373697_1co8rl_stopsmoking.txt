Thinking about going for it!

I am 27 and have been smoking for 9 years. Between 2-4 packs a day (I know, that is way beyond normal). I have tried those e-cigs, gum, patches, and just chewing on stuff. My doctor won't give me chantex because I have a history of depression. So I guess I'm here to ask, if cold turkey, when is the best time to just stop. Should I smoke all day and drop it a few hours before bed, or should I just wake up and never go near one? 

I play hockey and run/hike and I can easily run 5 miles at a 7 minute pace and skate more then half a game. I know smoking will eventually take it's toll. I don't want that. I want to quit.

Why Should I Stop Smoking?

Oh wait, I know: no more irritability, no more jittery feelings, no more anxiety, no more coughing (except now, but my body is getting the crap out), no more washing my hands a million times to hide it from my parents, no more asking "hey buddy, can I bum a smoke?", no more money wasted on packs, no more feeling guilty because I should be quitting, no more self-deprication that I'm poisoning myself, no more people telling me "jeez you smell like smoke!" no more chains of nicotine bringing me down. I have 1 week, and I feel great! It's been tough, a lot of cravings, but thanks to this subreddit and willpower, I hope to make it 1 month then 1 year. Thanks for everything r/stopsmoking!

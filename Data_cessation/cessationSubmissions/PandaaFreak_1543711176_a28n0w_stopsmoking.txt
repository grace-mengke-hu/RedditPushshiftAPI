I DO NOT have chronic bronchitis anymore ü•≥

I‚Äôve been smoking cancer sticks since I was 14 and I quit about a month after my 21st birthday. 

I would get horribly, horribly sick for months at a time, every fall/winter, without fail. I went to the doctor numerous times, was diagnosed with chronic bronchitis and was given a whole bunch of meds to deal with the symptoms. Despite the meds, every fall/winter was absolute hell and I thought I was doomed to bronchitis for the rest of my life..

..until now ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ 

December 5th with be my 4 months clean! And about a month after I quit I was waiting for my bronchitis to return...and waiting...and waiting...and it never did. I would usually be a few months into it by now. I knew the cigarettes certainly didn‚Äôt help the bronchitis but there is nothing in me and that really thought it could be the cause or reason for it coming back every single year, for sooo long. Just another example of the lies we tell ourselves to stay in the nicotine trap. But not me. Not anymore! 

So this year, I am enjoying my first holiday season not only smoke free, but bronchitis free üòÅ thank you guys for all the support! I love this community and all the encouragement, you guys rock ü•∞  

P.S I‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it again:  Go buy The EasyWay to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr!!!!!!  It is the only reason I quit (cold turkey technically!!! Wow!!!) . I was SO addicted, had anxiety attacks about being hooked on cigs until the day I died. But I swear to god (I am not sponsored or affiliated with Allen Carr or his books) I have not had one real craving since the day I read his book. No pain, no discomfort, no triggers, and not even one urge to go back to my  nasty nicotine ways. And you can search for his book online, you can read the (older) PDF version for free!!! You have nothing to lose! 

And let me know how it goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è

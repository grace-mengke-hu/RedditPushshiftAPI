47 days smoke free but.................

just had our 3pm break at work (uk time) and I was stood with the lads outside whilst they were smoking I have done this everyday for the last 46 days and never flinched once but something come over me then and I took the lit cig off my friend and had 1 small puff and immediately give it him back!!! I don't know what come over me ? why did I do this? and does this mean I have failed? please give me some advice because right now I feel the last 47 days don't count for nothing now?

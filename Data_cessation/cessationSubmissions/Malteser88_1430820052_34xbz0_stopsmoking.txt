981 days in and I slipped up

God damn it, I smoked 2 cigarettes, because I was stressed for a very long time and was feeling  down in the dumps. I felt like doing something naughty and so I went to the shop, bought a single and took a drag. It felt like a crown of thorns was lifted from my head.  I hadn't walked with a bounce since I stopped 985 days ago. I was thinking that maybe I could do a bi-weekly cigarette rule,  but 4 days later, today, the cravings came back. 

Mouth watering, panic, anxiety, zero concentration, zero motivation to do anything other than buying a packet of cigarettes, inability to concentrate & work, trouble recalling, anxiety a lot of anxiety especially social (I'm just mentally freezing when people speak to me), I have heart burn, pain in my wrist and my skin is pale. I have pressure pain mostly in my forehead, above my cheeks and under my jaw. 

I thought that after all this time I'd be able to have a relaxing stroll, a cigarette and some time to my thoughts, but I was wrong and now it begins again.  

Take this is as a general rule folks, nicotine addiction is much like alcoholism. It never goes away, it just goes to sleep, waiting for you to slip.

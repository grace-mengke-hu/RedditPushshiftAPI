just a rant to see me through...

This is my 4th day (again).  Yesterday was ok, but today is hard as fuck!  I just can’t get it through to myself that I don’t smoke!  

I keep saying to myself, it’s ok, just one pouch of tobacco, just to keep somewhere private... just in case I ‘NEED’ one.

I haven’t smoked, but I could have one.  

No I couldn’t... as I said. I don’t smoke.  I gave up for my health benefits (pretty pointless me going to the gym 3-5 days a week for the last 5 years if I’m going to smoke).  

I want to enjoy a bit of a retirement... I’ve only got around 15 years more to work (what’s the point of spending my retirement in a bed with an oxygen cylinder?).  

I actually like the way I smell... stale old smoke is not an attractive scent.  (If it was, Tom Ford would have bottled it.  Instead of Tobacco Vanille, it would have been Fagash and Tar and still cost £170).

I think I’m done for now... normality has resumed.

Thanks for listening...

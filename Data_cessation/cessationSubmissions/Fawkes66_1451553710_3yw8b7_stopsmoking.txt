I dreamt so vividly I was smoking

I mean.... here I am, daily complimenting myself on my accomplishment. And there I was last night, making a solid choice to go out to buy a package and tearing the plastic of the package. Even lighting up I was thinking: ugh....why? I don't even like the taste of the cigarette. And I foolishly smoked on. I was so dissappointed with myself. I was doing so good, 109 days on (thank you Reddit, for keeping count for me :-) ) And I threw it all away. I actually reset my badge at Reddit. 

But waking up I was singing! I actually woke up happy because I DIDN'T smoke!!! I've got reason to be proud again, no reason to talk myself down. I'm so happy today for another non-smoking day. Have a wonderful New Year's Eve you all and an amazing 2016!

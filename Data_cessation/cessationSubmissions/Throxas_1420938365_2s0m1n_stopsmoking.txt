How do you start the process?

Hello, thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and help me out. I've been smoking a pack a day for the last 5 years and have often gotten sick of smoking. The problem is once I get sick of it, I get a sudden craving stronger than ever to have a cigarette. I've recently lost my job and cant afford to continue this filthy habit however I can't find the strength to begin the process. Is there something I can do to ease the transition or is it just jump straight into cold turkey?

boyfriend is quitting. How do I help?

My boyfriend is on chantix.  He's past the crying-for-reason phase, and the smoking now feels like nothing.  He still wants to smoke, but there is no payoff.  So, the chantix is working perfectly.

But he feels really upset that there is nothing left for him to look forward to.  He started smoking really young, 19.  He explained it as how he learned to be an adult.  Smoking was the point of a break.  That's how he calmed down.  It was a reward.  It made the world stop.  It was the point of getting off of work.  Smoking.  Driving is really difficult, as he was constantly smoking.  When I drive, he just plays on his phone, tuning lots of things out.

He's anxious, but he isn't raging out or anything.  He just doesn't have an off or pause button now.  He's overwhelmed and feels powerless.

I'm not exactly the best person to explain coping mechanisms to him, lacking any real ones of my own.  But what can I do?

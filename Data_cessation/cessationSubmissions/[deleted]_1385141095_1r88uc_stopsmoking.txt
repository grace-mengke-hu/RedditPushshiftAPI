I'm doing this !!... yet again...

Roughly a pack a day for the past 4-5 years. Have tried to quit since December 2012 around 4-5 times. Longest was 3 weeks then I got right back into it after a rough night. I started running 10 days into my last quit and achieved a personal milestone of not being out of breath till about 20-25 minutes in. I noticed in those 3 weeks that my headaches, chest tightness and morning cough had completely disappeared and I felt fresh as hell. I want to be that guy again.

Even though I am a very casual drinker (a few beers every 2-3 weeks), I've also noticed that almost every quit of mine has been ruined under the influence of alcohol too so I think I am going to stop drinking for a little while too (Minimum 1 year).

Hi, I'm badabingbadabang and I'm ready to get some nasty chemicals out of my system.

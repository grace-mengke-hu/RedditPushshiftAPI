Getting off 7mg patch

How hard is this to do? I know I’m going to do it and be fine. But I just wanna know what it’s gonna be like. Is 7mg to 0mg enough for a ton of withdrawals? Will the withdrawals pass faster than cold turkey? I’ve been on the patch for 19 days and switched to 7mg a few days ago. I don’t see myself as a smoker anymore. Working on changing my internal identity while on the patch and I can see myself without relying on ciggies to cope with boredom and anxiety. I’m thinking of going off the 7mg early to get it over with, maybe in 14 days instead of 30, unsure yet

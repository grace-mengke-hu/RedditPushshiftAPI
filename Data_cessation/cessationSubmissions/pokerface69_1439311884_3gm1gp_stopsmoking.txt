Regretting that party :(

As your might have already guessed, had quit in jan end, was smoke free for 4 months thanks to Alan Carr and this epic forum :) I was completely free from any cravings! but in one party I thought yeah I can have one....long story short been smoking since last one month. 
but I quit again and I'll just complete 4 days  in couple of hours :) feels nice 
feels free! thanks guys

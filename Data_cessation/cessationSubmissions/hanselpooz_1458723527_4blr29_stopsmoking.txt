Couldn't believe it

Quitting smoking is the easiest thing I've done. I had been smoking for 5 years, heavily for 3. By heavily, I don't know how everyone else has their cigarettes but we do 30 and 50 gram pouches of tobacco.  I was smoking 80 grams a week of tobacco on an average week. To give you an idea of what this is if you can't get it,  on a work day by 5.40pm I had had about 20 cigarettes and would at least have 40 by bedtime. I am currently only 22. Before quitting smoking I had no resolve. Here's the thing - the resolve I needed to quit smoking came straight after not having that first smoke. I couldn't believe it. I had an e-cig, only had nicotine in it for one day then I was off it. No withdrawals. It has been 3 months without a slip up.  The best thing I think you can do is find your reason. You can't just need money. You need to save money or you can't have something that outweighs your fear of quitting. You have to NEED to quit badly enough to jump in. Good luck everyone!!!

For you ex-vapers. What benefits did you notice when you quit vaping ?

Almost all of us hated and loved our addiction. However, for the vast majority of us, we did hate smoking for many reasons that are unquestionable such as smelling like shit andlosing sense of smell.
Add to that all the negative social consequences of "being a smoker trapped in an elevator with your colleagues".


So it's normal that when smokers quit, they are happy as they can immediately sense all the benefits of those things completely vanish.  
But what about you vapers?  What benefits did you notice once you quit vaping completely?

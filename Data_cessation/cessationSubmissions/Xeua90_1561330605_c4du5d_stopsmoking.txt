Damm you! Trying to save myself with vape!

Hey guys! I quit smoking about 1 month ago using patches. 2 days ago I smoked 1 cigarette and yesterday I wanted another. So... In the morning I started to "re"using my vape before buying a pack of cigarettes. so far, it's working. 
 
My question is:
1-Will I still see the difference now that Im vaping? I'm talking about skin, taste, breathing better etc etc. Because actually Im not sure  if vaping is as bad as smoking.

THANK YOU!!!

Have a big test tomorrow. Can't study.

I'm in college right now.
I have a big test tomorrow.
I would usually start studying a week earlier, but I just couldn't get myself to focus.
Now that the test is tomorrow I am more stressed out.
I feel like I will just fail this test, which will affect my grades greatly.

Should I just smoke?

In all honesty, academics comes first to me right now, because I am a student.

Went to the bar last night and I succeeded even when I was surrounded by smokers!

So I went to the bar last night, and I bought one beer and hung out with some friends inside. It was going well. Every once in a while I would have an itch, but it was mild enough and I was easily distracted. 

I went to the bathroom and got my second beer and discovered that everyone had moved to outside. 2 of the 4 people I was with were outside smoking and there was only one seat open; in between the smokers. :( I put my big girl pants on and sat down.. it felt okay, I never felt super stressed about it. 

After a few moments, the girl next to me, who I had just met, said "sorry if I'm blowing this in your face" and smiled sheepishly. I remembered when I said that, and being sorry for blowing my nasty smoke in people's faces.. I realized that it was silly to envy them.

Anyway, super proud of myself. Thanks to this group for all the encouragement and support!

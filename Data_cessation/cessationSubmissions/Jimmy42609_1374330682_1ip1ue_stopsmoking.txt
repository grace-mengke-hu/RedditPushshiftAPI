It's been 2 MONTHS since my last smoke and my progress has been....

One crazy rollercoaster ride with twist and turns that throw me in every which direction that I never want to go through again.   I have a few questions for all of you who are smoke free like me.  

I'm on the tail end of the 8th week and my chest is still feeling tightness, is that normal? 

Also I am having very life like dreams including everybody I have ever cross paths with in my life more than once.  For instance one night this week I dreamed about entering my mothers friends house who we used to vacation with when I was a kid and haven't seen them since I was 12 which was 17 yrs ago.  Normal to be having these kind of dreams?

Ok that was longer than I expected it to be.  Thanks for listening

Cardiologist

To celebrate 88 days, I'm off to the cardiologist for one of two appointments this week. At least I can say I haven't smoked in almost 3 months. Wish me luck!  [nervous](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/nrvs.gif)

Echo showed I have a strong heart. :) [whew](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/original.gif)

And another reason not to smoke: I never want my left boob massaged by a strange man again...no matter how nice he is.

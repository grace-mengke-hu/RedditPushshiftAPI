Today is the day... day one of attempt number 2^n*n

Once again, I am trying to quit. This time forever... I recently (read yesterday) picked up a beauty of a [little e-cig mod](http://i.imgur.com/Cgebuxe.jpg), some potent liquid to help take the edge off, and a new-found desire to quit.

For those playing at home, here are a few of the things over the years:

* Tried the gum. Gave up when I was putting four pieces in my mouth at a time. (yes, chew and hold.)

* Tried the tablets/lozenges. Those just shredded the inside of my mouth. I think I still have a few tubes laying around the house from 8 years ago.

* Tried the patches. There's an episode of the Simpsons where Krusty is trying to quit, covered head to toe in patches, and has Sideshow Mel put one on his tongue. Anyone else remember that? I kinda lived it, and was still smoking two packs of camel unfiltered a day...

* Tried vaping once before, but it was in the early days of the scene and the equipment I had just kind of put me off.

* Good old Allan Carr. Whilst a good read, that's all it was to me, a good read. Maybe I am too cynical?

* Cold turkey!!! Yes, I quit cold turkey before, for a whole six months following my heart attack! Six, long, miserable months with a monomaniacal obsession of just wanting a cigarette hitting my brain once a minute...

So yeah, here I go again. I even put in for my badge and everything, so I gotta stick to it right? That said, I feel sorry for my co-workers today, considering I want to claw their eyes out for everything...

Wish me luck, maybe, and see y'all on the far side.

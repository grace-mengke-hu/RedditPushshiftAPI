3 days in and I've found myself on the struggle bus.

Last year, I quit for almost 4 months before giving in (like a moron). I recently read Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" and had my last cigarette ever on Sunday. It's now Wednesday night and the entire day has been clouded by what seems like non-stop rapid-fire cravings. I honestly don't remember the cravings being THIS relentless last year. And that was when I worked as a bartender and the smoking section was 10 feet from me across a gigantic window. I'm meditating on Allen Carr's advice and I'm convinced I'm done smoking, but holy moly.

Anyone experience anything like this? What do you do to distract yourself? Any and all advise is welcome.

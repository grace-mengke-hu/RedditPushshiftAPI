"Quit" 24 hours ago, already relapsed. Can't take the anxiety.

Been smoking for 15 years. I decided to quit cold turkey 24 hours ago, and almost had a full blown panic attack this morning.

I want to stop, I don't want to get cancer or heart disease - but I also don't want to feel like utter shit.

Did anyone of you guys have anxiety when stopping? Would love to hear about so I have something to fallback on when I feel like shit.

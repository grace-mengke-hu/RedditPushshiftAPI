Lets do this! Today.

My first post on here. Hopefully I didn't mess up my badge. I've been smoking for 3 something years. Heavily smoking 1-2 packs a day for two years. LSS. I ended up in a correctional facility for 6 months or so I've smoked a total of one cigarette in there. It's weird how all of a sudden I decided to take care of myself. When I got out.. a month passed and I got back into it again slowly through peer pressure. Been smoking almost steadily for three months now and I want to quit. 

I guess besides the real obvious reason to quit, my main reason is that I lose weight quickly when i smoke, working out and smoking is not doing me any good.

The journey has begun

So I’m 1.5 days into my quitting journey and it’s been mostly manageable. The one thing, however, that I am truly struggling with is how horrible my quality of sleep has suddenly become. Is this a part of withdrawal? The past two nights have been plagued with having a lot of trouble falling asleep and then waking up intermittently throughout the night. Is there any way to mitigate this without smoking of course.

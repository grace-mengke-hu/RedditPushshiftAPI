quitting again

LAst time I quite successfully I stopped for a few years; that time I stopped using Allan Carr's easy way, did it cold turkey.. but I was on holidays so had no stress and didn't need to worry about concentrating and being awake/in a good mood.

&amp;#x200B;

This time I'm trying to stop while working, and am thus using nicotine patches. Not sure if I'm craving nicotine right now or the just the habit of going outside and smoking, I mean it shouldn't, in theory, be nicotine cravings as I've got  a high strength nicotine patch on. But my brain still wants a cigarette.  

I'm going to go for a stroll around the block, urgh. 

It felt so easy last time doing it while on holidays. This time not so.

A whole week!

I have been smoke free for a week!  I've tried quitting before but this is the longest I have gone.

I am using the patch.  I haven't had any cravings.  Yesterday was really the worst day.  I found myself really exhausted and there wasn't enough food on the planet to curb my hunger.  But I went to bed early last night and I'm feeling much more chipper than I did yesterday.

This sub has been just wonderful.  We can do it!

[M21] I'm going drinking tonight - worried about the "habit".

So I'm on my fourth day, I smoked my last fag at around 2:20am on the 29th of September. Finished reading Allen Carr's book and have stuck with it so far. 

I really struggled on day two with cravings that were much worse than expected. Since then, I've had them but have been fairly easily able to quell the urge.  

Tonight being my usual night out, means I'm gonna be having a fair bit of alcohol. I'm not worried about buying any before hand, or anything like that. I'm worried that out of "habit", I know I'm going to go with the 99% of my friends that smoke, into the smoking area however many times that happens tonight, and I know I'm going to be offered cigs/might just bum one off somebody/have a drag just because it's what I normally do.

When I've had these feelings so far (after meals with my girlfriend, in the mornings etc) I've just stood outside for a breath of fresh air, but that's not going to be possible tonight. 

Anyone have any tips for just avoiding the "habit". I don't want to smoke, I know that, but I'm worried on some level that on nights out it's automatic. Nights out are where I started, and I just want to be extra cautious tonight.

Day 6 and struggling more than I expected.

I started out only as a social smoker, bumming one or two when I was out to bars with my friends. That progressed into a habit, never more than a pack a week but I found myself starting to crave cigarettes. At most I would smoke a pack in a night then stop for a week or two. At some point I realized that the smell, the cough, and the expense weren't worth it, and decided I should stop smoking altogether, socially or otherwise. Well, it's been less than a week and I went to a bar with friends. My friends went out for a smoke and I had to stop myself from going out with them. It was weird sitting alone at our table and I found myself actually craving a smoke. I have addictive tendencies so I know I need to stop before it becomes a more serious issue, and unfortunately that means not just one or two when I'm out with friends, I have to go cold turkey. 

I really wish I had never started smoking in the first place, it's an awful habit and so hard to kick. Best of luck to those of us who are trying to have a smoke-free 2015 (and beyond).

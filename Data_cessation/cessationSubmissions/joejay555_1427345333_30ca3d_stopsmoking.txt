4 weeks of no smokes but i feel very lethargic / tired / hungry all the time.

well not exactly 4 weeks but almost 4 weeks. 
i got off chantix about 2.5 weeks ago and been smokeless since. However I have gained about 15 pounds , i feel really tired , clumsy , most of the time . 
my friend said that i was experiencing post acute withdrawals and they would go away . 

I feel like iam on the verge of relapsing , help , tell me to snap out of it please

thank you

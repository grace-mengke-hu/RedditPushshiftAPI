Benefits of quitting vaping

I also posted this at electronicigarettes subreddit but I decided to cross post it here hoping for a few more responses.

I  am forever thankful that I was able to use an ecig to stop smoking,  after trying everything and even struggling through the transition  (failing multiple times) this is the only thing that ever worked.  Amazing.

However  for some reason I'm just kind of bored of vaping. Just being reliant on  it on a day to day level, accidental dehydration, fixation on it when  it's not available, headache when mindlessly chain vaping while working  on things, feels like it still affects the quality of my breathing.

Obviously  the transition from cigarettes to vaping came with a whole host of  benefits such as sense of smell, easier to breathe, generally increase  in sense of well-being, emotional stability but are there any further  benefits that anyone can identify from moving from vaping to nothing?

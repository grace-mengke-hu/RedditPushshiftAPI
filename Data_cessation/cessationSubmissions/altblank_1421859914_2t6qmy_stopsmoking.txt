almost a year...

and soon enough, it will be one year since i quit smoking.

man, this feels good!

to be clear, i did test smoke two cigarettes during the past one year (and both well after my official quit date too, months apart), and those were just to see if i would like smoking after all - nope, i was disgusted by them, both times.

after 26 years of smoking almost a pack a day, this feels more than good. it's the single-largest most-importantest damn achievement i've ever had.

in the past year, i've definitely encountered every situation that i would originally have coped with by smoking, and i have NOT given in. love, fear, hate, anger, boredom, happiness, sadness, name it and i've experienced it... without a single bit of nicotine around me.

my sweat has stopped stinking. my body odor is more of a comfortable smell than what you would call an odor. the breath flows better, and smells better (i think). not one of my clothes has that tell-tale smoke odor.

one downside is that i don't go outside the house as much now (unless i remember to get out, take a couple of deep breaths and go back indoors), so there's tons of snow just sitting around, waiting to be shoveled. when i used to smoke, i would do that even with the snow-blower (two things = one stone, yay!), but no more.

work is more focused; i don't get out unless it's to take a quick walk and get some exercise in, so end up either getting stuff done very productively, or in my downtime, end up learning something new or the other, instead of taking an immature smoke break.

so if anyone needs some inspiration, read this and be comforted: it gets better, much better, and keeps getting better. there are NO downsides to quitting smoking, period.

ps: the two that i did smoke, i did as a non-smoker trying cigarettes out; not as an ex-smoker trying to see if i'm still quit. a very subtle difference, and all in the mind.

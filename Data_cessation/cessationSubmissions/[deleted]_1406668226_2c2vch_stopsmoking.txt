Been smoking for 2 years. I'm on day 6

I want to nip this habit before it becomes a serious health problem. I'm currently on day 6 and this shit is hard. I've been watching a lot of movies and I've never noticed how much people smoke in movies. It's like every fucking scene. Anyway if I can do it, then so can you! We're in this together.

Last Week Of Smoking

So I'm currently a freshman in college, and I've been smoking roughly about 5-10 cigarettes a day for 3 years. I know it's definitely not as long and as frequent as some of the other people here, but it's still really hard for me to quit. 

What can I say, I just really really love the damn thing even though it's ruining my life. I started smoking because I was depressed and had anxiety, but I feel like in the long run it isn't worth it at all and will make these problems even worse. In addition, I'm at school for music and yes, you guessed it. I'm a voice emphasis. I want to be able to conduct choirs and sing all over the world, so this shit has to stop now.

I did about 90% of the work. Gave away all my smoking related paraphernalia (rolling papers, my precious zippo, rolling machine, cigarette case) and now all I have is an old bic lighter and some stale native american spirit ryo tobacco (I rolled my cigarettes for about a year because I moved to New York). Today was my first day of cutting down and managed only to smoke 2, pretty big deal for me.

Just wondering what helped you guys stay off, what helped release stress, and how I can convince myself that I'm not immortal and see the cons outweigh the pros.

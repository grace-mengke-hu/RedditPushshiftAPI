51 days. Still vaping.

Hey all... I'm at 51 days and the good news is I have absolute and complete confidence that I will never smoke another cigarette.  I am getting some health benefits and I feel great!  The bad news is, I am still vaping pretty heavily on 15 mg/mL (pretty strong juice) -- I love the vape.  I have had some limited success in going to 10 mg/mL juice, I am cutting myself off from the 15 as soon as I run out.  But it is proving harder than I had thought to wean myself off the vape.  I am somewhat proud of myself for not smoking, after a pack a day for almost 30 years, 50 days of zero cigarettes is a miracle... but I am worried about the vaping.  Anyone had a similar experience, got any pointers for me?  Many thanks to you, this is a great sub and I would not have gotten as far as I have without you...

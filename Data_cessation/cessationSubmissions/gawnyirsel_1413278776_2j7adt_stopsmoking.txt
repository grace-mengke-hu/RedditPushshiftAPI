5 days smoke free

I have been smoking for 32 years!! I am now 5 days smoke free & quite proud as I have NEVER quit this long EVER!! I need some advise... I am currently using a vapor pen is this cheating??? It really does help me stop reaching for the cigs! The pen is all I'm using though.. No pills, patches or gum! I still have strong cravings 1st thing in the morning & after I eat but the pen seems to help! I just keep saying if I can do another hour then next thing I know a few hrs pass! Everyday at 1:30pm is another full day but this is so difficult any advice would be greatly appreciated üëç

200 Days ya'll!

I can't believe how much better I feel and how much more energy I have!  I still have the occasional vivid nightmare where I cave and smoke a cigarette, but my waking cravings are never near as severe as the ones in my dream.  I distract myself for 3-5 minutes during a craving, and I move on.  

200 days and still going strong.  I'm running my second half marathon this Sunday.   I fell in love with running after I quit.  I think it's because it's the first time in 11 years I can feel myself really breathe.  As someone who was hopelessly addicted to cigarettes, I still can't believe I am a non-smoker.  It's very exciting!

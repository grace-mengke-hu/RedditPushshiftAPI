Just Do It. . . Right?!

I have been smoking on and off since I was 12. I even had a fantastic 3 year period where I didn't smoke at all. Never one to be controlled,  I have always taken pride in the fact that I could walk away from any addiction-inducing activity; coke, meth, booze,  cigarettes . . . If I wanted to do it,  I did. When I wanted to stop,  I did. 

Today I have to say it. I can't do it this time. I can't fucking put them down and I don't know why. I want to--I'm a fucking fitness instructor,  for chrissake.  I donâ€™t know where to start or what to do. It's been four months. I'm not even entirely sure I'm getting enjoyment from it.  I have tried to quit recently but I'm not willing to reach out to my family or friends with my latest attempt. They won't believe me. They know I'll fail,  just like like last month and the month before that. 

So now what. . .? How do I do this alone?

First post regarding this. Big step for me.

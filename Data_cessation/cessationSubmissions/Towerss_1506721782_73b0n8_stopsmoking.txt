Alcohol isn't good anymore.

After I stopped with the cigarettes, alcohol feels shitty. I'm no longer anxious so alcohol just doesn't have any effect beyond making me behave in a sedated way and reduce my faculties.

I just feel way more charming and happy when I'm off the booze. Every time I start being able to even feel alcohol at parties now I immediately quit drinking because of how shitty the effect is - and I used to be a party every weekend and always get drunk guy from age 16 to 23.

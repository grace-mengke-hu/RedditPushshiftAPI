I need your help. Looking for someone to quit for -- Have you lost someone you truly loved to lung cancer caused by cigarettes?

This may seem an odd request, and please don't feel you *must* share, but I'm searching for someone whose memory I can dedicate my quitting to.

I'd be incredibly grateful to hear any stories you wish to share. I'm a fairly empathetic person, and simply think it'll help boost my chances of successfully quitting (with this at the forefront of my mind.)

I have a very invasive surgery scheduled in January, and want to quit on December 6th... For me, and my health, it's simply a no-brainer; I don't need to make healing any harder than it already will be.

I'd be extra grateful if you'd be willing to not only share about your loved one, but allow me to PM you if I need good vibes to help me through; Perhaps a story or two about this person to help me move forward during the tough times, and keep them in my mind as a truly good reason to quit this awful habit once and for all.

Thank you!

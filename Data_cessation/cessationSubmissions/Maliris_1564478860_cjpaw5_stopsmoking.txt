2 weeks!

I made it 2 weeks without smoking! It's been a tough road but not impossible. It really is possible to quit. I still get cravings in certain situations, but sometimes I just forget that I ever smoked at all. 

I already have seen great benefits. All of my senses have improved. Even my eyesight! Everything just looks more crisp and detailed now. It's like I can take in more from my visual field. Not to mention my ability to smell and taste. I mean trips to the grocery store are just incredible now. There's so much different smells that it's amazing. I also feel more especially in my extremities. Touch from my gf feels just heavenly now. My hearing is probably the only that hasn't changed much. 

 I'm still struggling with focus but it just feels different instead of worse I think. It's much easier to really immerse myself into different activities since there's no constant need to smoke. Downside is that my time management has suffered, because I get lost in different activities for a very long time sometimes. Not that smoking really improved it though. I just lost my time in smoking before.

Keep going! It will take some time, but these benefits are definitely worth the initial discomfort.

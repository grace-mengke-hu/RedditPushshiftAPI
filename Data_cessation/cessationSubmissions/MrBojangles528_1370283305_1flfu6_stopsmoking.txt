The Big Quit: Day 6

A little background on my story: My name is Scott, I am a 27 year old from Seattle who has been smoking for about three years. I also suffer from Crohn's Disease, which is a particularly nasty form of IBS. 

Now to the current situation: On Wednesday of last week I was rushed into the urgent care clinic with extreme stomach pain. It turned out to be a severe flare-up of my Crohn's Disease and I have been in the hospital ever since. The situation is so severe that I may need surgery to fix it. Since they obviously don't let you smoke in the hospital, I have been using the patch while I'm here. If I do end up having surgery I am looking at up to two weeks in the hospital without smoking. I figure this is the best opportunity to get a head start on my quit since smoking isn't even an option. I will not ever smoke another cigarette, and that is an exciting prospect. This will be the silver lining on the cloud of this Crohn's flare-up. 

It has been going very well so far and it feels great to go so long without smoking! I am going to start reading Alan Carr's book today for extra motivation. I apologize for the long story but there isn't much to do here!

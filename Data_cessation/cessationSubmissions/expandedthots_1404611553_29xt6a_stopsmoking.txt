Just quit tonight

Hi guys, decided to post here for some moral support. Decided to go full out on what will hopefully be my last quit attempt ever. Only have been smoking a pack a day for 5 years, but a month ago my uncle who I was close to died at 54...mainly because he smoked 2 packs a day and drank heavily. Trying to take a lesson from him and quit now before it gets too late. Smoked my last one as I was driving by his old house and said thanks to the old man for showing me the full breadth of the evils of smoking. Already dumped the last pack I had in a water bottle to see how gross it gets over time. Any advice/support is much appreciated!

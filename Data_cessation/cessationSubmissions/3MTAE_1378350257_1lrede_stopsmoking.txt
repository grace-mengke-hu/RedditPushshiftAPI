Seven days make one weak

Weak isn't the best word to describe my state but I couldn't resist the pun.  Annoyed may be a better word.  For some reason I was expecting the compulsions to gradually and steadily fade.  I quit cold turkey after reading Allen Carr's book.  I mentally braced myself for the first 3 days and imagined the worst was over.  Days 4, 5 and 6 were smooth other than the quitter's flu symptoms of nasal drip and constipation.  

The best figurative description of what I am experiencing now is:  I am thirsty for poison.

I know the benefits of stopping outweigh the smoky pleasure.  I am done forever.  These damned compulsions just surprised me with their intensity after disappearing for a while.  I will soldier on with renewed vigilance.  I won't be taken off guard again.

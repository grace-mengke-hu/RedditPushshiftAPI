You . . . Got . . . This...

So, 3 and a half years ago I started stopping again. For the 7,932nd time, give or take a few hundred. When I started I really wanted to quit, just like all the other times, but after failing so often there was that nag in the background, assuring me that I'd die a smoker. So, I added a couple more false stops to my record. 

I guess the one that stuck was when I stopped trying to see me never, ever smoking again. When, after weaning, I instead settled for not smoking the next cigarette. Then the next one. Then the one after that. Little by little that urge came after longer gaps of not thinking about tobacco.

For the record I'd smoked for, well, decades. There was always a smoke, through good times and bad, through highs, lows, and in-betweens, gf's, lovers, flings, and wives, smorgasborg and famine, life, death, raising children, promotions, small businesses, coffee, tea, wine and beer. All my life, when I had nothing else, I had a smoke, even on days when that was literally all I could afford. Yup, with my last couple of bucks I'd buy smokes v food. Cigarettes convinced me they were my friend, my only friend in bad times. HA, I was a true addict.

I'm here saying all that to say I know how many of you feel. I read about your Hell Week, about slipping up, of feeling like you failed yourself. I feel you. Really.

And I'm here to say. You . . . Got . . . This
It's OK if it hurts, keep going. If you slip up, quit again. If you don't think you'll make it another day, make it another hour.

What ever you do, whatever happens, just don't permanently loose your desire to quit. You'll do it when it's time. 

Believe me, I'm looking at my flair with amazement. In my wildest fantasy I didn't think I could do it . . . until I did it. Day.by.day, minute by minute. Here come's the cliche, but it's true.

If I could do it, You.CAN.do.it.
Don't ever give up on giving them up.

You . . . Got . . . This.

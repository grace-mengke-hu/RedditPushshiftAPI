4days in

I've smoked cumulative for roughly three years and I just recently decided to quit but more and more I feel like it wasn't for myself and it was just because my friend did it.

As the days go on without smoking I find myself getting saltier the more and more I think about the fact that I can't smoke. I haven't relapsed yet but it really seems to bother me more than I feel it should. I would normally only ever smoke anywhere from half a pack on normal days. and  extremely bad days which, in all honesty weren't very common one pack a day.

I understand all the health benefits that come along with it and everything, and I understand that females would in turn be more attracted to me as a result of me not smoking but I just can't get through the psychological condition that makes mr feel like cigarettes actually helped a lot more than they really did.

Any advice or even just open conversation?

Trying Zyban (Wellbutrin) All else has failed.

I recently asked my dr to prescribe me Zyban to attempt to use it to quit smoking once and for all.

I was prescribed 1 x 300mg Generic 24hr release tablet per day.

The second day I started having side effects, Dizziness, headaches, a sense of dysphoria.

Apparently these are fairly common side effects, however I am wondering if anyone who has had similar side effects can tell me if they go away. How long it took for them to go away.

I realize everyone's experience is going to be different, but I already have a bit of anxiety about my health and feeling like Im having a stroke or anyersym terrifies me.

Thanks

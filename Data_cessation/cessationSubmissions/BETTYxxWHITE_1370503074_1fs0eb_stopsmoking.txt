Day 1. Changing my life one day and one less cigarette at a time.

Well today is the day. I've tried quitting before and it just didn't turn out too well. Lately I've come to some realizations in my life and have decided to make some big changes. I've got a fresh start comin up this fall in college and a new job starting today. Smoking has lead me to lie to my parents, it's taken a lot from my athleticism that I take great pride in and has lead me down a road I don't want to go down. I am ready to embrace change and start fresh in my life starting with quitting! Not looking for up votes or anything so down vote if you want.  I guess I just really needed to put it on paper (or in this case reddit). So wish me luck and hopefully I can post here again with good progress news down the road as many of you have! Wish me luck!

I WANT to quit, but...

So here's the thing. I want to quit, but I haven't been able to muster up the strength. Simply speaking, I love smoking, but I'm tired of coughing, smelling, getting winded walking up a long flight of stairs, and it's just overall not worth it anymore.

I smoke during coffee, while driving, when out having some beers. I don't know what I'll do to replace it when I quit. I also have like, no will power to boot. I've spent months lurking here in this sub, and you guys are a huge contributor to me finally wanting to give it up.


Any tips, tricks, suggestions, or words of wisdom? I'd really appreciate anything. 
Thanks for being here!

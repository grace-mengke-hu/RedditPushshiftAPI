Some days are harder

It has been 18 days and 9 hours. I have the stupid routine cravings everyday. Some days I have more and and stronger cravings. I mean I guess that’s what you would call it. Like I will get in the truck and start to drive and automatically start to look for a cig and have to remind myself that I quit smoking. But I guess the up side is I must not be thinking about it all day long just during the routine times I would have had one one before. Then sometimes my addicted brain tries to tell me I could just get a pack and have one a day and that wouldn’t be so bad   But we all know it wouldn’t just stay one a day   So I have to mentally push the thoughts away and try and distract myself. I’m worried it will never be much better. Like 5 years from now I’ll wake up and forget I quit and still have to talk myself out of doing it. “Sigh”

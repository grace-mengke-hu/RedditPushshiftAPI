Update and some physical and emotional symptoms.. need answers for.

Its been 10days. I'm having symptoms I don't recall reading anywhere. 

- shivers at night 
- general cold feeling within - like I have a light fever
- extremely emotional - I cried, I never do this. 

The remaining I've read like nausea and irritability - any idea when this will go? 

I also started the quit when I got a bad cold and fever. Took it as a reason to start now than later. But the fever was gone in the first 4 days. 

The update
My day was quite stressed out yesterday. I'm hoping and planning a better day today as it's Saturday. Will go exercise as well. I have also cross the 250hrs of not smoking now and am happy I'm not a smoker:)

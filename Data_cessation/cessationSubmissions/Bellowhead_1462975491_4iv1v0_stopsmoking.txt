Advice for a sort of social smoker

Hi all, apologies if this comes up a lot but I'm looking for a bit of advice. 

I tend to smoke about 5-6 cigarettes a week. It's basically social smoking during breaks at work, so never at weekends and usually a couple on Friday and one or two throughout the week. I want to shake this habit, partially because I know it's bad for me (duh) and also because I don't want it to develop into something more serious. 

Whenever I look into it online the only information I can find is stuff like "people who think they only smoke a few a week probably aren't tracking it properly" or "social smokers seek social situations to feed their addiction" etc. I know this doesn't apply to me. 

Basically does anyone have any information on the health impacts on smoking minimal amounts like this? 

Thanks in advance!

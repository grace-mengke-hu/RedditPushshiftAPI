I just hit 5 Months at Noon Today!! October 11th 2015 was my quit date.

Unreal! 5 months of not smoking!! 152 days! $1,600 saved.  I'm actually saving it too! 4,561 cigarettes not smoked.  That makes me ill to think about how many that is.  I'm still amazed by how good I feel and the positive effects of being a non-smoker!! I was a pack plus a day smoker for 28 years so you new quitters have faith that it can be done.

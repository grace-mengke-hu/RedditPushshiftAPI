Getting a jaw infection from a wisdom tooth extraction is a great way to reduce how noticeable your nicotine cravings are.

The painkillers help too, although knowing my luck I'll come out of this smoke-free yet addicted to opiates, on top of the gaping hole in my jaw.

Day 12 of quitting.  Ugh.  I miss them ever so much.

One month down, a whole lot more to go...

I'm new to this sub, but I thought I would share my experience with everyone! I'm 22 and was a smoker since age 17. I was never a heavy smoker (around 10-12 on an average day), but I was a very consistent one. 

I moved in with my girlfriend in January, and she is not a smoker and always begrudgingly put up with my habits, so I tried to cut back once we moved in together. Interestingly, something strange happened. I began to lose the motivation to go outside and smoke and when I drove, smoking felt like something that was part of driving, rather than enjoyable in itself. Then, I had major back surgery, so that further allowed me to quit (pretty much forcefully). 

Now, I'm a month in and I've not smoked at all. I do get bad cravings every now and then. I get anxious very frequently and my retreat was always to smoke, training myself to think that it made me feel better, so those moments have been difficult. Also, when I hang around friends that smoke, I so badly want to crave just one, because I start thinking "whatever it's just one". 

But I'm fighting it still and I'm so glad I found this sub, just to at least provide a community of people in the same boat.

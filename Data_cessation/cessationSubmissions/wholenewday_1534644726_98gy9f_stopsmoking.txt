Over two months now...

Something made me think tonight about all the things I've been quitting or trying to quit and I had to come back to this sub to see what my daycount for quitting smoking was. I completely forget when it was.. Didn't realize I had made it over two months. I thought I'd just put it out there that, at least for myself, I'm at a place now where I don't think about smoking, don't remember when the last time I had a craving... oddly, either feel nothing or feel mild disgust when passing smokers in the street.. It's just not apart of me anymore. I wanted to say that to hopefully give some people who are struggling hope.. It was an awful time quitting.. took about 5-6 weeks for me to start to relax, not be irritable and not feel cravings.  But now... I'm shocked I use to do that.. and for so many years. 

Anyways, stay strong, stay with it, and if you're like me, it will someday be a thing of the past.

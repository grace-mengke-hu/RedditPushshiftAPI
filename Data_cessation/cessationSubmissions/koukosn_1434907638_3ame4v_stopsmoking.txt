Decrease in productivity

Smoke-free 72 hours or so, I see a real decrease in my productivity and motivation to start a task / job. 

I used to smoke one before I got into a new task to help me concentrate and get down to work, now I seem to just procrastinate... anybody went through this? what should I do?

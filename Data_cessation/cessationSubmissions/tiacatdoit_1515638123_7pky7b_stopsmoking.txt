10 year smoker want to quit again

Hey all, I’ve been smoking for about 10 years and I feel like it’s time to get serious about quitting. I keep getting sick, I have chest pain, I worry constantly about how smoking is ruining my health.

I quit once last March and lasted 4 months until I got cheated on and went through a break up.

Any tips for making it through those first few days cold turkey? I remember being really hungry and feeling lightheaded.

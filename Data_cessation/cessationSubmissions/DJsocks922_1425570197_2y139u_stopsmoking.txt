New here. Want this to be my last pack.

So I started smoking in grade 11, am in my 4th year at university. I really want to stop smoking. Usually when I go home for holidays I won't smoke a cigarette in a week or so with no problems, but then I'll go out and smoke a pack and a half in a night. But here at varsity I buy a pack everyday. 

I have decided this is my last pack. I have 11 left, and 2 stashed away for rainy days. 

I need help guys. 

Yes, I know how much money you save yada yada yada. But it doesn't seem to motivate me enough to quit. Maybe because I havnt actually seem the results of quitting? 

And how am I going to calm my nerves before a 5 hour exam? Any tips or suggestions are welcome.

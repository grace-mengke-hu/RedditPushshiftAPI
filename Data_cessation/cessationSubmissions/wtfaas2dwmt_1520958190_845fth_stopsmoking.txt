I'm starting to become a regular smoker, and it's bothering me, but I don't want to give up those moments of clarity.

I'm craving tobacco for the first time in my life. I don't crave it when I'm drunk, but after dinner. Between classes. When I'm studying. Before going to bed. 

So I wanted to ask those who have successfully quit: What did you replace your smoke with?
Because I really need that occupation to clear my mind. I need that something that helps me zoom out of everything. This analog feeling, it's so much better than fleeing into the depths of the internet. When I smoke, I feel reasserted in myself. I feel like I am reloading. After smoking, I feel way calmer. Connected. In control. My mind feels like it is back the way it should be/the way I need it to be.

And as far as I can see, there's nothing quite like this.

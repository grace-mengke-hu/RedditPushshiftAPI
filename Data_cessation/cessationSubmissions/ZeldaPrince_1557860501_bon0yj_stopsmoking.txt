Day 1. I realized that smoking makes me physically depressed and tired.

It has to be the carbon monoxide levels that causes me to instantly feel down, depressed, tired and unmotivated. I could go all day without smoking and feel great, and then when I give into that urge and smoke, suddenly life seems dull and miserable.

Today I am stopping full force. I have to harness the power deep within me and do this for my health.

The second time of reading Allen Carr

Hey all, 

I'm looking for some advice. 

I've been reading the PDF of Allen Carr's EASYWAY. I've previously read EASYWAY for women without putting on weight (bought on google but all it's done is crash my phone recently everytime I've tried to open it ). 

**BACK STORY STUFF**

When I first read it (which was about 2 years ago) I thought it made a lot of good points but it did nothing to help. 

I carried on smoking for a while and tried to stop again pretty recently and made it about 5 days or something. That is the most I've ever managed. That was using the Stop Smoking app. I even said to friends and family and they were super proud. Then I cracked and smoked and cried. In my mind I blamed everyone making a big deal of it as the issue. Which I know is not why I started again - that was the addiction. 


**BACK TO THE POINT AT HAND**

Anyway I saw someone post the PDF of an old version on here recently (thank you whoever that was) and I saved it for future reference. 

So as I've already said, I started reading it again **yesterday evening** and I've just got to the bit where he says 

 "If you have any doubts, re-read the book first" chapter 40 page 99

Yesterday evening I was smoking and reading it and then thinking "that was my last cigarette" until I got to the bit where he says

"1 Delay your plan to extinguish your last cigarette until you have finished the book." chapter 32 page 86

That wasn't that many pages ago. 

I was thinking "is it a trick question kinda thing" "should I not need that next fag yet?" is etc and so on

Then I thought "I'll just keep smoking til I've finished because that's what he said to do... So I've smoked today... And now I'm doubting myself. 

I'm going to reread the book like he says to and hopefully next time I'll be able to stop when I feel like I'm going to... Does that make sense? 

Did anyone else have that problem at all? How many times am I going to have to read this? Has anyone else got any better suggestions? I have a vape I very rarely use but I feel like Allen is right - why replace one addiction with another (although at least vaping doesn't include the tar and shit) 

I so desperately want to not smoke anymore. I've smoked for nearly about 13 years... And I am only 24 in 2 weeks... It's shameful and I hate that I am scared of dying of old people's diseases at my age :'(

Sorry this is soo long!! 

TL;DR I don't think Allen Carr is helping... Any other ideas welcome!!!

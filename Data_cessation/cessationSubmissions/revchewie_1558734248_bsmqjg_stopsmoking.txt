One of the things I did to keep from going back: I've got one cigarette from the last pack I smoked, sitting on top of the workbench/tool chest in the garage. Just sitting out gathering literal dust since September, getting more and more stale. If I ever want to smoke again, I have to smoke \*that\* cigarette first. If I'm not willing to smoke that stale, dusty, nasty thing then I'm not desperate enough to start smoking again.

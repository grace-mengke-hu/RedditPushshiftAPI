New beginnings

I am writing today to make a new commitment since I smoked again yesterday after having been smoke free for a month (apart from one slip up).

I have reset my starting day to today. Boy did that hurt. I have decided to not drink alcohol for the next month. My association with cigarettes after having a drink is too great and I know I can do this!

I felt so good not smoking and so want that feeling to never go away again.

Wish me luck. Thank you.

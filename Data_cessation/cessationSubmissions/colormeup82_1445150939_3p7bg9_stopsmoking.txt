Going on Day 3

2 Weeks ago my(32) wife (35) had a heart attack. She is back home now after having a stent put in, but it has given me the motivation i need to start making changes. I have always been in better health then my wife, but the last couple years it has started to be the other way around, i have been gaining weight as she has been loosing it.
First big step for me is quitting smoking. I have been 1 pack + since before i was 18.
The first day i tried using one of those blu electronic cigs. The second day i went to a vape shop realizing this thing was not helping at all! Now on my third day and i have a good feeling about this vaping stuff. Has anyone else used it to help them get off cigarettes?

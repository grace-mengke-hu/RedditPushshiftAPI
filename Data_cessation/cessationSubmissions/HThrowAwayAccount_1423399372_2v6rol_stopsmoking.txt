One week

One week - no cigs! Im also one month clean of all mind altering drugs. 32 days without a needle full of smack in my arm.

Im on a vape and tried dropping down to 0% nicotene juice. Its too early in my recovery and I was finding it difficult to live in my aware of thought conscious, as apposed to my self-will. Even mediation could not get me there. Self willing through the day is very dangerous for me so fuck jepordusing my recovery yet. Im back on 6mg juice.

Still no tabacco for a week!

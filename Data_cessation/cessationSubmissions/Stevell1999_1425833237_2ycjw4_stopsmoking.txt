30 days and slipped last night

I woke up this morning absolutely gutted that I decided to smoke at my friends 30th birthday. I'm really annoyed with myself to the point of feeling quite depressed about it as I really thought I had it nailed but drinking clouded my judgement and I'm now worried I will never be truly free!!! I guess I have to reset my quit date now on stop smoking app and lose the 30 days I had racked up so angry right now.

Question for e-cigarette users!

I'm on day 6 of no smoking and it has been relatively easy so far because I'm getting over a cold, which was my motivation to quit in the first place (I kept getting sick all. the. time). However, now that I'm feeling better I'm getting really anxious about it. I think the hardest part I'm struggling with is what happens when I go out and drink with friends? I go out a lot, especially on the weekend, and it's the norm to go to bars and sit out on the patio and smoke all night. It's a fun time, and I don't want it to end just because I don't smoke. SO my question is - has anyone been successful in using an e-cig during these kinds of times? I don't want one to use all the time or to replace cigarettes at all. I just want one for those times when I will inevitably want to cave and smoke (like when drinking with friends).

Sorry for the long post. I'm kinda wordy. Any advice?

Just destroyed my JUUL, time to quit now

I’m a 20 year old guy, I started smoking around three years ago socially. It turned into something else and I started smoking pretty much full time. I got off of the cigarettes pretty easily with a JUUL, but then I became severely addicted to that.

Today is going to be my first day without it. I’m going to try my hardest.

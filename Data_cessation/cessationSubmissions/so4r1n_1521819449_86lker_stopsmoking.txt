(TW?: Craving deams)

So I've been trying to quit for a while. I've been without a cig maybe 2 or 3 weeks now... But.... After being really stressed out and having these craving dreams lately. (Smoking in the dream. Bumming cigs in the dreams. The smell/taste of it still in my dreams but not being around it) I got so stressed due to personal issues I bought a pack last night... It's disgusting me but I can't put myself to throw them away...

Since there's no StopVaping sub...

...I thought I'd come here. Found you guys through /r/StopDrinking. I was a cigarette smoker from ages 16 to 24, before I switched to vaping. I've been vaping now since May 2013, over four years. I really want to stop, but I'm finding it so incredibly hard. I'm sick of spending my money on this habit, and doing God-knows what kind of damage to my respiratory system. Thanks for listening, and hello.

Birthday Boy

Tomorrow is my 23rd birthday. That blows my mind. I feel like I've been stuck in the same dark hole for 5 years and my youth is passing me by, like a diamond sand running through my fucking hands. I'm done with this shit. I smoke around 10 cigarettes a day (much more when I drink), and have done since I was around 17. I am constantly tired, have no concentration or motivation, and am underweight since I'm too lazy to eat well. 

Each time I see my family they tell me how shit I look. The rings under my eyes are fucking purple man.... My relationship is on the rocks since I don't even have the energy for sex. My head is full of dreams and ambitions and I don't do a single thing to make it happen. Basically my life feels like a fucking freak show of failure and unhappiness. 

Since this is a quitting smoking page, I assume most people here are interested in making a positive change in their lives. Even if no one reads this, I need somewhere public to track my progress. 

Here are my laws: 

• Zero cigarettes (nicotine gum if unbearable)
• No masturbation (bad habit from my lonely teens)
• No alcohol
• No coffee 
• No junk food (high sugar/fat)
• High water intake (8 glasses)
• 2500+ calories of clean food
• Daily run (minimum 20 minutes)

Here we go into the valley of death, will update daily with progress/bitching.

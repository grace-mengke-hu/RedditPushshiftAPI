Nicoderm Patch Question

Just wondering if anyone has strayed from the Nicoderm Patch plan? I’m on week 3 of Step One, and 3 more weeks before dropping a step seems like a long time. Thinking about finishing this week and moving onto step 2, but also don’t want to risk throwing myself off. 
Thanks !

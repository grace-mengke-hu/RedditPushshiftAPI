13 days 10 hours nicotine free

Doing good.. just want the urges to stop... they don’t last long but they are happening to often... i quit cold turkey but after being on this site people kept referencing the book by Allen Carr the easy way to stop smoking....
I feel cheated while reading since I’ve already quit &amp; others get to smoke while reading...
My real point is I want the urges to go away when I’m done with the book...
Has anyone else read? Is it as true as it claims on the life post smoking... right now I feel like I’m doing it all on willpower.

Question about nicotine withdrawal

I stopped smoking cold turkey last year and started having severe hypnic jerks every night. I would thrash violently and then wake up with a pounding heart. I don't know how to adequately describe just how severe the jerks were, but they were so intense they scared me. They would be accompanied by a weird discomfort in my eyes, like they were bugging out as far as possible. This would occur two or three times a night. 


I resumed smoking and the hypnic jerks stopped immediately. Then I stopped smoking and began vaping. I wondered if I would experience the hypnic jerks again and I haven't. I'm drawing the conclusion that the jerks were a symptom of nicotine withdrawal, since I'm using e-liquid with nicotine.


For financial reasons, I have to quit vaping. My question is, are there any techniques to ease the physical symptoms of nicotine withdrawal? I smoked socially for almost fifteen years and then a pack (or more) daily for over five years (except for the occasional attempt at quitting.)


If you've had intense physical symptoms during withdrawal, have you found anything that helps?

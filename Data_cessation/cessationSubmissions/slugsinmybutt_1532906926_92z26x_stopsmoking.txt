On and Off

Hello all. I've been a smoker for about three years now. I'm trying very hard to quit smoking. Recently I've had trouble breathing, and I've noticed my cough has picked up. I stopped buying my own cigarettes about 8 months ago, but am still very social with a crowd that doesn't want to give up the habit. They all smoke cigarettes like they breathe air, and when I'm offered, I just politely take the cig and ask for a light. This is becoming an issue. It doesn't matter the brand, whether or not it's menthol, the length of the cigarette... I just can't say no. Because I can't say no, I also can't shake the cravings. I just really need some support from some people that have actually quit and feel better about themselves.

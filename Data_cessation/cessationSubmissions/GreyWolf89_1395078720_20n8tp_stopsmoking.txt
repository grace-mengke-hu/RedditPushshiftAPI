12 hours with out a cigarette

I am 21, my smoking can be anywhere from two packs a week to a pack a day. Started when I was 14, smoked everyday sense. my palms and feet are sweaty right now

I have no plans to quit yet, but I at least want to see how long I can go without it. So then at least I know damn well I CAN quit

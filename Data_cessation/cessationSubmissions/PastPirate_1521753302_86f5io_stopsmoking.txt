Morning cigarette doesnt taste good.

Currently reading Allen Carrs EASYWAY to quit smoking. I am halfway trough. Found it on /r/stopgaming because they recomend it for quiting gaming. I am still smoking at this point but something is happening. And it is weird. Has anyone tried it and really succeeded? My last attempts were done with "Willpower Method" and - obviously - not so successfull.

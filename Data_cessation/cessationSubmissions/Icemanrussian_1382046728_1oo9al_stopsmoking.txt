Question about smoking addiction. Can some people just stop easily?

So, I'm not really a smoker, but ever since college hit, I've been finding myself smoking more than I thought. Usually, I never liked cigarettes for taste or smell, and only for the buzz. When college, started smoking turkish royals, and then started liking others, but never smoked every day. Either way, I just smoked a cig right now, and decided its best to stop now, the buzz is wearing off, and I certainly don't want to start a horrible habit. 

**The Question** My father smoked in the USSR, he started when he was 17, and continued to smoke until the age of 27, when he decided to quit for my mom. Now my father is a honest man, so I don't expect him to say anything opposite of that, but he told when he did quit, he never had any cravings,withdraws, and never had any problems stopping. 

I don't know if he was a daily smoker, I never asked. But if he said he smoked for 10 years, then there must of been some kind of habit. 
*My question is, are there people out there, like my father, who can just quit one day and not turn back, and not suffer any temptations?*

Just had my last smoke

I've been slowly cutting back for a bit over a month and finally today pack was running low and decided why put it off any longer. I don't want to smoke anymore. I waited so long because of the stories people have about withdrawal and the first 3 days but I guess no matter how long you wait those first 3 days will suck and I'm ready for that (I think).

A question to those who recently started or anyone who can remember these 3 days. Any tips or advice on how to make it more manageable?

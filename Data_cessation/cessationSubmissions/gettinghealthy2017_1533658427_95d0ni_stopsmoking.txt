my thoughts on NRT // 2 months smoke free

yup!! it's been 2 months without a cigarette and it was the hardest/best decision i've ever made. i feel like NRT gets a bit of a bad wrap around this forum and i am by no means advocating for people to continue using nicotine or not go a different route that works for them but wanted to share my experience for you guys as well. i was a pack a day smoker for 15+ years. i tried cold turkey, i tried allen carr and to be honest, it didn't do it for me. when i was finally ready, i started with the patch. 3 weeks on step 1, 3 weeks on step 2, 2 weeks on step 3. using the patch helped me get over the mental addiction, the routines i associated with smoking, the behaviors, which to me were harder to break than the physical. so yeah i used the nicotine for an extra 2 months but i used those months to restructure my life, change routines, get used to not smoking. now i've been off the patch 5 days and honestly the physical withdrawal was almost nothing compared to the mental changes i made in the beginning. so like i said, NRT may not be for everyone but it can definitely work if you use it properly.

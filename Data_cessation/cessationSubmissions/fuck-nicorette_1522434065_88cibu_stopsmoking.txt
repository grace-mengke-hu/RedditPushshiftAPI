25 days on patch

Probably a different path than many here.  I'll start by saying I am 52yo...so perhaps there is a sad lesson here...and/or an opportunity to do much better.

&amp;nbsp;

I started smoking at 17 in the Army and kept it up throughout college.  I continued to smoke even after watching my father die of lung cancer.  Yeah, we all know how powerful this addiction is.  I finally quit at 27yo, prompted by my first wife and changing trends in white collar jobs.  Brutal, but I did it.  And I was **blissfully** clean.

Fast forward 8 years (~35yo) and one divorce later and I let a friend who was really down on his luck live with me.  He was a smoker and had no one else to hang out with, so we spent a lot of time together.  Within months I was addicted again.  Fuck.

For the next 6 or 7 years I alternated between smoking and chewing Nicorette gum.  More Nicorette than smoking, but I still smoked a pack every 2 or 3 days.  I hit 40yo and got remarried and the smoking tapered off, but the Nicorette use did not.  I was **hopelessly** addicted...and afraid if I gave it up, I would start smoking again, so I kept chewing.

&amp;nbsp;

**For 12 fucking years.**

&amp;nbsp;

It was an **incredible** monkey on my back, getting to the point that I almost always had to have a piece in my mouth.  30 pieces a day when I stopped a little over 3 weeks ago.  Fuck me.  I knew for years I needed to quit, but couldn't.  Within 30 minutes of not chewing a piece, the cravings hit me hard.

Fast forward to 25 days ago, which is when I did a simple thing that made me finally stop - **I had my teeth whitened.**

After the procedure, the dentist directed me to not eat or drink anything dark since my teeth would be very susceptible to staining for the next 3 or 4 days.  I left the office and of course immediately stuck a piece of Nicorette in my mouth, only to realize that the nicotine in it would stain my teeth.  Shit.

I went to a drug store and bought the 21mg patch and applied it immediately, reapplying one every day for the next two weeks.  It was hard, especially given that this nicotine level was about a third of what I had been accustomed to, but I did not want to apply more than one patch.

When I finished that 2 week course, I switched to the 14mg patch.  I am days away from completing that box and will then shift to the 7mg patch for two weeks.

**But I have been planning to fail.**  

I had a stash of 2mg Nicorette at home that must have been the equivalent of 4 or 5 full boxes.  Today, it went out with the trash.  I decided this is it.  This feels like my last chance.  I will be clean.  I have to get this fucking monkey off my back.  I am so tired of the addiction...and being led around by the nose by it.

Who knows what damage the smoking and many years of chewing that shit have done, but I am done.  My teeth are white and I no longer want to be enslaved by this shit.  Frankly, I am also tired of being embarrassed about the addiction.  For the first time in years I feel good (or at least better) about my health.  I cannot wait to finally tear off that last patch, but I am going to go through the full course first.  In the interim, I know it's a crutch and by many measures I have not quit yet, but I really do feel like I am done.  The only thing that remains is to go cold turkey when I'm down to 7mg a day.

&amp;nbsp;

This addiction sucks, regardless of the mechanism - smoking, lozenges, gum, vaping.  It makes you a slave and robs you of so many other parts of life.  I am so disappointed that I let it rule me so long and know that it is early on my current journey, but for the first time in many years I feel like I am angry enough to succeed again.  NO FUCKING MORE.  It will not enslave me another day.  Well, okay, maybe for a couple of more weeks in patch form.  ;)

What helped me long ago is almost embarrassing to admit - a list.  A list of all the horrible parts of being addicted, which I would look at many times each day when I first quit all those years ago.  Now that list lives on my phone.  You know what's on that list.  We all do.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure if I am typing this to share for encouragement or if it is just what I need to do to be strong today, but it's here for whatever it is worth.

I have no wishes of good luck for you.  Fuck luck.  Fuck the idea of **trying** to quit.  Do it.  Break free.  Be strong.  Believe in a future in which you are no longer enslaved.  **Get fucking angry.**  This shit does nothing for you.  Nothing.  It is poison that puts its claws in you.  Quitting doesn't cause cravings. The shit you are putting into your body everyday does.  Walk away from that beast.

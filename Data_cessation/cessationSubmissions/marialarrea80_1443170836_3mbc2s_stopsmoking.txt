13 days! Never gone that far in 22 years As a smoker!

Yayyyy! Still don't feel super proud just semi proud. Have a cold can't stop coughing and sooo tired. I have my appt with my stop smoking advicer later on and we are going to talk about cigarettes when I normally try to avoid thinking or talking about them! We can do this! 💪🏻💪🏻

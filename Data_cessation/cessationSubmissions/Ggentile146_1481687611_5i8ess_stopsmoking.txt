Help! 21 days in and getting depressed. Any1 else at this time frame?

So I'm 21 days in and im experiencing depression. Has anyone else experienced depression this far into quitting? I know 21 days isn't that long but multiple sites say the mood swings/depression should only last a couple weeks? I don't know but I'm having a hard time. Thanks

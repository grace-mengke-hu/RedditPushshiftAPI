Champix, sleeping, halving pills

I took champix last year and quit for 3 months, the only thing I remember is nausea,  weird dreams, major issues when I took it once on an empty stomach, but other wise fine. I have a history of mental health problems but I had no issues last time, I was actually pretty elated most of the time, and because of my history I have a lot of psych tools and support for those side effects if they do surface. 

I'm trying again this year - bit this time I'm only on day 7, still smoking. But from day 1 I was already very irritable and I feel totally burnt out. I don't have insomnia,  I'm actually sleeping more because I'm so tired, but I get no rest from sleep and have pretty stressful dreams I don't remember. It's messing up my life pretty bad.

Tomorrow my dose doubles and I'm pretty worried about it because the side effects are so bad but the actual effects haven't kicked in yet. Here is my plan so far, looking for advice (that is not stop taking it, I want to give it at least another week and some effort before giving up - it's the only thing that's ever helped me quit and I want to quit!)

- taking the second pill at 5pm instead of closer to 10pm like I have. (but even when I was just doing the morning pill my sleep was fucked, although I did tend to take that pill quite late. I am a shift worker and a bad pill taker.)

- taking that second pill as a half dose. what's the best way to split such a tiny pill? 

- skipping the second dose completely.

- suppliments I have access to: melatonin,  magnesium citrate, weed. I live in Toronto so I could potentially go to a dispensary and ask for very specific, targeted strains of weed. However, while weed can be good for straight up insomnia it might be bad for sleep health and can disrupt deep sleep patterns, which is what Champix is already messing up for me. The people at the dispensary might be able to give advise on that.

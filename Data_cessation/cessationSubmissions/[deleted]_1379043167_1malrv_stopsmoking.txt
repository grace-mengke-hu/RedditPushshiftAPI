The first 24 hours.

I've been a smoker for 11 years. I'm currently 24 hours tobacco free! Got myself a vaporizer in place of cigarettes, and so far it's worked out really well. For the first week I had it, I was smoking 3-4 a day instead of my usual 10+ a day. Today I decided I was going to fight the cravings for a real cigarette and I've been successful so far. I've had to fight off the cravings a few times today, but I powered through.  I consider this a huge success considering I haven't gone a day without a cigarette since I turned 18. Having the vaporizer has helped immensely. I've tried and tried to quit for about a year now.

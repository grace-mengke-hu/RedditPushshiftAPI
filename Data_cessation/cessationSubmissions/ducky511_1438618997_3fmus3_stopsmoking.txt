WOO HOO! (MADE IT TO 100)

Title says it all. Never thought I could do a 100 days with out a puff. But I made it! Still get the occasional urge for a drag. But I've build a nice mental shame wall that I would have to tear down and start over if I did. I'm so proud of my number!

We can all make it! I really thought for a while I could get this far. I was wrong!

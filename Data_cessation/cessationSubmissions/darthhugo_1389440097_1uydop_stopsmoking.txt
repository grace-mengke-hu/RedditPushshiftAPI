Help with Nasal Congestion

Hi guys, I've quit 5 days ago now. Things have been going more smoothly than I imagined. I have been keeping myself motivated, and have laid down a pretty solid argument in my head for never getting any cigarettes even when I do occasionally get cravings--which have been dramatically decreasing in both frequency and potency. 

The only real side effects I've felt are a tendency to snack, which I've been able to deal with by buying a bunch of fruit, and some nasal congestion. No biggie right? Well, here's the kicker, I have a date tonight with a girl I'm seriously interested in. It will be our second date, and I don't want nasal congestion to ruin it. While I'm not sick, the biggest problem is that I can't breathe through my nose a lot right now, and a lot of kissing is expected as per first date. What's the best way to get rid of light to medium congestion fast?

Thank you guys so much for the support. This is one of the coolest online communities I've ever come across.

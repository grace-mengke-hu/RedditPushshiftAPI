1 year since I quit, need help with one weakness.

I write a lot, and when my creative juices get going is when I get a huge craving. I usually while writing and getting my creativity flowing, would smoke a cigarette while pacing back and forth. Of course I can't do that now that I've quit, and my normal means of calming cravings don't seem to do much. I usually grab a drink/snack, but it doesn't help because the craving is continuous until I'm done writing.

Any recommendations?

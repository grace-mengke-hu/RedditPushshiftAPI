It's great when people notice!

I haven't made any secret of the fact that I've quit, but I don't announce it. People at work have noticed that I don't go out for one any more, obviously. The other day I was chatting to someone who I haven't seen for a few months and mid sentence he stopped himself and said "You've given up smoking, haven't you?". Apparently he just noticed that I looked so much healthier and smelled so much better! I was rather chuffed!

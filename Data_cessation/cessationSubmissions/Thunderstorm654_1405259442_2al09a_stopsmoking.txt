How my grandfather quit smoking

Hey, so I'm not a smoker but I was talking to my Gradfather about how he quite smoking and I thought maybe you guys could use it as inspiration. 

I knew that he had a heart attack when he was in his thirties so I asked him about it. He said the doctor called and told him the tests showed he had had a heart attack. The doctor told him the thing that will help him recover the most is quitting smoking. He was actually smoking a cigarette when the doctor called. As soon as the doctor said that, he butted the cigarette and that was the last one he had ever smoked.

I asked him "was it really that easy to quit?" He said it wasn't. He said it was actually one of the hardest things he had ever done in his life. He said he just took it one day at a time. I had to ask how he did that. He said at the beginning of every day he just said "I didn't smoke yesterday, and I'm not going to smoke today." He said if he thought about the future he wouldn't have been able to do it. He was only focusing on the present day. And before he knew it he didn't have to tell himself that every day, he had kicked his habit. I think that's sound advice that we can all learn from.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that he used to keep his cigarettes in his shirt pocket and when he quit he replaced the cigarettes with a pack of double mint gum. And just the act of taking out the pack of gum, taking out the stick of gum, unwrapping it from the tinfoil and putting it in his mouth curbed his cravings quite a bit.

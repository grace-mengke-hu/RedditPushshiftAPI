Have been 26 days without a smoke, but had truly shitty night and smoked one. Please PLEASE help.

What have I done? 

I obviously don't want to continue smoking, but the urge is extremely strong and my night has resulted in the breakdown of more than one friendship and the potential for having to evict a roommate, and keep the other from self-harming. HELP! PLEASE HELP! I want to smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke... but I don't want to go back on everything I've already accomplished. Smoked for 14 years, and am risking the hard work of quitting.

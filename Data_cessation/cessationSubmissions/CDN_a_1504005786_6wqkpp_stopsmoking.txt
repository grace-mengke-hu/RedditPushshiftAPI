Failing &amp; Need to Stop

I've failed miserably again. I really really need to stop smoking. 48 years. I'm choking and it's disgusting. Plus I'm now retired and it would mean so much in my life to have that extra couple of hundred dollars a month! I'm under extraordinary stress doing renovations and squabbling with various contractors trying to complete my project., or am I just making excuses and then there will be the next thing...blah... blah... Any help appreciated. Thanks.

Stopping smoking has changed my life, here is why

So I have been smoking since the age of 13, 6 years of smoking in total, do the Math if you want to know my age, I started off socially smoking with my brother and my friends, like 2 cigarettes a week, I wouldn't really smoke much of it, and then I'd pass it on to my friends.

Then a few years go by and I was smoking a lot more like 8 - 10 a day in school, we used to go out at lunch time and all sit together and smoke and eat our lunch, It was really fun time infact, I get quite nostalgic when I think about it, smoking has always been apart of my life, and imaging myself without it was hard, I'd never thought that I could have stopped, but I continue smoking for a few years until I graduate school and move on to college, I turned 16 and the legal age to smoke in the UK is 16 and 18 to purchase a pack.

So my mom knew that she couldn't stop me smoking, so she would buy me the odd pouch of tobacco to make roll ups because they where cheaper to buy, eventually I found that I could purchase 50grams of tabacco for Â£6 (google the currency conversions) which is super cheap, but there's a catch right, like anything that is cheaper than it's supposed to be, this thing tastes really chemically, and it was fake, imported tabacco, meaning it isn't regulated at all and is probably pumped with a lot more chemicals, which I'd imagine would be really harmful, and it really was.

I noticed my mental health was starting to decrease over time, I'd always be down in the dumps and I wouldn't smile, or laugh, everytime I smoked this product it made me feel so sick, and I'd feel depressed, I'd have a my odd moments of happiness, after two years of this I have finally decided to quit, enough is enough, there is nothing in it for me.

I have been using an E-CIG which is pretty safe to help me quit, it's been 5 days so far, and I can smell now, I haven't been able to smell the air outside for years this good, it's amazing, I can taste food so much better, and I am super happy everyday, I wake up with a smile on my face, and I'm always laughing and enjoying everything, it's beautiful, I am so much more confident in myself, I honestly can't express how happy I am right now, I am smiling writing this, my life has changed for ever, and I am so thankful, seriously guys do not smoke imported tabacco it is so bad for you 

Thank you guys and sorry for it being so long

Quitting gave me the confidence to jump half naked into a public pool belly and all!!!!!!!!

Today for the first time in over ten years I had the confidence to go and swim on my own in a public pool. As a kid I always loved swimming. But as the years went on and the weight piled on I became self-conscious and basically gave up swimming. Today I went swimming in a crowded swimming pool with my tight swimming trunks and belly sticking out and enjoyed every minute of it. There is no doubt in my mind that the confidence to go back to something I loved so much as a kid has everything to do with giving up smoking. THANK YOU !!!!!!!

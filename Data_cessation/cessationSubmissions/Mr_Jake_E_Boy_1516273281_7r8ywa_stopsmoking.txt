Does smoking help concentration or not?

I have been browsing various forums and websites for hours but can't seem to find any definitive answers. I have ADHD and have found since I have stopped smoking my brain just turned off. Is there a definite answer behind whether smoking aids concentration or impedes it? Sources please.

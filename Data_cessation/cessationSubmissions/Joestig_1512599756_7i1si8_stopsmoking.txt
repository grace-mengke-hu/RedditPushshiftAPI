My quitter's flu is almost over! :)

I've been having this cold for a few weeks now, starting the day after I quit. It was pretty bad at first, but it's slowly healing. It's a good process, because it's a sign that my lungs are cleaning themselves. I can almost breathe freely again.

What are your experiences with the smoker's flu? How long did it take to heal, or are you still coughing?

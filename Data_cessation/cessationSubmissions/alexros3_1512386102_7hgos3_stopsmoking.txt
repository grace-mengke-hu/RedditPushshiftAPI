I didn’t take advantage of my last cigarette and now I want another

Hi all, 

I’ve been wanting to quit for a while but decided to have my last cigarette last night on a bit of a whim. The problem is, now my cravings are so bad and I keep telling myself to have a proper last cigarette so I won’t miss it so much. 

Has anyone else had this problem? As I’ve decided to quit on a whim I’m worried I’m not going to be strong enough to stick to it. 

**EDIT**

Thanks for the replies everyone! I decided to have a nap to take the edge of the cravings and thankfully haven’t had a cigarette all day! I definitely appreciate all of your advice and support :)

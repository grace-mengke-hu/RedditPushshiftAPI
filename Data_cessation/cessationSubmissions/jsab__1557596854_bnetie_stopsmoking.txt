Little complaint :(

I am trying hard to quit vaping.
I am vaping very very little since one week.. struggling, but bit less every day.
Main reason is I developed a leukoplakia and dr told me to stop vaping.

I use to chew lecorice roots.
I developed pain in my tongue.
I tried the cinnamon sticks .. it burns my lips
I tried chupa chups hard candies.. bother the mouth and too much sugar.
Back on the lecorice root and again pain in the tongue (same side of leuko so getting me worried).

Why nothing can help?
:(
And the stress and fear making it more difficult and almost saying whatever then I keep vaping.
:(

I will consider to go back to the Dr to get it checked again, but I just went 10 days ago.

A bit depressed.
I know it's still reasonable to stop but it's hard to keep motivated :(

I should start desmoxan tomorrow and I hope it will help me to stop completely.. and maybe reduce the random chewing of stuff!

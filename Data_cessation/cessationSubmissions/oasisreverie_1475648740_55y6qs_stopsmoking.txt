I don't want to do this anymore.

I'm depressed. I want to live but sometimes the thought of dying from smoking doesn't even scare me when I'm feeling down. 

What I hate the most about cigarettes is the addiction. I want to go for runs without getting tired. I want to workout again. 

Most importantly, I'm poor. I'm 22 and live with my parents. I go to school full time and barely just got a part I time job and received a car as a gift from my family. 

I can't even afford my car insurance this month because I pissed so much money away on smoking. 

There was a point in my life where I had 3,000 dollars saved up. All the money was from my financial aid and grants. Now, I have a little under 400 dollars saved up. 

I'm not so concerned about my health yet. But I want my life to be improved so I can care about living moreso. 

I want to afford nice things and be fit and attractive. 

Please offer me guidance and advice. I love you all even if I don't know you. You're all very strong and amazing. 

I always hated the tobacco industry and never justify my smoking to people other than giving the excuse that I am depressed and addicted.

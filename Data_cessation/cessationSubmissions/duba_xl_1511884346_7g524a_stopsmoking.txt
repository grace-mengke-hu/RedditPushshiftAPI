My experience so far.

So, right now I am at 8 days and 20 hours and my experience so far is amazing actually.
In these days I had around 20 cravings which I went over very easily tbh with drinking water and grabbing a snack or fruit. I feel more energetic and I more relaxed when I know I don't smell like smoke bad breath is minimal only in the morning until I brush my teeth and that's it. I also had hearth problems which are minimal aswell since I stopped smoking.

TL:DR : I feel great, don't intend going back to smoking.

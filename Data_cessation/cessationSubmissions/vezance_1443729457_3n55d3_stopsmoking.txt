Getting drunk a lot faster. Is this normal?

So it has been almost two weeks since I stopped (Technically, this is the first week since I smoked a couple on the weekend while drinking. But let's not get into technicalities.) Tonight is the first time I have committed to drinking without cigarettes. I have isolated myself in my home and ensured I have no access to cigarettes even if I wanted a smoke. But with just about three drinks in, I am feeling absolutely hammered (yes, I am typing this drunk). I can usually go about 6-7 drinks before I feel this drunk. Does not smoking make people drunk faster? Or is this probably because of some other reason and my brain just wants an excuse to blame it on the lack of nicotine?

Edit: While waiting for answers from experienced members, I typed in a similar query on Google - "drinking after smoking". The [top result](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2373458/Drinking-smoking-hand-hand-recent-research-suggests-Nicotine-dampens-feel-good-chemicals-brain-making-crave-alcohol.html) blew my mind. Thought I'd post it here for those interested. TL;DR - nicotine makes you want to drink more alcohol to feel the same amount of enjoyment as a non-smoker. 

Edit 2: I was browsing more articles, and one of them just made me realize that I was feeling a lot more thirsty these days. I didn't really realize how much more water I have been drinking this week. Is this also something that is a result of my quitting cigarettes?

Hard as hell to quit when you constantly smell the neighbor below you smoking

But doing all I can to keep a level head about it & resist the urges. Sadly not much you can do about a neighbor's smoke smell in an old house downtown. Quit for a year and a half, had just a handful during a summer then was full blown back to a pack a day. Ready to do this again, this subreddit helped me tremendously last time. Good luck to everyone else going through it too!

In my dreams!

Hi beautiful people of /r/stopsmoking.

A very long time ago I decided I should quit smoking. I tried several times but never really convinced myself I would indeed never smoke another cigarette again. This kept me relapsing all the time. 

This time was different. Every moment I thought about smoking in the past three weeks, I just told myself I would never do it again. It felt very weird in the first few days but now it feels normal. I easily managed to not smoke while at parties with only smokers around me. My girlfriend smokes, although she tries to avoid it when I'm around. Drunk people have been blowing smoke into my face (I think because they were jealous). I haven't had a single puff and I won't ever again.

It has been a rough ride in the past few weeks but it was sooo much easier than I expected it to be. I even managed to convince some die-hard smoker-friends to *think* about quitting. I feel like a religious fanatic from time to time, trying to convert people to my new found philosophy. 

Last night I had a weird experience. I have been dreaming about smoking (in the weirdest circumstances), but in my dream last night I bought a pack, realised I don't need them anymore, and just threw them away. I think my mind has come to peace.

If you have just a single doubt about quitting, please contact this sub. I have been reading the stories from time to time, especially in the first few days. You guys are amazing! I'm going out to spend some of the â‚¬ 120,- I earned by not buying packs.

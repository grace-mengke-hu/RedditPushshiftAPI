Two weeks of vaping(No cigs)!

I'm not sure how people in this community view this but today marks two weeks without cigarettes for me. Before these two weeks I had been smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day for just over four years. I have been vaping 3mg nicotine since quitting and plan to lower to 2mg or 1mg after I run out of my current ejuice. Is this a good plan?

I quit for the wrong reason...Now what?

I quit because I was in love with this girl...and she told me she didn't like cigarette smoke. So I quit because i wanted to become a better me, and also because I wanted to date her. Anyway, I never ended up dating her and now she is completly out of my life. Now I feel like smoking again...but I realize that if I start now...I may never quit again. Right now I hold the power, and my cravings are gone...but I am starting to get the urge because nothing else matters anymore, what is the point of quitting now? At least when I smoked I got pleasure from that...But I feel good as a non-smoker now, I smell good, I look better and I feel better...But I crave a cigarette so much. I don't know what to do.

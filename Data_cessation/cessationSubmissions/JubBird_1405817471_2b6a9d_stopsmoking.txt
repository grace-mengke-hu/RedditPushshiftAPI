I forgot how long I quit for. Came back here to see.

If I can do it, you can too.  20 years, 1 pack a day.  I haven't touched one in almost 2 years. Life is so much better.  I remember:  

- waking up coughing so hard.
- needing a cig before anything.
- being scared of going out to dinner, because I knew I'd have to catch a smoke break in the middle.

That need dictated so many of my decisions in life.  

Life is free now. :)

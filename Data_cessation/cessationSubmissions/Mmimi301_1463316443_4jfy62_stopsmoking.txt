I keep forgetting I stopped smoking

I'll automatically reach around for the ash tray or my cigarettes and then I remember, oh, I quit smoking!

What works for me is someone pointed out the cravings usually last only 15 min.

I'm loving not spending the $$$ (almost $300+/month, hangs head in shame).

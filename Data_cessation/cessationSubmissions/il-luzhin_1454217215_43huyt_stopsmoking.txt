Fuck you, busted TV!

Ach! I'd say it's the week from hell but that doesn't quite cut it.  i wonder what a replacement TV is going to cost me...  Half of what I've saved by not smoking? 

Ugggh!  It's one of those days where this moment does not seem even close to better than smoking.  Whatever.  May tomorrow bring good luck and no smokes please!

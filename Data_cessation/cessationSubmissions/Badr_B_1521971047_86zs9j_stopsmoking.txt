3 weeks ! Very hard week-end, went back home

I don't know why, but I feeling so empty this week-end, I can't even smile. YEsterday I sat with my friends ( childhood friends) and they smoked weed, I refused. I went back home very quickly. There I realised that I am losing most of my friends. It's very hard, I don't see my best friend that much anymore. It's hard, but I am motivated to change and stop all drugs and focus on my studies. I just need to know that I am doing the right thing by staying alone for a while...

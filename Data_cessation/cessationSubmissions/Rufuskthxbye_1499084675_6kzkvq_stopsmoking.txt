Resetting. Life is a slippery slope.

Hey everyone!  I'm resetting my badge after being a non-smoker for 4+ years. Started smoking at parties a few times this past months. Bought my own pack of tobacco (rolling myself) because i wanted to this week. Something about nostalgia and wanting to have those "serene" moments of just smoking a cigarett while having coffee again. Quitting again tomorrow! Done it once before can definitely do it again! Stay tobaccoo free people!  

Hope you have an amazing smoke free summer. Cheers!

I'm 3 days in but I have questions

I'm 3 days in using the patch. Unfortunately I have overactive sweat glands and the patches aren't stay on. I've used medical tape, bandaids, right bow I have stocking on trying to keep it on my arm. I'm not sure I can put up with the patches constantly falling off. I'm also vaping to help with the smoking sensation. Right now I'm not vaping with any nicotine, but I'm considering trying it if these patches keep on falling off. I smoked a pack of Newport shorts a day. My question is for those that are using vaping to quit. Which nicotine level should I start with? I plan on weaning myself off nicotine completely. Just not sure where to start? I started vaping my quit day so it's all new to me.

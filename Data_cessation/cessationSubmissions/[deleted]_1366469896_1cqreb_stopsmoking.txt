Being in the hospital a few years back...

I remember a day when I was stuck in the hospital for a day and couldn't smoke. I was given a patch. I distinctly remember that I hardly even thought about smoking, basically I'm trying to figure out what that meant, how to get that back now so I can quit for good. Almost like a change in surroundings and the feeling of literally not being allowed to smoke was what kept me from thinking about it. And also keeping busy. When I'm working, I don't think about smoking much either until I get to break/lunch.

Any advice on how I can channel this keeping busy thing into my everyday life? I tend to spend a lot of time alone, in my house. And I'm bored a lot. I have some hobbies such as playing guitar, crochet, writing, drawing, I'm pretty creative. I just need to make a plan to avoid boredom, cause that's when I smoke the most. 

The biggest barrier I see is my trouble with self-discipline and self-control. I can be pretty terrible at following through with things I start. I also have anxiety pretty bad, and getting stressed and panicky makes me want to smoke. 

Anyone have advice on how I can get past these barriers?

Resource

1-800-QUITNOW seems to be a decent resource. It's a national hotline and they transfer you to your state's hotline. Some states give free patches or gum. 

Georgia is one of those states. I got 28 free patches in the mail today. You pick the strength. You also get a nifty workbook (wish they had sent a coloring book and crayons, actually) and access to a free counselor. Of course, I don't know how many of them quit smoking so you get stuff like, "Well I see bubble baths are on your list of alternate activities. You could go take a bath." Ummm. But I'm at work. 

It's a little hit and miss, but FREE STUFF. Who doesn't love free stuff?

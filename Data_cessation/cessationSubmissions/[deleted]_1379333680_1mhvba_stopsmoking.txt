50 days - Feels like a second

It is really awesome what I have learned in the past 4 months about discipline and addiction.
Today is my 50th day without a smoke. All my friends who knew how I have been struggeling with quitting seem to be very proud. This is my 20th - or so attempt to quit.


The result of everything looks so easy. I mean, I see my badge, 50 days, said in a second. But I have been in so many situations where I have been offered a cigarette. I had unbearable moments of cravings. I felt like shit sometimes and had huge problems which I could use to justify smoking again. But I simply didn´t. I also tried to write down some advice to many people in this subreddit. This also helped me to sort my mind and put my rules to paper.


I changed my whole life. I go to the gym, I sleep better then ever since I am not on nicotine. It is ridicolous to wake up automatically with the sun every day. I wake up, feel rested and don´t crave for any substance except water and healthy food to give myself the energy to achieve my goals.

Just finished my first 24 hours not smoking after smoking a pack a day for 10 years. Kinda freaking out.

This is the first time I've ever really tried to quit. I'd made a few deals with people that I didn't really care about and always bought the person a drink and got on with my life later that day. 

Jesus, how hard is tomorrow going to be? It took a lot of willpower to keep my mind off smoking at work. I'm a bartender and I'm just around it constantly. I have tomorrow off (day 2) then work Friday night to close (day 3) which should be the big challenge. 

Wish me luck! I'm doing it for good reasons and I'm very motivated. Going cold turkey. 

EDIT: You guys are the best. Incredibly positive and supportive. Thanks!

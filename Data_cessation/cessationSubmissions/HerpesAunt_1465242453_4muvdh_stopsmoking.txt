So it's been 7 weeks and I have starting to have crazy cravings.

I think it could be caused by one of two things. The first is that I started a pretty strick diet a couple days ago. By the third day of the diet I have had insane cravings almost non stop for the past 72 hours. The other issue that I find myself struggling with (and this is very silly) when I quit I did it by "swearing to god". In a wierd sort of double think way I don't believe in swearing to God that is, I do not believe if there is a God he gives a damn about whether I smoke or not. However it applies this strange weight on my shoulder where I feel like I'm quitting by forcing myself into this strange corner rather than through my sheer will power. Anyways, I know this is probably a very strange post to react to, but any response would be greatly appreciated.

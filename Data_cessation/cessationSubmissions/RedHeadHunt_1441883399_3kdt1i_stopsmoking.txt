This vacation is the worst.

I am on vacation in Boston. The vacation is awesome but it is my first since I quite. All I have wanted is to have a cigar or really nice cigarette on the walk home each night. The desire is overwhelming. 

My wife has talked to me and said if I can make it an only on this vacation thing then I can do it but I don't know if I can. 

Last night I even told my wife i would gamble it and if they had Nat Sherman's in the liquor store we walked by I would smoke. There were none. I still have not smoked but I am at 100+ days and still going strong. I was hoping that it would be easier than this at this point.

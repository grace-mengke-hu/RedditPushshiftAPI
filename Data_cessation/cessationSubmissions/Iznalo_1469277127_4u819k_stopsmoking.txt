75 days smoke free.... 1500 cigs I didn't smoke

Just looked at my app and realized I am not only 75 days smoke free but have also avoided over 1500 cigs! That's crazy! 

I was a pack a day smoker despite being in denial that I was actually smoking that much because I was a closet smoker for the most part and never actually considered myself a "smoker". Thankful for my husbands insistence and his reminders that I was indeed a smoker which  helped me finally flip the switch after many failed attempts. Most importantly, I was tired of making excuses to my little ones about why Mom needed to go outside to "check on something".

Life is so much better on the other side! It was hard at first but got easier around week 3 for me. Each week has gotten progressively easier and I rarely think about smoking now. I do still have an occasional strong urge to smoke, primarily when drinking, but I can talk myself out of pursuing the urge.

For those starting out.... Stick to it! It does get easier even if it doesn't seem like it will today. One foot in front of the other and just make it through today, and then tomorrow. You will be immensely glad you stuck to it and so proud of yourself for beating this! Good luck to all! Thanks to all the posters here as that has been really helpful to me!

Looking forward to day 100, then 200 and so on!

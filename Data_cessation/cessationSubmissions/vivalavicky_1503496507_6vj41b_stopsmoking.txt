So hasn't quit

I've relapsed once before but I'm finally back on track and I'm doing really well (with the help of Chantix)

My SO is still smoking and it's making it really hard for me. I'm trying to be patient (he's on Chantix too and I'm hoping he'll quit). I'm also trying to be sensitive because anytime I bring it up he feels like I'm nagging him.

I've told him I want to quit and that it makes him snore so much more. I've had to sleep in a different room the past couple of nights it's been so bad.

Any creative tips for dealing with this?

Woke up on Day 5 feeling like I smoked a pack last night...

This is my 3 serious attempt in the past 2 months. I just am coming off a 3 week gluttonfest of rippin cigs, eating bad, and zero exercise. Im over halfway through Alan Carrs book, and I think the last 3 weeks was a subconscious "last hooray". I have been smoking for 15 years and never been so resolved to quit as I have been since joining this group a few months ago. I started reading Alan Carrs book about 3 weeks ago and since it empahsized it wasnt required that I quit smoking before finishing the book I took that as my queue to let 'er rip. For the past 2 weeks I have been more mindful of how smoking makes me feel and the psychology behind it, and I got so sick that I decided to quit smoking 5 days ago even though Im not finished with the book. Anyways that said I woke up this morning feeling like I smoked a pack last night. I have smoked chronic fairly regularly for most of my life and last night took 2 rips off my one hitter. Does bud make your mouth feel THAT bad usually or is it normal to wake up with muck mouth 5 days in?

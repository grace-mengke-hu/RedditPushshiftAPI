1 yr...thank you

1 year as of May 1...I lurked on here all year and decided to finally join so I could maybe if even for a second, provide to others what you have to me. I came to this sub when I wanted to smoke and read your stories, and commiserated, and cried. But I didn't smoke. Knowing everyone here existed made a difference. Thank you guys. 

To all those at the beginning or that are struggling- you got this. You do. Take a breath and reassess in an hour. A day. A year. You got this!!

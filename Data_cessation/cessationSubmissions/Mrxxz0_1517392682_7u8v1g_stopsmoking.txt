1 Month - Honestly it was alot easier than I thought

I started around the dumb teenage years because I thought it was cool and then developed a bad habit of it for around 10years to come.

Quitting the ciggarettes was honestly ALOT easier than I thought. At least for me. Did anyone have similar experience?

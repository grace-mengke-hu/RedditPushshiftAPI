Wife told me that I need a cigarette...

Hi I got back from outpatient day treatment and I picked up my kids. It looks like my blood pressure is extremely high even after not having nicotine for 40 hours now. I went home and cried in the shower very hard, which is unusual I guess, I left shower and my wife who works night shift and has been having trouble sleepin today yelled at me to go smoke a cigarette

But I know that won't help...idk.. 

I feel hopeless...

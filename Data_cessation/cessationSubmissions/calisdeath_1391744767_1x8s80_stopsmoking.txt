going into the second month...

i'm new, so i don't have a badge yet.  i'm headed into my second month (started jan 2), and i'm having trouble attacking my cravings now.  it's like a tired ennui rather than anger or frustration.  and it's almost worse sometimes, because it's a less definable enemy than it was for the first few weeks.  anyone else experience this and know what the f that is?

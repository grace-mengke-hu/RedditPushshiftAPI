Resetting badge, starting over

I just came back from smoking the last cigarette in that pack.  I'm currently at work and break is too short to make it to the convenience store for a pack so I know that I'll make it at least 5 hrs.  I started Chantix yesterday (no preaching please, it was successful to get me started on my best quit to date, that quit lasted 4 months after stopping chantix, and I know I'm not one that suffers from side effects from it) and am feeling confident!!

Thanks in advance for all of the support I know I'll get!  This sub is awesome and was critical in my previous success!

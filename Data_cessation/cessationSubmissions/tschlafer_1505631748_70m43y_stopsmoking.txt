I'm free

Hey, this is my third time posting. This is my first quit attempt ever (after 11 years of smoking 15 cigarettes daily).
I've made it to 287 days (roughly 9 months and a week), and I feel amazing. The hard part was only the first week or so. I never threw out my lighter or stopped going out on the porch or balcony with smokers, conversing with them while they smoke outside. If you want to quit - you have to understand that it's just an addiction. It doesn't make you feel more relaxed. By smoking you are relaxing the stress that came from withdrawal, not some extra stress. A nonsmoker just doesn't have that stress to relax in the first place.
Good luck to you all! This sub helped me quit.

Gave it up for Lent - Can't remember other folks passive smoke ever smelling so good :( !

Hiya r/stopsmoking. I'm five days in and passive smoke smells really good at the moment. Is this normal?

I need a bit of positive encouragement. Does anyone have one of those charts that tells you, day by day, how your body is recovering?  I could do with reading it.

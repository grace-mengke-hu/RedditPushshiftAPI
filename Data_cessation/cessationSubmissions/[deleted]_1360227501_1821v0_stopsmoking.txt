Starting today, I will cut back. Starting a week from today, I will be a non-smoker.

I've only been smoking for four years, but my god do I have ridiculously low self-control. Ever since I took my first drag of a cigarette I have not gone en entire 24 hours without smoking tobacco.

But I can do it.

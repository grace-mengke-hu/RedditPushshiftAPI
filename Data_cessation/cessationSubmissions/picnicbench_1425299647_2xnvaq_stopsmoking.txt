I rewarded myself

As it was 7 whole days since I gave up, I decided to treat myself to a late night run. 

That shit was humbling. I've never been a particularly great runner but the expectation in my head was that I'd get straight back into it after two years of smoking and eating poorly. It took me an extra 2-3 mins per mile.

It felt incredible and I'll be getting back into it properly.

I encourage anyone who can to do it, it's a great stress reliever, helps counter the respiration and circulatory issues and is pretty much free.

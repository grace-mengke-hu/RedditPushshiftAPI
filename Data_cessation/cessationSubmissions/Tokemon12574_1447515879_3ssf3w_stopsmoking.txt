Felt "The Pity" tonight, with absolutely zero sympathy. I thought, "you have fun with that."

So, I work in events, in Sydney, Australia. Australia has some pretty brutal smoking laws, and I work at a high-profile venue space where *the rules are the rules*. We can't afford any negative press, essentially, and we err on the side of caution when it comes to maintaining our standards. 

It's been pouring rain non-stop for about two weeks here and, being Christmas time, we're booked back-to-back with functions. The only smoking area we can offer is fully exposed to the elements. (It's a wonderful view over the Harbor Bridge and Opera House when it's not pissibg down rain,  by the way.) There are umbrellas, sure - but they don't help when the rain's coming down fucking sideways. 

So tonight I had an argument with someone about where they can and cannot smoke. Outside the venue is an awning, way more protected than the deck. Thing is,  smoking isn't allowed out there - in fact,  it's illegal. 

"But we can't smoke out there, it's raining, be reasonable," I've heard, over and over again. The same argument,  delivered in different ways, on multiple nights, non-stop, for the last two weeks. 

Tonight I'd had enough. This one bloke just wouldn't leave me alone. Pissed up and righteous, he felt like he was being discriminated against, and told me so. I felt pity. I know what that feels like. I felt pity - but no sympathy. 

You don't want to stand outside in the driving rain, huddled under an inadequate attempt at shelter, sucking down fumes, drinking your expensive wine and enjoying *none of it* because all you want to do is be back inside in the warmth? 

*Then don't fucking smoke.*

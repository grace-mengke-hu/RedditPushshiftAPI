Day 6! Not what I expected...

It's difficult. I mean the physical withdrawal is finally subsiding, but the mental withdrawal is hitting harder than ever. Since I've made it this far I keep on almost caving.

"Well since I'm not physically addicted, I may as well give in just a bit."

Keep having thoughts like that. It's dangerous how it changes your train of thought, lol. I'm literally gonna have to rewire my brain. It's just gonna take some time. Or a lot of time. I'm not caving.

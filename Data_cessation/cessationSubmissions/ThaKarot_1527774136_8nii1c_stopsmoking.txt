I want to stop smoking so bad

First off I’m 22 years old, I’ve smoked since about 15. The only time I’ve been able to stop smoking is when I was in prison twice. After my last stint of six months, I didn’t have the urge, it was more out of habit that I asked the escort driving me back to get me a pack with my money I got from prison since they had my age and stuff. Ever since then which was a year ago, I’ve been smoking and haven’t been able to quit.   I’m a student at job corps and I told myself as my New Years resolution I would quit, and that didn’t happen. I hate it. I’m almost out of here and I want to be DONE with the orange booty cancer sucks for good so I can focus on my career in rap without bad breathing issues and whatnot plus no stink. I’ve tried nicotine patches and they don’t help. Please Reddit, I’m like begging for your help.

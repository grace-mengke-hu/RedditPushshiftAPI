38 yr smoker, started Chantix 3 days ago

Still in the smoking phase and used chantix in the past and quit for 7 mths. This will be hard as I commute four hours a day and husband still smokes (going for script himself next week). This is like losing a friend of 38 years. Too many med problems not to.

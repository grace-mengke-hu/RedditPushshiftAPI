Just need some advice

Hey everyone I’m having such a hard time getting my brain to not think that  “all I need is a good buzz right now” I smoked for 3 years and vaped for 2 pretty heavily. I haven’t taken in any nicotine in the last 4-5 days (other than two patches I’ve had on for half an hour each).  Is there anything that’s helped anyone here that could help me?? This place seems like an amazing resource now that I’ve found it

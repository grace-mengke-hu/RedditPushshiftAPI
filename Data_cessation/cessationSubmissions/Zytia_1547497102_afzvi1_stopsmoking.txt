Trying to stop vaping is so difficult !

Completely smoke/toke free for 12 hours!! I feel like I deserve a medal! I think I’m actually going to quit smoking for the first time since I was 14. Only problem is because I vape people aren’t as supportive to my cravings as a cigarette smoker.. I think it’s harder ! Quitting e cig doesn’t make you smell better, it doesn’t have any proven health benefits, it doesn’t even save that much money so why do it?? The answer is to quit my reliability on that small electronic device I have had in my hand constantly for the past 2 years. I can do this!

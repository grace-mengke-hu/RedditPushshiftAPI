just quit.

stop. whenever your body "wants nicotine", tell it to shut the fuck up. it's that simple.

so many of you act like smoking is this thing you can't control. e.g., "stopped for two months, started smoking again. any tips?" honestly, what the fuck? what kind of tips do you want someone to give you? is googling smoker's lungs not enough? just stop smoking, holy shit. are you guys possessed by some fucking tobacco demon that forces you to put those filthy ass cancer sticks in your mouth? you're not. it's ALL in YOUR HANDS. you KNOW it's horrible for your health and you DO want to change, as is evident from your participation in this sub. you're gonna let another craving take that away from you? are you that weak?

NO, you're NOT!!! all of you are strong human beings responsible for your actions, so STOP! grab your pack of cigarettes, and SLAM that foul SHIT into the fucking GARBAGE and NEVER, *EVER* LOOK BACK. DON'T BE DUMB SHEEP THAT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF. DON'T YOU FUCKING **DARE** SPEND YOUR HARD-EARNED $$$, AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOUR OWN HEALTH, ON GASOLINE AND PESTICIDES WRAPPED IN PAPER

you can do this. from this point on, you will never touch another cigarette. and for the sake of all that is holy, DO NOT tell yourself that you "can quit anytime". every cigarette has an impact on your health.

good luck.

actually, fuck that; no luck is needed. it's all up to you.

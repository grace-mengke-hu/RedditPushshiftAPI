Quit cold turkey and feeling like shit

Pretty much two days after I quit I got really sick. I cam off of it for the most part but I have a stubborn chest congestion that simply isn't going away. It also feels tighter and more difficult to breathe than when I was smoking.  This isn't my first time quitting, I have quit in the past before once for 2 years another time for 1 year but never experienced this before. Has anyone else experienced this?

Don't have cravings and been incredibly drunk over the holidays in front of smokers and didn't drunkenly ask for anything which is good. But I want to hit the gym but simply can't due to this breathing issue. So frustrating, anyone else go through something similar?

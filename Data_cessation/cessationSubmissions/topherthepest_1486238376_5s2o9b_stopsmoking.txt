Others are terrible.

So, I've made it a year and a month without a single cigarette. I didn't really have the support of many. My sister and this subreddit were my biggest helpers. Smokers I work with, however would always try to get me to cheat. One individual, I shit you not, slapped me in the face when i said no to a cigarette (he had money that I wouldn't make it through the year). Another co-worker quit with me and made it about eight months before relapsing. She really wants to quit, and last night when i try to encourage her, a bunch of employees told me to mind my own fucking business and she can do what she wants. She, on the other hand appreciated that I care... others are just soo infuriating. Has anyone else had any scumbags in the way of your quitting?

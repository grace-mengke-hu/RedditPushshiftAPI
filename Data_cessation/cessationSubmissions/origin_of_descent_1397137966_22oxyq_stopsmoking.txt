Drinking night success! Biggest fear quashed!

Hi all,
I survived a major event last night--It was my first fairly heavy drinking night since I quit smoking over half a month ago. Multiple times throughout the night others would step outside for a smoke, but I didn't even feel compelled to join them. In fact, I didn't like how they smelled when they returned to the group, nor did I feel like leaving the warmth and entering into the chilly night. I had fun without smoking, for the first time in a while. This girl I'm crazy about (who was also there) has no reason to think of me as disgusting or weak or anything negative like that. It was a good feeling to not rely on cigs, especially since I've done so much damage in the past by chain smoking on drinking nights.

Just remember if you are drinking: alcohol does not change the fact that smoking harms your body, nor does it add to the night's enjoyment. The pride you feel for not giving in is far more powerful than the smoking hangover you get after a drinking night. Stay strong everyone!

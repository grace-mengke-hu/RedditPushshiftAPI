What day is this?

Man, for some reason I'm just having a really hard time today. It's feeling like I'm back in week two suddenly. I've been fine, and suddenly I'm just fighting hard. 

I know there's no way I'm going to smoke a cigarette, they're completely disgusting and hold no attraction to me, but my brain knows that I've still got some lozenges and a bit of 3mg vape left. That's actually even harder to say no to though because my subconscious keeps using the logic that they aren't disgusting like cigarettes are. 

Right about now, all I really want to do is get in the Delorian, hit 88mph, and go back to kick the ass of my 15 year old self. I know I got this, but it doesn't make it any easier. 

Stay strong quitters.

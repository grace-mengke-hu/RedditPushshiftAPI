Almost 10 days in, going strong

I'm almost in 10 days and I feel great. I'm using an app called Stop Smoking Light and a vaporizer (iTazte). I'm breathing better, sleeping better, and not having the dizzy spells I was before. I smoked about 13 cigs/day for 9 years.  It is possible, and I'm much happier than I was before.

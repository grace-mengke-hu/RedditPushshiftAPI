I quit smoking a week ago and now have no motivation to hang out with my friends.

I know this doesn’t make any sense, but I know it’s because I’d always smoke cigarettes when I was with them. I’ve never been someone who smokes alone. Now that I’ve quit, I just stay home alone while all my friends hang out, and it’s a shitty feeling, but I don’t really have the motivation to go to the bar and buy overpriced drinks just to sit around with them while they smoke. I kinda screwed myself by having social interaction intertwined with the rush of smoking.

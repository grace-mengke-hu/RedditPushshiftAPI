Keep up the good work everyone!

I've gotten to a point where I had stopped looking at how longs it's been since I've smoked. A friend of mine has been trying to quit, so it aroused my curiosity. Damn near 500 days. I'm pretty happy about being able to breathe again. My sense of smell is crazy now. I've also realized just how salty most fast food / prepared foods are. (Not that my diet has improved much as a result, but one step at a time)

At any rate, cheers to trying. Cheers to quitting. If you feel like your failing at quitting, just keep trying.

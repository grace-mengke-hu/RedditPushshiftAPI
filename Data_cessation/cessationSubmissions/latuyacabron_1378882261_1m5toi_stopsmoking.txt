E-Cig vs Cold Turkey

I've been a smoker for about ten years. I've tried to quit several times, sometimes lasting up to three months without a cigarette. I tried nicorette gum once. I'm torn as to whether it helped. On the one hand, I was able to wean myself off of cigs rather quickly, but I feel like i became even more addicted to nicotine and started to smoke even more when I "fell off the wagon". Currently I smoke only when I'm drinking with other smokers (2 times a week) and always feel shitty about it. I'm wondering if an e-cig would be a good idea or if I would become more of a nic junky. Any opinions?

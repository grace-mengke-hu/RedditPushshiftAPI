Time is making it easier to say no to cravings

So today, my 6th day was a bit difficult. I had a couple long really intense cravings, but I just want to let everyone who is just getting started also that it does get easier. Instead of having 5 or 6 of these a day it is much less and having some momentum makes it easier to say no. I just kept telling myself that it's not worth it to ruin all of my progress. And knowing that the first couple days are the hardest helped me to abstain because I don't want to go through that again.

I want to thank everyone here that has shared their stories and advice because it really is extremely helpful. Knowing that having just one cigarette will just make it even harder really helped me decide not to ask my friend for just one smoke.

So thanks again, I appreciate all of the support of this community so much.

idk how I survived... probably coz of this

2 week maark! can't believe. when you smoke daily going one day without it becomes a challenge and when u add withdrawl to it , it's an amazing ride. 

I've never been able to cross 5days but this time I have quit for real! 
seeing all the ppl here trying makes me think that I owe it to this community and myself to not even have one puff!

I couldn't even imagine myself going to office and talking to ppl or working without smoking first. Now I work I talk I laugh I meet I roam 
everything without smoking!
feels great!

my head is clear, it's mostly nervousness in the stomach that isn't gone yet but I'm hanging in here. yesterday my mood was really bad due to this stomach nervousness but I made it yet again :D

please join me in not smoking today

Champix helped, but oy did it mess with my moods

So we're still off the cigs - hurray! We used Champix to help, but after 2 months on it, I noticed it was doing one hell of a number on my moods - as in I would have massive depressive episodes two to three times a week. 
After a particularly bad day that involved a lot of suicide ideation, I decided that I've been off the cigarettes long enough and I can do the rest without without the Champix. 
It's been three weeks and I'm glad to say that cravings are nil, relapses are nil, and the depressive episodes are greatly minimized.

Another side effect we've noticed with quitting smoking is we've cut way, way down on drinking. It now takes a week to finish a bottle of wine, as opposed to one - two nights. So we're taking that as a win as well.

This week has been stressful as fuck. My dad is in jail, because he's a piece of shit. My grandfather, his dad, has cancer. My half siblings are too grown to be in the middle of it. And I just fucking want a cigarette. But I will not smoke, not one goddamn puff, ever again.

Hey, sometimes life throws bullshit your way.

This week, my dad is in jail. 

I don't feel sorry for him, and it's not my goddamn problem. 

My siblings are fucking crazy, and my cousins are more like siblings. 

I drank beer tonight, and I really wanted a smoke. 

But I will not smoke, not one goddamn puff. 

I can do this, you can do this, not matter what the fuck life throws at you &lt;3

Almost 6 weeks in and things are starting to fall apart. Any advice would be much appreciated.

This coming Monday will be 6 weeks of no smoking, a feat which I never thought I would be able to achieve. Everything was going so swimmingly until the last couple of days.

Firstly my fidgets have come back. I didn't get any major cravings when i quit, but fidgeting was the worst, it has come back in full force and I am constantly either tapping my foot or clenching my hands.

Secondly I can't sleep and when I do sleep all my dreams are filled with me smoking. Has anybody else experienced this? It is really unnerving and really putting me off sleeping.

If anybody has any advice or experiences they could share it would be very appreciated. I'm kind of cut off from my friends at the moment because I'm living in Africa, so I don't really have anywhere else to turn.

Thank you in advance.

Smoking friends are becoming defensive?

Hey guys. I'm almost on day 60 (yay!) and it's been going great. The only problems I've had (apart from cravings and a relapse at the beginning of my process) are minor weight gain and then a new, sort of unexpected and uncomfortable problem - apparently, talking about your experiences and how much good this has done for me is not exactly the most popular thing to do with your smoking friends. 

Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do about it, just not talk about it? Let me clarify - I am not going on about this all day. I've had one talk with my best friend (who smokes) in the two months I've been off the cigarettes, but the talk went really weirdly. She got really defensive (not in an obvious way, but I know her). She even said "if you want to sit here and "badmouth" cigarettes..." and I interjected that I wasn't saying anything bad about her and that I didn't care that she smoked, after all, I smoked for years myself! 

Do your smoking friends react weirdly to you talking about your quitting? This conversation happened about 2-3 weeks ago and I don't think I will be bringing it up again but I just think that it is a bit uncomfortable because this is a HUGE life change for me which has improved my wellbeing tremendously. If it were anything else I had been doing (eating a specific food or whatever), I know my best friend would like to hear all about it. But now it's like, because she smokes, if I talk about my non-smoking experiences, I'm offending her. 

I don't want to offend or start any weird, awkward experiences between us, but I also want to be able to at least mention it. What do you think?

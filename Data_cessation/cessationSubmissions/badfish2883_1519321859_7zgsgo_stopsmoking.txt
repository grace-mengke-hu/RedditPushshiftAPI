Has anyone else experienced shortness of breath after quitting? Any advice?

I'm currently in day 5 of not smoking. I'm 34 and began picking up the habit at 13. I've been experiencing shortness of breath and am wondering if anyone else has experienced this, and if so, what did you do to help alleviate it? Thanks.

I don't even want a dip anymore...

Just the thought of putting one in, while I'm sure at first I'd love it, I know I would hate myself afterwards. I've made it this far. I can make it the rest of my life. Thanks to all of you for your wise words and advice. I hope.. no, I know I won't relapse anytime soon.

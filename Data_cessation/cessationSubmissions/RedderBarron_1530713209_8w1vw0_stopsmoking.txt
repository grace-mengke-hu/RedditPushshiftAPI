Managing boredom.

So, i'm underemployed, i've tried for countless jobs around town but with no luck, doesn't help that i live in a small town. I bring this up because since i work part time, i have a lot of free time on my hands, and with that comes a lot of boredom. And when i get bored the cravings come at me with a vengence. 

I've got a pack of nicotine mints but honestly they only really work when i'm preocupied with work or something like that. When i'm bored at home i might go out for a walk or something, but in a couple hours i'm back home, bored again, craving a cigarette, even after popping a mint after a bit it's all i can think about. 

How do you guys handle boredom when it comes to quitting cigarettes? Because thats definately my bighest downfall.

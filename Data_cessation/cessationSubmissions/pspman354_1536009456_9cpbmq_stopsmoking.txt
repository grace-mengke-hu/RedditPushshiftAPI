How I quit

On the day I successfully quit, this is what helped me and motivated me to stick with it

- Having nicotine patches in my house (not using them) gave me peace of mind that if cravings got bad, I can use them. I never had to actually use them, just having them on hand kept me calm

- LOTS of bubble gum, sunflowers seeds, and one wierd thing: chewing ginger. Chewing ginger in cut up pieces throughout the day burns your mouth, kind of like cigarettes, and also improves blood flow, thus helping to undo damages due to smoking

- Drinking plenty of water. I always kept a gallon in my hand ALWAYS, no matter where I was.

-  Keep remembering that the first three days are the hardest. If you can withstand the first three days, you can DEFINITELY keep going and its smooth sailing after that. If you can make it two days, its pretty much easy after that.

- Remind yourself how awesome it will be to be a non- smoker. No more cravings, no more wasting money on expensive cigarettes, no more anxiety when you are somewhere you cant smoke, or about not having any cigarettes, no more being unhealthy

Best of luck!

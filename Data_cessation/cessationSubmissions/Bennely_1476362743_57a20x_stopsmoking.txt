365 Days

Hi everyone - just a quick note to say "I made it".  365 days.

365 days.  in those 365 days I did not spend over $2,900 on smokes.  I did not smoke almost 5,500 cigarettes.  It's pretty shocking how many cigarettes we smoke over a year (this is at about 15 per day average).

I posted my first day quit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3ole2q/day_one_patch_on_frustrating_and_buzzing/?ref=share&ref_source=link). 

Everyone's quit is and will be different.  I tried cold turkey but couldn't hack it.  Ended up on the patch.  Didn't read Allan Carr's book.  

It hasn't been easy, but it does get much easier over time.  There were a few times in the summer, around the campfire with drinks and friends, they'd be smoking.. I wasn't.  Those were some challenging times to overcome but I did.

For those of you who are thinking about quitting, quit when you're ready.  You need to be in the mindset.  For those of you who've just started, keep it up.  It is not easy - we all know, but you can get through it.  For those of you who are months in - great job, it's a long battle and you're winning the war.  To those of you who quit before and have provided your support here - thank you.

You can do it, you can live smoke free.  I'll still be here giving some support from time to time because this community was helpful to me over the months and I feel it's important to keep the community spirit and support going.  Thanks everyone!

I am done...Today I bought a pack of American Spirits...

Carried the pack with me all day...got home, opened it...put it under the sink...soaked it in water, squashed the pack...and threw out in the trash...

I came to my senses...fuck smoking...I am done. But I was so tempted that i actually bought a pack...But I came to my senses. I feel great right now, Keep strong brothers!

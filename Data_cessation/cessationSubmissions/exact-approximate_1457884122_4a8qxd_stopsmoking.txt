9 Weeks...

9 Weeks. I slipped 3 times, but I always bounced back. 


My overall my achievements are:

- I no longer have the urge to smoke when I wake up in the morning.

- I no longer take a morning and afternoon cigarette break.

- I no longer need to smoke at lunch.

- I no longer need to smoke while I drive.

- I can do 30 minutes of cardio without thinking of stopping.

- My teeth are really white.

- My self confidence is increasing, I am not controlled by cigarettes anymore. Girls who consider cigarettes to be a deal-breaker are now looking at me in a different way.

- I can afford another short holiday this year.


Apart from alcohol or social scenarios, I no longer feel the need to smoke. 


Some tips:

- Quitting alcohol and coffee for the 4 weeks was really important.

- If you happen to smoke one at a dark moment, calm down, and re-affirm your goals. The world hasn't ended yet and it won't come crashing down on you unless you continue to smoke.


To another 9 weeks.

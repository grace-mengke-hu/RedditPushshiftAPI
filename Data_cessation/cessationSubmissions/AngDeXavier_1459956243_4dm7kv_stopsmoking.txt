I can't stop eating, please help.

So I'm on day 9 (or ten depending how you count). The early determination and positive attitude seem to have worn off some. The rationalizations are coming thick and fast now. I can handle all of this; just grit my teeth and know in a few days it will be easier. The problem is I am eating anything and everything. I can't sit for more than 30 minutes without needing to stuff my face. I'm trying to keep a handle on my calories by having cups of tea some of the time... but I've never been a big eater and I know I'm not exercising enough to cancel this out. Is this what was hiding behind 18 years of smoking? I don't want to replace smoking with food (or anything) - I want to be a normal human being who can get through the day without some kind of dopamine hit every hour.

A whole week. Turns out I have social anxiety. Who knew!

I haven't smoked a cigarette in an entire week. Not even normal Logar stuff like "ah I only had one last night that don't count."

I spent some time away from the city and away from everything after day 3. Things were so different and I was so "busy" that I didn't even think of it.

When I did sit down and reflect last night though, I got this tightening anxiety in my chest imagining going out to... well anywhere social. Bar, party, wherever.

I thought I smoked to look cool or fit in but at this point it is very much having an excuse to walk away from where I am. It is very much "how do I nonchalantly bond with this person, or how do I nonchalantly get them out of my goddamn face."

I'm going to spend another weekend "away" from the city, and then probably another away from most of my normal spots.

Also is starting to get cold so I'm good on all that.

A WHOLE WEEK

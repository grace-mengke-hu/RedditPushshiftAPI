Into my third day, question about using other substances while quitting.

I've been smoking for 18 years and am 33 years old. Stopped  just over 48 hrs ago and I feel pretty OK. I've heard the first week described as hell in a blog on quitting, pffft, I mean chronic seasickness, a spinal compression injury or the loss of a child; that is hell, quitting ain't so bad.

Anyway I'm wondering if it's OK to smoke pot while I'm quitting? I feel like it could be a replacement for tobacco during those trigger moments but I could be wrong. I already threw away my lighters and papers but I feel like owning one lighter and a bong should be OK right? I can't drink alcohol while I'm quitting for obvious reasons and I like to have a recreational drug in my life usually.

Cheers and thanks for any advice. Â

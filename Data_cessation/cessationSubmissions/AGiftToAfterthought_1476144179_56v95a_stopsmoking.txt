Day 1 of ..?

I've tried more times than I can count to give these horrible things the flick. I always found an excuse to wind up smoking again (work sucks, it's hard, my girlfriend was grumpy... the usual).

Something snapped this morning. Had (what was now) my last one and threw out the rest of the pack.
I'm sick of stinking. I'm sick of making people uncomfortable. I'm sick of my Girlfriend not wanting to kiss me. I'm sick of having no money.

So, this morning was it. Last one. Never going back.

It's going to be tough, I know. But I'll be fucking dammed if I have one more drag.

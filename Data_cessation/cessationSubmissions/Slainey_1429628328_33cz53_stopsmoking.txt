Day 2 Feeling Good

Today is the second day of No Butts.
I feel pretty good so far. I'm really proud of myself because last night I was hanging out with a friend who smokes like a chimney. I didn't have a single cigarette. Today it almost feel normal not to smoke. 

Oddly enough, I have a soreness it my throat. The same soreness that I used to get towards the end of the day after smoking a whole pack. I may be sick I suppose that's a possibility however this worries me. Have any of you ever had a soreness in your throat while quitting that feel strangely familiar to when you would smoke entirely too many cigarettes in a day?

I bought a vape... again.

I smoked for 20 years and for the last 2 years I smoked, vaped, and chewed. I joined this sub when I decided to go cold turkey off nicotine. So today would have been my 226th day without nicotine, but lately I've been struggling.  
So... I threw in the towel and got a new mod.  
When I quit, I gave my old vape to my little bro who thankfully completely quit smoking cigs and now only vapes.  
I guess the plan now is to vape until it gets old again. I'm on 3mg nic and I'm enjoying it so far. I do feel guilty though. It was fucking hell getting off from nicotine and now i'm choosing to go back.

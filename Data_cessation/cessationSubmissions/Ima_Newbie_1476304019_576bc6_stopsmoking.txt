Wow, 2 months already?!

If you're in the early days of quitting, or even a couple of weeks, you may feel like this quitting business is dragging out forever, and haunting you every.single.day.

But some time between a few weeks and a month, maybe this will happen to you: I quit obsessively checking my smoke-free app to see how many weeks/days/hours since my quit, how much $$$ I'd saved, and how many cigs I had not smoked.

At some point, it just wasn't an issue anymore. I was a non-smoker and if I thought about smoking at all, it was to wonder why it took me so many years to finally stop smoking. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes it IS hard quitting and staying quit... in the beginning. But at some point, the time just starts to tick along without you pining for the satisfaction you used to get from a smoke break. And suddenly another month goes by. :D

Here's to your daily sojourn along the path to tomorrow...

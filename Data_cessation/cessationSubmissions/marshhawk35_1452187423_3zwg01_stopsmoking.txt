Anger, anxiety, day 25

The stupid thing is, I truly don't want a cigarette and I am thinking about it less and less as time goes by. But in the past week my levels of anger and anxiety went through the roof. Everything and everyone irritates me, and I have these moments of sheer rage that come out of nowhere. 

I'm starting to wonder if I was this angry and anxious while I was a smoker, but I never faced it because I'd focus on a cigarette break when I felt emotions.... If so, I know that presents a really great opportunity for reflection, healing, and change. But right now, I really don't know what to do with myself. Why am I so angry? What do I do to deal with it?

The other thing I've noticed at almost a month quit is that I now have only one or two cravings a day at predictable times, rather than the persistent low-grade craving I had all day during the first two weeks. Which is great progress! But the intensity of the cravings now is far more intense than at any other time during this quit. What the hell is that? The first three days - when nicotine was actually in my system still - were a breeze by comparison. 

I guess I'm just rambling now, and if you've read this thanks for that. I truly expected this process to get easier with time, not so much harder. I'm really discouraged and exhausted by it all today. I'm not going to smoke, but I wish I could just crawl under a blanket and not come out.

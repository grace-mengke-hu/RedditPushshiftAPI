100 days after quitting and 2000 cigarettes not smoked, I celebrated with a cigarette. :/

I'm not sure why, but this milestone made me think of smoking to the point where I had to have one just to take off the pressure. So when I took the dog for a walk yesturday I got a spare smoke off a stranger and puffed away. It was disgusting, and I felt like shit afterwards and made sure I showed ans washed all my clothes when I got home. Even though it was only one cigarette I feel like i've failed myself.

Feeling lucky? Gearing up for a new year's quit? Today I celebrate 13 years without a cigarette!

If you're quitting over the holidays or new year's and need someone to talk to, feel free to hit me up for support. I still don't take it for granted, even after all this time. 

Do I ever want one? Really, truly -- NO!

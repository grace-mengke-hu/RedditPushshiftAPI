it's been a month!

it's been interesting. it was easy and exciting for the first 2 weeks. the last week or so i've been getting slight cravings, but they usually last a minute or less and i know how to write them off. i'm excited to get my first star. one step closer to a year and the rest of my days! the only slight worry is that i know i can quit and that it's not difficult when you're in the right mindset, i hope i don't ever use this as justification to hit one or something when i'm drinking with friends. but also i know how it works, i know how i've fallen for it in the past, and i'm aware that it's entirely in my hands to recognize that i'm this far in there's no reason to ever go back. why risk it?

good luck bruvs, let's not smoke today

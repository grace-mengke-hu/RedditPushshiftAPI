Well... it has been 30 hours and I officially hate everything.

I decided to quit smoking a few days ago after toying with the idea for the better half of a year.  It has now been 36 hours since my last cigarette, I bought an e-cigarette but I'm going to try to do this without it.
I feel like I have the flu, but I might have the flu.  I started re-watching my favorite show (Firefly) and I almost yelled at the computer screen for pretty much no reason.  I am generally a relatively reserved person.  My arms and legs hurt, are my arms and legs supposed to hurt?  Any advice at all would be helpful.  I'm going to do this, but I can't promise to like it

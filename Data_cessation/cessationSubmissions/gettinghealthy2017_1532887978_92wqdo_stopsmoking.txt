1 m/23 days, i want to smoke so badly rn

i’ve been doing so well, i was excited and proud and eating healthy and i’ve gained weight despite being the most diligent i’ve ever been about food and i want to give up and start smoking again. i’d rather deal with all the crap that comes with smoking than be fat, i don’t care how vain that sounds.

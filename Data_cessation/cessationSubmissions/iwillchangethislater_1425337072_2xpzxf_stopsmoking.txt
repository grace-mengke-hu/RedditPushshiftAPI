Where do I start?

I've just stumbled upon this subreddit and am really interested in quitting. I've quit before but I just keep coming back to it. How do I stop relapsing? I need help... I find it the hardest at work where smoking is such a social thing. That and driving. I don't smoke by myself at home unless I'm drinking... What can I do instead? Motivation?

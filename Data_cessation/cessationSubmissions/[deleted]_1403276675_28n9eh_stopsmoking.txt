Seeking encouragement

Nevertheless, today will mark the day I make my second attempt of quitting cigs.

 No more bullshitting, no more will I tell myself that tomorrow will be the day, no more excuses to light just one more, no more no more NO MORE. I've gone cold turkey for 4 months in the past and now I am ready to surpass that a hundred times over. Hell I have always been ready to quit, I just cannot adjust to having the right mentality. 

The addiction always seems to win the battles in my mind and yet the desire to quit just grows larger without there being any real progression. 

I may just be a stranger, but I would be a damn fool if I said I didn't need any help with this. 

Please- please- please share any tips or advice for how I can be more self disciplined to quit. I have a mountain of reasons to do so, but the nicotine seems to overcome my rationality.

16

Today made 16 days being smoke free. It's nice not going outside to smoke in the cold wet weather and driving to work with the windows up and staying dry and warm.  This is the first Year sense 1975 that I started smoke free I've tried so many times in the past but this year I'm definitely done it I'm working on day 17 haven't had any cravings in 3 day's feeling great and getting better every day.Â  We all got this Beat

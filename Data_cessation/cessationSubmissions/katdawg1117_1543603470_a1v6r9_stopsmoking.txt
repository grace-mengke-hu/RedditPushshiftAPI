Trying to quit

Been smoking for about 5 years (consistent half-pack a day) and it's my turn to quit. I've tried before, but my life was in shambles and just couldn't do it. Now, my life is more on track, so I'm going to give it another shot....any advice for a newby quitter? I really am determined this time, but I think I'm going to need some help.

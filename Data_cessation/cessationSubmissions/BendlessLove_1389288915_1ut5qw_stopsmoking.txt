Day 9: A few observations

1. The nicotine stains on my fingers are completely gone.
2. My mouth tastes "normal" now to me.
3. The smell of old smoke on a couple of my sweatshirts makes me a bit queasy.
4. Now that my sense of smell is returning, a lot of things smell bad.
5. The "crap" in my lungs is starting to remove itself. (lots of coughing)

I think being analytical about my progress has helped. It's like noticing mini milestones every day.

Keep up the hard work everyone!

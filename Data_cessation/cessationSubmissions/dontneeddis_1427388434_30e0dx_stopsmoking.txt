questions about sex

As you all can see, I am now 45 days clean.
As a single 27 year old, I like to drink and get lucky when I can.  Recently was my first time after quitting, and had my first difficult time getting it up.  I barely managed to finish the task, and to be honest, was very embarrassing.

I was pretty plastered, but it's never been an issue before (pretty much smoked cigarettes my entire sexual life).  
Would one of you mind elaborating on what is happening?

Hello r/stopsmoking im a New quitter on Chantix.

Just wanted to say hi, i'm on my second week with chantix, i had 4 cigs yesterday and plan on going all day today without one today and hopefully the rest of my life and I'm scared. I've tried quitting in the past but it felt fake. i'm ready to stop but I've so far felt very odd because of how integrated smoking was in my life, How routine it had become. The only thing so far that has bothered me about taking chantix is the upset stomach, in the morning i don't eat breakfast so after i take the pill i feel nausea for about 2-3 hours. Has anyone experienced this? do i need to just try and find the time for breakfast in the morning? Yea i probably should since i'm not smoking in the morning i freed up about 5 minutes to the point where i can just have some toast or something. Any tips from any chantix users on here would be helpful. anyways i'll definitly check back and let you know how im doing. for acountability.

Thanks

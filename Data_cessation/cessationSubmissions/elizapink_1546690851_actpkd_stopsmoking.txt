Grief reaction 7 days in!

Woke up this morning feeling bereft and very strange! I would normally smoke a spliff with my girlfriend on a weekend morning and then we go back to bed! This morning she got up as usual and I stayed in bed because I was tired anyway - but suddenly felt such grief, sadness and loss! Felt like it came out of nowhere! Last weekend all I felt was liberation but today I feel the opposite! I’m also a bit hormonal today so I don’t think that is helping! Had a good cry and chatted with her about it so I feel lighter now but wow, the grief and loss hit me like a tonne of bricks and totally unexpectedly!

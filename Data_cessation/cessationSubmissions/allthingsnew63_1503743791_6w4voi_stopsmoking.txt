2 Completely Weird yet positive side effects...

1.  Apparently I'm nicer.  That actually kind of pisses me off - lol. Although I haven't had a cigarette since June 23rd, I started with NRTs.  I have been completely Nicotine free 15.5 days and I'm still having anger issues.  SO it SERIOUSLY surprises me and yes ticks me off to have people tell me they like me so much better now and that I'm nicer.  The other day when I was taking what I now call a MEANDER break instead of a smoke break with a co-worker and she said "I like you so much better now" and took my arm. I kind of pulled away and said what was wrong with me before? (That's the I'm still pretty damn hateful at the moment part of me).  I didn't get a satisfactory answer, but apparently, many people have told me repeatedly that I'm  a much nicer person as a non-smoker, even though I feel pretty hateful at the moment and thought I was nice before.

2. My skin has majorly improved.  Like M.A.J.O.R.

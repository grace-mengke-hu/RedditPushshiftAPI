School is about to start when the challenge actually begins... What do I do in between classes to unwind now?

My last cigarette was on the 24th December, so that puts me at 13 days of sobriety (little victory macarena dance!) 

I don't know a lot of people in my classes in uni and I used to smoke in between every class because I have this weird anxiety thing where I stall for about five minutes after a lecture unwinding a bit, and stalling until the professor walks in because I don't want to just be sitting fiddling with my phone like a knob until the prof walks in. 

I know that sounds nuts, but that silly anxiety is strong enough to make me want to come out and smoke a cigarette in between class. 

So any suggestions on how to cope with that trigger when school starts again in a couple of days?

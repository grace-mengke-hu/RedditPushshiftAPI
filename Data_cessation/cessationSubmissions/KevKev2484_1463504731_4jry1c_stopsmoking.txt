When bad news gives you the slap you need - Day 1

I quit smoking last year but I started up again after NYE.  I just stopped again, and I'm using the patches to help with cravings.  Today is day 1.

Backstory: My mother, who's been a smoker for 40+ years has been diagnosed w/ emphysema, COPD, and found out that her lungs are functioning at 15%.  She has been told she needs a lung transplant but is refusing at this time.

This has been the biggest kick in my ass to get me to stop.  I'm 32 and I don't want this to happen to me when I'm older.  

Today is day 1 towards a healthier me.

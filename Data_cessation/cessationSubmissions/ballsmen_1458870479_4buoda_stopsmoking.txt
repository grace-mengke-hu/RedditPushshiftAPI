Woo! 83 days since I quit!

I fell in love with a beautiful girl who I've known for a long time now.  She is a childhood friend who never smoked.  I told her I would quit.  Every time I'd try and fail and she'd get super mad at me because she didn't understand how hard it was to quit cold turkey like I preferred.  So be me:  It's new years eve.  I get drunk after quitting for like a day.  She sees me smoke a cig with friends.  She gets mad.   I get mad at her getting mad.  It's an endless mad fest.  After that I was like fuck this.  


tldr; I love my girlfriend more than I love smoking.  Keep it up bros. Love conquers all!

Coming off 1 year of 1+ cigars a day. When does taste/smell come back?

I had been smoking (not inhaling) a cigar per day for basically a year. Even though I wasn't inhaling I think it still did a number on my senses, because I'm 4 days clean now and I can barely smell or taste a damn thing. I might also have a cold which isn't helping but when will my smell and tastes come back? I'm 20 if that matters. I'm also drinking like 5+ water bottles a day

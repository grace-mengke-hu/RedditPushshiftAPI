Cutting back

Hey everyone. I think I’m finally ready to commit to quitting smoking. I’ve looked over different options, and since I smoke about 35 cigarettes per day I’ve decided that cold turkey would be a bit much for me to handle. 

However the cutting back method stood out to me as something that seems manageable. Before diving in however I’d like to ask a couple of questions here to people who have used this method to quit smoking. 

My main question is do the cravings get easier as you cut back? By this I mean does your body adjust to the lower level of nicotine over time or do cravings just get worse as you reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke. 

As well, how fast did you cut back? 1 less a day? 1 less a week? I’m a bit lost as to how fast I should be going. 

Also if any of you wanna share your experiences with cutting back please do! I’m looking for anything to better educate myself on this method. 

Thanks!

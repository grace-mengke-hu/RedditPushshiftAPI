180 degree turn.

So I stopped smoking tobacco cold turkey, can't drink alcohol for a year because of some medical treatment (this is not that big of a deal since I didn't really drink that much), can't smoke weed anymore because of random drug tests at my university and I started exercising an hour every day.

I feel like shit. I feel like I can't get enough air, I feel tired, acid reflux sucks. Whenever I'm exercising I need to stop every 10 mins to go and spit phlegm.

I don't really have any cravings for tobacco to be honest, I'm sure I'll quit. Just want to make that clear.

Will it get any better?

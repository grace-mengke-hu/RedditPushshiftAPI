Guys need help

Guys I need to ask a question because I have really bad anxiety so I worry about almost anything, but basically I used to have asthma and never used an inhaler in about 10 years and never been to doctors about and never had trouble breathing, I got drunk last night and had one drag of a fag and that was it and next day my chest started to hurt but not seriously hurting just felt tight and my throat was sore and I started to get mucus in my throat but very small amounts. Should I be worried or do they not have anything to do with me having a drag?

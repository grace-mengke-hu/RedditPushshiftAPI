What are some scientific ways of speeding up nicotine elimination of the the recovery of nicotine withdrawal

Hello,

I am 30. I've smoked on a off since I was 18. I hate it and really have no desire to smoke. I actualy very healthy, workout, drink water,etc. I even once stopped for a year smoking. Latetly I will stop for a month be motivated and all it takes is one to start. I can always get throug the first couple days but it is always hell.

I'm not complaining but with severe depression and bloating its a lot to handle. I do all the right things, relax, mediate, workout, drink water, juices, fiber but the effects are still there . Any advice on anything more I can do?

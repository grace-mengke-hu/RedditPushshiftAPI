Tell me why I shouldn't smoke

I am 28/F. I smoked my first cigarette about 3-4 years back. Since then I must have smoked a total of 10-15 cigarettes. But these days I am going through a lot of stress and I just feel smoking might help. Also I see that it is easier to bond with people when you smoke. 

I care about my future children's health and my own. That is the only reason I am not smoking but so many people smoke all the time and look fine enough. 

What experiences are you going through that has convinced you to want to quit smoking? Why should I not make it a habit?

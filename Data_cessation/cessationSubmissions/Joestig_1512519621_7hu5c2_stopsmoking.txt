17 days in, I already was a positive influence for someone

My sister offered me a cigarette, not knowing that I quit. I told her that I did, and that it's for good so that she should never give me one (but thanks anyways). She told me that she is trying to quit herself. She is not someone who easily opens up, not even to her brother, and I am glad that she was able to share it. I just said "that's good to hear".

I hope that me quitting is just showing her that it's possible for her to do so as well. And now she knows that if she needs advice that I can offer her. I chose not to offer it to her without her asking for it, I think she appreciated that.

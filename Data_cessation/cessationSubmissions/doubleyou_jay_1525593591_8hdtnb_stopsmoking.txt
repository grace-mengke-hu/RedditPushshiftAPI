So for the last week I have honestly been justifying and facilitating getting drunk and smoking tonight. I shyly told myself I wouldn’t smoke while knowingly planning to do so and blame it on my inhibited subconscious. Like it’s been there the whole time.

All2.5 months. I I even bought a pack of smokes. Somehow I haven’t yet still. I’m going to though. I’m telling myself i can just smoke when I drink like my sister in law. I already hate myself for it but I still want to. Ugh addict behavior at its max. I know it and I’m still letting it define me.

Drunk and still free

I only mention that I'm drunk right now because I am probably going to ramble. It might not be in the most easily read sort of way. But I think it is good to say something right now. 

I have quit a few times before. Once for 2 years. Once for a little over a year. Each time I failed because I thought I could have just 1. Or it wasn't a problem to just smoke like 1 a week. When I entered into the quest to free myself of nicotine I did so with a certain understanding. Quitting is a process a struggle that lasts years. When you decide to say no to them now, you prepare to say no then 2 years from now. And potentially 3-4-5 years. I don't think I'll want another my whole life, but what if I feel that craving 10 years from now. 

Not even 1

Not today. Not 10 years from now. 

"I will not eat them in a house, i will not eat them with a mouse, i will not eat them in a box i will not eat them with a fox, i will not eat them here of there i will not eat them anywhere, I do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them sam i am"

In that moment of confidence. When you think it would feel good. When think it would help. No cigarette is okay. No cigarette will do what you want it to. You cannot be happy with a cigarette. 

The addition monkey quiets down over time. It learns that you don't listen. It knows it is wasting it's breath. It will wait until the right time. And hit you in a way that you don't know it. 

You are better than that. Sit down and comfortable for the long fight. It gets easier, but it doesn't go away for a very very long time. If it does at all.

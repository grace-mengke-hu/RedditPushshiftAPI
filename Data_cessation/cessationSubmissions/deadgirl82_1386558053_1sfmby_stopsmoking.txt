I know I should quit but...

I've smoked for 13 years and I know I should stop. I'll save a ton of money, I'll be healthier, everything will be peachy. I understand all the mechanics of why I should stop but there's nothing really driving me to stop, even though I would like to, I just don't have the deep down motivation to quit. 

Any words of advice for a reluctant quitter?

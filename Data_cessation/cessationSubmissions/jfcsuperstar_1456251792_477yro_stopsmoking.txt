Still plan on taking 'smoke breaks' at work

I'm in five days without a cigarette, but my coworkers are used to me stepping out to smoke at least two or three times per shift. My job only allows a thirty minute lunch break, even at a nine hour shift. I don't plan on telling them that I've stopped smoking just so I can still take the extra ten-fifteen minutes of downtime. Anyone else do this?

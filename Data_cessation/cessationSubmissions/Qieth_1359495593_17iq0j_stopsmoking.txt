Dizzyness

In my previous quitting posts, I have talked about the dizzyness I feel when I try to quit cold turkey. I litterally feel like I'm drunk. My vision is wavery, my speech is slurred and so on. I used to think that this came from the extra oxygen in my body, but I've come to realise that this is not the case.

I'm on day 8 now, and I've been using nicotine gum up until day 6. I used the gum to wean myself off nicotine pretty quickly, because by day 6, I had just three pieces - and in the last two days, I have had none.

But now the dizzyness is back. It would creep up on me if I had gone a long time without a nicotine gum, and disappear once I had a piece. It's clear that my body is reacting to the lack of nicotine.

Thankfully, it's not as severe as when I went cold turkey before. And if it just stays like this and doesn't get any worse, then I can deal with it and still be productive. But I worry that it might get worse. Whats funny, though, is that it had disappeared after waking up for some reason, and then it comes back during the day. Hmm.

Does anybody have any experience with this? Is this just the way it goes? Is there any way I can relieve this dizzyness, or is it going to go away fairly soon?

This is the longest I have ever been without nicotine in 12 years. I don't want to smoke again.

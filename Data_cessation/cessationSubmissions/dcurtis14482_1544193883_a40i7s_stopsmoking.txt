Wife is trying to quit

So my wife(she doesnt have reddit) is trying to quit, stopped smoking cigarettes but has a vape. The habit of holding the lighter, the cigarette, the going outside, the after dinner cig, all of it is a huge adjustment for her. Definitely feels her body adjusting to the recent change. Any pointers on how to make it less stressful, how to make her feel less on edge? 

Sorry for the bad grammar

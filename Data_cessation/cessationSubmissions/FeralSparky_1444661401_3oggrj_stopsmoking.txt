Well yesterday was interesting

So first up I caved yesterday... For exactly 2 hits. 

I was craving big time after 3 days. Went down to the gas station to buy a couple singles. 

So I'm sitting on my bike and I light up like always but I got 2 hits in and something in my brain clicked. 

I stared at the burning money pit in my hand and couldn't hit it anymore. My craving was instantly gone. So I threw it and the extra on the ground and crushed them with my boot. 

Since then I have not so much as felt a craving for any nicotine. Threw away my ecig when I got home. 

Feeling great.

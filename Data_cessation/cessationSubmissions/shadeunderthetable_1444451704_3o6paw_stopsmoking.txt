Trying again, this time with the patch.

So, a little less than two weeks ago I tried to quit cold turkey. On the third day I came home to find one of my roommates had thrown away a two day old steak of mine. I was pretty upset about this, along with a lot of other things, (I think I may have clinical depression, I have my first counseling session in a few days.) So I punched a hole in my concrete backed wall and threw and smashed a framed painting that fell. So I started again and decided to do the patch on my next pay day (today, so starting tomorrow). I'm gonna put it on tonight because I never remember my dreams but it's nice to be able to do that for a few days. Many of you may be familiar with this side effect. The dreams are nice because it let's me see onto my mind for a bit and escape reality. 

Anyways, I realized I need my breath, I enjoy biking and simply not being winded in general way too much to keep smoking, but I'm also a crazy mother fucker and need to step things down gradually. Last time I quit cold turkey I made it two months, I was still an aggressive ass hole bear for the entire time, that or I was on the verge of tears. Hopefully this time will last pretty long.

Triple digits, wow!

Time really flows by, doesn't it?

I remember when I could't go an hour without a smoke, now it's been 107 days and I don't even want one anymore.

I'm not going to lie, this journey hasn't been easy and it's definitely not over but I'm so grateful to have put that filthy habit behind me and I couldn't do it without the support of my fellow quitters. 

A few things I noticed since quitting, and maybe it'll help you all in the long run:

* I don't stink. Not just of cigarette but my sweat isn't as offensive as it was when I was smoking.

* My skin is so much clearer. I had wicked bags under my eyes when I was a smoker and my skin was sickly pale especially on my face. I even had far more pimples than I do now.

* I eat a lot more. Smoking made me lose most of my appetite, I'm glad that I was able to get it back and start eating healthier and more regularly. 

* I can smell EVERYTHING!! Previously I was only able to smell something if it was powerful, but now I smell so much even if I'm just taking a walk outside- I can smell the flowers and the grass abd the dirt. It's wonderful.

* I can taste so many more things. Usually my taste was limited. I didn't notice how much i was missing out on until two weeks after quitting and eating some things and they tasted so different!

* I sleep better. I used to wake up feeling groggy and craving a smoke. Now I wake up alert and craving fresh air.

* I'm not as irritable. Smoking made me agitated and irritable, the only times when I wasn't was when I had a cigarette in my mouth.

* I can laugh without coughing. When I smoked if I laughed to hard I'd end up in a coughing fit. Now I can laugh as hard as I want and only need to stop for air!

* I can walk further and faster than before.

But most importantly...

* I'm going to live longer.

A few other changes I noticed was that I have done irreversible damage to my teeth and to my lungs. I can only hope that in time I'll have the money to fix my teeth and hope that my lungs will fix themselves.

So for those of you who are quitting, quitters or thinking about quitting... **you can do it**. You just need to stay stong, you need to trust that you can get through this and that you'll be better off in the long run.

Quitting is easy, smoking is hard.

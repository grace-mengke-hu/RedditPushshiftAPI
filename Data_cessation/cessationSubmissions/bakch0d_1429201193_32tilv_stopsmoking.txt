Met an old friend ...

I met an old friend yesterday, hadn't seen him in an year. We got a bunch of drinks and I did get a few cravings but nothing I could not brush aside. 

Anyways, he did not know that I had quit and said I look different, fresher and healthier. When I told him I had quit, he was super impressed and showered me with words of encouragement and appreciation. Felt really good and thought I will share it with you guys. 

Its hard to believe that I am looking healthier/fresher in 23 days of quitting but hey, I ll take what I can get.

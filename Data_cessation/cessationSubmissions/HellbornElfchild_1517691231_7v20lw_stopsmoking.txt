I like to pop in every once and while to say keep at it! It only gets so much easier!

According to here I am at 2,337 days of no smokes! I gave up cold turkey on 9/11/2011 and have never had a cigarette since! You can do it!

Also here to give my full endorsement of "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking" by Allen Carr. I read that book, and have never had another cig. Case closed. Give it a read!

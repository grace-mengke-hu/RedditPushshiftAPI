Would it be cheating if I go to a Vape Shop?

I have been really good in resisting temptation in purchasing a pack however there is a vape shop that is on my walk home from work and on occasion I think if going in would be considered cheating. Im on the fence about it because it would mean that I am technically smoking but at least Im not buying a pack and it can be seen as going to a bar and having a drink.

Thoughts anyone?

25 Days In!!! Question: Did you Blood Pressure drop significantly?

I gave blood a few days ago, and my blood pressure was 98/75 and has never been that low. My pulse was 68, which I did expect some drop there (was around 85 before) I have always hovered right 120/80, give or take a few points, before and after I started smoking. 

Is a drop this significant normal? Has anyone else had this happen to them? How long before it returned to normal?

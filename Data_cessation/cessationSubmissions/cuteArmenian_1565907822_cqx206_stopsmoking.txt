Quitting for the 2nd time now...it doesn't get easier, does it?

Has anyone failed from the first attempt? How did you find the motivation for the next time?

I quit for whole 4 months in January but as the summer began my urges overcame my willpower. And now I am back to square one. With one failed attempt behind, it seems like I have even less motivation this time...

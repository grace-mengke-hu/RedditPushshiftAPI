Anyone else a long term off and on smoker but still find it impossible to resist sometimes?

I've been smoking for about 10 years now, and in periods I smoked daily, the longest about 6 months, in periods I didn't smoke for months.  Generally I smoke when they're around and don't when they're not.  I probably smoke a pack in "borrowed" cigarettes a month. (I buy people packs every once to not be a complete bum)

If I buy a pack, which is unusual, I smoke about 1/3rd to a half a pack a day and cannot seem to smoke less.  If I don't have them, don't think about them unless I see other people smoking (on tv or in real life) even when at the store or gas station and I'm looking at them across the counter I'm not compelled to smoke. 

So I have a hard time believing my issue is a chemical dependency when I am so unmotivated to smoke for intermittent periods. I share this with other things that aren't addictive as well so I am pretty sure it's psychological. 

I've done vaporizers and they're fun, and I would probably vape regularly, but it doesn't do anything to make me not want a cigarette if I see other people smoking.  

It's so hard to stop "cold turkey" when I don't even do it on a regular basis so I'm not even choosing not to smoke most of the time.  I don't feel tested until I see someone else light up and then all of a sudden I'm in a dilemma and have to make a choice that I have not really readied myself for. 

Anyone else have/had this issue?

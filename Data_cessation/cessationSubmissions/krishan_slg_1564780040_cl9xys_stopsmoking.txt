Left... rejoined... leaving again..

I smoked for almost 3years... A regular smoker .. 10-12sticks a day... which sometimes increased upto 20...
3months ago, i got sick, jus fever, but that time, i was not able to go out to buy cigarettes.. and then came the nightmare, eveey passing minute i had the craving, it literally felt like dying every minute, but successfully completed 2mnths, without smoking, but one day, it was one puff... And for the past 2mnths i am smoking again.. i feel terrible, cux i got back into it so badly, that the thought of quitting it, reminds me of those nights, when i couldn't sleep, i fear, and again i smoke, i know i am supposed to leave it, cux earlier it was 3years, and i creaved for 2weeks, this time it's merely 2mnths, in a couple of days i will be fine, but the fear is eating me...
But i have made my decision, it's been 10hrs now, i haven't smoked, won't let myself smoke now... For the next 62hrs it will be tough, i know it, but deep inside, i know... It will be worth it ðŸ˜Š

Reminders to Stay Quit

I want control over my life again
Sick of hiding the fact that I smoke (from before)
I feel like crap 
I am embarrassed to be a smoker 
I want to live a long life 
I want to set a good example for my children 
my voice is raspy 
I want to feel better 

That's why I quit smoking !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One month check in!

It was a difficult journey. First few days I had the help of Tabex, which took the edge off a little bit. The following week came runny nose, and I went through about 350 tissues in less than 5 days. Next weeks were progressively better and better. I'm getting ready to start working on my fitness, since it should be easier now.

This time the target is 12 months - hopefully by the time I get there it will be absurd to think of starting smoking again. Frankly, it already seems that way!

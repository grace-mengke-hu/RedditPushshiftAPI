OH HOW I LOATHE

My friend suggested this thread to me. I had to literally make a new account to reddit. It's fine. I haven't bought a "PACK" since July 6th and I've been bumming from people, going to the store to buy "loosies" . This is how I convince myself that i'm "quitting" and it has never worked worked for me. So Today! I made the conscious decision that it's time. Yesterday was my Day 1. Today is Day 2. Not looking forward to how tired it makes me, but I know for a fact that cigarettes make me SICK. I just feel like straight shit after even just a few pulls. I'm soooo over that yo-yo binge waste crap. Ugh. So yea. I should be able to make it through the week and goddammit i'm having mood swings ;) RAWWRRR

Need encouragement/advice/anything please

I’ve been trying to kick this for the last several months.  I got 3 weeks in and failed.  Got another 2 weeks in and failed.  Couple days here, a week there.  I just want it to be over, but each time I get to a point where I don’t care and smoke.  I get so angry at everything when I’m not smoking that I’m told just to smoke.  I feel terrible about how mean I get, so that how I rationalize smoking.  I feel defeated.

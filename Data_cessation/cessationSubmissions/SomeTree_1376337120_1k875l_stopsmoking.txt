Today is the day. I am going to use the money for a good cause.

I have been thinking of quitting for a while now. Today is the day.

I noticed that overall, I spent more than €1500 in cigarettes in the last 3 years (about €45 a month), and I am ashamed of it.

I am currently in Barcelona, working a summer job. There are so many people living on the streets you wouldn't believe. Really. 
 
I am using the €45 a month to help some people. I created a (blog)[helpingarandomstranger.blogspot.com], 10 minutes ago in which I will report my experiences. 

Tonight I am picking a random person on the street to have dinner with. 
Cheers, non-smokers! Keep strong!

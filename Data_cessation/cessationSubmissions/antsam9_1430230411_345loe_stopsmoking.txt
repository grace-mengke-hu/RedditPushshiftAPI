Resources for quitting? What is and isn't effective for you? How would you talk to someone quitting or needs to quit?

Hello, I'm a student respiratory therapist and former smoker, I quit 10 years ago. I had trouble quitting, I tried a few times but I found it to be something that relaxed me and helped me be more social. I tried cold turkey twice before, but I found tapering down helped got me there eventually. I forced myself to taper down by taking 5 ciggs out of a pack and giving the rest away to a homeless guy that hung out by the 7-11 that was 20 miles away from where I lived and worked (so every cigg was also at least 30 minutes of reconsideration) along with a few dollars. I would allow myself less and less ciggs and I would donate more and more, eventually it got to the point where I would only keep 1 cigg and was giving that bum a 20. I did that twice and that was it, I couldn't afford to keep that guy in ciggs and cash and my tank was empty. 

There was a monkey on my back for at least 3 years, but after that the cravings are gone and now I haven't looked back since. 

I was wondering if there were anything I can present or share in a clinical setting, 1 on 1, healthcare provider to patient or patient's family that would be fair, factual, and not forceful. It's a personal decision and action to quit, but is there a website, or video, or questionnaire that helps?

Today is my first day of being a Non-Smoker thanks to Alan Carr's book

Hello fellow users of Reddit!

This is my first post on this website (forgive me for any errors in grammar and parts of speech). I've been a long time lurker but wanted to share my story of stopping smoking with this community.

I've been on and off with smoking clove cigarettes since I turned 21, I am now 24 and after 3 years finally kicked the habit. I've tried many attempts to quit by cold turkey, and the longest period I went without smoking was 4 months before I relapsed.

I've read Alan Carr's Book "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" a few months before hand (in May) and successfully kicked the habit, only to relapse again a month after in a moment of weakness. 

Today after reading the book a second time and with an open mind, I know realized the trap that I fell into and won't make that same mistake again. I know feel great for being free from the "weed" and embrace the energy that I will regain from being a non-smoker

Alan Carr's Book definitely gave tremendous insight on smoking, and I can say that if you read it with an open mind and follow the directions, you too can stop smoking once and for all. Today is Day 1 of the rest of my life being a non smoker!

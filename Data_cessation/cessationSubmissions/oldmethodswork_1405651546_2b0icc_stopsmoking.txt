Officially in groundbreaking territory

Well several weeks ago I posted talking about how I regularly (at least 2x a month) have been able to quit for 6-7 days, and about 15 days has occurred several times this year.

Now I'm at three weeks working on day 22, and I've got to tell you I haven't had this much ease and success, well, ever. Last year I quit for 9 months, but it was always just so much harder. So what is different now?

For starters, I have learned first-hand what it is like to be perpetually experiencing withdrawal effects. I now understand triggers about 1000x better than the average person, according to the latest research by Oldmethodswork. 

Next, I have an app on my laptop now that tells me exactly how long I have quit smoking. Every time I think about it, I just look up. 

Finally, being on this support forum has helped immensely. Your continual stories are relatable and keep me from forgetting the mind tricks our brains love to play on us. 

So, the biggest thanks has to go to you guys. I can't express enough how much you have all collectively made my life so much nicer over the last few weeks. :)

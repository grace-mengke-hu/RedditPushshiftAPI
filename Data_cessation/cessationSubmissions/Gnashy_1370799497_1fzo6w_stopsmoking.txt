Let me Count the Ways...

I'm posting this because I have now got three weeks behind me of not smoking.  I am no longer physically addicted to nicotine, and the desire to smoke is mostly out of my system. I do still have difficult days, and I often have to think myself out of a craving, but I think my behavior is starting to return to normal.  Which is why I wanted to get this down - the things I take for granted when I'm feeling "normal".  It's so easy to forget just how bad it feels to be a smoker when you aren't one.  There comes a point where you don't just wake up and say "Wow, I feel... just regular! How great is that?"  So before I forget, I would like to take a minute to write out the things that seem normal when you're a smoker that I do not miss at all.  I think it will help me to look back over in the coming months if I feel that urge, and hopefully it could help some of you folks just getting started.  Feel free to add on if I've missed anything!

Smoking Shit List:

-Waking up and being painfully aware of my esophagus.

-The nagging concern that wherever I go I need to have a backup plan in case I run out of cigarettes.

-Every especially good bout of laughter ending up in a fit of coughing.

-Freaking people out with a very subtle rattling wheeze every time I take a deep breath.

-The smell of my fingers when I'm trying to go to sleep.

-One less trip I have to take back into the house when I'm trying to leave because I forgot cigarettes or a lighter (now it's just the trinity of keys, wallet, why did I come in here?... oh yeah).

-Hangovers are 80% more manageable now - it turns out that so much of the recipe for a crippling hangover is chainsmoking.  It's been amazing waking up and not regretting the sandpapery act of wrenching my eyelids open after a long night of drinking.

-Getting disproportionately angry with anyone or anything that conspired to prolong the time before my smoke break.

-Randomly having half of my hand go numb.

-Coughing so hard I give myself a headache or see spots.


Most of all, I am glad to be rid of that constant fear that I will have to quit someday looming on the horizon, picturing how awful it's going to be (it wasn't) and how empty my life will be without smoking (it isn't).  Thinking every time I smoked about how I would have to quit, and then a half hour later thinking I'd never be able to make it.  
I know I still have a ways to go, but I'm very glad to have made it this far, and I have a feeling things are only going to get better from here.

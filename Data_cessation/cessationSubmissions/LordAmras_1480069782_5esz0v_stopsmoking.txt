First day without thinking about it.

Yesterday I was going to bed and I thought that it was a good day, but couldn't really find the reason why.

And then it hits me that I didn't thought about smoking or had any kind of craving the whole day.

At first I was mad because In the end I technically thought about it, but I still going to call it a win because it wasn't with the intonation of "If only I could still smoke" but a "I'm happy I'm not smoking anymore".


Yes I already felt all the other good effects of having more breath, not stinking my clothes and not having to go buy cigarettes in the middle of the night because you run out, but this one was different.

I know it's not over, I'm having a craving right now, and I know I will be an ex-smoker for the rest of my life, but yesterday was the first actual light peeking at the end of the tunnel. The idea that there will actually be a day when things will be much easier and I don't have to fight the urges, and I will be able to do nothing for 15 minutes without going mental because i can't smoke.

Also thanks to you, venting here actually helps.

Stay strong guys, we can do this !

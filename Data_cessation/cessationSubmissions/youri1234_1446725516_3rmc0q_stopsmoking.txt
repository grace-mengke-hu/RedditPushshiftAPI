Can't quit smoking! Help me, please?

Well hello, It's my first time browsing this sub and I got an questions. First let me tell something about myself. I'm 20yrs old and I just can't manage to quit again. I started smoking when I was about 15/16 and around februari this year I have managed to quit for like 2 months and somehow I just fell back into my smoking habit. And ever since I just wanted to quit again. Only this time, I just can't seem to do it. I have read the books from Alan Carr. Watched a dozen of video's about smoking. Looked up everything I could find about smoking and how to quit. But somehow I just cannot get rid of this habit or make the shift in my mind, I have had some weeks were I did not smoke for 1-3 days and just started all over again. Smoking away all my pride. I just dont know what the fuck can make me quit again. I just dont know. I'm just wondering if somebody had felt this too, and did manage to quit again. How did you do it? Any information would be helpfull, I just need to know how to make that first step again. 

Thanks for reading.

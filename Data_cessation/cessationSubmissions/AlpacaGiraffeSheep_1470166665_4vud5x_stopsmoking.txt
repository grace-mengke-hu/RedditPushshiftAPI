7 full days and proud, but have sleeping problems. When did yours go away?

Hi, I wouldn't have posted if I didn't have an actual annoyance bugging me about quitting.

Three and two days ago I barely slept 3 hrs each night and was angry all day not because the lack of smokes but the lack of sleep. Last night I slept 13 hrs, and felt even more tired... I feel like these sleep disruptions are what also REALLY cause me to have difficulty concentrating while awake.
I only need to ask whether you guys have/ had it this annoying with sleeping, and if so, when did it end?

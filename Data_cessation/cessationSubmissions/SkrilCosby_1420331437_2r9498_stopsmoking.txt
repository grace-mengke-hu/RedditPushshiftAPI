I can't stop eating!

I have made it a month and a half so far, and I'm pretty excited about that. However,  now I don't know when or how I'm supposed to eat. I feel the need to eat constantly,  but never actually hungry. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to manage food after becoming smoke free?

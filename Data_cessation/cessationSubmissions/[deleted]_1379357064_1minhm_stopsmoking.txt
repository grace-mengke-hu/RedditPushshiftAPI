Withdraws. Its been 9 days and I still want to smoke. When does it end?

I have asked a lot of people who used to smoke and every one of them say they still want a cigarette from time to time. It doesn't matter if its been one year or even 10+years (local Fire Chief).   
Is it the same for all you? Do you still think about it even after the withdraws are gone?

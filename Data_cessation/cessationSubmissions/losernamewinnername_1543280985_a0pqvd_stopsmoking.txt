Hah quit weed 10 days ago because I realized it always ends up using it to feel ''normal'' while being a slow fuck ruining my

mind, health and spirituality and ending up in abusive ''friendships''... So I don't even miss it. 

But I'm really scared about tobacco? My mother is going away to work in another state in 2 days and father is staying on our property.  I love both of them even though they are divorced and sometimes I end up being their messenger -.-. Can't wait to start working but I'm afraid if I start working while smoking I'm in for such a bad time for my health and nerves. 

I really get mad at her whenever I'm trying to leave this habit and it's so awkward to be quitting near. The worst thing is even by smoking a little now it just makes me awake through the whole night and my sinuses are really suffering... 

It's like I'm smoking 3-5 cig a day but it's so fucking addictive. I don't even like smoking the whole cigarette or smoking in house, so I leave halves or thirds of them outside or throw them in fire..

I wish I had nerves to quit now instead of planning while this or that happens...

Give some advice!

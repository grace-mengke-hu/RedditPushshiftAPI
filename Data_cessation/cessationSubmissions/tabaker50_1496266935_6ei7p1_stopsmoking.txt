Day 2 and...homicidal?

So I was in this community a few months back. Obviously I fell off the wagon, but I'm back on. Tomorrow at 10:48 a.m. I will officially be 72 hours cold turkey.

Cravings have been minimal so far. I would consider them THOUGHTS more than cravings...nothing too compelling (yet). And this morning was going well, but around and after lunch, this strange sense of pure evil hatred came over me. 

I was at the grocery store and was pushing my cart down the aisle. This lady was putting something back on the shelf and I thought, "She's going to start moving her cart once mine makes it up to hers." And she did. Did I stop my cart to let her go ahead? Hell no! It became this wierd cart race between grown ups until finally, she stopped and let me go ahead. And I thought, "Damn right you did, lady!"

We ran into each other in the cheese aisle later and and gave me this death stare and I got this sick pleasure out of knowing I upset her, and that's when I realized...

What the hell is wrong with me?! How long before the menche comes back? I just am so completely irritable, and while some of the folks I work with I firmly believe need a swift upper cut to the jaw, they are still human beings and I'd like to not get fired either.

Thanks!

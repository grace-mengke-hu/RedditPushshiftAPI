Quitting is hell; or how i learned to stop worrying and embrace the sufferest.

Last Saturday, September 3rd 2016, I walked into our local shopping mall/precinct and straight into the arms of a Government agent. Well, an agent of the local Government's stop smoking service. I had ZERO intention on quitting. After a little back and forth, I half heartedly signed up to their quit smoking program, got some microtabs from them, and agreed to blow into their little breathalyser machine. Apparently this measures CO levels in the breath.  Here is their scale of what readouts mean:

So 30 is a heavy smoker. I blew 36. Thirtyfuckingsix. Myself I'm 35 and have been smoking a pack or more per day for 21 years. Ouch.

So off I tottled, feeling like a complete fucking loser.

This last Saturday I rolled in to see the friendly local Government no smoking agent, and to redo my test.

I blew 0. She nearly died. Truth be told, I started dancing midway through when I could see it was not shifting.

Literally if I can do this, anyone can. If you're considering it, do it. In the end I somehow rolled with no NRT or medication or anything. Turns out stubborness can be a positive personality trait if you're trying to kick bad habits.

If you've quit and you're going through hell, just stay in there, keep going, it will pass. And that message is as much to myself as to anyone who may be reading this.

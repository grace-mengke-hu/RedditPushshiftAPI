I HAVE to stop smoking right away. Need some advice.

I've had so much stress in the past year that I found myself smoking almost a pack a day. This is terrifying, as in the past I only smoked on occasions. 

I have no idea where to start and how to manage my urges. 

What are the most successful practices for quitting? I don't want to use patches or medication, as I'm highly sensitive to all kinds of chemicals. 

I'd appreciate your help, /r/stopsmoking. I've read good things about this subreddit.

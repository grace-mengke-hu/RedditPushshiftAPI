I'm finally starting to be able to smell again!

I took another attempt at quitting at 9:30 last night, so it's officially been over 24 hours without smoking. And honestly, I'm doing really well. I tried to quit a couple days ago and caved in less than a day, but this time feels much easier for some reason. Also, I was able to smell fresh cut grass today for the first time in years and it was glorious. I can't wait to see how much better it gets.

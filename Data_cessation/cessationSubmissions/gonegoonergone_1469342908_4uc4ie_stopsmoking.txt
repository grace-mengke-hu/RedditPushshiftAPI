Has anyone quit and still smoke marijuana or hash?

I feel like this question has been asked in this Subreddit but I can't remember what was said and I can't find it either.

I have quit smoking and I'm doing fairly well for now. I have a strong conviction against smoking but not such a strong one for getting high on marijuana or hash.

Does the craving intensify when you smoke up? Has anyone managed to continue to smoke up without smoking cigarettes. So far I've gotten by without drinking or smoking up with my friends. I'm just scared that I'll fall into the 'nothing will happen with just one cigarette' trap. Especially since you have to mix cigarettes to smoke hash and I usually mix some in weed too. 

Should I just quit getting high too? I feel like that'll be an okay life decision as well...

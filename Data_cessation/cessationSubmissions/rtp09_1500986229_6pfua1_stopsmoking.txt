I'm quitting!

After many failed attempts over the past 6 months I have finally decided to quit smoking gradually!
25 years old and work in construction so I'm constantly surrounded by smokers but I'm determined this time!

I'd be very interested in hearing what you think regarding going cold turkey or gradually cutting back and setting targets. I generally smoke about 30 a day but so far today (day 1) I have just had 1 cigarette and 4 x 4mg Nicolette pieces of chewing gum and it's 2pm which is very good!

Look forward to hearing your thoughts

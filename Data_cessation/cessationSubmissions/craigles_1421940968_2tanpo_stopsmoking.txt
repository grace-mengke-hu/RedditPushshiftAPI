Just found this sub, looking for some advice on prepping to quit

First, I'm happy to have found this sub.  I've been wanting to quit smoking for a while now, but I'm nervous about doing it without some sort of support system in place.

I've heard that some prep work can help when quitting; things like trashing lighters and ashtrays, washing all my clothes and cleaning my car to get rid of the smoke smell.  I suppose washing my winter coats, gloves, and scarves would also be helpful.  Does anybody have any other tips for getting ready to quit?  I'd hate to risk failing right off the bat because I left something blatantly obvious somewhere to trigger me.  Thanks in advance!

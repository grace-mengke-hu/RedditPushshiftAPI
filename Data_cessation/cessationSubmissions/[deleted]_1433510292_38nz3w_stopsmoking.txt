Why does phlegm look so much worse once you've quit?

Howdy, currently on my second attempt quitting, the first attempt was last year. Quitting was a lot easier than I had thought, though I fell into those old habits. That won’t happen again. Both times I’ve quit however I have noticed that my phlegm is way more disgusting and black looking, I’m wondering why that is? I’m assuming it has to do with me coughing up all the gross stuff in my lungs, but I don’t understand why it isn’t like that when I’m actually smoking.

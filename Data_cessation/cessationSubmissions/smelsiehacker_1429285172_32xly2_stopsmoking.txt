Day 12-15 tips?

I've read from multiple resources that days 12-15 are really rough. Apparently, the psychological withdrawal is strong at this point, and this is the kind of withdrawal I struggle the most with.  Any tips from others who have experienced a rough time starting at/around day 12? Thanks in advance!

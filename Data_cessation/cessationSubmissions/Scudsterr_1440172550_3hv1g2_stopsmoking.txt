It may be the hardest thing you do

Think about all the addictions people struggle with: whether it is eating unhealthy foods, inactive lifestyle, drinking every night, constantly checking there cell phone or other technological device, video games, harder drugs, coffee, negative thought loops (I smoke cigarettes. I'm hurting myself. My throat hurts. I'm an idiot.  My life sucks. Yesterday sucks. Tomorrow will suck. etc, etc).

Any one of those things is a very difficult task to change, but it is possible.  Cigarettes may be the hardest thing to quit out of any of those things, but once you start accomplishing your goals and see cigarettes in the rearview mirror, you start realizing all the amazing things you can accomplish.  If cigarettes are so difficult to quit, that makes most things easier.

*"If I can quit cigarettes, I can definitely start to lose some weight"*

*"If I can quit cigarettes, I can definitely start eating healthier"*

*"If I can quit cigarettes, maybe I don't have to treat myself like shit anymore"*

Start to realize this fact.  If you can use your mind to beat this incredibly strong addiction, what else can you achieve?

Last thing. Don't be too hard on yourself. Learn from your mistakes, don't flog yourself for them. Good luck.

Day 3. Can't focus on my work. Please help.

Okay, so I'm third day off nicotine. It sucks but I know I won't smoke. The only thing I can't control is this:
I work from home, on my laptop. I have some projects to finish this week, but I just can't focus on them. I'm nearing the end of the day and I'm still struggling with a project I would normally finish in like 4 hours. Hell, I even struggle to write this post in a gramatically pleasent manner. Please advise!

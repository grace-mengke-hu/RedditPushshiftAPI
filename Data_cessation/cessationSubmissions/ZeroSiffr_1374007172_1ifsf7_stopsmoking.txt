3 months without snus. Anyone else managed to quit from it?

Fellow snus users and other people struggling to quit from the oh so fine tobacco plant. It took some iron will and I slipped back for a week during my vacation but I've stayed away from it now for three months. I basically dealt with it by drinking a bit more alcohol (it's within reasonable level) and eating a lot more fruit.

It feels really good now, especially the mouth hygiene.

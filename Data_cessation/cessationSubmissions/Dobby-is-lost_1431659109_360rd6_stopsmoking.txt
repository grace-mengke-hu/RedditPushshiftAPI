Almost done with Allen Carr's book

I posted here a few days ago, and just wanted to let you guys know that I'm roughly 30 pages away from the end of Easyway. I am still a little nervous, but mostly excited to begin my journey and be free! Thank you to those who have offered kind words when I needed to hear them. I will join you very soon in not smoking. Wish me luck!  Once again,  thank you :)

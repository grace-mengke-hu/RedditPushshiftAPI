Today is 365 days I'm smoke free

I started smoking when I was 13, by 16 I was on a pack a day. In my early and late 20s due to a stressful job I was on 8-9 packets a week. I've just turned 34. On January the 4th 2015 I decided to give up and go cold turkey. At 10 pm ( London time) I had my last smoke. The initial 4-6 weeks were brutal and I was awful. To this day I would say I still dream about smoking on a weekly basis. But I've managed to stay strong. I initially put on about 6-7kg. However due to just having such better health I've lost almost all of that or turned it into muscle. The financial benefits have been amazing. My appearance and smell have vastly improved. I haven't contributed too much to this sub but I did get some advice and help in the early stages last year and it was invaluable. If you're in the process of giving up then stick with it. Its so worth it I promise, the upside out weighs the downside dramatically. In fact giving up was horrible but not being a smoker is better. All the best!

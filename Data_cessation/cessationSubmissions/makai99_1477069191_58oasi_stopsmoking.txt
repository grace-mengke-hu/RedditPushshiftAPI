Someone fucking help me

I started smoking when I was 7th grade and I've quit smoking on the 29th of this September. This has been very hard. I tried vaping and that worked okay for a few days until I realized I have a propylene glycol allergy that makes me throat swell.  On top of that my entire fucking family chain smokes daily wherever they are. The cravings are getting intense but I really have to stop. I really can not get my mind of ciggs like I'm always thinking about it . It's unbearable

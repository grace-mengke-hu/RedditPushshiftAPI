Chatix/champix. Is it worth using if I've used it before and had no side effects?

So the first time I tried champix was 3 years ago. I used it for about a 2 or 3 weeks then stopped because I thought it wasn't working and didn't know it started working after the second or third week.
  
Second time I tried champix I used it for about a month but then I went away for work and was drinking everyday and kept smoking so I though it was pointless taking it.
  
Both times I used it I have had zero side effects. No nausea, no vivid dreams or nightmares, nothing.
  
A friend of mine used it for a few weeks and said he was having weird dreams.
  
Though today is the first time I actually looked up people's stories about champix and all I I'm reading is bad bad things. 
  
After reading all these stories it's making me worried. I've tried cold turkey and gave in after 5 days. I tried vaping but it's just not the same.

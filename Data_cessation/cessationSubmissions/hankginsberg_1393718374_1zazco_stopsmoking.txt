37 days in and when does it stop?

The beauty of quitting cigarettes is you never know when they're going to throw curveballs at you. 

For the past week, I've woken up thinking about cigarettes, wanting a cigarette, feeling like I might have smoked but not quite sure. That gunk feeling sits at the back of my throat and says go on. Have one. I thought I was past all this. Thought "hell, it's been five weeks and a breeze this time". I got through the moods, and the aches and the anxiety and thought I was home free.

The other night after going out for a big night I actually had to check with my house mate whether id smoked. And then the craving lasted all day.

But I won't cave. Not this time. 

Good luck everyone else sitting pretty at a month.

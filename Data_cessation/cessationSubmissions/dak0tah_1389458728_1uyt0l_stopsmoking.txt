Breaking the association between smoking pot and craving a cig?

I've been trying to quit smoking cigs for a long time. But I smoke a lot of pot. Often, I get high, and there's a feeling somewhere in me that craves a cig. It's the only time I truely crave one, other times I may want to smoke, but getting stoned actually makes me crave a cig.

Does anyone have any advice? I've heard that fruit cuts cravings, which I've tried, but when I'm in a stoned crave fit, the fruit just satiates my munchies and I still want a cig.

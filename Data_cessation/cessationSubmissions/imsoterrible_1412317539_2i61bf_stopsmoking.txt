So tempted!

I need someone to remind me that I'm a non-smoker.

I was a stay at home dad about 4 years ago and my smoking habit grew from having a couple a week, if that, to a full blown smoker. I just liked stepping outside and getting that short break.

I then went back to work last year and had no problems not smoking. I was busy and it never really crossed my mind during the day at work. I had the odd cigar but nothing like when I stayed home.

Now I'm back to being a stay at home dad and all I can think about it having a smoke. My mind is telling me to just take that 5 minute break and light up. 

I believe it is out of boredom and the new stress of being home again, and I feel like I could fall back into the same pattern as I did 4 years ago and that's something I definitely don't want to happen.

One month in! Blimey!

Okay! Well, I stopped. And I haven't started again. At last, *at last*, I'm taking my health and my life slightly seriously. There have been a couple of casualties on the way, but now, at the 1 month mark, I think I'm starting to deal with them.

Week 1 - enthusiastic, positive, committed. I've found that the first week usually goes pretty well.

Week 2 - harder, but managing. What started getting interesting here was how much self control I *didn't* have in other areas of my life, notably drinking and food. Both intakes started creeping up!

Week 3 - wow. I'm not smoking, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm sane! I'm eating huge amounts, I'm drinking a *lot* and my discipline with money has just flown out the window!

Week 4 - okay, okay. Got to get a grip on this. My weight has shot up--I swear, I *must* have put 7 lbs on--and I'm starting to need to take control again. No more drinking.

Last 3 days ... really committed to running again, and actually turning up at the gym, which I joined two weeks ago. I'm walking/running 5 miles in the morning (to work), doing a little workout at lunchtime, and then walking/running 5 miles home. I'm also cooking my meals at home and taking them into work with me.

Current status: 203 lbs / 5'10" (eek!), but I feel fantastic. I'm sleeping really, really deeply and my mornings are just incredible -- up at 5:00am, leave the house at 6:00am, get to the gym (shower) at 7:00am and chilling out between 7:30am-9:30am (when work starts).

I am NOT: coughing, stinking, burning up time and money. The cough was a huge worry--I thought I had COPD or something, but it has seriously, properly just *vanished*. 

I AM: really enjoying life. I feel confident and much less in the hole of having to worry about where I can duck away for a smoke. It's like a whole new world and the only thing that could make it better would be if I'd done it 10 years ago... :D

The time is now!

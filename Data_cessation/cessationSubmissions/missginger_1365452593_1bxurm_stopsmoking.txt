Things I didn't know I was missing...

I'm just over two weeks in (thank you Allen Carr!), and I've noticed a few things over the last 17 days that I didn't realize I had been missing out on.  There are the obvious things, like the fact that I can climb stairs without losing my breath or go for a run without feeling like I'm actually entering cardiac arrest, but there are so many smaller, beautiful things. My hair still smells clean the day after I washed it. I can see clearly out of my car windows since I've washed all the tar off of them.  And my personal favorite was realized while I was on a date Friday night. I met a guy at a bar at 8:00pm and we stayed and talked until closing time at 2:00am.  During that time, I normally would have smoked about 3 cigarettes (or more, if I had been drinking a lot).  Instead, I got to stay at the table with him, continue the conversation, and not disrupt the flow of the evening.  It was a wonderful date made even more wonderful by my rapidly diminishing nicotine addiction. 

TL;DR - Life is good.

Thanks so much to all of you for your inspiration and advice!

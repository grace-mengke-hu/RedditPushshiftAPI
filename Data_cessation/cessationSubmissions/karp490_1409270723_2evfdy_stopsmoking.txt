Im cheating. Help?

First post here, just subscribed. 
So i have cut down from 30ish a day to one each way on my way to work. But i just cant gather the strength to stop. I went cold turkey for two days, but my hands started shaking. I work with live electricity so this can be dangerous if im not at my A-game. What im asking is how can i kick this habit completely but still be able to function? Every time i stop completely i feel like im putting myself and others around me at risk because i cant control my hands and i might literally kill someone.

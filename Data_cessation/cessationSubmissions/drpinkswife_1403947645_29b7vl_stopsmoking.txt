One Week Today!!!

I feel so much better than I did a week ago today! 
Yes, well I was in hospital, but still. 
Days 2-4, really bad. 
And then it got easier. A little. 

Evenings are the worst. My busy plans seems only to last until evening.
I'm reclaiming my smoking spaces. Sitting outside.
I have a lot of time. All that smoking then recovering from the cigarette takes up a lot of time. 
Thanks everyone for being supportive! 

And you two haters, thank you too. You remind me that there will be people like you out in the real world and you and they won't make me smoke.

Only I will can do that, and I won't, at least not today. 

Now hand me my rose coloured glasses, I'm going to buy a tart pan!

Do I need a cigarette to enjoy myself?

I have been totally smoke free for 1 week now using Champix and Alan Carr's EASYWAY book... honestly I found the past week pretty easy. But tonight I'm going out to a concert and I'm worried if I don't smoke will I actually enjoy the show. The irritating thing is I don't actually want a cigarette right now, but the fear of tonight is making me contemplating buying a pack 'Just in case'. I know that if I buy a pack and just have 1 I will still have 19 in the pack that will get smoked as well!

How did any of you amazing ex-smokers deal with the first time you went out as new non smoker?

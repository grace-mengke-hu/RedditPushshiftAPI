"quit" but can't stop having a cigarette at night

So I'm on my second day and night of no smoking yet I've had a night time cigarette both times. I'm doing okay but I just physically cannot stop having a cigarette at night. I can't settle without the hit, and that's with (very weak relative to my normal intake of cigarettes) patches and gum. Any advice for me? It would be really appreciated

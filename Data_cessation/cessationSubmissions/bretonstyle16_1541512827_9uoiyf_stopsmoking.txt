12 year smoker, 9:30 EST will be my first 24 hour period without a cigarette since I was a teenager (currently 30). Here's to another 24 hours!

Coincidentally I quit on #009 Blastoise day, my original Pokemon that defeated the Elite Four when I played Pokemon Blue!  Looking forward to the Caterpie inspiration.

Another side note, Nicorette and coffee is a surprisingly good combination :)

We can all do this, it sucks but let's get another 24 hours done!

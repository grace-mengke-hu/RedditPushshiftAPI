I fucked it today, but smoking can't keep me down forever.

2 months and 28 days into my quit and I made the conscious decision to buy a pack. I was drinking with friends last night but it didn't happen then. I was practicing what I thought was fantastic self control even though the temptation was there. I woke up this morning, not hung over enough to use it as an excuse, and bought a pack of smokes along with my coffee. I sat on the stairs at home with the unopened pack, fumbling with it in guilt that I had bought it at all. For nearly 45 minutes I told myself "You don't have to open this pack and smoke just because you bought it." And after 45 minutes of attempting to convince myself, I did it anyways.

To reiterate, this was a sober and conscious decision that I made today. I have no excuse, I did this to myself. Tomorrow I will make the sober and conscious decision to wake up and redo this quit. I only have myself to blame, and I will only have myself (and all of you very helpful folk in this community) to thank when I make it another 2 months and 28 days without smoking. Cheers, everybody.

Day Three

Well, I'm into day three of my quit after smoking for 13 years. I gotta say, it's fairly easy so far. First day was the worst, second felt better on the symptoms but.. sneakier about it. I noticed on Day Two my body seemed to wander outside where I used to keep my smokes. Tricks on you, I threw them all out.

I'll let ya'll know how I'm going when I hit a week.

Working on day 2, some observations

My mindset is different this time, I think. Like most of us, I've tried to quit a hundred times, at least. Patches, gum, whatever else I could find never helped. I think I just wasn't ready, maybe, but I'm noticing the cravings are easy to squash this time out. 

More experienced quitters: You think it will get worse before it gets better? I'm already noticing things smell different.

As an aside, holy shit do I love the dreams on the patches. Hell yeah.

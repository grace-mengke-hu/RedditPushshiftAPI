I’m sure this has been asked many times before, but does anyone have any healthy snack recommendations?

I’m 4 days in and am allowing myself to cave into the snack attacks as it’s stopping me from smoking. I’m fully prepared and expecting to pile on a few pounds, but after I get the first week under my belt I’m going to try and stop constantly grazing on chocolate biscuits!
Can anyone recommend some easy, on the go alternatives that have worked for them? Thanks :)

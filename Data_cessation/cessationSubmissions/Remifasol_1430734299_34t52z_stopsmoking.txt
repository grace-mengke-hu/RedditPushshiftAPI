I stopped smoking 6 months ago and here's how I did it

I've been a smoker since 2009, I stopped smoking on November 6th 2014.
 
 

* **Allen Carr's 'EASYWAY to stop smoking' is a classic.** I read it once in 2013 and it helped me stop for one month, but I had it to read it again in November 2014 to really get the meaning and the philosophy behind it. I find that reading it while asking yourself some essential questions ('Why am I smoking?', 'What's making me addicted to the cigarettes?') helps you being more mindful and aware of what your smoking habit really is and how you do not chose to be a smoker.
* **Exercising has helped a lot.** When the craving was horrible, I would just get into a pair of running shoes and go for a run in the nature. It doesn't matter how good your performance is. Doing sports make your lungs work and makes your cravings go away for a few hours afterwards, you'll need this. 
These days I go to the gym 4 times a week and I can easily run a 5K.
* **I read this subreddit, all the time.** And, in general, I read and listened to people who quit smoking/are quitting smoking/want to quit, you get the gist. That definitely made me feel less alone, and although I had read a lot of science, it was very comforting to have a proof that everybody is going through roughly the same withdrawal symptoms. I knew even before I tried that I'd feel a lot better after one month, and I did! That single fact motivated me a lot to go through the first weeks.
* **I failed a lot!** I didn't quit cigarettes overnight, I had to go through a serie of failures until I made it. One year before, I had quit for one month. A few months before, I had quit for one week. And a few days before I was trying almost every day. One week after I successfully quit, I had half a cig! I was a bit drunk and it tasted horrible, but it made me even more confident that i would not be a smoker again.
* **At first I did not tell my family that I quit.** I had found out the previous unsuccessful times that I tried to stop smoking that telling everyone about it was making me very nervous and pressured. This is not right. I chosed to keep it a secret until they realize it. It took about 2 weeks (!) for them to realize but then the hardest part was done and the pressure was small.

 

I accidentally smoked a bit of tobacco for new year's eve when I thought I was smoking pure marijuana. I felt horrible for 3 days and my body was definitely craving tobacco back. This is when I realized the power of Allen Carr's method: Even though my body - and at some point my brain - wanted nicotine badly, I knew and I kept telling myself that I actually didn't want it. Because, that's the point! 

When you're a smoker you believe very strongly that you need cigarettes, but you don't think you're addicted. Or you still believe that, for a reason or another, cigarettes are helpful to you. But it's not, once you realize that it's all about that little motherfucker called nicotine creating that need, infiltrating into your brain to make you believe that you like it; you also realize that it's very easy to quit. We are what we put in our bodies.

 

To this day, I still have cravings every now and then. They are becoming less intense with time but they are still there. I remind myself how much I've achieved and how different I look/am now. That's why it's easy to say 'no' now and that's why I will keep being a non-smoker.

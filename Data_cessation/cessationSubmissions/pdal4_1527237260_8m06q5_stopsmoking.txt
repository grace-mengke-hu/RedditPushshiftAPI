Plan to get dad to change lifestyle

My dad smokes a cigar each night.  He has been smoking since college and is in his early 50s now. I’ve tried to ask why he smokes and his reply has been that it is relaxing.  Whenever I (or anyone in my family) bring up the concept of quitting, he has gotten angry and mad about it. I’m scared not only about his smoking, but also his weight because his father (RIP) had similar habits and also smoked cigars quite frequently .  He had an unexpected heart attack when I was around 5 years old.

I’m very concerned for him because I do not want my dad to suffer the same fate as my grandfather.  I was considering making a bet/contract between me and him to not smoke for the rest of the year (except one cigar on his bday, a birthday present).  I am a very heavy cannabis and ecig user currently in college and I wanted to bet my entire summer wages (~$4000) with him.  I know it would be tough for both of us, but I believe that if he sees that I am committed to this he will be as well.

I’d like to hear some thoughts on whether this plan could work and some activities my dad could do instead of smoking.  He usually will smoke in the backyard and do sudoku when he comes home.

Also would quitting help him lose weight?  He is overweight but doesnt go to a doctor (i believe it is bc he is afraid to have a doctor tell him his health situation).

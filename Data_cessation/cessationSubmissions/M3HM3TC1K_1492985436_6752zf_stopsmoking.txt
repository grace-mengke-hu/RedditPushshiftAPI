10 year smoker quitting

Hi everyone.

I'm a 10 year smoker who's quitting for the second time. First time I started smoking again because I quit thanks to e-cig. The reason I decided to light that smoke after 4 months? Battery of my e-cig was dead and I was at school. I'm so disappointed when I look back. Such a simple stupid reason made me sacrifice all the hard work I put in to quit smoking. Life happens .. I guess.

So I've decided to quit for good this time. The reason? I'm going to join the army (mandatory!) in about a year. I'll have to be fit when I join the army because it's going to be a 1 year hell.

I've picked up my e-cig once again, thrown out all the ashtrays and cigarettes. Also thinking of drinking tea instead of coffee (which makes me want to light up a cig very bad)

Any other tips? What do you do when your mind is telling you to light "just 1 cig" (which will cause you to start smoking again) ?

Thanks for taking the time to read my long ranting.

Good luck everyone.

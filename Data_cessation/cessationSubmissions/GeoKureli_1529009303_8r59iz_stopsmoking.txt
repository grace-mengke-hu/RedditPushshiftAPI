Previously a pack a day smoker, just hit the 1 month mark.

Last time I tried to quit I had no issues for 29 days and relapsed hard on day 30. This time, it was hard from the get-go but I feel like I'm doing better, strangely. I quit on Mother's day, she's pretty happy.

I thought my tough triggers would be stress, drinking, and socializing, these haven't been a problem, once. The real struggles are when I'm just bored. I used to use smoking as a excuse to take a break from heavy social interaction, or to socialize with specific people without dealing with the group as a whole, I found that keeping my old habits works well here; when the smokers go out for a break, I follow and they know it helps me. I still go outside for 5min breathers/walks for work and events (but a lot less now). The real struggle comes with the boredom, smoking was something I do to pass time on long walks (I don't drive), or when I'm waiting for something, I'm still trying figure out a good replacement for that.

Here's where I go from humble brag to straight up boasting, but I truly think I can help others, here. I smoke when bored and when i can't smoke I eat, but so far I've lost 10lbs since I quit. I was told people gain weight when they quit and that seriously prevented me from trying to quit, many times. 2-ish months ago I set out a goal to lose 30 lbs by my 30th birthday, I decided when I reach my half way mark I would quit smoking, and thought mother's day was a good milestone for both. If you're afraid of the weight gain, try laying out a workout/diet goal and timeline, it really helped me.

I don't think I'm entirely out of the woods yet, but I made it farther than I thought I would. Best of luck to all of you who are going through the same struggle. I hope this helps

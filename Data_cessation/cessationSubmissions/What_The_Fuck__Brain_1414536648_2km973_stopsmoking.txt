Strange tingling and uneasy feeling in my legs when I'm trying to sleep at night?? Also, increased levels of flatulence??

Can anyone help me explain this or know what exactly is going on? 

I've been a pack a day smoker for the last five years and have attempted to quit only once or twice before. Iv'e had a couple of weird side effects when I've tried giving up smoking before.

My legs, especially at night when I'm trying to sleep become really restless, tingly and uneasy, they also sweat a lot. Has this something to do with the nicotine leaving my body??? It's really tough, it keeps me up at night and just makes me think about smoking even more. Any solutions??

Also, whats with the upset stomach and increased gas, it's pretty embarrassing and might I just add, the flatulence is absolutely foul. Is this just me or is it an actual know side effect?

Thanks everyone so so much.

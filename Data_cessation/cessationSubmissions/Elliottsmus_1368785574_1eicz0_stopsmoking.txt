Help me!!!!

I quit smoking 5 days ago and things have been going ok just lots of cravings which is usual. I'm in a bad state of mind at the moment after having a huge fight with my gf... Stormed away and bought a pack of smokes and am sitting here just staring at the damn things and I can't help but think it will make everything better!! Help me?! A part of me really doesn't want to smoke but a part of me is desperate to make it all better! Helpppppp!!!

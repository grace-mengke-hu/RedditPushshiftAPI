2 years...

Two years...

Has it really been two years? No quite, but coming up on it.

The thing is, I was a pack and a half smoker for eight years. Eight years might not seems like a long time to some, but to me that was ages 14-22. 

I quit cold turkey with my dad, who was a lifetime smoker of 40+ years. It was not only a commitment to him and a him a commitment to me, but rather something we've both been wanting to do together for a couple of years.

I moved from Louisiana where cigarettes are $4 a pack to $10 a pack. This extra incentive was the extra push I needed.

I don't post here a lot, but I do read pretty much everything here. To everyone just starting out, the beginning is rough. After that, it's smooth sailing. Don't give up. Push through the cravings and accomplish your goals. Sometimes it is even weird for me to think that I was once a smoker. Quitting is no easy task, but is something that is unnecessary.

Good Luck!

Alright guys! December 10th is my quit day. To those who are always debating and struggling (and lurking)... who wants to join?

Pretty simple here - December 10th, I will no longer have another smoke.

I was talking to a buddy of mine and telling him how every night I want to quit, but every morning I don't. He is a former smoker and said a quit date is what I needed. I asked when I should quit and he said December 10th. Why? "Because it's two weeks from today bro. You can digest it, prepare, and be ready for battle then." So thank you, Justin, that's my quit day now.

Two weeks seems like such a long time too. Like why don't I quit tomorrow? (oh yeah, it's night time and that's how I think)

So, for those of you who quit today - in two weeks I want you to respond to my post telling me you made it to week two.

For those of you who are debating quitting - **I want you to respond to this and join me in the quit fest.**

*Edit: I'll even make a list of names to call out those who are starting/continuing and need the support.*

For anyone else - Encouragement and support is always welcome.

So I'll post next Wednesday (December 3rd) as we near our countdown and see what you've done to prepare. We'll share ideas, support each other, and get ready. Then, December 9th, we'll have a mash up of last minute links/advice/whatever.

December 10th is the day.

Who's with me?

**EDIT**: 12 days guys. I'm stoked about how many people we have here.

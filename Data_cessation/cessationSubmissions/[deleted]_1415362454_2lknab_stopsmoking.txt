Day 5 update

It's been a good week, people. I originally planned to do weekly updates but today just felt so good that I had to post.

Some things that have happened since quitting: 

More energy throughout the day - I'm down to just one coffee a day instead of with each meal. Sometimes I don't even need one in the morning.

Bigger appetite - no more skipping meals. Taste still hasn't quite returned to 100% but at least food is satisfying again.

I CAN BREATHE - that permanent cold that comes with smoking? Fuck that.

World is more colorful. Woke up this morning and the sunlight that poured into my room made everything look HD. Smoking put a dull veil over my eyes and now it's clearing up.

Temper is on the fly, but my friends an coworkers cut me some slack because they know I've quit.

That's all for now but I'll be back with more soon, I promise. Keep it up, everyone!

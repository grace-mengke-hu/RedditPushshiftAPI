My partner (30f) is lying to me (30m) about quitting smoking

We are both smokers and after several failed previous attempts to quit, we decided to stop on New Years Day.
We had both been doing really well until my wife went away on business. I could sense almost immediately that she was lying to me when I asked her how things were going and if she was still making good progress. 

My fear is that she has resorted to smoking and is lying to me over the phone in a bid to prevent upset whilst we are apart.

I'm upset a) that she's lying - her responses were nonchalant and vague. And b) she's smoking again after we had planned to start a family this year. We had many upsetting conversations last year about the importance of quitting for our own health and I feel that she is using the business trip to just do whatever she wants without regard for my feelings.

What do I do?!

I am yet another guy who just quit

I had my last cigarette on Labor Day 2011.  I haven't had a single puff since then, and don't care to.  But the thing is I replaced cigarettes with snus, so I had no nicotine withdrawals.  No withdrawals...no longing.  Quitting cigarettes was almost effortless.  I stopped the snus just as suddenly as I stopped cigarettes--completely unplanned. 

 I was just sitting here on Jan 2, dreading having to put on pants (yes) and drive to get more snus.  The best part about not having an addiction is the freedom.  I never have to feel that fucking "duty" to go to the gas station anymore.  And it's one less thing to tote around in my pockets.  The biggest problem is I'm into weightlifting and am trying to get to 10% body fat.  

When am I going to stop wanting to eat to compensate?

Alright guys, today is my day

I've been a smoker on and off (mostly on) for the last 12 or so years. I smok*ed* anywhere from 1-3 packs a day depending on how stressful my life was at that time. I have no idea how I'm going to get through this, while I have had 6 month stints before where I've stopped, I know what I'm in for and that thought kind of terrifies me (terrifies me enough to want a cigarette to calm me down lol). 

Any support you guys can offer especially on how to pass the longest ever 3 minutes during a craving or how to concentrate on something else would be greatly appreciated. Right now I'm trying Allan Carr's Easy Way method. Thanks everyone.

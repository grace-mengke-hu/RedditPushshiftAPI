Soooo......I am literally joining Reddit for this thread. I've tried quitting several times and have failed epically every single one. So this time I've weaned down to about half a pack a day and I downloaded the smoke free app. I set my quit date for Tuesday. Is weaning and waiting just prolonging the inevitable? I don't know. But it seems like the prequit missions the smoke free app is giving are helpful. Like finding this thread.  It's helping me with preparation and the building of my will power. I also downloaded a smoking cessation hypnosis app. Has anyone tried it and can tell me if it has any helpful effect at all? I've been hesitant to use it for some reason. Thank you in advance!

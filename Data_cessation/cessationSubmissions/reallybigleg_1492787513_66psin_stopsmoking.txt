Anyone else quitting with pre-existing panic attacks?

Really just looking for a hand hold today. I was doing very well then started to experience rolling panic attacks yesterday. Just one after another. I felt like I was going to die.

I got through it and did not smoke. 

I just want to know from anyone who had attacks prior to smoking - as I realise some people experience attacks from quitting alone - how this developed with you. How long until the attacks died down, did it worsen the condition for a long time afterwards etc? I just basically want to know how long do you think I will need to go through the attacks before they die back down? I can totally cope with this, but I'm finding it easier to tell myself - it's not forever, it's not forever, this will end etc. I just want to add to that voice, basically! :D

I'm currently on my third day without nicotine and had cut down significantly for the four days leading up to the first day without nicotine.

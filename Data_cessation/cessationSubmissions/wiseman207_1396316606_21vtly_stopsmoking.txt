I have more success getting off nicotine when I approach it from the simplest perspective, so I figured I'd share it for someone.

If you're never going to smoke again, then you've already successfully quit.  If you think about all the time you've been around, you've probably seen dozens of years go by.  Sure, before now things were different, but in the meantime you've been able to see many years, and your memories are far in the past.

If you took a stopwatch, started the timer, and let it run; it would report 400 days next spring.  If you hadn't smoked at all during that time, you'd be looking at that watch as a 400-day non-smoker.  

If you can imagine the difference in life you'd have after being off nicotine for 400 days, and would like it to in-fact-and-truth happen: it's as easy as doing nothing.  

As long as you just don't smoke (which is pretty easy if you don't buy any and refuse offers) it will come to pass, assuming you survive.  From my understanding of the statistics, your odds of doing that are actually better via abstinence than not.  Improved survival rate, free of charge?  It's difficult to beat the math.

Nicotine is a wicked thing, and addiction is rough.  You'll start to win back the black holes of time that revolved around suppressing withdrawal symptoms, through conscious domination.  My coworker once said "it was the hardest thing [he] ever did".  I believe him.

It CAN be done and YOU can do it too! Don't give up on trying. Today I celebrate 5000 days since my last cigarette

today marks a huge milestone for me, I can't believe it has been so long. I smoked for about 15 years and when I decided to quit I wasn't sure I would be able to do it. It took a few tries, I quit and restarted and quit and restarted a few times, But with a determined attitude and support from my friends, here I am today as a testament that it can be done. I feel like if I can do it, so can you. Stay strong, don't give up. Even if you have a bad day of weakness and have a smoke, don't give up on quitting. you got this.

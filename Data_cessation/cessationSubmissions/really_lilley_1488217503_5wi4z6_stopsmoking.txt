All natural vaporizer

Hi there I'm a 27 year old male thats been smoking since I was 18. Ive tried to quit off an on through the time I've smoked but never made it past 6 month. Now is this time I really wanna quit and was thinking about vaporizing. I don't know much about it and am looking for a little guidance. What's a good "set up" or company I can look for without spending a much of money as this is a means to an end? Also was wondering if there is any all natural oils with nicotine as I plan to reduce the nicotine intake over time? I appreciate you're time. Thank you.

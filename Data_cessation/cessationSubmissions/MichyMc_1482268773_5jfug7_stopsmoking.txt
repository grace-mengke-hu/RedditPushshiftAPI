Day 4, for the 15th time, hot damn

I keep getting bursts of restlessness that exacerbates my already latent attention issues to the extreme and it's honestly a lot. I'm also laid low by sinusitis so going outside is a pain nightmare and that leaves me stuck indoors with an inability to focus on anything but too tired to do anything.

The nice thing is I have no desire to smoke the problem away. It's either now or never and I'm picking now. But this restlessness is going to be the death of me.

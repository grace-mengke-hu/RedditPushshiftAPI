So, I'm Looking to Quit.

I've tried a few times over the years to quit smoking, alas, to no success. I think the right time has come though. Towards the end of last year, I lost a fair amount of weight and started eating healthily and I'd like to continue on that path, I don't think smoking fits in with the kind of lifestyle that I want for myself. Furthermore, it occurred to me a while back that I don't actually enjoy smoking and that I haven't done in a long time. It's most definitely a **habit** at the moment and has been for some time. It's holding on to me.

I'm certainly susceptible to habitual behaviour and that's my main problem. It's not just smoking but also other things in life, but at the moment smoking is the most damaging in every aspect. I know that once I get out of this habit for a certain amount of time that I can make it. Therein lies the hard part though. It's not affecting my health at present though I know that if I carry on it will eventually catch up with me. I've been smoking on and off for around 15 years. It used to be occasional but for the last 7 or 8 years it's been a daily part of my life. Now, I want to rid myself of that. I'd like to step up my exercise regime and get really fit and certainly smoking will be a hindrance to that too.

Soo . . . how do I go about this? What tips and advice can those of you who have kicked the habit give me? How do you deal with cravings? Is it better to go cold-turkey or ween yourself off them or use replacement devices? Do you have that 'last' cigarette? Is it better to have a rewards system in place? To track everything?

I'm mostly writing this for myself, to give myself motivation to quit once and for all and maybe garner some virtual support. I'd love to hear some advice on the above and any other matters though.

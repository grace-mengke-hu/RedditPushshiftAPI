18 Months

Hell yes!
Thousands saved, thousands not smoked. 

18konth milestone is surprising (feels like I've been free longer!).  I noticed a strange uptick in thinking about cigarettes recently, that's when I checked calendar. 

THEREFORE: in my experience, I apparently have an 18month review. Will keep this in pocket for the upcoming two year mark. 

Alan Carr's book is life saving.

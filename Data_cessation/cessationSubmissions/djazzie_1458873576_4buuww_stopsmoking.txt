One year smoke-free(ish)

Wow, I can't believe it but 365 days to the letter have gone by and I've been relatively smoke free. 

I say relatively because there're been a couple drunken nights where my self-control hasn't been very good. But all in all, I don't think I've smoked more than 7 cigarettes in the past year. And the last time I slipped up, I felt like shit the next day. Plus my wife chewed me out. 

All in all, I'm feeling pretty good about myself even if I wasn't perfect. I've got a whole other year ahead of me to not smoke, and the rest of my life really. 

I'm not craving them anymore and I've take up jogging as a hobby. That's something I couldn't do very well after 22 years of smoking. 

This sub has been tremendously helpful and supportive. Your personal stories have each inspired me no matter what stage I was in (especially in my pre-quit days when I was in denial that it was possible). 

To anyone who's struggling--hang in there. It gets easier and better. And if you do slip up, don't beat yourself up about it. Just accept it and try harder. Move on. Life's too short to let your flaws get you down. Just keep at it and you'll find your strength one day. And the next day. And the days after that. And pretty soon, you'll realize a lot of time has gone by and you hardly noticed it.

After a pack a day for 7 years

Its time to quit. Today is my 5th day without a cigarette. My partner quit with me on Jan. 2nd and yesterday we dropped damn near $200 on vaping equiptment. It's a life saver. My cravings have been unexpectedly...not bad. Crazy. Im only 23 and cant believe the math. $3000 on cigs for 6 years, maybe half that for the first year. Almost $20,000 on cigarettes. That almost equals my student loans. Im focusing on the savings to help me quit, clearly. Ive noticed this past week I've made a lot of good decisions, like a domino effect. And I've been much more focused on my work vaping at my desk than running out to chainsmoke 2 cigarettes every few hours. We can do this! Sending good vibes to everyone in this group!!!

Day 1 after failing New Year's eve decision

On New Year's eve, and 3 days before that, I was planning on quitting smoking, preparing myself mentally. 

When the clock hit 12 am, I completely quit till the next day. I lasted a good 12 hours before I drowned myself with left over alcohol and passed out. Woke up about 6 hours later and just NEEDED to smoke, but I fought it by munching around. I lasted a good ~48 hours till I just couldn't handle it anymore. 

Today, I'm deciding to try to quit again. I downloaded an app called Smoke Free, and I'm setting my mind to just quit. After I click on 'POST' on this thread, I will set the app to start and just fight it till it becomes easy. 

I have a lot of will power, as I have been lifting for years now. During cutting season, I do Intermittent Fasting, which I eat for an hour and fast for 23. It's so easy to do so. 

But quitting smoking isn't easy, and I know it. I experienced it in the beginning of this year, and I'm glad I have an idea of what's waiting for me in the upcoming days. 

Is there another support community on Reddit that I can check out? A discord server? Anything that I can join to help me. 

Wish me luck please, I need it. And if anyone is starting today, I wish you luck as well.

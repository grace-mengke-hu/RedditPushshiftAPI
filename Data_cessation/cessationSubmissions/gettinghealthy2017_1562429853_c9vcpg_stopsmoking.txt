At 11 months/14 days my puppy died &amp; I almost gave in

This community helped me NOT do it. I did NOT smoke! I am so grateful to everyone who commented on my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/bqtpjl/11_months_14_days_my_4_year_old_puppy_died_of/) telling me not to give in. I am so grateful to the guy in the smoke shop who wouldn't sell me a pack of cigarettes after I told him my story. I admit that I did buy a Blu disposable that I've used but I haven't gone back to it after that single one after his death. 

Thank you all

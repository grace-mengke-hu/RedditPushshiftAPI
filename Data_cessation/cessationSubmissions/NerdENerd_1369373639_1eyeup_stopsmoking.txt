You know what I am starting to find irritating about smokers

I am starting to consider myself a non smoker and some of the things about smokers I am starting to find irritating, but there is one thing in particular that I didn't anticipate. It is the goddam waiting for them everywhere we go. Hanging out with a smoker for the day is just a series of waiting for them to finish a fag. So I think I have to apologise to all the people over the years who waited for me on countless occasions or stood out in the cold while waiting for me to dose up.

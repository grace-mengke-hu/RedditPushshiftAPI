I'm 17 and want to stop smoking

I've been a smoker since the middle of this summer(july maybe?). I usually just smoked when i was with friends but it quickly escalated to when i'm alone and when i have breaks at school. I've tried quitting before but i never lasted more than a day. 

I need help to quit smoking before it's too late and i'm addicted for life. The thing is a lot of my friends smokes , so when i'm with them my temptation gets the best of me and i start smoking again. I can't ditch my friends just because they smoke because they are good friends and i like hanging out with them. I don't know why i'm writing here i guess i'm just lost and need someplace to vent/get some help. I just noticed that since i started smoking i'm not as healthy as i was and i don't really like myself anymore. So as i said , i'm just here to get some help , so please help me

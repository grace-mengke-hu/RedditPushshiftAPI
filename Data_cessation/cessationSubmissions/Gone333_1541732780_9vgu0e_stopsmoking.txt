How long do you need to take Chantix?

My sad has smoked for 40 years and wants to quit smoking. His insurance wont cover the prescription but i know that there is a savings program. It looks like the cost would be around $200 for 52 tablets of .5mg. Im assuming this is a months supply? 

I want to pay for the Chantix for him because he is unable to do so. How much money will i be spending entirely? I hear some people only take it for a couple months. Thanks.

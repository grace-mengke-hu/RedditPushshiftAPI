[20] M - Quitting. Day 1. Reasons and rants.

So today is day one. I'm 20 years old, had been smoking for since I was 12, and smoked just about a pack of cigarettes per day. 

The past couple of months, I got really angry with myself for being a smoker. I can't be mad at my peers who encouraged me to smoke cigarettes at a young age - I have only myself to blame.



**Why I want to quit:**

* Makes my clothing, car, and breath smell bad.

* Is fucking expensive. Marb reds are $9 a pack here in VT - and only going to go up!!

* My lungs are black. I'd like them to be pink again. Oh and I have asthma. 

* Some one kissed me and said it was "like licking an ash tray".

* Smoking gives your wrinkles! So not into that...

* Not trying to die a slow painful death. Also those NYC no smoking ads have scared the crap out of me.

* Is holding me back physically. I'd like to go for a hike, run, or swim without feeling like my lungs are going to explode. Also trying to get fit and it's next to impossible if I continued smoking.

* I want to quit for myself, but I know how incredibly happy my mother and father would be if I quit.

The last time I quit was for one month. It took me about two weeks to get over the hardcore cravings, and then it was pretty easy. Was at work - got a phone call from my dad saying that my Aunt (god mother) had died and I just unraveled. Before I knew it, I was huffing down my co-workers cigarettes and not giving a single fuck about my relapse. This will be my second REAL attempt at quitting. I have tried tons of times with no success. YES - I am going to be a raging C word, and I'm going feel like absolute crap - but it's just time. This might sound weird, but I feel like I can't move forward with my life until I quit. It's holding me back in so many ways. 


For the first two weeks I plan on posting to this sub daily. Then I'll slow it down a little. Wish me luck guys!

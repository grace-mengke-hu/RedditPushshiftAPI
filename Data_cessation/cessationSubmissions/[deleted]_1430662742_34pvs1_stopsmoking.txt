Help Me Help My Husband

Maybe someone here can explain this to me or help me find ways to help. My husband has made it clear he wants to quit smoking. Ok, I'm nothing but supportive (been down that road myself). However, I've noticed a pattern. The first day he's ALWAYS sick. He says it's not just him being irritable and craving nicotine. He'll deny he's struggling without smokes but he just "doesn't feel good" that day. Whether it's sinuses or stomach problems or anything in between. He's always suffering some ailment on the first day so he'll use that as an excuse to go buy a pack. I've tried to bring this up as delicately as possible but he just got offended. He refuses to read Allen Carr even though it worked for me. It just doesn't seem he wants it bad enough, and he keeps trying and I try to help him but he acts like I don't know what I'm talking about. It's like he doesn't *want* to feel better. Then when he caves and smokes, suddenly everything's so clear and he realizes what an ass he was being and everything just makes sense! But then he won't learn from any of that and just keeps repeating this pattern and I really don't know what I can do for him anymore. I tell him books, exercises, activities, foods, drinks, mentality that helped me and he won't even TRY. It's kind of insulting. He's too good for my advice or something. I don't know. I'm getting really frustrated with these one day failures and he's in the shittiest mood and the biggest baby and he just refuses to be positive so I tell him maybe he's not ready but he insists he's ready but he doesn't want to put in ANY effort and the slightest discomfort is just absolute torture to him.

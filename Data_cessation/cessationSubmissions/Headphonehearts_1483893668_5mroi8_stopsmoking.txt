One week in, but I'm in tears.

Has anybody else experienced fairly bad bouts of depression while quitting cold turkey? I'm at the point where I'm bursting into tears over absolutely nothing, I can barely make myself get out of bed, and I'm just so overwhelmed by the simplest of tasks. I've suffered from depression and anxiety for a few years but this definitely has been exacerbated since quitting. Any advice?

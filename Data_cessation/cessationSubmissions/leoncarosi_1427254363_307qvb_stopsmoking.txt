Coming up on 1,000 days?!? That can't be right!

It seems not that long ago that I was on break at work, mid-cigarette, when I decided that I was tired of feeling like garbage all the time. Tired of coughing. Tired of not being more active. Tired of it all.

So I quit, right then and there. Told myself I was a non-smoker from that moment on. I came here for a few days/weeks afterward, looking at my badge, reading other peoples' stories, trying to offer motivation when I could, eating up motivation when I needed it.

This subreddit is a great place. I'm sure that the people who were here 1,000 days ago are mostly shuffled out for a new crowd now, but that's kind of the beauty of it. They were all in your positions at that point, and now, many if not most of them have lived nearly three years smoke-free.

It can be done. And, who knows, with a little willpower, maybe you'll be the wise old-timer stopping by to say hi three years from now.

Stay strong, friends. The power is yours.

I'm feeling excellent. I went to my friends house which was a place I would usually drink and smoke, which gave me a LOT of anxiety beforehand. I went anyways and worked through my anxiety and cravings by playing with our puppies and thinking about reasons why I didn't want/need a cigarette. 


This morning I woke up feeling proud, but I also recognized that yesterday before I went to my friends I was a little irritable. I know that it is part of quitting, but I don't feel like that should be a justifiable excuse for my irritability. How do you guys get that under control so you don't hurt your loved ones in the process?

178 days smoke free!

Ashamedly, I haven't logged in for a while due to being very busy with a project, but it was really cool to log in this morning and see that I've been smoke free for 178 days.  It's amazing how time flies when you get past the initial desire to smoke.  I've spent days where I haven't even thought about smoking.  Sure, I've seen my fair share of strong cravings (even up until last week), but those cravings vanish so quickly now.

It doesn't matter if you are on Day #1 or Day #178, you CAN quit smoking.  Don't give up.  It's such a rewarding feeling to know that my body is healing from 15 years of abuse.  

I also checked my Stop Smoking app for some interesting stats:

Cigarettes Not Smoked: 2,660

Life Hours Regained:  1,064

Savings So Far:  $997 (but I know it is much more than that since I would buy 2 packs of cigs for 1 night of binge drinking)

Who is going to join me today in not smoking?

I'll also make a pledge to remain a more active member of this community.  My apologies for not checking in for the past few months.

Help..

I'm a college dropout, dropped out of my college of choice.. :( well I'm scared and nerved out shitless, I just relapsed and feel like shit.. This shit is like heroin or something. I'm lazy as fuck, kinda lonely, constantly thinking about the bad auschwitz like trip that happened 2 years ago like it happened yesterday. My grandma and grandfather died, my father"s brother has been mentally ill and a severe caffeine/nicotine addict adding fear in our lives . I've failed both one year of high scool and now one year of mathematics college. Most of people that contact me it's about weed. I think weed sucked bunch of my motivation and fucked up bunch of my quit attempts.  I can only sense real happiness when chanting Hare Krishna but when coming in contact with devotees I can't help but to think even when we try to approach God people just kinda want to suck money of from that. Not everyone, there are some beautiful people that I see are very stable, nice and clean for many years in the temple but in the end it seems like people just focus on the money. Now I don't know. My parents have been telling me to find a job every day but I don't feel yet sane to find one. My first job summer 2017 was a hellish experience and I'm fucking scared..(mother and boss told me it was easy, other people on the sea told me it's only job they wouldn't work lol) I still want to pursue mathematics, physics and music even though I feel like complete shit. It's like I just got out of fucking school that stole half of my life and most of the time I'm in weed haze or withdrawals from weed, cigarettes and life itself. When I'm free it's rare but when all withdrawals and drug use passes I feel free, but eventually I end up craving money, friendships and weed and I find myself in a rollercoaster of slight mental illnesses and distance from love, work, knowledge, communication and service.. And what's funny I can live on like 3-4 cigs a day but yet it has such a strong pull..

170 days... $2,550 saved.

Huh.

Edit/Update for the questions: 
1) Feels weird. I don't have $2,550 sitting in savings or anything. Can't for a few reasons right now. Got a new bedroom set, though. New mattress sleeps nice.
2) I was at 2 packs a day for the last couple years. Stress, man. Stress.
3) Arizona prices - 2 packs for $15-ish last time I bought any. They're $8.50/pack or 2 for $15. I was too lazy to drive to the Navajo reservation to buy cartons for $55.

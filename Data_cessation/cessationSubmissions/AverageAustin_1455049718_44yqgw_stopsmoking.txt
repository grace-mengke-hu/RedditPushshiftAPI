how to resist smoking coming to/from work?

I relapsed (have yet to change my days, will do that when I get home) and it's because the drives to and from work kill me and it's just so customary for me to have a cig. It's the only thing I look to in the morning going to work and the only thing that really makes work less miserable. Any advice ditching this belief will help a lot.

Surprising success (so far) with the patch

I want to share some notes from the field on our quitting history (why we've failed in the past) and how different this quit has felt so far with the right mindset, the right prep, and the assistance of NRT in the form of gum and patches. I haven't seen many post on here about the patch in particular, and so I wanted to tell you about our experience so far.  


Tl;dr: the gum+patch combo have been working really, really well for us  


**HISTORY**  


My husband and I have quit smoking and started again five times in the six years we've known each other. We've even had one successful quit that lasted for over a year! And then, summer of 2017 when I was away for a conference and had a terrible day of travel, and a lonely, rainy first night at the shitty dorms we were housed in, I caved and bought a pack, and within a month, we were back to our previous habit.  


We tried to quit last year in September, and failed almost immediately, and for all of the same reasons we've always failed in the past--our withdrawal symptoms were *devastating*. He (literally the kindest, most patient man I know) gets short tempered, cold and snappish. He gets SUPER annoyed with me, in particular, for trying to be helpful or kind, because it makes him feel like an even bigger ass, and in that headspace, what would normally be guilt turns into resentment. On my end, withdrawal makes me the thinnest skinned, most easily hurt, quickest to cry version of myself. And so, historically, the first several weeks have been a tortuous cycle of resentment, irritation, and deeply hurt feelings.   


And so, when he finally caved and said the timing wasn't right and he wanted to buy some smokes and try again in a few months, I practically begged him to go to the store right then and get them. I just wanted the emotional roller coaster to be *over.*  


After this last (ultimately failed) attempt in September, I broke down and told my husband that I could only do this one more time--this cycle that really leaves a bruise on our otherwise stellar relationship is not a thing that I want to invite into our lives, and so the next time we quit, we're going to do it right--we're going to plan, we're going to wait until we are both READY and WANT to quit, and we are going to actually use the tools we have available to us for free through my insurance (NRT). We both made a commitment to actively looking for ways to make the next quit feel easier in whatever ways we could.  


**CURRENT QUIT**  


We are currently **sixteen days since our last cigarette!** This is officially the longest either of us have gone without smoking since summer of 2017. For us, the primary goal was to stop smoking cigarettes as an immediate priority. Our plan was to break the smoking habit first, and then wean off the nicotine over the course of two months.   


**The patch:** We found out that we could get NRT through our state's quit line for free, and so ordered gum and 14mg patches a couple of weeks before our planned quit date (end of the first week in Jan--whatever day we ran out that week. No new purchases allowed.)   


My doctor was a little wary about the patch, and told me straight up that there is no scientific evidence that they work (well, no shit--there's basically no conclusive scientific evidence that ANY one thing works, as the rates of relapse over time are so incredibly high).  


My experience so far has been that with the steady levels of nicotine, and without any withdrawal symptoms to remind me about cigarettes, I just *don't think about them*. I am shocked by how little I think about them, and how little nostalgia I'm feeling for smoking. The emotional weight of the quit seems to just be...nonexistent. So far, I am **much preferring the patch to any other form of NRT I've ever tried** (and frankly, I've tried them all).  


**Gum:** We've also been using 4mg gum occasionally, especially in situations that were our biggest smoking triggers (like long drives). My husband commutes an hour and a half each way to work, and has found chewing a piece of gum on the way there and the way back to be really helpful when it comes to not nurturing resentment that he "can't" smoke.  


Nicotine gum was also the tool I used for a previous relatively successful quit of my own (2012-2013 whoop whoop!), so I trusted it as a tool.  


We have experienced no withdrawal symptoms since we quit. None. Even the desire for a cigarette has been super easy to just...ignore, rather than fixate on. Neither of us have even gotten to the point where we were fighting the urge to buy a pack. I've had a really easy time recognizing that when I want to smoke, I am actually just bored 99% of the time, and so I just do *something* instead, like put in a load of laundry, or make a to-do list for the rest of my day.  


**Greatest Success:** This past weekend, we traveled a couple of hours for his company's employee appreciation party. This involved stressful driving conditions, interacting socially with people I don't know well, and several hours of bar hopping. We also (due to the drinking--we are out of PRACTICE) ended up getting into some stupid late night drama in our hotel room that basically boiled down to an incredibly petty and actually sort of silly misunderstanding. Too drunk. Should have gone to bed.   


BUT!! At no point did we even TALK about wanting to go buy cigarettes. We had motive. We had opportunity. And it didn't even come up. All of these circumstances would normally be *intense* triggers for us. The next morning, we did have a gloat over how proud we were of ourselves, and how pleased we were that we didn't do something stupid like get drunk enough to forget how much he doesn't want his coworkers to know that he EVER smoked, let alone does currently (we've both been ashamed of our shared habit for a while now).  


**TAKEAWAYS**  


Here are the things that have made this quit feel so different than other attempts in the past:

* We were actually really sick of smoking, and had talked for weeks leading up to our quit about how much we didn't want to be smokers any more. We made sure to verbalize our discontent with it, how much money we were wasting, and how gross it made us feel. This was really important for having the right mindset going in--we didn't feel like we were giving something up so much as we felt like we were making a choice to grow the fu\*k up and be the people we are trying to be. 
* We planned ahead, and ordered our NRT weeks in advance so that it was ready to go when we were. (only the first boxes were from our quit line--we now have prescriptions and are getting it for free through my insurance). Researching options to get the gum and patches for free was also a good idea, as it made quitting not a financial investment, but a financial break
* We've celebrated small milestones. On Monday, our two week quit anniversary, I made us a fancy dinner with champagne and small presents.
* We tried the patch! I am honestly still shocked on a daily basis about what a difference this one choice seems to have made. Steady nicotine levels seem to be a much better fit for us than "dose as needed" NRT (which still means you have to consciously acknowledge and respond to cravings)  


Of course, these things are as YMMV as they come. I definitely believe our mindset was healthier going into this quit than its ever been in the past, but I don't want to discount how much the NRT tools we've used have helped us to get through these first two weeks. I know it's too early to call it, and I know that the road ahead will still be filled with surprising and frustrating roadbumps and days that feel harder than we expected, but right now?  


This is the easiest, most comfortable experience I have had with quitting EVER, and also the most confident either of us have ever felt that this is something we can and will stick to for the rest of our lives. I am optimistic about our future as non-smokers, and this is the first time I've ever said that and *meant it.*

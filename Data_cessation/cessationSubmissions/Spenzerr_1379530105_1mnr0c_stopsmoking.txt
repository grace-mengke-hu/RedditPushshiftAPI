If you haven't had bronchitis yet it's a good reason to quit

So I've been laying in bed either sleeping or coughing and hacking like I'm dying of the plague every 5 hours all because of bronchitis and cigarettes. Bronchitis  happens when your airways get a viral infection and guess what, smoking increases your chances of getting it. I haven't really had a reason to quit seeing as I'm still a 20 something male in good enough shape. But after losing 6 pounds in 2 days wasting those days off I had from work and calling in sick today I think these deaths sticks really aren't what I need anymore.

Day 14, I can do this!

Hi guys, everything is going quite well, I almost smoked a cigarette last sunday, but instead I lit it up and just watched it burn. Was a pretty great feeling and a friend said he is proud of me. I experience some withdrawal symptoms like being a bit sad and stuff like this, and I also have mood swings because I didn't smoke any bud the whole time too. Some of my friends tried to discredit me by saying:" Uh, you didn't even smoke for a whole year, no wonder it's so easy for you." Um, well it isn't! I crave cigarettes and weed often but I remind myself often why I do this and that it is good for me. Now, I will go cook a little meal for me and my mother and I will fucking enjoy it! FUCK YEAH, We can do this!

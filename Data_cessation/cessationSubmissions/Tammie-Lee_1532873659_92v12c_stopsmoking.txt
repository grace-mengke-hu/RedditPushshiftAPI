Really struggling

I’m on day 77 today. I realize now that I am not a non smoker. I don’t smoke - I haven’t had one in 77 days but my brain is thinking of smoking and keeps telling me that I miss it. I could easily light one up right now but the guilt that would ensue would be overwhelming. 
For now I don’t smoke. But I can’t wait to actually feel like a non smoker. I hope that happens sooner than later.

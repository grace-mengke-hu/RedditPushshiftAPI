What a crazy 10 days

This past 10 days has been insane.  So much has happened since I quit.  10 days ago, I quit smoking weed and cigarettes.  5 Days ago I got a $5,000 annual raise.  4 Days ago I re-enrolled in college to finish my degree. 3 days ago I had my first date in over 5 years. 1 day ago I was told that I'm being heavily considered for a promotion.  
  
I know this isn't all because I quit cigarettes and weed ( well, maybe the date ) but I feel like deciding to do so suddenly gave me motivation for the others areas of my life.  
  
My body doesn't really demand a cigarette anymore, but I still have the mental associations.  That'll probably take another few weeks to get over I think.  I'm still afraid to drink beer because it has such a strong association with cigarettes.  Coffee brings on a craving too sadly, and I love coffee.  I've been able to see my smoking friends again without asking for one.  Can't spend too much time around though, it gets harder the longer I'm with them.  
  
Overall, the past 10 days has been marked by triumph, and I've never felt more proud of myself.  I've always had self-esteem issues, but it's getting easier to believe in myself with each passing day.

Don't listen to alcohol's call

Just relapsed after 10 days clean and smoked a cig after having a few drinks. The urge was too strong. And you know how satisfacting that was?

ZERO. NADA. NIENTE.

Resist to alcohol's call. I was mostly a social/drinking smoker and I know how tough that is, but IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
I learned that now. Not gonna fall for that again.

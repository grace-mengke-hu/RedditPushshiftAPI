How to quit with other smokers in the house?

I've been a smoker for about eight years. About four years ago, I quit once for an entire year and then bummed one at a funeral and quickly relapsed into my pack-a-day habit. Fast forward to now, California has passed a tax on cigarettes and I've decided I don't wanna keep blowing all my cash on a habit that's going to eventually kill me, so I'm quitting again. Cold turkey. The problem now is, I live with my parents and my dad has been a heavy smoker for about thirty-something years. Just like it was in my life, it is entwined in pretty much everything he does. I have been quit for only four days now, but I find myself struggling because my dad is constantly smoking around me and/or offering. Even though I reject the offers, it feels almost like he wants me to keep smoking. I don't want to avoid my dad, but I don't see how else to prevent myself from relapsing. How do I resist when I'm exposed to the trigger every day?

Only 8 hours in, already struggling pretty hard

I've been smoking about a pack a day since I was 15 (I'm 20 now). Never put an honest effort into quitting before, would always swear them off the night before and wake up reaching for a cig without much thought besides "maybe tomorrow". This is the first time I've ever really wanted to quit. 

I ended up staying up until around 4 am, going through this sub and watched the alan carr video. Had 4 packs left in a carton, so I opened them all up and broke them in half (after having one last cig of course). Woke up about an hour ago, and usually the first thing I do is reach for a cigarette. It's only been 8 hours and I've almost caved twice. I'm able to snap myself out of it, but I'm scared for when I get to work. I work with food, and Fridays are super busy. Plus I have a closing shift which are the worst. I really need some advice and motivation, I have close to no will power. 

Also, does smoking weed the first couple weeks help the cravings?

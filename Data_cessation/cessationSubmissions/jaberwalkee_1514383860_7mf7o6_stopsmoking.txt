Given up, and not in a good way

I actually created a Reddit account just for this sub. I hate smoking .You know what my kid said to me when I tried to wave away the smoke when she came outside? "I'm getting used to it, mom" 

I quit for 5 years, and then I lost my first kid. I deserve it, I said.  Then I quit for another 2 years. I can handle it, I said. 9 months here, 3 months there. 2 years ago, I quit 4 times in a single year, anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months at a time. Hypnosis, Chantix, eating, sunflower seeds, the wrist rubber band, blah blah. 

Now, I have just stopped trying to quit. Please, share your successes? I need to get my mojo back :(

Over 1 Year!

It has been I year and 1.5 months since I quit. This subreddit helped me so much in the early months. Thank you everyone! 

Now I am in the place where I barely ever think about smoking. Even if I do think about it, the thought is fleeting and doesn't hold any weight. I'd never go back to smoking. 

Keep going everyone!

It's over 4000 cigs I havent smoked and over 1300 dollars not spent on something that was killing me and enslaving me. 

Not smoking is real freedom. 

Keep rocking everyone. Blessings and love

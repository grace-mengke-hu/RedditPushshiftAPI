Smoking, concentration and memory

I have been contemplating quitting smoking for a while. The most I've been without a cigarette is 3 months before I caved in. Now, I don't mind the cravings, but I feel like even when the withdrawal symptoms fade away after a few weeks, I'm not able to memorize things and concentrate quite as much as when I used to be a smoker.

I intend on quitting anyways, but I would have liked to have some feedback from ex-smokers and if/how they have dealt with this. If someone knows a bit more on the science behind this, I'd be interested too. I feel like as a very type A kind of person, I can't really afford to have my concentration and memory decrease but evidently, the health/money aspect clearly outweighs this regardless. Just curious to have some insight!

I've just hit the one week mark!

So I read Allen carr's easyway, worked well and quit smoking a week ago.

But today has been the hardest :-( most of the other days were easy. Money, change of jobs soon, co workers smoking... These things put the pressure on me and I questioned if i should stay stopped? Second hand smoke didn't help either.

Anyone else find the one week mark hard? It's so annoying, i was doing really well and happy. Still, I'm proud that I didn't smoke and I won't. It's just an addiction. But the thinking about smoking gets tiring. Even though it's from a positive way.

A huge thing that helped: Noticing how other smokers would have one after the other after the other... 
There truly is no 'one smoke'. It's a million or none. That helped.

EDIT:  Wow, title fail - Posted here on day 7 just to be silly.  Now it's day 36, and I'm still smoke free!

25 years in, 2 packs a day, just quit cold turkey after reading The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr.  Crazy that a book would get to me, and I thought it was a dumb idea to even try.  Just made me realize how stupid smoking is.

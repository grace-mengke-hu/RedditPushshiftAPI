Just smoked my first cigarette in a month

I feel fucking gross about it. I don't know what to do. I'm literally scared. I feel weak for succumbing to the cravings. I'm disappointed in myself. Don't even know why I'm posting this. Just feel like I need to vent it out I guess. Fuck. How do I even do this?

2 years without a cigarette!

On this day two years ago my then-boyfriend gave me an ultimatum: either I quit smoking or I had to go skydiving with him. As you can see, I chose to quit smoking. (It's dumb but it worked, I'm terrified of heights and he knew it.)

Quitting was one of the hardest things I've ever done but also one of the most rewarding. In two years a lot has changed in my life. I've gotten engaged to said then-boyfriend, gone back to school, bought a house and perhaps most importantly, regained my freedom. I no longer spend every moment anticipating the next opportunity to step outside for a smoke, which in turn has made me a much more productive person. I can now proudly say I'm an ex-smoker. 

Keep pushing forward guys, you can absolutely do it!

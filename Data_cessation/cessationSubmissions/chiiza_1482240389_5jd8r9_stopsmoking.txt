Third time trying to quit- 3rd day in.

And I feel just awful. No cravings or anything, actually I just feel sick. My chest is heavy, I have such a head ache, I think I have the flu.. I don''t know if these are withdrawal symptoms but It's helping with my cravings.

I also stopped drinking, since it was starting to become more of a problem then a social and enjoyable thing. I'm tired of what I've let myself become. I'm 29, and I have just started to turn my life around. I don't care if NYE is coming up, and I don't care if I don't drink or smoke at the party I'm hosting. Why was i mentally trying to delay my quit date for some stupid party..

I'm so glad I did this now, my body was screaming at me to stop. I guess after 15 years, I finally listened.


Thanks for listening.

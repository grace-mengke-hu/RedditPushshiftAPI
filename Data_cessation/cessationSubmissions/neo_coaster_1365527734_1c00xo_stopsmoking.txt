30 fucking days and i feel awesome!!!!

its been thirty days already. 

after two weeks quit i joined a gym with all the money i've saved from not smoking.

 i'm currently running 7 miles a day, two in the morning when i get off work and 5 in the evening when i wake up. 

4 weeks ago i could barely walk up a flight of stairs without feeling a little winded.

 fuck yeah. 

good luck to anyone else out there who is trying to quit. 

its worth it.

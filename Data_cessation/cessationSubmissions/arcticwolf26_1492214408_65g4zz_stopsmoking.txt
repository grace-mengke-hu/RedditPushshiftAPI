Tired and foggy head?

Hey everyone! I'm working my way through day 5. I can say the cravings haven't been nearly as bad as I thought but I'm really struggling with having a "foggy head" and being super tired by 8 pm. Did this happen for any of you? How long did it last?

I was ~1 pack a day smoker for the last 9 years.

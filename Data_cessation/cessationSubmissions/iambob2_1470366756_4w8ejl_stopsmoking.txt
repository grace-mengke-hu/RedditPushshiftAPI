"non-smokers have bad days too" - thank you to whoever (re?)posted this here. day 10 and going strong!

using nicotine patches, in case that is relevant. 

i think the most immediate benefit is that i don't just randomly stand up and walk outside because i started cooking something or because i'm about to go somewhere or i just got back from somewhere. 

i subscribed to this sub for several months and read allen carr's book a few years ago before taking quitting seriously. it's nice to know there are others going through similar struggles.  

keep on keepin on!

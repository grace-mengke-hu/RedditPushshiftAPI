Dead and Co, stressed out

Hey y’all! I’m 10 days in and today has been the hardest so far. Easily. I’m at the Dead and Co show in Camden and it has been utmost stressful until this very point, where I’m finally sitting with a drink and listening to the groovin. Surrounded by smokers who are more than willing to hand one over. But I’m 10 days in, and I don’t want it to go to waste. Reminding myself that despite the stress, I don’t need it! Happy jamming y’all ~

I just did something very strange

Going on almost 36 hours without smoking and I had the sudden crave not for a smoke - but for ice cream. This was really strange because I worked at coldstone for 2 years in highschool and now I hate ice cream. I drove all the way to Walmart to get ice cream at 8:30pm. Pretty strange shit going on.

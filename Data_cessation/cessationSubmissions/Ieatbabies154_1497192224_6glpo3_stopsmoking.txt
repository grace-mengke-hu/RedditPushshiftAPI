Nothing post worthy about day 108, but feeling proud of myself for coming this far.

This is my second time ever making it to this day, and I'm closing the gap for my personal record. I've been trying to quit since my first puff, and I really think this time I did it, last time I wound up caving was because I thought cigarettes would cure my stress, I was wrong, I know that now, and I'm man enough to learn from my mistakes. 

To be honest sometimes I'm jealous of smokers, there were times I truly enjoyed puffing away, but I know the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits.  Its weird not being able to stand someone smoking right next to me, and suddenly being able to smell who's a smoker and who's not. Anyway thanks for reading my random thoughts at day 108, wishing you all the best of luck, P.S. I quit using the cold turkey method/best method

1 YEAR! A whole year!

Even though I was on the verge of giving up in the initial months, seeing a post like this one, made me not do it. I didn't really believe I could quit, but here I am exactly one year later, having my morning coffee, completely smoke free. The bad smell is gone from me/my car/my home; I breathe easily, I feel better than ever, I don't feel like I'm gonna die after going up stairs, my breath is not constantly bad anymore.

So for those of you that are in the same position I was a couple of months ago: *Don't give up! Not smoking is amazing!*

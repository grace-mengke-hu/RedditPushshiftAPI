Anyone else triggered by Father's Day?

 I've managed to get almost all the way through it, but it's been a doozy. I have bad childhood history, left home at 16, and don't much like the holiday. Today I kind of realized my "fatherless" status makes me one of those people everyone expects to have damaged relationships and nothing stable or reasonable. It's true I've had some very toxic ones and can't seem to choose wisely.

I don't know what I am going to do about this. If therapy hasn't fixed it yet, I don't think it will get fixed. I'm mad/sad because it was my job to teach my own child how men and women interact in healthful ways, how they love. And I can't.

But I'm not smoking. I guess that's all that matters right now.

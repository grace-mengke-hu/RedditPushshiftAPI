Help.

I've heard many a story from ex-smokers, "you have to want to quit for yourself." My problem is this. I know how bad it is for me, how much money I'm wasting, my bf hates it. I know I and my car reek. My habit affects almost every part of my day-to-day life. But do I really WANT to quit? I don't think I do.

It's a constant fight with myself. I know all the repercussions but I genuinely enjoy smoking. I'm at my happiest when I'm sitting on my porch with a good book, cup of coffee, and a cigarette. I am and have always been a highly anxious and shy person. Not only does a cig chill me out, but I've opened up a lot going out to smoke and making small talk with others doing the same. I rarely drink, smoke weed occasionally, don't really have any other "vices". But yet I know I NEED to quit. That it's best for me and my future. 

Has anyone else had this kind of experience quitting? Where you don't really WANT to but know you should? How were you successful? It gets me down because I feel like I don't have enough willpower and would rather allow myself to basically kill myself than to suck it up and quit. I almost feel like damn, I don't even have enough love and respect for my own self to do what's best for my health!

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I have used the vapor ecigs and really liked them, but it's still hard for me to not mix in "real" cigs. I'm going to up the nicotine level in the next bottle of juice I get, am hoping that will help. I'm smoking right around a pack a day, been a smoker 10+ years and I'm only 27.

I dreamed of smoking

I am 28 days smoke free and yesterday night i smoked in my dream it felt like real. Is this normal what does it signifies for my addiction.
 In these 28 days my friends offered me to smoke 3-4 times and when i declined their offer they use to smoke standing near me. Do i have to stop this thing also?

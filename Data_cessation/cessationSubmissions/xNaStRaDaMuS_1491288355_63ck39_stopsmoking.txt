Cigarettes Were The Best Part Of My Life

I started smoking in 2014. Nothing crazy, I was a teenager with no money so I smoked Swishers now and then, once a week or so.

I started smoking black and milds and swishers once a day around last February. 

September I graduated to cigarettes and fell in love. The Buzz they gave me and to my body it just made me forget everything for 5 minutes. This became the favorite part of my day, where I was just totally satisfied even though I'm a depressed trainwreck. I enjoyed it for 3 months. Now I smoke half a pack/pack a day and have since December. I no longer get a buzz but everytime I hope there will be one but it is no longer there. So I am quitting. I no longer love cigarettes, it's now just a lie and an empty promise. 

Oh and also. FREEDOM. Now I no longer need to be a fucking addicted slave to tobacco. On my mind 24/7 whens my next hit coming from like a methhead.

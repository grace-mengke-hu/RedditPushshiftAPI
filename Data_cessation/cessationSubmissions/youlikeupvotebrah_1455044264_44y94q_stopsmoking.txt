What the hell...

The last few days have been really hard. The sun just came out but it's still cool in the morning. For some reason sun on my face with a cool breeze at 8:30 am makes me crave a cigarette. I find myself relishing the idea of smoking and almost fantasizing about smoking again. It's been so long since I've smoked what's the deal?

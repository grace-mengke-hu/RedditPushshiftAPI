Just before the year door 2014 closed

In the beginning of 2014 one of my thoughts was to quite smoking finally after 22 years of smoking. I trieed it one or two times that year but it never worked out. Since december 12th I m abroad on vacation for a cupple of weeks. My plan was to smoke until all cigs are gone and on december 16th 20 o clock I had that last smoke.

Now I am free from this bad behaviour for more then 2 weeks, smoking  is finally banished behind the 2014 door and i feel so much better.

Thanks to all of you who supported me also a lot with your comments here. 
Have a great 2015!

Getting tough but not over

Good morning everyone, I hope you made it smoothly through the weekend. It was exceptionally hard for some reason for me, but I made it through. Just wanted to vent out some of my frustrations from my weekend. 

Over the weekend I went from 14MG Patches to 3MG vape thinking psychologically that would help me as Friday I was about ready to call it quits. The change in itself was a good one for myself and my plan.. but I haven't been able to sleep, I've been super moody, I want to cry. I thought I was over this part!? Then it hit me this morning like a ton of bricks, I'm going through withdraw again! I do not want a physical cigarette, but I wish this part was over.

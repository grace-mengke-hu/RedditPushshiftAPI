My Dad is quitting smoking! I was a former smoker and he has taken my advice.

I was a smoker for 16 years and quit by using chantix. My dad was a smoker when he was younger and quit when he had me. He is in his 50's and for some reason picked it back up. I never told him outright that he should quit, I never scorned him, lectured him on the dangers. I made my gandhi like protest; say nothing, but let him know I enjoy time with him. I also told him I would end up with upper respiratory infections in passing. I told him how I quit, I got on chantix and happened to buy a new car, then I wouldn't let myself smoke in my car... that lead to me quitting for good. Well, he bought a new car, and got a prescription to chantix, and said he is planning on not smoking in it.

Woot! I'm so happy he is joining the struggle to quit. And I would love to show him the reddit support!

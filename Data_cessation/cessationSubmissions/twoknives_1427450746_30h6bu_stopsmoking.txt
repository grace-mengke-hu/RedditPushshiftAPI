for the first time in 10yrs I went over a day.

Id like to thank you guys for this. I found this sub today at work and it was uplifting.  For the first time in 10 years I did not have a cigarette in over a day. While I broke and had one late at night I was able to not smoke while I drank in the company of many who were smoking. I have been a pack or more smoker since i was 15. I woke up yesterday and simply didnt smoke. Wasnt as bad as I thought.  even though I had a few drags before bed I feel massively more confident and accomplished. in the morning ill try once more but I now know that I can indeed do it. 26 hours of not smoking and when I lit one up I felt so much guilt not even satisfaction. Tomorrow is new day.

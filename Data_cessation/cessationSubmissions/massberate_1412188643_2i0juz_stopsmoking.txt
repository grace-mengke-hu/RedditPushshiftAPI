Thoughts at 150 days

I stopped by buying a case of 12 beer and a 25 pack of smokes - (my own idea of aversion therapy) and forced myself to finish it all on my birthday. It worked. As I gagged on the last smoke at 2am the last (blurry) memory I have of smoking is a headache, nausea, and a scorched throat. It was horrible.

I smoked for 20 years, sometimes 25 a day, sometimes 10-15. I tried the patch, Zyban, Chantix, acupuncture, gum, e-cigs... and all it took for me was REALLY WANTING IT. I didn't want to be a 35 year old smoker.. I was tired of being a slave to a substance, and I think I've almost beat it. 
I can even drink beer with my friends smoking and not give in. Not saying it's easy, but I don't want to fuck up how far I've come.

Also, a tip if I may offer it: video games! Keeping my hands busy was very helpful in the first weeks of stopping.

I mostly lurk here, but you all have really helped me see that it is possible to not depend on a bunch of dry leafy chemicals to feel "normal".

Thank you SO much.

And to you folks just starting out - stay strong! It really does get easier and easier.

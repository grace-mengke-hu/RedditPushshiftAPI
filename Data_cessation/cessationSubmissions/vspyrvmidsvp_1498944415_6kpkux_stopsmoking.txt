Quitting Smoking & Motivation?

Hello. Almost at 20 years of age, I've been smoking pretty much a pack of Newport 100s a day since about 9th grade, atleast for a solid 4 years. Always suffering with mood related issues including motivation I have as of late been visciously trying to tackle these feelings. 

I am trying to do so firstly by getting in my ideal shape as I am uncomfortable with my appearance. Horrible to others, absolutely not. Horrible to me, absolutely. One change I'm looking for help as to make is quitting smoking. Is there anything more then a weak correlation then ciggerate smoking and deppression/etc? I'm aware atleast Nicotine effects Dopamine neurotransmission. 

Thanks!

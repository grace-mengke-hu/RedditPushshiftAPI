I have every intention to quit. For real this time.

I had a terrible thanksgiving followed by something of a mental breakdown. Upon waking up this morning, I decided I need to actually try to stop smoking. I've been smoking for about three years or so and have had several half-assed attempts to quit which rarely lasted more than a week. I'm pretty serious about it this time. What concerns me is that my roommate is a heavy smoker and probably isn't going to quit with me, in spite of constantly talking about doing so. I enjoy the time spent smoking with him because it gets us out of the house and encourages conversation; apologies if this gets asked all the time but I'd really like suggestions for some less destructive habit which could replace smoking while we hang out on the porch. I have TMJ disorder so I'd like to avoid anything that involves chewing (gum, sunflower seeds, etc.)

What do your friends think?

I'm on day 34 now. Most of my friends are still smokers and they don't know how I did it.
    
They seem supportive, and none of them try to get me to come out with them anymore on smoke breaks.
    
Have any of you influenced your friends to quit? Or is it not good to pressure them, and let them try to quit on their own?
    
In the past, hanging out with them would lead to a relapse. It's not happening this time. I hope to be a good example, while not annoying them about quitting.

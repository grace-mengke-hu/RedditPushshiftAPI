Two weeks today and the cravings seem to be the worst yet.

Smoker for ten years and have a 1.5 yr old daughter with another baby on the way. (I'm the dad so don't worry about baby). This made me say fuck it to the smokes for obvious financial and health reasons. However today seems way more unbearable than the first 13 somehow. I just can't see the light at the end.

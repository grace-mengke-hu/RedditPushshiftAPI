Going to hang out with smokers 'n drankers this evenin'.

Haven't drank or smoked cigs in 18 days and I'm goin' to hang out with a  couple I'm good friends with tonight. Probably at a bar or two.

So basically, they'll be drinking and smoking, I'll be drinking iced teas or sodas or other crap and probably smoking some weed here and there to keep me focused. I'm expecting some cravings to hit but they're good people and I miss them, plus I haven't gotten out of the house as much as I'd have liked since quitting everything.

UPDATE: HEY, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

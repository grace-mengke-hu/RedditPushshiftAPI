Six Squared

And feeling scared....

I almost screwed up yesterday. Went to a little Polish restaurant with my wife. We had had a few friends there a couple months ago before we quit. I mentioned I had come out for a smoke then, and chatted with a cook who was doing the same. I guess that vision didn't sit well with her.

She wanted me to stop on the way home, and was talking of buying a pack (we quit the same day). I'm like NO!!!. She came out with milk and a little cigar. We haven't touched it. Whew. I'm a scared of mentioning tobacco at all now.

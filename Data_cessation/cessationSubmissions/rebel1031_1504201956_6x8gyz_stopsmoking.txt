How long until I'm happy?

I stopped smoking 18 days ago and this site has been a big help.  I love the absence of all the negative parts of smoking but a part of me is just so angry.  Every single day is a struggle to not smoke.  My brain feels like a two year old having a constant tantrum because I want to smoke!!   

How long before that part dies down?

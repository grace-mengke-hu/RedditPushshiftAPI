Am I overestimating myself or am I finally free?

Failed quitting who knows how many times. This week, I successfully passed following tests, where I failed previously:

1. Argument with stbx, with her smoking next to me and pack within reach. Didn't start, even though conversation was stressful

2. Pulled into parking lot of smoke shop defiantly to fix rattle in my car. Left without even considering buying a pack

3. Went out drinking with a friend, had no craving for smoke 

4. Several lingering pangs this week were immediately dismissed

5. Walked past my former smoke buddies smoking outside of work, didn't even consider bumming one

I'm actually feeling more optimistic in my ability to quit this time. True test will be in few weeks when I go on vacation to Europe... Wish me luck... Nah, jk - I got this. Fuck cigarettes!

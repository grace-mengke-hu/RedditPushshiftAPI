Just checking in!

Hey all,

doing great here at the no smoking, 45 days, unreal.

I really don't even think about smokes or consider them anymore.

some of you may have seen my post about quitting drinking now as well, thats on day 4 and going ok. I think one of the main reasons I chose to quit drinking was because of the quitting smoking. I had trained myself to drink without cigarettes, but would still get intense cravings while drinking. I realized this was a danger to my progress in quitting smoking.

However, I also thought about my drinking. And thats when it really clicked that it was a major problem. 

but back to smoking...Screw Cigarettes, I'm stronger than you.

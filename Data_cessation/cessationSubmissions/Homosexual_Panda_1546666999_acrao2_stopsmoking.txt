how do you deal with not smoking when the majority of your friends do?

right now im abroad with family and have not smoked for about 12 days cold turkey.  it was rough but i can feel the cravings subsiding. i am able to do that as id break my grandparents heart if they saw me smoking. ive debated quitting for a while and considering the hardest parts behind me right now it seems like a good time to start. however i know that when i socialising with my friends on returning its always impossible for me to refrain from falling back into the habit. is there any tips or tricks you guys have for me? the vast majority of my friends smoke.

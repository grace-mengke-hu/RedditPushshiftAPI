I Like Money

I'm one of those saps that live paycheck to paycheck. Today was payday & normally that meant today was the day I'd go buy a carton. I have $56 in spending money this week. So, it's just really nice knowing that if I didn't quit, I'd be spending all my money on ciggs but instead I get to go buy the odds & ends I need for my house & that crazy stuff called food. *fist pump*

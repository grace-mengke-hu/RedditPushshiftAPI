Recently quit, but hungry, pangy, using snus a little, generally unhappy.

So I have known for a year or so that I had to quit (again). Life got in the way in March when I broke my foot (which should have been when I quit, it inhibits distal circulation and healing) and I really needed the mental relief I feel like I got during those tough months when I couldn't walk, or do much else for myself. The past 2 years of smoking has been at a rate of 1-2 packs a week.

I smoked from 14-19, then from 31-33, then off and on from 39-41 years old. This is obviously a lifelong problem.

Time has passed and now the snowboarding season is rapidly approaching. I don't want to be a smoker for ANOTHER fucking season, as it is noticeable to me when I'm riding, hiking, etc.

I know I need to go and start exercising to try and get the endorphins working against my psychological desire to smoke.

So I have only had 2-4 cigarettes in the past week (I cant remember clearly, there was alcohol involved both nights) but tonight I want to smoke, sober. It's aggravating, I want to be a social smoker but I can't do it. Some of my friends seem to be able to pull it off, but maybe they're just better at hiding it, I don't know, and it doesn't matter.

I've already made the decision to not go to the gas station for more cigarettes, and I can guaranfuckingtee you there are none here in my house, but that (along with some Valium) hasn't made me feel any more satisfied about it, just frustrated.

Any thoughts? I'm an idiot.

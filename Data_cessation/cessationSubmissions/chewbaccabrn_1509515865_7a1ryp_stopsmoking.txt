Tongue pain?

Have any of you experienced soreness in the tongue? It almost feels as though I bit it (but I didn't). The soreness is mostly on 1 side but a little on both. Its been getting progressively worse just after I quit, but had been slightly sore the day before. My jaw hurts as well (but I have been clenching and chewing gum non stop). 

I am super paranoid and am scared of mouth cancer. Please tell me this is normal. I'm panicking.

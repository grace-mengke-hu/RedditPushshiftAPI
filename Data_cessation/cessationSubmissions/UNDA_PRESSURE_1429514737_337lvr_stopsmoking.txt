Quitting while still drinking?

I'm 23 and still in college. I've tried to quit smoking multiple times (5 or 6) over the past 3 years and every time I've caved has been after a few drinks. I only ever drink socially anymore and am not a heavy drinker. I'm not looking to stop drinking but am willing to stop temporarily until cravings stop. Anybody have any tips for resisting the urge while intoxicated?

Quit 11 days ago

I began smoking when i was 14.  Now that I'm 21 I have decided that smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day just isn't something I can do anymore.  These last 11 days have been absolute hell, but thanks to this forum I have made it 11 days.  The hardest thing for me has been the anxiety I feel knowing I have to take on the day without that cigarette between my lips 15-20 times a day.  But fuck it, those things are killing me and I don't need them anymore.  Good luck ya'all

What was the wierdest or farthest you've gone to offset a craving for a cigarette??

We all get a little bit crazy when we need our fix for nicotine. For myself, I had an intense craving for chupa chups lollipops and spent at least two hours going store to store to find and buy a huge canister of them. Apparently its harder to find than you might think!

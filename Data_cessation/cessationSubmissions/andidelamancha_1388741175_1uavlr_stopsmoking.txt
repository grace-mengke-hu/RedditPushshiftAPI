Just quit and now my nose feels weird...

I've quit on Jan 1st. I don't crave smokes that much at the moment. I am pretty proud of mzself and I'll try to keep it going. But my nose feels a bit swollen. When I breath through my nose. It feels like there is way less air going through than normally.
Somebody knows if there is any connection? Or am I getting ill?

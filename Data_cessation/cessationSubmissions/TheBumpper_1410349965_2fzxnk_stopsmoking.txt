Trying to quit smoking. Can someone help me?

Recently I decided I want to quit smoking. Im 24 and have been smoking for about 7-8 years. Lately Im exhausted after even the smallest physicle exercises. Also it cost ALOT of money, which I dont have a ton of. The problem im facing is I dont really know how to quit, since its been a big part of my life. I tried quiting "cold turkey", which didnt work... Also tried to smoke less and less, e.g. max 3 cigarettes a day for a week and then 2 max ect. But that also didnt work. Am I not motivated enough? 

Everyday I have these moments were I just need a cigarette, like in the morning with a cup of coffee, after dinner, when im drink a beer with friends. Its so difficult not to smoke at those moments. How did you over come these moments? 

I was also wondering how did you quit? I was hoping that when reading some of your stories/methods, I would find a better way for quiting.

Sorry if there are a ton of spelling and grammer mistakes, english is not my first language.

This is the last cigarette of my life

I just finished reading Allen Carr's amazing book, and it really opened my eyes to what the stupid sticks are actually giving me. Nothing, well, besides stress, anxiety, and depression. This book showed me that I have no need for them, it's the cigarette that causes my brain to want another, it doesn't relieve my stress, it causes it. So here I am, sitting in my car, reading the final paragraph, and I'm going to light one last cigarette, as per the book's instruction. I will remember the horrible taste, the awful smell, and I will rejoice and be excited for becoming healthy and happy as I extinguish my last cigarette, for I am not losing a friend, or sacrificing something I "need", but rather I am destroying the monster that has enslaved me of my happiness, free time, health, and confidence. Thank you for reading and for all your advice, I have become a new man.

I need help with Allen carr's method

Hi. I recently quit smoking 24 hours ago. I read Allen carr's book twice and watched his Web seminar.  Yet I still feel like I'm strictly using willpower to quit smoking. 

I think the problem is that I can not get it through my head that there is nothing to give up. I know everything is an illusion that we think about cigarettes and I know that the only relief we get is by taking away the need that was created by the last cigarette.  But isn't that something we are giving up?

Aren't we giving up the feeling we get when we light up that temporarily relieves the symptoms caused by the last cigarette? 

Please help me get this out of my mind....it's the only thing I think that's holding me back. Any help or advice would be appreciated!!!!

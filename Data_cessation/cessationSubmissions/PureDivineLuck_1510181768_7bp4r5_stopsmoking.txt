Need suggestion how to socialize without cigs

Hi everyone,

I decided to quit smoking for good starting from this month and so far I have been doing great. But I think it has affected my ability to socialize with people.

You see, I was a smoker for more than 10 years and I was really accustomed to socialize with cigs and had no problem with it. It was easy for me to struck up conversation and hanging out with people in general when I was still a smoker.

However, at the same time I quit smoking, I also started my new job. Facing a new environment, new people, of course I want to adapt and socialize in my workplace and with my coworkers really well. Unfortunately, many of my coworkers are smoker which in the past, I will have no problem to socialize with. But right now, I can't find a way to socialize with them because I can't join them when they smoke (hate the smell and it is useless to standby near smoker as a non-smoker) and I can't use the main prop that I used for the last 10 years to socialize (cigs). But don't get me wrong, I always try to be friendly with them when I have the chance.

So, any suggestion how to socialize without cigs, especially in new environment? I had no problem to socialize with my old friends who are still smoker since I have known them really well.

Thanks!

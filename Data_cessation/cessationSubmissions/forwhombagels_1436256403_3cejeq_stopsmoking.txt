I [27M] am ready to give up.

Hi, this might be a bit unconventional but i was watching american ninja warrior, wishing so bad that i could be in the competition. so i am a male, 27 years of age, smoker, drinker, apathetic. I don't know what it was about tonight, but i want to make great changes. Smoking probably the furmost. I have overcome drug addiction already, i am still an addict but i am not a user thankfully. But smoking is all i have known for ovr the past ten years. Strongly tied in with my smoking is my drinking... The drinking has been taking a hold of me also. All in all i don't know what i need to tackle first. But all i know is that I am not happy with myself. I really want to be a better person. but i don't know how to be a person different than who i am. But i want to be different, I want to be better. I want to be better for myself, moreover i want to be better for my SO. She is so much a better person than i could ever hope to be. i honestly just want to be close to her level... what can i do to succeed?

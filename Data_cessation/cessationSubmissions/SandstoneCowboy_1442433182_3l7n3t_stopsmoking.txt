Dealing with lightheadedness when quitting

One of the major barriers for me to quit is the lightheaded feeling that I get for days/weeks after quitting. It's usually one of the main things that pulls me back into it and while every source I have looked at said this should be a short lived/temporary effect of quitting, it does not seem to be for me. A handful of times a day for weeks, if not months, after I quit I get lightheaded and need to stop and sit down for a second. I despise this feeling. Has anybody else experienced this? Is there any way to mitigate or decrease this effect? Any help appreciated. Thanks.

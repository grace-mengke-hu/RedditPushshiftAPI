im so happy i didnt smoke lastnight

for all you ex-smokers, I think you would agree having a drink in one and a smoke in the other hand is really nice. this was one thing I was worried about doing is drinking while I'm quitting smoking but I done it its such a big step for me overcoming this. this was the one issue I had trying to quit the only thing that worried me and I did it. yesssssss feel so good.

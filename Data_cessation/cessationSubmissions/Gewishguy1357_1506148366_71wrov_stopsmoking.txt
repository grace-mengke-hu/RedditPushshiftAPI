Well

I had surgery about a month ago. It was a surgery due to a cleft lip where they brought my upper jaw forward and as a smoker they said it could severely fuck me if I kept smoking. I went four weeks. I smoked my first cigarette and I realized that I no longer realize any benefit from it. I think I’m done. If you need to quit smoking I know it sucks. I know that you’re just like I just need one and it’ll get me through. But that one is entirely a gateway. Don’t do it. I believe in you and I always will. It is amazing how much you will change if you just stop for three weeks. The craving will always be there and that’s something that just needs to be accepted. Friends and family are always there, use them. Good luck, god speed, and just do. Not. Do it.

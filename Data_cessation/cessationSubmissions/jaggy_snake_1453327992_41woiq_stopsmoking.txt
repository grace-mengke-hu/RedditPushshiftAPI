60 days cigarette free today.

Two full months as of today with no cigarette. The Christmas season was a bitch (more drinking and socialising than usual) but I got through it. I honestly don't think of them anymore, except if I'm monumentally bored (I always used smoking as a way to pass some time). 

Overall it has been a bit easier than I thought it would be, if not initially. It helps to remove myself from situations where I would usually smoke (going outside between classes in college etc.). Hopefully I can start repairing the damage I've been doing to my body for the last 10 years. 

To anyone just starting out at the minute, trust me, you've made the right call. Something small I do that helps me is that I check my badge on here everyday. Just seeing it increase day by day is the extra push I need sometimes. 

Best of luck everybody and congratulations for making it as far as today, whenever you started. Hopefully we can all stay smoke free for the duration!

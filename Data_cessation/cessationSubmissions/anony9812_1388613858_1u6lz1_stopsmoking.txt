Hello!

Hello fellow Quitters!  
This post is just my shout out loud that "TODAY IT ENDS!" :)  
  
I have tried countless times to quit last year. I failed so many times that I eventually got ashamed to even tell anybody that I'm trying again.  
This time it will be different. This time I have a counter and I'm way too competitive and challenge minded that I won't easily break my streak :D

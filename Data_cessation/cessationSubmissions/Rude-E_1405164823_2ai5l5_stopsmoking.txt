Haven't smoked for 17 days now, I feel it's time to tell the world!

It's not the first time I quit but this time it's going to work, why? I quit drinking 3 months ago, and it was always after some drinks that I started smoking again. So, that is not going to happen this time. 

I must admit, quitting drinking is almost easy compared to smoking. I got over the ritual ciggies (like the very first thing in the morning, and right after dinner ones) so things are looking great.

That's all, just had to share it with someone, so why not post it on Reddit

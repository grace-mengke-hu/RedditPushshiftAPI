5 year check-in

Hey everybody, yesterday was my 5 year q-versary. I just wanted to drop by and wish all you new quitters the very best of luck and general good vibes. Believe me, it's the best thing you can do for yourself and gets real easy real quick. The first three days felt like a mountain for me but everyday thereafter got a little easier. One day, I realised I hadn't thought about having a cigarette for a whole weekend. I knew at that point that I'd cracked it. Happy waiting everybody.

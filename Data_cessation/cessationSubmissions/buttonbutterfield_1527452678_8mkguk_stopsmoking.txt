Why I'm quitting for good and how I'm going to do it

Midnight tonight is my quit time/day. I was going to wait until June 1st but I don't know if I can carry on another couple of days feeling like this. 

My reasons for smoking (apart from the obvious) are:
1. To have healthy lungs and be able to actually breathe - no more coughing up stuff or constant sneezing and sinus pain.

2. Because I know from previous attempts at quitting that smoking pretty much causes me to have IBS - sorry for TMI but it's something I've had for 4 years and never would have put it down to smoking until I gave up for 5 days the other month.

3. For my mental well-being. I know nicotine is a stimulant and my constant consumption of nicotine and caffeine is making my life miserable.

How I'm going to do it. 

From now until midnight (less than 3 hours) I am going to stop smoking. 
1. I will use patches and gum to keep the anxiety at a manageable level. 
2. I am going to practice deep breathing and do exercises whenever I feel the urge to smoke.
3. I am going to go outside every time I would usually smoke ( I smoke outside) and take 10 deep breaths of fresh air and notice how nice it is to do so. 

4. I'm probably going to spam on here quite a lot (sorry in advance)


I'm ready for this. I am stronger than my addiction

Wanting to quit

So I'm 19 and I have been smoking since I was about 14-15 (not sure if my birthday had passed by then) And I hate it like no other. I just cant bring myself to stop. I hate the smell it leaves, the cost it, how if I go to long with out it and then do the Nic-High that it gives me. I want to stop but at the same time I don't want to. I have had some HUGE changes happen in my life, and its making it that much harder. I smoke about half a pack to a pack a day sometimes even more.

Struggling

I’ve been smoke free for over a month. Yay me!  Today, though, the weight of the world is getting me down. Relationship and health issues abound and smoking sounds wonderful. Don’t get me wrong - I’m under no illusion that a cigarette would solve anything. It won’t. I’m just not feeling the confidence and strength to fight this demon while carrying the weight of the other problems.  

*Sigh.*

Fucking Impossible

I'm so tired of trying and trying to quit smoking. I've attempted countless times. Within the past year I've had an unknown number of one and two day long attempts, one month long quit, one attempt that lasted six weeks which is the longest I've gone since I started smoking, three or four consecutive days on the patch (it doesn't stay on because of my active sweaty work, I was having to tape it to the tops of my feet), six weeks of vaping (literally just vaping all the time), and countless attempts to cut down on my intake. This shit is dominating my life. 

But I'm even more tired of smoking. I'm spending 140 bucks a month on it. I wake up in the morning and immediately smoke while hawking up big fat loogies. I smell like shit all the time. I get short of breath at work. Stopped exercising because I started smoking again. On and on and on. 

I "tried" to quit starting last night and made it all of twelve hours. Got short with my partner and my boss this morning. Was screaming inside with frustration at my work. Was afraid that I'd actually inappropriately yell at someone. Felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. Bought a pack. Smoked one, which means I'll smoke one more, which means I'll smoke ten thousand more. 

Wtf do I do? How did I ever go so long before? Is there any hope for me or is this just my destiny?

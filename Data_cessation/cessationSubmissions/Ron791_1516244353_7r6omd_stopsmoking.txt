Bad night

Tonight I fealt like my chest was gonna explode it's really bad. I've always have had control issues being a drug addict and all "my last hit of coke was 6-26-06  which was my crutch. This nicotine addiction is way fucking worse I can't even come close to stopping not even slowing down. I'm always thinking about when something bad will really happen to me and that don't work. I feel fucking doomed!!!

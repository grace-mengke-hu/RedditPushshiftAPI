I could really use some advice.

So this is my first attempt at trying to quit. I attend a very competitive university and picked up smoking to help deal with the stress. since I stopped I've felt extremely stressed, but it isn't overwhelming. My biggest issue since quitting smoking is the fatigue. I haven't been able to keep my eyes open, and when they are I'm so tired I can barely function. I've missed classes because I failed to get out of bed, fallen asleep in classes, and I'm really worried quitting might affect my gpa and set me back on my life goals.
the semester is almost over and I was thinking about taking up smoking again for the rest of the school year and quitting once summer rolls around. I don't know if this is the cravings talking or actually a reasonable idea. what do you all think?

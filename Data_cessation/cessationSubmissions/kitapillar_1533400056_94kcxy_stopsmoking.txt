My lungs!

It’s been a week. The stop smoking app told me on day three that my bronchial tubes had begun to relax. Now I have anxiety disorder that manifests as hypochondria when stress builds up. Lately, I’ve been telling myself I need to quit most of all because I feel like I’m dying with every cigarette.

And that sweet app, it told me my bronchial tubes had a chance. As soon as I read it, I took a deep breath in.

Every day, I take a deep breath in. I couldn’t do that before. I do it multiple times a day. I take a deep breath in and it’s effortless. It’s not uncomfortable. It’s not riddled with anxiety. It’s a full lung breath.

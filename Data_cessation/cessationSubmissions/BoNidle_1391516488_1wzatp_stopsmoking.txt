What can I do about the wild mood swings when I stop?

I've tried stopping before and apart from the physical discomfort, the biggest problem for me is that I get really bad tempered, really quickly at the smallest things. I lash out at anyone close to be, I'm not just irritable I'm downright mean at times. 

I remember one time when I was trying to quit and I got into constant arguments with my then gf, she got so annoyed after one fight that she came back with a pack of smokes, threw them at me and said "Just fucking smoke them and go back to normal".

It's also a problem for me as my work involves dealing with the public who tend to be easy targets for my anger, when I'm in withdrawl. 

So what can I do?

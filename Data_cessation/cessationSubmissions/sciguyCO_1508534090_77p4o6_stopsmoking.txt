Counting this as my first "real" milestone: have completed the work week smoke free.

20 years of smoking, 2-3 packs a week.  Work has always been my worst trigger.  Wife (and now kids) at home made that nonviable.  But I'd be "free" at work to step out for a cigarette.  And hey, just relieving that "work stress" right?

But not this week.  This is the *last* time I go through this withdrawal period.  Last weekend was another re-read of Carr's "Easy Way".  The last cigarettes of my last pack were finished off Monday morning.  Instead of mindless puffing, careful attention was paid to just how gross the whole ritual is.  Each burning inhale and irritation of the throat was studied so that it would not be forgotten in a moment of weakness.  When a breeze blew smoke into my eye and made them water, I noted it as one more annoyance that I'm not going to have to deal with anymore.

Making it through a Monday - Friday feels great.  Plus, while writing this up, I also got my "100 hours smoke free" badge from my quitting app, so I've got that going for me too.

Next stop: 7 day streak...

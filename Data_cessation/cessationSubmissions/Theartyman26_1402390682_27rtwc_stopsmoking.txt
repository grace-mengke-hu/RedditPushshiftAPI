Day one again

So I'm back on day one .i did pop in there and had 3 months when I had no fags .did so well .i could smell things again and had so much time on my hands.i loved being normal .but I went out and brought a packet .no reason .the first ones I had to really try to smoke .and things happened and been back on like the old days.one packet a day.
Then I just got up today and I feel crap so I thought why not ?.the birds are singing I'm eating a lot better ,not so much beer as before.
I'm going to try to give up today .
Just had one fag and was feeling sick on it .haven't enjoyed smoking since I gave up the first time so what I am doing.not going to tell anyone just in cause .
Thank you for listening I let you know how I get on.and I love the stories .thanks

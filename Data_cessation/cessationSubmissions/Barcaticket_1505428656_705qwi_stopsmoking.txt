I'm close to 5 months now , wondering what the hell am i craving today just to remember "oh yeah cigarettes"

I would love to read science that answers how our brains work this long after quitting , feels like i'm still missing the buzz/dopamine kick and that really sucks. I started working out and am in better shape though. still sucks i don't feel content.

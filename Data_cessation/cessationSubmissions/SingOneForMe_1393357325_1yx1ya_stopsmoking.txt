Smoking and anxiety?

I have been really thinking about quitting lately. Recently Ive noticed that the first cigarette of the day makes me feel slightly disoriented and very anxious (I've been smoking for almost ten years and this has only started happening consistently  in the last six months or so). It's really strange and it kind of worries me. It's almost an instantaneous thing, after I take the first drag I think to myself, "I think I'm forgetting something I was supposed to do today. What was I supposed to do today? Am I running late for something?" I just think it's really strange that my brain goes to this same place almost every time. Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think it's actually related to smoking or is it purely just a symptom of anxiety alone?

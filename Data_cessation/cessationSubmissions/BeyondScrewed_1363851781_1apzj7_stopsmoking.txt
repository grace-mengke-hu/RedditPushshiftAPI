Been smoking for five years and I want to quit, any advice?

As my title says I've been a smoker for five years now. I bought my first pack when I turned 18 just because I could and decided to smoke the whole thing because I thought that I was better than all those people who got addicted to cigarettes. I smoked so little for the first two years that my packs would get stale. Eventually I started smoking more frequently until I reached a pack as day about a year ago. I didn't care much thought because I believed that I could quit whenever I wanted to.

Well now as I've said it is my fifth year smoking and I have finally realized that I am addicted, I can't just stop as I please, I am the person that I never thought that I would be. I wake up in the morning and I crave a cigarette more that I crave breakfast. I hate myself for allowing myself to fall into this. I want to quit now, I've been trying for a few weeks but I can't seem to make it more than a day.

I sit here at my computer when I'm not working and peck away at my computer lighting up every hour or so. My roommate is a smoker as are all of my friends and even when I decided not to buy a pack I bum one off of them without thinking. I have started to notice my clothes smelling like cigarettes now and if it's gotten to the point that I notice it I can only image how bad it is to nonsmokers around me. Please give me any advice as to how I can stop this cycle, I am sick and tired of spending $6+ a day, I am sick and tired of smelling like a damned ashtray, I'm sick and fucking tired of being a slave to my addiction and I want a way out. If any of you have any advice I would be glad to hear it.

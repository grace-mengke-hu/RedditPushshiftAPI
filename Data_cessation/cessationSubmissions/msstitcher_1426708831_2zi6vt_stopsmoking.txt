Is it normal to get this angry and agitated when quitting?

I have quit before, I went cold turkey and didn't smoke for 3 years, however last summer I started again, this time I cut down from about 20 a day to less than 10 a day over the space of a month and I'm finding it really difficult to get that last couple of fags out of my system.  I went a whole day but then on the second day I was awful, I was a bitch to be honest and I have two gorgeous kids that bore the brunt of it and that made me feel awful, and I smoked to try to get rid of that angry person I became.  Today has been even worse (5 fags so far) because I am scared of being that angry irate person when I don't smoke, I know it's mostly psychological because I got through the first 48 hours before cracking again.  Any help or advice? Also is this normal to get that angsty and agressive? (I'm normally a very peaceful person - I'm a support worker for goodness sake)  Sorry for ranting, I just feel like poo

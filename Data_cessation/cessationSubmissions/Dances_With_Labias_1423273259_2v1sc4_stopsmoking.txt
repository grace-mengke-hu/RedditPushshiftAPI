Quit over a year ago, but started smoking again about 6 weeks after. Didn't visit this sub until I was ready to quit again, and saw my badge I never reset. 435 days. 4. 3. 5. Now I'm almost a week in, and hoping it'll stick. Wish me luck.

I'm using Nicoderm CQ, and today was the worst.  I took the patch off when I woke up, and left it off to work out and then shower.  The craving was so bad that I almost stopped mid workout to buy a pack.  Just one, right?

Anyways, I replaced the patch after my shower, still smoke free, and I'm good again.

Am I setting myself up to fail once I'm done with this 10 week NRT session?

I quit cold turkey last time, but I almost murdered 3 people and one child.

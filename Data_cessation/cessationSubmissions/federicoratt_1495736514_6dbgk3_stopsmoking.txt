Hi everyone I'm new here and I really need to quit smoking and make several habit changes

I'm 29 and smoke since I'm 15. I feel out breath often and feel my heart beat quickly.
I stared smoking out of the house recently and felt for a while it was a step forward, but since I work outdoors driving alone almost all day it really is a struggle to find an equivalent pascifier throughout the day.
I only quit smoking temporarily on occasions I was sick, but as soon as I get the chance I'm lighting up a cig again.
It's ridiculous the loss of time, money, health and mental energy this is demanding me, and I could really use some help.
I tried to vape, and follow my doctor's advice for a while, but can't get my habits changed for good.

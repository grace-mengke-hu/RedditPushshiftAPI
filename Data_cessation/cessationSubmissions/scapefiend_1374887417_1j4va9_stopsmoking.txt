I get the feeling I'm forgetting something important...

  So I quit smoking about 5 days ago. Everything is fine and all, but I get this feeling right before waking up when I feel I forgot to do something important, or forgetting it. I'm seriously bugged out about this, I'm late with a few deadlines but nothing serious. Does anyone else got this feeling after quitting smoking ?

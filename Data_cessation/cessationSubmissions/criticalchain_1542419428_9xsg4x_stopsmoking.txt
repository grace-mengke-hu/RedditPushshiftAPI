Alternatives to regressing to smoking

I’ve been off cigarettes for almost 3 years now. But lately I’ve been getting the urge to start again. I think the main reason is that I feel that smoking outside my office used to get my creative juices flowing. I remember numerous occasions when I was stuck with a problem and a trip to the smoking zone resulted in an idea to solve it. I understand that it might just be a change of scenery that was responsible for it. But I haven’t been able to find anything that gives me an equivalent feeling - coffee, short walks, small talks with friends etc. Have those who have quit smoking know what I’m talking about? Have they found a good substitute for “problem solving while smoking”?

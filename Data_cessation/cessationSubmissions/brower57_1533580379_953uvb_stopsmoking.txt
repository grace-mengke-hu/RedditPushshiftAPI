Brain Zaps from withdrawals or too much Nicorette

Hey everyone,

I am trying to quit chewing tobacco and have been doing pretty well. Unfortunately, I experience brain zaps and it really freaks me out. I was wondering if anyone else experienced this while quitting. I’m not sure if I’m underdosing or overdosing on the 2mg nicorette gum that I have roughly every 2 hours.

Thanks in advance

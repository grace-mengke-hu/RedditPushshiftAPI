1 day 9 hours ago I neglected to recognize being smoke free for 3 months!

I realized after the fact that I had been smoke free for 3 months. 

Did you catch that? I **FORGOT** to realize that I had not to have a cigarette in 3 months. That is how much of a non issue quitting smoking is for me now. 

Is it an accomplishment to remain smoke free for 3+ months? Hell yeah it is! I am beyond impressed with myself. 

But, it is as if smoking for 22 years is a distant memory already. I have zero regrets, and I do not miss it in the least. 

If you are newly quit, thinking about quitting, or suffering over being quit, you might be envious, or jealous. I know I was when I was in your shoes the hundreds of times that I attempted to quit in the past, and eventually failed. I failed and failed and failed to quit, for at least 18 of the 22 years I smoked. In fact, I know I attempted to quit 7 times this year, until I finally stopping 3 months ago. 

Hang in there. Try again. Keep trying. Each failed attempt is one attempt closer to when you quit. 

Wellbutrin helped. Also, Allen Carr's Easy Way, added to all the past attempts, and a determination to brain wash myself seems to have finally done the trick for me. 

Find your way. You will quit someday, today, or yesterday...for the last time.

Did anyone else feel intensely happy early into their quit?

I debated posting this - I know that some people are struggling with their quit early on, and I don't want to make them feel any worse.

With that out of the way, did anyone else actually experience almost a euphoric feeling after their initial withdrawal phase? I'd say that yesterday and today I've been damned near giddy as a school girl - I'm generally not an openly jovial person (though I like to have fun), but for the past 2 days I've been in an *extremely* good mood.

This has nothing to do with being brainwashed or hypnotized into being a non-smoker - I have done a (failed) quit before, and was a son of a bitch for months.

Am I alone in this, or did anyone else go through the same thing?

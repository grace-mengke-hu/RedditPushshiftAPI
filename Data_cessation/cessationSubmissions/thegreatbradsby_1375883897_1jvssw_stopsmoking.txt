I went 2 days 11 hours and 32 minutes... Just smoked...

Hello there, 
This is my first post in this sub (I just found it and subscribed). My wife and I quit together 2 days ago and she only made it over a day before having half a cigarette. I literally just walked in from smoking a cigarette and I feel ashamed. Everyone in my office smokes and it has been wearing on my nerves this morning. I had a cup of coffee and for some reason, I feel like that broke my resolve. I am so used to having a cup of coffee and a cigarette in the mornings.

I've been a smoker for around 6 years now and I never anticipated how hard it is to quit. Now that I have found this sub and seeing all of the people with their outstanding badges, I have decided to frequent this site as a means to gain some perspective from others as well as offering any encouragement I can. 

I have installed a stop smoking app on my phone to increase my awareness of how long it has been since I have smoked and it also offers a "help" button to tell you what your body has done in the means of recuperating since the last time you have had a cigarette. 

I didn't imagine it would be this hard but I look forward to posting here and continuing my journey in the path of not smoking. Thanks for allowing me a place to vent. Now to get back on track.

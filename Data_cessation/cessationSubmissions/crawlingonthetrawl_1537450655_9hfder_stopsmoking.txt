Day 12?

I almost can't believe I have made it this far. My previous record was 14 days. I intend to shatter that record. I can now actually hold on to money lol. 

One thing I have noticed though that certainly is unpleasant; I tend to get very angry at stupid shit to the point I just need to walk away. Impatient too. 

I hope it goes away soon! 

Thank you guys and good luck to everyone!

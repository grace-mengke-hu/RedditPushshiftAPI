Anxiety attacks, wild heart rate, chest pains. Normal to persist into the 5th day?

For starters I wasn't really a heavy smoker. I vaped 12mg juice and went through maybe 2-3ml a day. When drinking I'd smoke 1-3 cigarettes about 2 days a week. I decided to quit cold turkey last Friday and man have I felt awful. Incredibly weak and I have constant fear and anxiety in my chest. My heart just felt "off." Not like regular palpitations, but a persistent weird feeling. I don't even have really bad nicotine cravings, but I feel awful. I tried working out day 3 and felt an electric shock feeling in my chest and stopped and had the worst anxiety attack of my life. I also have a fast heart rate most the time between 80-100 bpm opposed to my prior to quitting rate of 60-80bpm. 

How long do these symptoms typically last? I'd probably go see a doctor but I don't have insurance.

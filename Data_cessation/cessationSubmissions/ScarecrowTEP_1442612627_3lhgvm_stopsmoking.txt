My first test as a non smoker

I recently quit smoking,  however I haven't really been put in situations where I've had peers around me smoking or have had the temptation to smoke. 

 Tomorrow I will be going to a friend's birthday BBQ where I will be drinking and be surrounded by friends who smoke - - My first real test as a non smoker.  

Do you guys have any tips or tricks I can try when I'm at the party? Thanks in advance!

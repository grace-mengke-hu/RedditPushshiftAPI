Last cigarette

I’ve quit several times over the last few years. The longest I’ve made it was three months. I’m going for a year. And many more after but a year is what will make me feel accomplished the most. I have things in my life to live for, people I want to be there for, and a person I want to be. I will never be that person just to look back and say, “I shouldn’t have quit.” My brain tells me that after weeks one, two, and 12, but I know I’ll never miss it after I kick it. Goodby old friend. Hello life.

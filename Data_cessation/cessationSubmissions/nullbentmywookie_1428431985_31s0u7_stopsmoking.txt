About to set a date.

So last week I saw my nephews for the first time in a few years, they (6 and 8 yrs) caught me smoking. The youngest grabs my hand after I finished, looks up at me and says "you know that's going to kill you, right aunt nullbentmywookie?" and my heart shattered. I've felt like shit every time I smoke since then. I've been wanting to quit for a while and just haven't had the metaphorical balls to just start stopping.

So I'm scared. I have my Chantix boxes, and am stubborn as all hell and do really want this. I'm afraid of side effects, I'm already in a bit of a funk with life and worry that the depression will increase beyond what I can handle. Any tips or tricks for that? 

I also have a pretty intense hand to mouth/oral fixation. I notice now when I go long periods without smoking I chew my inner cheeks and my lips to hell. 

I will be the final one of three in my immediate family to quit, dad did hypnosis, sis did frustration and willpower. I have support from many angles, but I still feel like I'm about to jump off a waterfall and drown. 

I guess I'm looking for guidance, or tips for the worst days, or even just a "stfu and do it already". I tried and failed with an e-cig last year (5 weeks), I tried and failed with sheer willpower a few years back (6 weeks). I want to succeed. I want to not need to rush outside after eating or need half a pack with my morning coffee. I want to stop spending obscene amounts of money and worrying about if I have enough to skip the store on my way home.

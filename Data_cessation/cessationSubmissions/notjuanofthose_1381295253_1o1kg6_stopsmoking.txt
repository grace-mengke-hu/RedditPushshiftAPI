Day 2 - "Well, this is quite easy, what's all the fuzz - oh god I need to smoke ALL the cigarettes NOW!"

So yesterday was the first day I didn't smoke in many years and it wasn't so difficult (I had smoked 2 packs on Sunday because I was so nervous about quitting). I knew that the 2nd day was going to be harder but it started out easy. In the morning I really wanted to smoke but some sunflower seeds and lots of water did the trick and I went to work almost without thinking about smoking. I get there and I was in "easy mode" because I never smoked at work, so the day went by without even needing the chewing gum I bought (regular gum) but I was dreading the end of the working day. One hour before leaving it hits me: 

-- I really want to smoke


-- No way, you don't want to, the nicotine is playing tricks on you

-- No man, you reaaaally want to smoke. Remember that cigarette after 8 hours of hard work? How can you not want that?

-- Shut up, shut up, shut up

I run out of the office, went pass the place where I usually get my daily pack (where I don't even need to talk to the guy and he has the pack waiting for me) looking straight down and hoping for the craving to go away before getting home. I had like 5 pieces of gum waiting for the bus (that mofo took forever to get there) and finally got home, where the cravings hit again but I was better prepared to deal with them.

So, a successful but frightening 2nd day went by. I realized that I used to "binge smoke", I spent 8 hours asleep, smoked a couple of cigarettes before getting to work (ok, more like 4 or 5), another 8 hours without a smoke and then the rest of the pack and a bit more in the evening. That is definitely going to be the toughest part of the days to come.

I know tomorrow will probably be harder than today, but I think I'm ready to cope with what's to come.

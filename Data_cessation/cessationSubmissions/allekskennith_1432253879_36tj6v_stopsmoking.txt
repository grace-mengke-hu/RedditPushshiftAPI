Almost quit need some advice critical moment for me

I had oral surgery (not related to smoking) a week ago. I have been smoking  a pack or two a day for six years.

I decided my surgery would be a good time to quit and didn't smoke at all until yesterday and I smoked four times. I have smoked twice today. In my mind I want to quit and have wanted to for a long time. I threw away my cigarettes and have been bumming off of my room mate. I am trying hard to avoid my triggers but they are habits and not events. I am still recovering and find myself smoking out of boredom.

Is there something I can do to help myself right now? I feel like I'm really close to finally kicking it and I really want to so I can save money and be healthier. I am not very interested in it but I just find myself outside and feeling good with all the positive changes I've made in my life lately and I talk myself into not needing to quit right now, or just this one won't hurt...

Any advice from you pros?

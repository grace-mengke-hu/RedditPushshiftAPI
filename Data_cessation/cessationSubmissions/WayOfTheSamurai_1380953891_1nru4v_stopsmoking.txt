Still smoking... in my dreams...

First of all, I'd like to say thanks to everybody in this subreddit for helping me quit (almost 2 months ago), first time posting!

I'm doing fine so far. The interesting thing is... I catch myself smoking in my dreams knowing that I shouldn't. I'm still on the [nicotine] patch, so I'm sure that contributes to my 'dream-smoking', along with inducing some very vivid (and sometimes lucid) dreams. Last night, I dreamed that a friend offered me a cigarette. I said no. But then the dream became lucid and I said; "You know what, sure." I lit it up and started smoking when I told my friend; "You know what's cool about me smoking this cigarette? I'm only dreaming about it. This is just a dream." My 'Inception' moment of the week :)

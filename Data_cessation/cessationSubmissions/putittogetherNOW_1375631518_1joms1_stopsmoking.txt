Quit smoking with an Ecig 4 days ago, reduced my nicotine intake level by half, and will continue to do so every 2 weeks until nicotine free.

I bought a really good Ecig, with 8 diff. flavors to start.  

1st Day went really well, I really liked the smoke level and feeling of a real cig.  I was way too easy.  I was kicking myself for not doing it years ago.

2nd Day I started using more of the different flavors, like English Toffee, Cotton Candy, Candy Cane (man this one is good, and I never smoked methyl cigs) and others.  I really liked it, even better than smoking tobacco flavor!!!

3rd Day I went and got lower level nicotine e-liquid (I was a heavy smoker, and I smoked Marlboro reds) flavors and added some new flavors.  Oh man is this stuff tasty!!!!

4th Day  No noticeable discomfort with lower nicotine levels (reduced by half)

Wish me luck !

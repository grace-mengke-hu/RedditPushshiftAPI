4 months today!

4 months today! Woo hoo! I actually feel like a non-smoker and can't believe I was a smoker for so long (around 38 years). I've started regular exercise (walking 5-10km a day) and I'm actually enjoying it! Who'd have thought?! Lol. I scrunch up my nose at the smell of smokers when I walk past them and I'm so glad I don't smell like that anymore. And best of all, I don't have to go outside and freeze my butt off (pardon the pun, lol) every hour to smoke! (It's winter here in Australia and I live in the mountains -very cold). For those struggling in the first days or weeks of your quit, keep going! It gets easier quite quickly and it's so worth it to be free. Just don't smoke today!

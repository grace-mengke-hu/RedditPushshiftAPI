Tonight is a big night for some, don't slip up!

Just here to offer some motivation and support.  

Drill this into your head now, especially if you will be drinking and around other smokers tonight. You don't need the cigarette.  Your last cigarette is what's causing your current craving.  You can stop these cravings by simply not lighting up another one!  You can do this!

I was a pack a day smoker for a long time, and if I quit, I promise you can too.  I have dreams now where I'm smoking and I wake up feeling ashamed until I realized it was just a dream!

Start the new year off right!  You can do this!

Good luck and happy new year!!

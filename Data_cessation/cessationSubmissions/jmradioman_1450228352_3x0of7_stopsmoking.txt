Wife won't quit smoking while breastfeeding 4 month old.

Alright.   First of all i have been a smoker since I was 14.  I decided i did not want a cigarette in May 2015 and have not had one since.   It was mental for me.   I felt like shit for smoking a pack a day til my son was almost 2 and through most of my wife's second pregnancy. Daughter is 4 months old now. I will always be a smoker,  I just CHOOSE NOT TO.  Like AA meetings. 
Now her children don't want to be held by her,  since she smelles. she won't hold them long since wife has to smoke every hour on the hour almost.   She does not care since her need to smoke blinds her to what's going on.   Im no rookie when quitting, I've done it hundreds of times. I just don't know what is going to work for her.  I just don't know what to do. I can't let this go on much longer.

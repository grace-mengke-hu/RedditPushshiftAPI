Relapsed 18 hours in. Should I give Allen Carr a try??

I got Allen Carr’s book and I don’t know if it help. I had horrific cravings, bouts of crying, headaches etc. and my period is coming up and I have PMDD(pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder) which makes me nearly suicidal so I don’t know if I should give this book a try. I feel like I’ll never quit.

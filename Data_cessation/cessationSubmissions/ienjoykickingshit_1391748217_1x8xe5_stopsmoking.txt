College student on day two, looking for some tips on how to avoid relapsing when drinking.

Besides the obvious "don't drink", I was wondering if anyone has some constructive advise that may keep me from lighting one up at a party. I'm very driven to free myself from this addiction, and as this is around my 6th attempt at quitting feel its about time to come I ask reddit for some serious help. Hopefully this forum can keep me motivated long enough to survive hell week!

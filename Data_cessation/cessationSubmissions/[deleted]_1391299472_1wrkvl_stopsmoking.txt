Day 5 and I'm feeling good!

Hi guys, I've just made it to day 5 without having a cigarette. This is a big deal for me because I have smoked every day for the last 9 years. 2014 would have marked a decade long addiction for me and I finally decided it was time to stop. Like most others, I started smoking as a young, naive teenager because I thought it was cool. Slowly the habit increased from smoking when I was out in clubs, to smoking a pack a day. Over the past 2 years I had managed to bring that back down to around 5 cigarettes a day. With the dreaded 10 year anniversary around the corner, I finally decided it was time to say goodbye to cigarettes. 

I have gone cold turkey and have found no physical withdrawal symptoms yet. I think about smoking about 100 times a day though, especially on my commute to work or if I'm just at home sitting around bored. I have taken up listening to audio books and podcasts as a form of distraction and it seems to be working. Thought I'd share my experience so far :) 

Good luck to all of you trying to quit!

A tip that has always helped me.

Hey all,  
I've been an on and off smoker for far to long. Seems like maybe 5 years. Just before I moved out for a new job I was living with my sister and we all stopped smoking for the start of the new year. That fell to shit when they started smoking again, I had a few beers and it was over. I knew what I was getting myself into.  


So here I am now and I've just got myself very motivated to stop again. It has always come down to money.  


If any of you are already doing your finances kudos to you. To many people don't understand where there money flow goes. I've learned to follow it very well but for the last 6 months I had no job and lost the motivation to do that. Today I broke out my budget. and holy shit my lack of caring has caught up to me. I've got some serious debts to pay down right now. I can't justify buying cigs. At least with some beer I get a release after a hard day. Smoking does nothing but cure it's own doing.   


I have to stop and I know I will. I can't afford this and honestly I'm ashamed of myself for starting again.  


So for me this has always been a big motivator and a lot of people can get on board with this. Pull out a spreadsheet and see how much your cranking out every month. See how much money you could be towards paying down credit cards or investing to retire some day (if that's still possible.  


Hope this can help some people!

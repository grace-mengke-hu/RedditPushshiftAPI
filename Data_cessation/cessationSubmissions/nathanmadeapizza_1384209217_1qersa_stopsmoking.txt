To all of those on the fence about getting a badge

I think you should get one! For a while I was just lurking on this sub and trying and trying to quit but failing one way or another. I decided to request a badge for the hell of it and for some reason it worked! I dont know if it was just a coincidence or because I felt a responsibility to my badge number or some other reason but hey its been 62 days! (longest I think I have ever gone since I started smoking).

YOU CAN DO IT!

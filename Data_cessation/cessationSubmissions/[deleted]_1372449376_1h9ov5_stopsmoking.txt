Quitting and Heart Palpitations

First off, I'm vaping (e-cigs), so I don't know if that qualifies as quitting. 

I've quit cigarettes codl turkey a few times, and every time I do, I get heart palpitations frequently. I always assumed this was because of a lack of nicotine. But I am vaping this time and I'm getting heart palpitations just the same. I've experimented with levels of nicotine so I don't think it's nicotine. I'm sure it's because I'm not smoking cigarettes.

Any of you experience palpitations from not smoking? If so how long did that last?

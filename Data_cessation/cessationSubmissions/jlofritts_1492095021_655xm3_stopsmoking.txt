Day 3 & Everything is Hard

I decided to quit while I was sick with a stomach thing (smoking made me feel way sicker). Now that I'm feeling mostly better, I'm back at work and I have to face the stresses of life (many) without cigarettes. I keep wondering how people do this. They just handle shit without having to take a break and smoke. They're like aliens to me. How am I gonna do this? I get so depressed and I've been so moody and angry w/o them. I don't want to go back. Somebody tell me it's temporary and I'll figure it out.

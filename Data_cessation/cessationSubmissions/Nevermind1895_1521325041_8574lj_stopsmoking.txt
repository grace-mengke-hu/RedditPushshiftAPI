Need some support please

Ok so I’m a recent non smoker after 4 years...I’m at my first party and am fairly drunk. Usually I’ll smoke when the social part gets too much and I need a solid break...I’m desperate for a smoke right now...


How do I get past this part? I’m really trying hard but this is all new to me..

Nicotine Patches vivid dreams!

First off- all the congrats to everyone who is reaching another day smoke free.

I still don't know why i haven't had a cigarette but it occurred to me that its time i stopped. I haven't smoked for 3 days, and yesterday was horrible, but these nicotine patches were left by my last roommate and so i put one on (the STEP 2 because i didn't want too much)

The dreams that night. I woke up so often, but when i fell back asleep, i feel right back into the dream. 

They weren't blotchy, the didn't go from scene to scene, it really was just a whole night of hanging and living in a different house near my family with new people, real faces ( its the first time ever i actually see the face of an anonymous person in a dream), several of them in fact... It was amazing, it was so weird I would wake up frightened by the reality of it.

Anyone else experience it?

Also weird that it was this whole party scene, and i refused every drink, as well as the opportunity to have sex....which is unlike me when im attracted to a person

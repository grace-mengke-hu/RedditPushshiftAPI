Get paid for sharing your e-cigarette experiences!

Hi all, I hope this doesn't break any rules (please let me know if it does!), but I'm writing an article on what vapers want from today's market, and I was wondering if any of you had any strong opinions? It would be really helpful to know.

Also, the company I work for is looking for a small group of e-cigarette 'professionals' to share their opinions on the vaping marketplace of today. We would be paying you to complete short surveys, sharing your opinions, and trialling new products.

Quitting 50s

I'm on day four of no tobacco in my weed bowls. I feel mild annoyance in the background anytime I'm not occupied. It's not the worst thing ever, but I'll be glad when it's gone. I feel bad that I am short with my bf and sometimes more depressed than I want. Ideas to occupy my time and maybe keep him and I happy?

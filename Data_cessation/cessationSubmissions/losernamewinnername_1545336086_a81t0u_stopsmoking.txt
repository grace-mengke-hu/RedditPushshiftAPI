Vicious cycle

1. Stop smoking tobacco  (for 22 days now)
2. Smoke some pure cannabis cus I heard it helps people with shitty feels.
3. Wake up feeling antsy and mad.
4. Dream about a fucking spliff whole motherfucking day even though it leaves you feeling like shit when you're without it.
5. Becoming really lazy and lungs starting to hurt and quitting again

Oh my... fucking... And this loneliness will probably make me relapse again. I'm not that strong.

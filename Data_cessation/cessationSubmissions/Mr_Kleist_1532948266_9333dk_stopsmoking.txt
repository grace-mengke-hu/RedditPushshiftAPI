Approaching the two week mark and starting to feel better

Who would have thought stopping would have made me feel so emotional and without purpose. I have all the small things in life that should make me happy (a job, family, friends, a girlfriend, good health, and I live in a first world country). In spite of all of this the cigarette made me feel hopeless, anxious, depressed, and like I had nothing to live for. What a drug man, what a f****** drug. Finally starting to get the happy chemicals from ordinary things (like whopping my friends at video games). C'est la vie.

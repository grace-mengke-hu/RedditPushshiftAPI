I'm new here

Hey guys,
I just stopped smoking yesterday - I've been smoking for 4 1/2 years. But checking my account-balance + the wish to be engaged in sports, like I used to be, made me stop.
I heard the 3 first day are the most physically demanding - but I think I can do it.

Thank you for all your inspiring stories! 


[EDIT]
I'm using this as kind of a diary now.

It's 13:17 - I'm 19 hours and 15 minutes in and I really feel the need for a cigarette. But NO - dark chocolate it is.

[EDIT#2]

It's 11:58 - Having lunch early today. I'm super hungry so that's why I'm already eating. This morning I woke up and the smell of my pillow was really disgusting. 42 hours done. Feels good.

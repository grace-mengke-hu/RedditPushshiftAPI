Cravings

I used to smoke a lot with my cousin, I am visiting him this week and I have not smoked for 12 days, the cravings are getting to my head because of the smell and the sticks being seen every few minutes. But I am controlling myself, although some words of motivation will help further in my cause. It's because of this subreddit that I have come this far. Thanks for letting me share this here.

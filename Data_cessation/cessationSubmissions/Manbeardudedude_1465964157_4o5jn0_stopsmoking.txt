Just had my last cigarette ever.

Hey guys. :)

Let's just get this out of the way, I need to reset my badge, I know, and hey, it's been awhile! 

I'm going to sleep now, and tomorrow I'm going to wake up a non-smoker. Last time I quit this community was a HUGE part in my success, don't ask me why, I have no reason to please you guys, but it did. Positive reinforcement is the best cure for addiction. 

I have only smoked for 7 years now, just turned 25 on the 12th, and started smoking a couple months before my 18th birthday. So it hasn't been a life long habit, but damn this addiction is one hell of a villain. 

I'm looking forward to feeling better about my life, about my health (I know I'm young but let me vent here a bit, haha) and being alive to see my little girl get married, even though she can't date until she's 40. So I have to live for awhile. ;) 

Looking forward to your guys' positivity! See you on the other side! Hopefully I check in randomly, and can one day post some milestones! 

Here's to living! *clink*

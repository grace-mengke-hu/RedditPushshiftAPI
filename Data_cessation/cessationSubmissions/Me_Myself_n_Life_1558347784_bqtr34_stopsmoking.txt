TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK

I believe that our subconscious minds have been told for decades that "I can't quit" or "Il start on patches or gum and Il wean myself off slowly until one day im strong enough" YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH RIGHT NOW ! When Ur told something for long enough U start believing it ! Iv not had a smoke in 1 month and 5 days now and it has been surprisingly easy ! Don't get me wrong, first 3 days I felt like death would be easier but once withdrawals were gone I decided to tell that evil little craving monster to FUCK OFF !!! I very rarely get cravings now and haven't had a nasty one in over 2 weeks ! Which I breathed long deep breaths thru and smashed it ... To pieces !! My willpower is growing every day and I amaze myself every day with how easy it has been !! Please believe me, once Ur mind is on the quit wagon Ur body will follow !!! The human mind is amazing so let's turn the tables and start believing in ourselves and not what we've been fed for decades ! Tell yourself that U r strong and worth every ounce of this pain to b smoke free !! It does work im proof !! Wish U all the very best STAY STRONG BE AWESOME AND SMOKE FREE LIKE ME !!

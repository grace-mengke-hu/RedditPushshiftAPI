Coughing - is it normal?

Nearly 3 weeks a non smoker after 40 years. After a couple of days my wheezing at night and coughing seemed to clear up, to my surprise, but now my cough has returned. Is this normal. The cough is a bit phlegmy (sorry to be so descriptive)  but I don't bring much phlegm up.

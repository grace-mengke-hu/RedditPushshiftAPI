15 days free of Nicotine(Use this as motivation)

Fifteen days ago I was extremely addicted to nicotine. I would vape 50nic from a Sourin. Would go through 2 ml a day (Equivilent to 2 packs of cigarettes based on nicotine content). It all started 4 years ago when I was a junior when I started to dip, and it started to be an every day habbit untill I quit dipping in September of 2017 and I decided to buy a juul.

My vaping problem was starting to be tough on my body. I always felt on edge, always felt wired.

Then I made the decision to quit, and to change my life around. These 15 days have been sober from all stimulants. I feel absolutely amazing.

I now have a girlfriend, we started talking 3 weeks ago, and I used her as my motivation to quit, because nicotine often caused me Impotence. Now I feel insanely healthy in all aspects of my life. I know I can't contribute all of these effects to nicotine abstinence. But what I can tell you guys is that your mind is powerful, and it can do and change things if you truely believe in yourself.

I don't have cravings anymore. I know that everyone is different, but it really was not that hard for me.

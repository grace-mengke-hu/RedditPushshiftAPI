How do I get my mom to quit?

I quit around 4 months ago after reading Allen Carr book, (Thank you all you guys by the way for helping me). My mom have like 30 years smoking and I very afraid for her health, that was a strong reason for me to quit. I give her the book for her birthday 2 months ago but she hasn't even touched it. She always says she has not time to read and make all kinds of excuses. I don't really know how to get her to read it and quit. Any ideas? Thank You in advance.

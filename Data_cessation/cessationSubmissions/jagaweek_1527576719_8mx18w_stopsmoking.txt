Advice needed

I am 21 years old and i have been smoking since i was 14 years old. But for the last 2 years i have been smoking nearly 2 packs a day(Because i am under a lot of pressure from my school and my exams). And i am feeling the bad sides of it. I have noticed my heart rate is much more elevated than it used to. 
I want to quit, or at least reduce it.
I tried quitting before and the hardest part is that when i am sitting at home i feel something is missing, smoking was an activity that i could do for hours.
I tried vaping aswell but it just wasn't the same.
What would be your advice for me, what can i do and what can i improove?
Any help is appreciated.

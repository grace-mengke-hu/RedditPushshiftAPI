Cravings

I'm really proud of myself for making it this far but lately I have been having super cravings for a smoke.  I know it is all cause the weather has turned nice and my hubby and I usually spend our spring/summers hanging out in the garage and reading talking and this is the first time around that I am no longer able to do that.  Just really wanted to vent I guess and I know I will get through it.  Hopefully as the nice weather sticks around and I have more days under my belt it will get easier.  It will be nice to go to a family reunion in July and for the first time I won't have to find time to sneak away for a cigarette.  Will make family time that much more fun.  Keep it up everyone, I can go for days now and not think about having one.  The weather is just playing with my mind for a bit.

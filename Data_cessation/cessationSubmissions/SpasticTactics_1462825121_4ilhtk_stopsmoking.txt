I quit smoking 3 days ago

I've switched to (please spare me you're hate) vaping as a way to ween myself off the old cancer stick. Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I'm also an iOS user so if you know of any apps, or iPhone tricks that might help, hit me with those as well. 

Now, how do I get some damn flare around here?

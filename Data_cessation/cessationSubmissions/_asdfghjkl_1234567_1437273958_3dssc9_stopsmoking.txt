To those who are/have quit via vaping...

Get down to 0mg. 

I had an argument with a vape friend a few days ago. He had forgot his vape at home and was freaking out. Never stepped down, was still at 18mg, and him and I had a long drive ahead of us (after work where there is no smoking, then a 4 hour drive.. So 12+ hours for him). To me, that's not a non-smoker (semantics really. He's not a non-tobacco..er). He's been at 18mg for 2 years now. 

It was the most grouchy and miserably drive of my life. Being in the car with him made my 42 days seem like nothing and made me even crave a smoke break from him (I didn't). I technically have a vape system and don't even keep it with me... I would have handed over all of my stuff after that day. 

So when you switch from cigs to vaping, remember you have to step down. Quit being addicted to shit for no reason. 

So, while I disagree with the vape-hate on this sub, I will agree that it CAN be a substitute addiction. I saw it first hand.

Be smart, quit smoking, quit doing anything you're addicted too, live a happy life.

Day Two Clean and Taking Chantix (aka "Reasons Why Chantix Should be Your Last Resort")

**Background**
I'm now past the 24 hour mark clean. I've been taking Chantix for a week and a half. Guys and gals, I'm sure you've heard it, but don't take it unless you need to. My brain chemistry profile is as follows: diagnosed ADHD with slight mood disorder (that I apparently handle well), trouble falling asleep, anger problems. For me, it seems as if Chantix has exacerbated all of these except the ADHD. Some say the slight mood disorder and bad sleep hygiene are commonly associated with ADHD, so draw your own conclusion on that one. I've noticed some **things while on Chantix**:

* It has affected my dreams, as commonly reported. Normally they're not horrible dreams, however they seem impossibly vivid. 

* My anger is exponentially harder to control. The girl I'm seeing right now was the victim of this yesterday. She said some mild things and I went off the deep end. I've made leaps and bounds in managing this, and Chantix makes it seem like I've done nothing. The good news is that I'll hopefully be that much more in control when I come off. 

* My caffeine intake has increased somewhat due to the fact that I'm always tired. I'm yawning constantly.

* The sex isn't as good. 

* I have drastic but manageable mood swings. I go from an almost euphoric state to a blah state a couple times a day. 

* At my most angry, I've had to fight hard to stay in control and not do something that would have been *seriously* bad. I stayed in control. And I will continue to do so. At times I honestly feel a tidbit psychotic. If I have any evidence of an inability to absolutely control myself, I will seek help. I'm a self-interested individual and I'm not about to do anything to ruin my future. 

* I'm not sure about you all, but I know running and physical exercise does absolute wonders for my mood and for my relapse resistance. The farther I run, the more I lose if I pick it up again. 

**Why I'm Taking Chantix**
I've used Chantix 2 times before and am familiar with the side effects. I knew what I was getting into. I've tried cold turkey once and will never do that again unless I can chain myself to a wall for two weeks. I was an absolute mess. The Chantix makes it easier, but there *are* costs associated with the benefit for most. If you're thinking about quitting, try cold turkey first. If you don't absolutely lose your shit, go that route. 

**A Tip**: Try melatonin if you have trouble staying asleep while on Chantix. Two 1mg pills remedied this problem perfectly for me.

**Edit 1**: I apologized profusely to the girl I'm seeing and she knows the situation. She's an angel for staying after how I acted yesterday. I'm mindful to not do that again.

And today begins my long journey... any advice?

I've been building up to this for a while, and today I've finally decided to quit for real. I've tried a few times in the past, but I never had the motivation to do it - however, this morning, after climbing a staircase that felt like Everest, I finally realised enough is enough. Not to mention I'm only 19 and have been smoking for 4 years - I want to kick this habit now before I take it into my life with me.

No more weighing up the choices between buying lunch or a pack of smokes.

No more brushing my teeth, scrubbing my hands with dish soap and changing my clothes every time I want to visit my parents.

No more coughing and shortness of breath at the slightest physical activity.

NO MORE SMOKING!

Sorry if that got a bit rant-y, but this is for me. I'm gonna save this thread, and if I ever feel like I'm about to slip I'll come back and remind myself why I chose to stop.

I'm a non-smoker. F#@& YEAH!!!

This is my victory dance. 

When I was 23, I watched my father die of lung cancer. I had already been smoking a pack a day for a year at that point. I got up to two packs a day for a few years, then quit from 31-35, before starting again when I dated a girl who smoked. 

Now at 37, 15 years after my first drag, and after more attempts at quitting than I can remember, I said enough is enough. I've had it with these motherfucking cigarettes ruining my motherfucking life. 

I read Allen Carr's book cover to cover yesterday. After that, I smoked my last cigarette, making sure to savor how shitty it tasted, to feel the buildup in my lungs and veins, to truly acknowledge that I wasn't getting a single benefit from standing outside in the cold, literally burning 50-cents worth of paper and toxic chemicals between my fingers, already stained yellow from years of smoking un-flitered. 

I crushed the remnants of that last cig under my boot, and knew then and there that I wasn't going to try and quit smoking. Fuck that. I knew that I already was a non-smoker. It was that simple. 

And you know what? I feel fine today. I've gone through withdrawal before, but this time it's different. I'm in a place of peace, I'm not scared, and that little urge that I'm feeling in the back of my head? It's actually not that bad. Life is good today, better than it's been in years. It's only going to get even better still, because I'm a non-smoker. FUCK YEAH!!

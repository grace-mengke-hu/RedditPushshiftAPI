3 days in

Hi all, new to this sub but not so new to Reddit. 

Started smoking when I was around 21yo (29 now), and was finally able to quit in October 2014 for a period of about 9 months. I was incredibly proud of myself and had never felt better. However, the typical "oh, one won't hurt" mindset reared it's ugly head during social events/fitting in at work, and I was back up to about 10-15 a day in no time. 

Finally decided to quit again this week (having a pretty bad cold has made it a bit easier). I'm now 3 days in and feeling pretty good. I know it gets better, so I believe I'm finally in this one for the long haul. Great to be here. :)

The Snoo & a Cold Turkey

I have been smoking cigarettes and weed everyday for about 7 years now. Today is the day I change my life and quit cold turkey! I have tried many approaches and have quit several times. I feel very weak for letting something as powerless as paper n grass control my life the way it has. Would love to hear any inspirational comments or suggestions.


On another note - I mod for the subreddit /r/redditlogos and have a small problem with your Snoo. When I **used** to step on a cig, I always focused on putting out the lit end. Made 2 variations if anyone feels the same way. Thanks for creating an amazing sub and helping those who need it!

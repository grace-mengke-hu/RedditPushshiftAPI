Got Motivated to Intermittent Fasting But Cannot Stop Smoking? Any Motivations

I started intermittent fasting on 8th august. From 66.7 , now i am 63.6Kg . However, I tried to stop smoking too hoping to invest the cost of cigratte on gym and food. :D 

Actually i used to smoke 20+ cigs per day. I could not last 5-6 hour before. Now I can do it but intermittent fasting irritates me and smoke with tea or coffee. So what suggestions can you guys give me?

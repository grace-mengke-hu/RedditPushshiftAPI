I now know why smoking addiction is compared to heroin addiction

The common factor in both is it gets hard to enjoy other things as well. Partying isn't as fun as it used to when I smoked, social gatherings are more dull, everything just seems shittier without that supplemental smoke. Its as if quitting drains the reward out of rewarding things because the smokes used to supply a reward on top of all those rewards, giving a heightened pleasure sensation.

I though the cravings would be gone by now but they aren't. They persist in the form of not being able to enjoy the things I used to, thus killing motivation to do things. At least not optimally. If I break its because I'm worried I'll never fully enjoy things again.

Anyone relate? How to get over this shit?

15 days so far so good

I still do not feel healthy though, but i was just reading the effects of not smoking after certain lengths of time o. The mayo clinics site.  1 hour up to 15 years.  Sounds good to me.  It says that you are back as if you never smoked after 15 years.  So its not to late for me.  Ill only be 67.  Ive been reading this sub everyday.  I think it helps.  Thanks and good luck to all!

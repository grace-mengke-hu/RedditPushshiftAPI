Quitting with chest infection

Hi everyone and well done on your individual achievements! I hope you feel fantastic! I was just wandering if anyone had any advice on quitting with a chest infection? Obviously it sounds like common sense but will withdrawals make the infection feel worse? Ive been smoke free for 2 days (not long i know) and had a chest infection for about a week. I do feel better but obviously the infection is still in my system. Any advice?

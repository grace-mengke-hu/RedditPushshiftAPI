Just some encouraging words

Hello all,

I have been smoke free since Aug. 1st this year. 54 days free from smelling disgusting. I just have some thoughts that I would like to put here. First off, a few days ago, I had a bad day---arguing with my mind. I overcame it though and am so proud of myself for not caving.

It does get better, the physical withdrawals may be intense but they are over pretty quickly. I smoked a pack a day for 15 years, and after the 3rd day with no nicotine I was fine from a physical point.

I have adapted to thinking of the psychological addiction in terms of a quilt. I know it seems funny, I read this years ago...I don't recall where I seen the article, however, it helps me tremendously to think this way.... 

Think of a huge woven quilt, the quilt is my/your life. Each time we smoked, little fibers-so tiny- weaved themselves around our beautiful yarn, sucking the color (life) out. 

For me, 15 years at a pack a day so roughly 109,500 times I had a cig. Each cigarette had..IDK about 20-30 puffs so thats...3,285,000 times that those microscopic fibers bound themselves to the quilt of my life.

When we decide to quit, and stick to our decision, those little fibers start to unwind and the color starts to come back to the quilt....vibrant and beautiful as it should be!

Healing takes time and in this case experience. We have to relearn how to live basically. I am just putting this here to remind everyone to stay proud and vigilant, and to also go easy on yourself and reward every victory! 

I have to remind myself to not be so hard on me, because that is A LOT of fibers to dwindle away.

Thank you for the read and stay strong fam!

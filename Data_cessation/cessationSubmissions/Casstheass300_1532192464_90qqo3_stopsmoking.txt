Trigger people??

Are trigger people a thing? There is one person that just drives me up the wall. When I first met her I would smoke a lot because she made me anxious and stressed out. Now ten years later I am quitting but when I see her or she tries to "help" it has the opposite effect. All her well meaning unsolicited advice... arrrrggg. I can't cut her out of my life even  temporarily because she's living with us until next month. I've told her that I need some space to get through these first few days but she keeps coming at me. She doesn't smoke. How do y'all deal with trigger people? Just one of those things I have to manage? Any advice would be awesome. TIA.

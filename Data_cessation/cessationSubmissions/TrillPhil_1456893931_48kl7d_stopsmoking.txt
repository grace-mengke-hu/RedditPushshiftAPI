I've stopped smoking several times...

This last time I've smoked for about 3 years. I'd stopped for over a year before I started back up.

Today I smoked one cigarette around noon, yesterday it was 3. The day before that was 5 or 6.

I've none left and really want to go get a pack but have decided to post here instead.

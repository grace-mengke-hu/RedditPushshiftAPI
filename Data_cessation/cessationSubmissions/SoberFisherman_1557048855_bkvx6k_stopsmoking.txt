Day one complete

I woke up with that horrible headache feeling, nose clogged and foggy brain. My morning ritual has been starting with some hot coffee brewing and rolling up a couple of cigarettes. Then puffing them down. Cough cough cough spiting up the day before lung and throat juice. But today I did something different because of last night I could not get to sleep until 4am. I woke up late this morning. About 9am. And just kept saying no no no smoke. Put my shoes on and drive myself to the water walk path around (2 km path way with nice veiws) and just stayed there for a couple of hours. Before I knew it was 12pm so I went to McDonald's and grabbed some food to eat. Then went and ate that, then went for another long walk. So basically it was like 2pm and I just kept myself busy for the rest of the afternoon cleaning my unit, then another drive and short walk at sunset. I made it! I had thoughts to smoke but I had to fight! Thanks.

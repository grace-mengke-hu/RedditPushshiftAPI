Day 2 and am nervous about tomorrow!

Hey guys! I’m a 27/f with a beautiful little girl I want to be around a LONG time for. Been a 1/2 pack a day smoker for almost 10 years and finally quit on Friday. I’ve worked the past 2 days and my first day off since quitting is tomorrow. I’m nervous that not having anything to keep me busy will cause me to cave. Any advice?

I forgot to put a new patch on..should I just go cold turkey?

I wrote last night about how I use the patch and how I almost cheated. Well, I took a bath early this morning and I forgot to put a new patch on. I took the old one off, but I forgot to replace it. I just remembered it now. With all the talk about using the patch...should I just go cold turkey now or continue with my patches. I have about a month's supply left. I'm a little scared, but I didn't notice for like 8 hours that I didn't have it on. I'm thinking about leaving it off and quitting nicotine all together. What do you think I should do?

Edit: I made it the first day without the patch! I'm having some cravings, but not really what I would say is withdrawal. I kind of feel the same. I have moments when I want a cigarette, but those moments are getting fewer. It's really not so bad without the patch. I'll update if I run into some bumps. Thanks for all the support! I appreciate it! :)

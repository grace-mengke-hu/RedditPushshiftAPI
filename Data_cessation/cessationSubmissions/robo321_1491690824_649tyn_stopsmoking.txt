I Just crumpled up my last 7 cigarettes. I'm ready to quit.

This is my first ever post so I hope I'm doing this right but anyway, I'm ready to quit this nasty addiction once and for all!!!!
I've been smoking for almost 15 years(32 now) and I want to give it up, It's really been effecting my health and it doesn't help that i'm overweight too. I've been eating better and slowly jog/walking the last couple of weeks though. Sex drive is definitely low as well.
I'm just tired of the dependence of cigarettes and I've had enough.

I really need to quit this time and I'm calling on Reddit to support me so i can get past this nasty habit for good!!!!I'm taking the e-cig route, I bought it last night and been using it today and only had 3 cigs in a 12 hour period with it so I just said fuck it and threw the rest away . I'M GOING TO QUIT!!!!! I know it's going to be hard but I'm going to quit, I've given up so much because of it and I can't do it anymore.

WISH ME LUCK!!!!

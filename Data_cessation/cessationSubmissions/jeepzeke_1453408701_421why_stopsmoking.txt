Day 7 has been the worst

Ok, So I've stopped before and I knew what to expect, days 1 to 4 sucks rocks and then it gets better. Not this time though. Its been fairly easy until today. Its been one 8 hour long craving so far. Why is this? I know no quits are alike..yada yada yada. Guess I'm just bitching because I thought I was going to have it easy this time around. Sigh.

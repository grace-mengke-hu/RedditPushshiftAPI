Once an addict always an addict?

I was having drinks with some new friends last night, and one of the girls was a smoker. They knew I used to smoke and had to ask if I wanted one (out of courtesy). I said no of course but as the night progressed (and as I got more drunk) it was increasingly tempting to ask for one.

My brain was trying to cheat me. It didn't help that I couldn't think straight. It was telling me that I was too drunk, that I needed to smoke *just* one in order to wake up and find my way home later. It was inventing all sorts of excuses, like its the holiday season, that a single stick wouldn't hurt my health that badly etc.

The funny thing is that I have been clean for the last 8 months. But when I'm intoxicated, faced with someone smoking so close to me and breathing secondhand smoke, I am amazed how fast the urge is triggered. Luckily for me we had to wrap up before I had the chance to ask. I knew that if I did smoke again I would be utterly disappointed with myself the next day. I'm just glad that it didn't happen and I'm going to be more vigilant next time.

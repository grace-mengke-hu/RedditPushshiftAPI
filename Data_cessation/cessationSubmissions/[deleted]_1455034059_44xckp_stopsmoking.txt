Day 4. First day at work.

Cravings are not so bad at the moment. I feel like my brain is off though. Like my brain is not functioning at full capacity. I realize that's part of the trick nicotine plays on you. I dedicated my entire weekend to quitting smoking. Friday Night I smoked my last one and washed all my clothes and blankets. I read Allen Carr's book which everyone recommended. The next day I spent a good couple hours cleaning out my car. It was disgusting. There were ashes everywhere, under and on the side of the seats and even though I vacuumed as best I could and aired everything out the smell still lingers a little bit. Yesterday there was a snow storm which allowed me to stay home from work and get another day in to get my mind ready. I've gotta do this I don't want to be addicted to this disgusting habit any longer. I considered NRT and vaping but I decided I want to be done with this substance (nicotine) period.

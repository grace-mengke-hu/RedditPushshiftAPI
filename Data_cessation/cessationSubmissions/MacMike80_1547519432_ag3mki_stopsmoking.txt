On day 14- toughest day so far

I am about 4 hours away from completing two whole weeks without smoking.  Today has not been easy by any stretch of the imagination.  Actually, it has been the toughest day so far.  I have been wanting a cigarette all day, seriously all day!  I’ve been thinking about how nice it would be to take a long drag off my old Winston’s.  I don’t know why- I didn’t have a difficult day at work, or anything.  I wasn’t bored- I had plenty of work to do but wasn’t difficult.  I just kept thinking how giddy I would get w smoking a cig, and how good I would feel.  
The only thing that stopped me was thinking of my mom.  I was at her house yesterday and she asked how long it had been since my last cig- I showed her the counter on the app and she got so excited and happy.  I would be disappointing her if I made it this far and picked up cigs again.  I hope this is the final gasp that Nic has on me.  Something tells me it’s not, but that if I don’t give in now I won’t give in tomorrow or the next day, or the next, and so on. 
Not another puff, no matter what.  (Weird- just typing that put some kind of resolve in me).
I AM a non-smoker.  
For everyone else out there- we can do this.

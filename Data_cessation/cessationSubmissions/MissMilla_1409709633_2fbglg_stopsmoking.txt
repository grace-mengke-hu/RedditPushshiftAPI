Idea for a NRT Brand: would love your opinion.

Hey everyone, my company is proposing an idea to a Nicotine Replacement Therapy brand. We want to help people who purchase their NRT product to successfully quit.

I was wondering your opinions on it -  whether you'd think it would help (or how it might be improved)? 


THE IDEA: 

Given the NRT products can take up to a minute to actually take effect, (and smokers have told us this feels like an eternity), we thought that it might be useful to provide something engaging to do, with your hands in that time. 

So, what if there was an APP, which had a series of high-quality games, designed to last 50 seconds at a time (think like a timed-Candy Crush). 

These would be designed to get you through those 50 seconds it can take for the NRT to quell the cravings. And it might even have images from friends/family supporting you when you reach particular scores. Plus, you could share top scores when you reach them.

 
What do you think? Is it stupid? Is it something you'd use? Any builds?

Day 2 again

So here I am a again at day 2 after slipping on day 7 last time.  Honestly when I went back to smoking this time I was like wtf did I stop and I should never try again.  Then I went to the gym and OMG, my chest hurt so much that I was like wtf am I still doing smoking these things?  

So here I am aging on day 2.  Looking forward to seeing 7 days again and beyond. :)

Two and a half months cig free, thanks to my wisdom teeth.

I got my wisdom teeth taken out about two and a half months ago. I wasn't supposed to smoke for a week, but I did anyway. It led to this thing called dry socket, which hurt like hell. The oral surgeon gave it a fix but warned me to follow his directions to not smoke for a week. Not wanting to experience that kind of pain again I followed his advice. Going a week without smoking was a lot easier than I thought. It felt really good. I just felt cleaner. I got lucky and didn't get the shakes or anything like that (maybe it had to do with the medication they had me taking). I told myself after I got medically cleared to enlist back in August that I would quit smoking before I leave for boot camp this summer, so I took this as an opportunity and just went with it. I didn't have to have any gum, patches, or switch to vaping, it feels great. I no longer feel dirty all the time, but the biggest thing I've noticed is all the money I've saved. I've been wanting to try to quit for so long, I'm just really thrilled that this did the trick for me. I have no intentions of starting again. Hurray for dry socket!

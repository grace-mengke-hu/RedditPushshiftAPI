Third time is the charm!!! Day 1

Hi guys.

I'm quitting again, for the third time within an year. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first times two times i quit, i've let myself lose to tentation within 18 days and 22 days  respectively  , so i've figured it out that the 3 weeks period is my most dificult time.

&amp;#x200B;

This time im focusing in an month, if a can get to the month period in sure i can continue to fight through.

&amp;#x200B;

 I always knew it wouldn't be easy, but coming here and reading all about people that made it to 1 year, 5 years, give me the boost in strentgh to want to do it again

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading, just wanted to write about it.

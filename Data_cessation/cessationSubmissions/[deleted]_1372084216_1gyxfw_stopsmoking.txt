Our smoking is the cause of some serious financial problems. Need help!

My SO and are smokers. We live together and have a beautiful little girl. We both work for the same school district and only get paid once every month. So here's our problem: we're spending about $250/month on cigarettes and we wind up being completely broke with two weeks left until payday. For this reason I have recently been putting a lot of effort into quitting. I'll go all day without one and then cave after my daughter's gone to bed. My SO on the other hand has made very little effort to quit. He says he wants to but a part of him doesn't. I completely understand where he's coming from. I don't want to quit either! But we HAVE to.. there are no other options. The only way we will ever get out of this financial hole we've dug ourselves into is if we quit smoking. How do I explain to him how important this is? I've tried many times but nothing seems to work. Please help!

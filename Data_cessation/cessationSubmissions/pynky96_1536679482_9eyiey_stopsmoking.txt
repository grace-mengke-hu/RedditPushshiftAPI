Im ready to quit but i need help

Hello, I'm 23 I've been smoking an average of 2-3 packs day for 10 years, I want to quit, I need to quit. I making this change because of financial and health reasons. I also chew and I'm thinking of going to that vape stuff everyone does now a days. Last night was my first time at work I didn't go to smoke every hour, I left my cigarettes and lighter at home... It felt great but as soon as I got home I had to have one, I've been home for about 2 hours and I've had like 3 which is a good start,but  How can I do better? Is vaping a good way to go. I'm affraid to go cold turkey because I get really anxious and I work graveyard at a convenient store. Chew helps alot to take the edge off but I want to stop that too. Help?

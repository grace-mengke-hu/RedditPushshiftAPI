SO much is happening!

I am a very calm, chill person. Last couple days have been ridiculous. I am constantly pacing, lost in my own mind, focusing on the cravings. I'm convinced I can do this, however.

My co-workers, with whom I normally smoke, are asking me (at least once daily) "you still quit?" I am still quit! I hate my life and I hate everyone around me, but I'm quit dammit! Haha.

I hope everyone else who is on the quit grind with me is plugging into support and being honest with themselves/others. Feel free to tap into me, as a young, hurting quitter if you are having trouble quitting. I think sharing our thoughts and sharing the burden of anxiety is good for easing the mind.

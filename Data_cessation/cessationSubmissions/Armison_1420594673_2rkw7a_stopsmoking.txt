TIL that smoking impairs healing of bone fractures.

I went to the doctor today and found out I had fractured my big toe in two places. When she asked if I smoke, I told her I had quit two years ago. She said that was good because otherwise it would take longer for the fractures to heal.

I thought I had already discovered all of the benefits of quitting, but there's one more to add to my list. Smoking seems to be bad for pretty much every part of the body.

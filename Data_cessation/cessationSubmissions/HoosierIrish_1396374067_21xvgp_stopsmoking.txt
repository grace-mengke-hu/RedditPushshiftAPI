Today I quit smoking!!

Today I have officially quit smoking! I know its April Fools day, but this is no joke. I smoked my last cig last night and so far I am doing really good. I have used tobacco products since I was 18, and I tried once before cold turkey and failed after 2 weeks. So here is to a health life of non smoking!

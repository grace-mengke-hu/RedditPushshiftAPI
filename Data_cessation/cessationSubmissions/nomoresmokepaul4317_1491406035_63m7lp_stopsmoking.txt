72 hours at 8 PM

Last smoke on 4/2 @ 8 PM. First 24 hours not so good. Yesterday Brutal. This morning has been tough but slightly better. I can think a bit clearer. Hopefully this is a trend! From what I understand at 72 hours I will be clear of nicotine. My past experiences it gets less painful around then.

Foods to help quit smoking

Hey everyone. I have been smoking now for several years, and am really hoping that this quit attempt is my final one. I was wondering if anyone knows of any foods that help take away cravings to smoke? I have heard before that cranberry juice can be very effective. Any suggestions? Thanks!

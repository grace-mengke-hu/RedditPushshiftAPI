New to this trying to figure out who I am as a non smoker

Hi,
  I’m almost through day 4 and am feeling better physically but my main struggle is psychological. I’ve smoked since I was 13 and am now 36. It’s been a significant portion of my life, almost as long as I can remember. My struggle is finding myself as a non smoker. I don’t ever really remember a day in my life where smoking did not play a role.  I feel down and completely not myself without it. I know it doesn’t define me but it has been a part of me for such a long time I feel sort of lost without it. Guess I’m just on here looking for someone who has been through something similar maybe who made it to the light at the end of the tunnel because I can see it i just am worried i won’t get to it. I understand the benefit and want to quit obviously but still having some quitters remorse. Thanks for any support and best of luck to all of you.

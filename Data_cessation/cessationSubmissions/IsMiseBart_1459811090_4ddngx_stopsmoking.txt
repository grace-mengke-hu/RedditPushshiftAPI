Need motivation

I quit smoking before Christmas and got to 3 weeks before I broke. This sub helped a lot. I've decided enough is enough and to tackle it again and take up jogging. This morning I went for a jog and felt so much better and I haven't smoked until 10:30 p.m. I am quite disappointed in myself that I already smoked even if it was only one at the end of the day. Im basically fishing for motivation here

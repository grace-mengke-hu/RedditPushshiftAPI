I was distraught!

Two months ago I came on here looking for help. I had an appointment to donate blood, but during the health screening my blood pressure was so high, the nurse almost sent me away. I quit smoking that night! Today I donated blood again and my top number is down 22 points!! Thank you to everyone on this sub

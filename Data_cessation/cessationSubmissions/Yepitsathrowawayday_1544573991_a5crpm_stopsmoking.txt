Herbal Cigarettes

Hello all. 
Iâ€™m a fairly new smoker who has been smoking for over a year or thereabouts and want to quit. I have probably smoked a couple packs of cigarettes in that time(considered myself a social smoker), and am wondering if herbal cigarettes would still be considered as harmful as regular cigarettes. 

Can anyone offer me some information on herbal cigarettes and if they are any bit safer? And could they be used as a quitting aid? Thanks.

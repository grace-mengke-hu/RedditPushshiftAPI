Caved after day 3.

Fuck me, I don’t know what to say. This is extremely difficult. I do not feel good about myself. 

3 days was the longest time I’ve been without in 5 years and I messed it all up. 

I sound like a beggar but can someone offer me some words of encouragement? I have no ego and I feel fucking weak. I’d rather hear it from strangers than from my loved ones at this point.

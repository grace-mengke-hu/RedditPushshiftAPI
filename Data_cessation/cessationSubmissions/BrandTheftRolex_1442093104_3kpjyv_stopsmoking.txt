150 day check in.

It's been a while since I last checked in here.  It seems long ago when I was within my first two weeks of cold turkey quitting, checking in 3 or 4 or 5 or 10 times per day, seeking advice, finding reassurance, expressing my thoughts, etc.  I used to smoke heavily for 20 years, with 30 cigs per day average when I started my quit.  This sub helped me so much to get through the difficult early stage of withdrawal and helped me to avoid relapse.

It is now 150 days later and I rarely even think about cigarettes.  When I do, its only a fleeting thought that I easily push aside as I just get on with my smoke free life.  The quality of my life has extraordinarily improved in so many different ways, both physically and mentally.  I'm so proud of myself and I'm so happy with the changes that have happened to me.  At this point I find the idea of smoking almost incomprehensible and repugnant which is funny really because 5 months ago, I couldn't go 30 minutes without a cigarette.

I don't consider myself an ex smoker anymore.  I am a non smoker.   It was a journey of self discovery and a challenge to get to this point but I've done it.  You can do it too!

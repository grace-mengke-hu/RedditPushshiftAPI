Amazing to notice just how much damage my 35 year habit resulted in. Hoping its not too late as the lung tissue is irreparably damaged. Needs lots of lung TLC right now. 
Worst part is when upset or angry but I'm managing fine without a fag to get me through it.
I won't go back because I know too much now. Enough is enough!

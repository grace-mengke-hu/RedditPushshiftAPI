Well, I’m inspired

I’ve always planned on quitting...eventually. But it’s always been “after this difficult class ends” “after I lose more weight since I know I’ll gain weight when I quit” etc. 
I realized the excuses will never end. There will never be a time that feels right, I just have to do it. So I’m doing it. Day 1.

One week in... Cravings aren't that bad

hey guys 
i'm proud be 7 days in now. It isn't hard actually... Sometimes i think about smoking but it doesn't destroy my mindset in the slightest. I nearly dont suffer any urge to smoke. 

I want to reach that point where i don't even think about cigarettes anymore. I want them absolutely disappear in my life. 

I suffered from dizziness actually ... It sucks i hope that i'm starting to feel better fast. I want to realize the benefits from not smoking more heavily

Look at this sweet badge!

I made it seven days! I can't believe it! The mental fog has lifted and the mood swings have eased off mostly!

I can smell things with more depth than before. Even eating is a miracle now, with the subtlety of flavor coming out in things in a way that I forgot can happen.

It is said that a healthy tongue is also a strong indicator of your overall health, and mine is looking better than it has been IN A LONG TIME TOO.

I can't wait to see what I'm going to do next.

Anger issues after quitting.

I've been coasting along pretty well, but I've noticed that I'm a lot more easily set off this week. All my life I've been pretty easily irritated, whether it be due to my anxiety, or relative introversion, or frustrating work situations. *cough* I am a female and the PMS symptoms seem to be amplified right now as well. 

How do you all deal with your irritability? Have you found that your inner Hulk has come back with a vengeance?

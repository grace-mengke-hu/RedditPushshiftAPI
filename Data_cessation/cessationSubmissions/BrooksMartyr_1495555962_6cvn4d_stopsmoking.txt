Unplanned day six

I flew out to Kansas City for a wedding with my family and I forgot my smokes at home. As busy as I was being in the wedding party I just kind of forgot to ever take a smoke break. I made it to six days. Now I'm back at home and the cravings have started to turn their ugly head. Haven't caved in but it's a bit more than I expected. How do people ignore or fight through the cravings? And ew I can handle. Every 20 minutes or so is getting exhausting.

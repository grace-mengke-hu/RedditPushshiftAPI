Does anyone feel that they are now permanently moodier?

I quit around ten months ago. I've been using a vape and it's been pretty good.  
  
I was hella moody just after I quit for two weeks or so and then that kind of abated.   
It seems to me now that I'm a lot moodier in general than when I was smoking. In a way I feel like smoking made me a nicer person. In reality I think it's because smoking makes you its slave and you have these little ups and downs that regulate you.   
  
You get these little dopamine rewards and as long as you continue to smoke, everything is good.   
  
I don't intend to start again but I've been thinking about this effect lately.
    
*EDIT* Ok I'm going to step down my nicotine levels and quit the vape. I just used it for the first time today after trying to see if I can cut it out and holy crap yeah I'm still addicted to nicotine. It literally felt like smoking an analogue.  
I think I, my body and mind, has this constant tension because of the addiction. Analogues just kind of blast it away when you're a smoker but with a vape you're kind of, but not quite addressing that tension but you're drip feeding yourself. The only way around it is to stop completely.

5 days without cigarettes! Teeth getting white again. (Not yet, but...)

Hey guys!

After I struggled to stop smoking last monday and continued the journey by starting to vape on Wednesday, I think I‘ve finally found a way that fits me right. 

Basically, I went to this vape shop in my area (you know these things, flashy neon lights, people with purple hair, smells like Bob Marley‘s living room). 
I wanted to find an electric cigarette suitable to replace my pack a day, without busting the bank. There was a lady at the counter and about 5 other guys who looked like they were working there, but didn‘t, or did they? Boy. 

The lady in the shop was the real deal. Told me I had a pretty face, if I live here, next thing I know is I‘m standing at the counter, holding a small pen with the name and looks of a freakin‘ motorbike at 55€. Crap. 

Anyway, I‘d like to recommend this to anyone who wants to stop without losing half his manliness in the rebounds. Honestly, this is beautiful, I don‘t crave for a cigarette at all, even though I went down in Nicotine today. 
You just take that stupid thing out once every two or three hours, vape for a little while and go back to not smoking again. 
It don‘t hurt your teeth, don‘t hurt your gums, don‘t make you stink like you just fell through the fucking chimney (even though you look like one when you exhale that stuff) and it‘s cheap if you buy those liquids on the internet.

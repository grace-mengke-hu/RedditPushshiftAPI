I need to quit

I'm gonna try and go for it tonight. Just had what I hope to be my last one, but for personal, work, and health reasons I really need to quit. My doctor even said "It's imperative that I quit". I might come around here looking for support if that's okay, but I'm afraid of telling people irl and failing... again. Thanks in advance for reading.

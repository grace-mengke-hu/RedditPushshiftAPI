I might be in the clear!

I have been lurking for the past week after a friend told me about this subreddit. We both have smoked for some time now (well, for me, only a year) and though he has quit smoking several times in the past (or took breaks rather), I wasn't sure it was even possible for me. I am now almost at one week without a cigarette!!! 

Though the urge to smoke isn't completely gone, it has been pushed to the back of my head and is slowly subsiding. I am a lot more happier, can breathe better, and have less concentration problems. 

In the week that I have not smoked, I have noticed some funny side effects. 

Dreams have become vivid, lots of blood, and fantastical situations

Tightness in chest (I assume to be mini anxiety/panic attacks) occur when I think about how I "NEED" a cigarette.

I find myself rationalizing that "oh you made it this far, lets have a celebration cig! It's okay!" Although I never go through with it, I hope it goes away.

 I also fear getting drunk or going to social events where many of my friends smoke because I don't want to cave.

I find some smoke smells delectable still (esp when some people smell faintly like smoke)

I find some cig smoke to be repulsive and kind of wanted to puke at the time.

I have also noticed that my wallet doesn't get smaller by the day. :D

On the up side, I feel my overall wellness has improved. I no longer find myself using smoking as a distraction from school work, much more is accomplished. 

Anyways, I just thought I'd share with you all. 

STAY STRONG MEN AND WOMEN.

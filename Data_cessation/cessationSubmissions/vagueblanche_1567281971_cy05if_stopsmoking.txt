I just broke down in tears because I feel like I am condemned to keep smoking until I die

There was one time when I managed to quit for one year. After numerous, desperate attempts; Allen Carr was my big help.

But for more than a year, I've been smoking again. I've reread Easyway and Onlyway more times than I can count. I can probably recite everything word for word.

I have all the motivation. The determination. Goals. Things to look forward to.
But... it just never feels right. It never feels the same as back then. The second I extinguish that last cigarette, I already feel like it is a sacrifice. 

Back then when I actually managed to quit, I was looking forward to it. *I didn't even have to try*. I didn't struggle for one single second. I never looked back. It was amazing. *It all just made sense*.

But now, no matter how rational I try to be, or how much I try to tell myself that smoking is not enjoyable whatsoever, none of it works anymore. I can't seem to convince myself that I don't want to smoke. The more I try to force myself to see things that way, the more I think "IDGAF, I'd freaking love a cigarette right now". 

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Using willpower makes me want to just kill myself. And using Allen's method was the only thing that ever worked for me. But even that doesn't work anymore.


What hopes of quitting do I have now?

I'm giving myself a binge week for the first two weeks of quitting the cigs.

I gain weight whenever I try to quit smoking, pick up the cancer sticks again, get disgusted with smelling like an ashtray, quit again..and the cycle continues. So I figured I should tackle my diet and stopping smoking separately. Kick the smoking habit first and just indulge myself on food for a few weeks (the first few weeks are the hardest, so I've heard.)

Has anyone tried this approach before?

Indian Independence day resolution! Freedom from Smoking today..

Honestly, this is not my first time. But I am up again! This time on independence day of my country. 
This time what freedom means most to me is quit smoking. I had been smoking more than a pack a day since last 6 months. I recently developed ache in my lungs, god knows if that's heart or what :-/. I had smoked after materbation which was so sad. 

It's 4 AM here, a new beginning is about to start with sunrise. Moreover, I'll be flying tomorrow to meet my gf tomorrow (another source of my motivation). 

Wish me luck friends! I am keen to see my 10, 100 and 1000 day milestone badge. I'll keep updating you. 

Happy independence day to you all. Love from India. Thanks for being such an awesome community.

I didn't MEAN to quit....

It just kind of happened. 

I've known I've had to quit for awhile. It was just easier not too. But I started taking valerian root for some anxiety issues and my desire to smoke just slowed down. Instead of going through a pack a day - I was down to a pack every 3 days. And then I got reallllly drunk almost two weeks ago. And the next day I had my last hungover morning cigarette with my coffee. 

I didn't mean to quit. It just happened. 

And then I went on vacation with my family, who knows I smoke(d) but we didn't talk about it and I never did it around them. And that made it easier, especially since my Mom had quit a few months ago and wasn't smoking at every turn anymore. 

I got home last night, not even wanting the rest of the ones I have at my house. 

But today - today is shit and I am alone at work with no customers so I caved. I bought a pack from our decades old cigarette machine. I took one of those long candle lighters from the kitchen and went outside. I lit the cigarette, took two drags and couldn't do it. I couldn't/didn't want to finish it. My anxiety is through the roof but those two drags made me feel gross. So out it went, and it looks like the guy who works in the kitchen is getting a whole pack because I don't want to hold on to them anymore. 

I know the next few weeks are gonna be a struggle, but I'm ready to deal with it. Finally. 10 days (minus two drags) free and I already feel SO MUCH BETTER. 

I didn't mean to quit, it just kind of happened. 

(And I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this - I just had to get it all out....and not step outside to attempt to smoke another one).

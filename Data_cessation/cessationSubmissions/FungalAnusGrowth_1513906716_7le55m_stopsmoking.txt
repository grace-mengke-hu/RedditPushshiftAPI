16 days smoke free but smoked 3 cigarettes

Was feeling down and thought what the hell, I will buy a pack, smoked one cigarette. Regret it, cravings soon kicked in full swing and I thought to myself how stupid I could be to smoke a cigarette and let myself have the nicotine in my blood and brain. But smoked another one, couple of hours went and smoked half another one but threw it away. Never touching that again. Nicotine is hell and smoking is just so destructive.

I think this was a good lesson and reminder on why I quit and especially made me realize how powerful and addictive nicotine is after just smoking one cigarette.

Nope, I'll be smoke free for the rest of my life now.

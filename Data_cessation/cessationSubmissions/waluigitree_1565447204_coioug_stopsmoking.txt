nicotine teen

its funny that so many kids my age have nicotine addictions without ever doing cigarettes. How did this happen?? anyways, I started smoking in december with a juul and quickly became addicted. I would have to leave class to hit it and it was my first thought each day waking up. Because of a family vacation this summer, i was forced to leave behind my device because I didnt want to risk getting caught while at security in the airport. My best friend was scared that I woudnt make it so she bought nicotine gum for my birthday (17) , which I ended up using about twice a day for the first week. Its been 3 weeks without hitting any nicotine device and Im not sure if i can keep going. The urge to smoke is super strong and I dont know what else to do. I keep seeing articles of kids my age that have gotten lung replacements and mouth cancers from only like a year of using. Im terrified of this habit and what its done to people, especially my nicotine addicted friends. and for this reason I am thinking of limiting my nic by having a friend hold my device. Any advice for this journey ? thank you guys and im happy to be a part of this community now &lt;3

Smoked for over 9,000 days, now I have 365 on the other side. Thanks r/stopsmoking!

For those looking for inspiration:

* I'm healthier (at age 40) than I ever have been in my life.
* I can run/bike for miles with relative ease.
* I was underweight, but have since gained 30 lbs (mostly muscle).
* I save over $220 each month just on smokes without even trying.
* I have more rewarding ways to relax now, instead of getting my fix.
* I'll never have to sneak in that 30 second smoke before going where it's not allowed.
* I had no idea what I smelled like. I don't mind being around smokers, but I didn't realize I smelled like that.
* No coughing, and most of my allergies and sinus problems are gone.
* No sore lungs in the morning, or ever.
* etc. etc. etc.

I don't hate cigarettes, I just don't want to do that to myself anymore and have no reason to be addicted. Occasionally I'll get a craving but it passes as quickly as it would if I smoked one, except it doesn't come back 45 minutes later. Anyway, you get the idea, this sub contains all the excuses you'll ever need. The effort is up to you!

PS - Here is my method:

1. I used the patch as it is intended.
2. I had a vaporizer that I would turn to if really desperate.
3. I had the support of someone close to me.
4. I had this subreddit.
5. I focused on physical improvement to supplement my quit.
6. It helped being around non-smokers in the beginning.

Happy Quitting To All!

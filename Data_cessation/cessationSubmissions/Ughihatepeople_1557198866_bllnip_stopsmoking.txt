I didn't really want to quit, I wasn't ready.

Had a health scare and decided it didn't matter if I wanted to or if I was ready, I had to quit. I'm still vaping a few times a day but I totally dropped cigs for 9 days now.  Yesterday and today have been the worst of the symptoms. I'm seriously depressed. When a craving hits it's intense, not subsiding with a few vape hits; I get frustrated and my eyes well up fighting off the tears. I thought this was supposed to get easier with time... when does it actually get easier?

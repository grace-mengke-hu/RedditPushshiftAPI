2 months down but lung butter persists

Hey everyone. I recently passed the 2 month mark(WOOT) but am still dealing with some nagging smoking related symptoms. Most noticeably, over the last month or so I wake up every morning with phlegm in the back of my throat that is difficult to get rid of. It’s never a lot, it’s just very sticky and stubborn. Like a layer of film in my throat. I’m sure this isn’t uncommon but how long can I expect this to last? Is there anything I can do to remedy it? Thanks!

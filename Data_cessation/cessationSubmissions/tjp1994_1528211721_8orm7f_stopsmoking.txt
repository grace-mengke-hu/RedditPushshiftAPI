Been 4 days without a cigarette, and have been feeling less anxious???

Since I have stopped smoking I have felt less anxious, I have had significantly less muscle tension too in my neck, face, head and traps etc.  
I have been able to smell and taste really well too. 

Does my assumption that my anxiety has decreased from quitting smoking hold any weight? I didn’t know smoking could make one anxious? I do feel like having a cigarette as I am feeling better and stuff (less anxious and depressed), but that isn’t very logical - because the reason I may feel better is because I have stopped smoking? so I don’t want to risk it.

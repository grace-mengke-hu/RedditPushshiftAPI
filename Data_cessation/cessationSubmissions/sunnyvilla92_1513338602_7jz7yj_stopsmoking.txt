Does anyone on here use the QuitNow app?

I majority of posts I see regarding progress and achievements are from that green themed smoke free app, which don't get me wrong is a great app. But the first one I discovered was quit now with the blue Q app icon. Curious why I've ever seen screenshots of it on here, well more surprised than curious. Either way congrats on everyone who made it and those still fighting.

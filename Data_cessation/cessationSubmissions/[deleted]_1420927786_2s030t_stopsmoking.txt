Hey Guys, I read Allen Carr's Easyway.

I read it about 4 days ago and went 3 whole days without smoking. Been going to the gym/eating A LOT (I'm underweight). Been sore from the gym, sleeping like a log, and fairly happy despite a few moments. Although while I was finishing the book the first time, I got very uneasy/panicked toward the end. I just ignored it and kept going. Up until that point though I was very excited about quitting but I think I got too excited and read too quickly, missing some stuff. I was fine until today when I decided to reread it and pick up on some stuff. I got about halfway, panicked,craved, and went and bought a pack a few hours ago. I'm EXTREMELY frustrated. I'm scared if I keep rereading it it will lose its magic. I felt frustrated that I didn't have a complete revelation the first time and started doubting myself. The book was VERY enlightening, though. Should I smoke for a few days and reread it? I have ample time tonight. What should I do guys?

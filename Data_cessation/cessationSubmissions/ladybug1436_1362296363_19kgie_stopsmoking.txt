Finally quitting. HELP ME!

Sadly, I am 18 and have been smoking for 4 years. Every time I try and stop.. It just doesn't happen. I can't find any willpower to do so. This thought has crossed my mind so many times. I guess what I'm thinking is that by submitting this you guys could give me advice or just any stories. It would be helpful.

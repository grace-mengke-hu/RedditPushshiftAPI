The real cost of cigarettes

I’ve been free for 25 days and I don’t think I’ve ever felt better!! Does anyone else think it’s weird that I am looking at everyday purchases and comparing that to how many cigarettes that could have bought me? For example, I bought some funny t-shirts online and it cost me $34 total....and I think “man, that could have bought 3 and a 1/2 packs of smokes”.......but then I take a deep breath and think, “sweet, I got new threads that don’t smell like shit!” In 4 months, I’m going back to Peru to visit my fiancée. 4 months at about $10 a pack a day is $1200......that would have been 120 packs of soul crushing killers. But instead of killing myself, I’m going out there to live!

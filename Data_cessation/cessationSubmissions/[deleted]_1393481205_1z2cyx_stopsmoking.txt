[update] I asked nearly a year ago how I could help my SO quit smoking! The advice was all lucky and these are the results. (5 weeks!!)

So it was 213 days ago I posted wondering how to help my SO quit because he was hitting a snag! Well, he didn't read any of the books but I read parts of them and spoke to him about it. He didn't know I was researching it but I'm glad it slowly helped.

It was him who finally made the decision. He switched to menthols thinking it'd be a better way to slowly quit. He smoked half of the menthol then put it out and walked away. This was super frustrating instead of rolling because it ended up being $15 every 3 days. He got frustrated and just bought more loose tobacco to roll. The great part of this is that this was the pinnacle. He smoked two of them and said 'fuck it I can't do this anymore' and we looked into the e-cig solution.

Ecigforlife or something is the website. He got pretty interested seeing some of them and looking at all the flavours. He didn't want the ones with nicotine in them (cause the smoking habit would carry on just a bit safer) and they're hard to get into Australia according to the site. So I suggested patches. He was cautious because his step dad got bad side effects and his nan got sick from them. I bought it for him anyway, the step 2 ones. 

From the day he put the patch on, he quit. The ecigs hadn't arrived yet. I'm incredibly proud of him. He did the step 2 dose for 3 weeks until he felt he could move to step 1 which he's been on for 2! He barely even uses the ecig now anyway. Smells good like cherry though.

That's just over a whole month without smoking when he needed 6 a day (which was a ridiculously reduced amount from when we met - he smoked like 25 a day before that). 

So if you feel comfortable with the e-cig and patch method it can totally work for you! I hope it's ok to suggest it.

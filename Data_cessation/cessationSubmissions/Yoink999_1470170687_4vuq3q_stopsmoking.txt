Another Go....

So I've been stop start since February. Stopped a few days here and there.
Now I have 2 months to up my running for the half marathon in Cardiff.
Going to hang onto the vape for "must have nicotine" moments. Regular chewing gum for driving when I smoke the most. And as little "idle time" as possible between now and the moment I realise I haven't had a smoke in ages. 

Been checking in here a lot and will keep doing so, your positive stories help loads.

Cheers guys :-)

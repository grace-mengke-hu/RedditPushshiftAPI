Help with Chantix.

Hey everyone. 

I momentarily was successful with quitting smoking last year with the help of chantix. However I stopped before the full treatment was completed. I want to give it another try. I don’t have the “started pack” left, only the secondary one. Does anyone know the difference? Can I take them without starting with the starter pack?

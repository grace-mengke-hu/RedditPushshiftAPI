What worked for me.

Hello Reddit,

I want to share my story with you. Because the phrase "If I can do it, you can do it" has never been more true.
37 days on and I KNOW that I will not smoke again, gun-to-my-head, thanks to you amazing people. 

I have been trying to stop for over 2 years now. 95% of the times, I wouldn't make it past 24 hours. 90% of the times I wouldn't make past 2 hours. After failing for 10+ times, I resolved to do one of the two things: Either accept the fact that I am going to be a smoker for the rest of my life, or stop once and for all (Accept the situation or change it). Smoking was causing a lot of self-destructive thoughts in me. I would get immense self-hating thoughts just after my first cigarette of the day. And the effects of this destructive thought pattern were, well, destructive. I **decided** I wanted out and went on to read Allen Carr's book. I'm not selling the book here but the guy makes a lot of sense. A while after reading I stopped smoking- this time for over 4 days and then I had a really bad day. I fell back into trap like it was gravity.

I smoked for another 30 days and then stopped for a second time ( I'm only counting post-Allen-Carr attempts at this point) which lasted for 2 days. Strangely, this attempt failed because I was severely bored at work and I basically said to myself "I'll stop once I decide how to deal with boredom after stopping ". Super silly, I know, that's how stupid the drug makes you. 

**Note:** Stopping smoking creates a lot of free time in your day which you wont know what to do with. So plan ahead. I started playing a mobile game. Some might choose to do a productive task. I just did not want to be bored of the replacement activity.

I knew I will stop soon but I continued for the next 50 days. I realize now that this was my fear phase. And the day came when I was ready. It did not just come, though. I said to myself- It is today.I skipped my routine before bed cigarette because I truly felt done with smoking. 

**Day 1** : I felt motivated and had to try little to fight the urge. It kinda helped that I had a cold and dint really feel much like smoking anyway.

**Day 2 through 7**: I would get constant psychological urges, but I had resolved and I dont want to turn back now. A strong resolution will take you ahead for the first three days. By the third day, you will have lost all the nicotine in your body- that means you will never have a nicotine-based urge again.

**Day 7**: [This happened.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3pcqhu/7_days_and_im_feeling_weak_help_reddit/) Do not underestimate the gravity of this weak moment. I dint want to smoke, But I knew I was going to do it. I asked you guys for help. Was not let down. 


> Just remember if you fail now, you will fail later. The only way to beat this thing is to really beat it.


Thank you /u/goldandguns for this. This is so true. You wont beat it if you  think, feel, act like beating it. You will beat it only if you really beat it. It may mean less to you but this basically stopped me from lighting that day. And I passed the test. By now, I knew I was over the hardest part. 


**Day 14**: If you do something over and over for more than 6 years, your muscles- heck your jeans remembers the drill. Do not underestimate the power of repetition. By this time, I would get nightly dreams, day dreams, visualizations of myself smoking. Dont feel threatened, these things aren't as scary as it counts. You need to accept that it is your body that is used to the movements and gets confused by the sudden lack of such activity. Its like closing your eyes after staring at a really bring object- when you still see the light. Its just the impression that is remaining. It isn't scary at all. I was worried if they would ever go or if I'd smoke in a moment of weakness (read drunken).

[I asked you guys again for help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3qe5eh/the_dreams_the_visualizations_they_haunt/) **Was. Not. Disappointed.**

**Day Today**: I have no urge. Okay almost no urge. But the little urges that come extremely rarely are basically powerless. But my back pocket feels thick. stopping  smoking gave me enough financial confidence to book my dream car.  

Thank you /r/stopsmoking. You are doing god's work. 

Remember- They say stopping  smoking is hard and needs a lot of fighting etc. But I say with the right frame of mind, its a cake.


Edit: Day 57 (9th Dec 2015)-    
I certainly do get urges once in a while. But they are so fucking easy to ignore. Its like those times when an you get random destructive thoughts like pushing off the guy walking aside you for no reason and you choose to ignore that thought? Yes, smoking urges are that faint these days. I do get thoughts of doing it once and not continuing and every time i choose to ignore it. I'm writing this for my own record and I will be glad if you choose to read or connect.     
    
    
Edit: Day 62 (14th Dec 2015)-
Today was a high. Good high. I feel in control of things in my life. I feel powerful. And at this very moment, I have an urge. Its is sad that i'd want to light when i'm happy. I was not prepared for this. The good-time-pang. I need to keep my eyes open for traps like this. I have seen people relapse even after 2 years of quitting. Althought there is no Immediate Gravity- like the times when i was a regular smoker but there are places i come close to that try to draw me back. Like extreme sadness, highs, lows, failures, achievements, self hatred etc. I am keeping an eye open for any imminent traps that would make me fall back. Although today is a major pang, ignoring it is still extremely easy. I have taken this road and I will put every effort to make sure I dont turn back. Good day :)

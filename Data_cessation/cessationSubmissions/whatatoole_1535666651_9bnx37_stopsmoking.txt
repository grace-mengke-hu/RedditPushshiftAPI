Planning to quit - how much permanent damage have I done to myself?

Hi all, as the title suggests planning to quit relatively soon though I'm just a bit worried at the damage I've already done to my body in the longer term, ie. Have I made my body permanently more susceptible to cancer? etc. 

I'm 20 now, and began socially smoking when I turned 18 - at most, I went through roughly a pack a week and often less, but for all intents and purposes let's assume I smoked a pack a week for a year. Since joining university/college, I began smoking pretty regularly, at roughly say 8 a day which consisted mainly of roll ups but occasionally straights also. 

I suspect I'm being a tad hypochondriac about this all, but it's just gotten me worried nonetheless. I've researched this extensively online, and haven't found much in the way of acceptable/relevant studies pertaining to my current predicament; there of course exists that under 30 years of age women study but, well, I lack XY chromosomes. I just think getting some objective and definitive answers on this would really help motivate me to give it up once and for all. 

Thanks in advance people! :)

When September Ends

Hey all. I haven't been smoking as long as some, but after 4 and a half years, I decided to call it quits. My roomate and I have smoked for roughly the same amount of time and in the past hour got rid of every last cigarette we own and promised each other, and most importantly ourselves, that we will never smoke again.

I've been subscribed to this sub for the past month or so while thinking about quitting and wanted to say all of you are awesome. After reading some of your stories, it finally convinced me. Do you have any tips or heads up as I start this new part of my life? 

I just wanted to share with someone so I figured all of you was a great place to start.

A tough weekend... Almost failed

I'm 21 days in and it is great. I see some other badges and I am so envious. I want to shout out a big congratulations to everyone, I'm always chasing! However this weekend was the most difficult and if it wasn't for my friend then I would have smoked. Of course, there was some drink involved, we were walking past a pub that was closed and on the table outside there was a pack of smokes just abandoned with about five in. I grabbed them as that is what I always would have done, free smokes? My friend said he would keep them as he knows I'm quitting (he doesn't smoke) and I just gave them to him however I hide one out of the packet up my sleeve as I knew he would throw them away or something. Later on when we got back to the flat, I had lost that cigarette up my sleeve. When I realised this I started patting my friend down and going after the smokes. (He had of course thrown them away) the craving passed and after all that I "thank the stars" I did not end up having a cigarette. I feel ashamed I handled it like that after 20 days and very lucky I've got both a great friend and that I lost that one otherwise I would have had to reset my star. I'm sharing this with you all as I wanted people to know to be careful and let everyone know even after 20 days you still have to work incredibly hard! It's never easy and those cravings will make you do terrible things! Anybody else had any close calls?

I think I've actually done it this time!

I officially quit on the 2nd, but today is my 3rd day without a cigarette. I feel irritated, and like crap. But I'm doing it! After smoking for almost 7 years, I really think it's time to quit. The fact that I'll be moving in November and won't be able to afford it, helps with the motivation. Also, my girlfriend doesn't smoke, and I hate smoking around her. But I'm definitely doing it this time!! Yay!

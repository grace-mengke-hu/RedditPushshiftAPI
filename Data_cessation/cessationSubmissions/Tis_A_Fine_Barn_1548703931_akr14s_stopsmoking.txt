My area is currently in the midst of a winter snow warning. Twelve inches accumulation expected, with gusts from 15-30 MPH. Most businesses (except mine) and schools closed. It is third break right now and people just went outside. To smoke. In this. Bizarre! Presenting #063 Abra. See you tomorrow.

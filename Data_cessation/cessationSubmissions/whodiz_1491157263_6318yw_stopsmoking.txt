Starting over

I hate what smoking does to me. I hate picking it up again. I'm soon to be out of money and all of my pay will be spent on paying debts. I hate it so much. 

I hate how I have to:
Listen to the nagging feeling telling me to fucking smoke every hour. 
Get really breathless climbing up short flights of steps.
Don't have time to focus on other things. 
Deal with being broke. 
Cutting down my allowance on food just to buy a pack. 

Most of all, I hate how i convinced myself that it "alleviates" my depression. It does not. But what it has done for sure is, to aggravate it. 

The longest I've ever been smoke-free was 49 days. I miss it. I always had enough money. Hell, I could even survive a week on $20 with no worries. 
Man, I miss it so much. 

Tldr; started smoking again and everything after that is downhill. 

Thank you for letting me vent.

Today I decided to quit

I just put out my last cigarette, for the last time. I have a 3 year old and a baby on the way, and I wanna quit for my health, and the health of those around me, also so I can be a good role model for my children. I've tried quitting before and got two months and then caved. This time I have bought some of those lozenges to help quit smoking let, I plan to use those along with exercise and healthier activities. My fiance is very supportive I also was on my own quitting but not this time so I feel very confident this time around!

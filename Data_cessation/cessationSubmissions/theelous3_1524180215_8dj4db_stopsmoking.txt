Two nights ago, going to bed without a pre-bed smoke was unthinkable. Not any more.

I'm lying in bed about 64 hours in, feeling much more confident. Turns out you actually do sleep just fine without smoking!

Tomorrow morning I'll be 72 hrs free. Thanks everyone for giving me a place to say these things aloud. Tomorrow I won't smoke, don't smoke with me :D

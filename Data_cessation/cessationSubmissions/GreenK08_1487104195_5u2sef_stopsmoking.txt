Day two..42 hours..whose counting? Which day was your hardest?

I'm seriously having to fight the urge to just go do it. I know I can get through this. I didn't exactly start with a plan. I woke up yesterday and decided I was done. I don't know how smart this is, but I have made it so far. Which day was the toughest? I know everyone is different.

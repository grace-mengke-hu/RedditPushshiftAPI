90 days today!

I’m so thrilled to hit this milestone! It hasn’t been perfect, but I do not think about cigarettes / smoking most of the time. I feel healthier, my skin seems brighter and foods taste better. I smell better and I love not having to think about buying cigs, stopping to get cigs, wondering if I’ll have enough cigs.  I have saved over $350 and counting.  Thank you for your support!

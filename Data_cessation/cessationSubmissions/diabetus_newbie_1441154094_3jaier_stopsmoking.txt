WTF, it's been 6 weeks and I was so close to losing it

I've had a shit 6 weeks and today was one of the most expensive.

If I listed the details people would bitch about it being "White People Problems" but shit, us employed white people aren't made of money.

That issue about 'is my job being outsourced' came up again when my boss got back from a 2 week vacation. IBM thought they were taking over my role. She didn't, but now she's not so sure. 

In the last six weeks my washer failed...$$$$. My pool pump blew apart....$$$$. My low profile run-flat incredibly expensive BMW sport package tire blew apart last night...$$$$ and just now a major section of my pool cage screen just fell out leaving my cat a way to escape if I don't lock her loud screaming Siamese kitty ass in  the house. Nails on a blackboard, nothing compared to a pissed off Siamese Colorpoint.

Fuck it. I'm going to go stuff myself with Publix Fried chicken and add to the 15 lbs I've gained in the last 6 weeks

Oh, cool. A purring kitty sticking her face in my hand chilling me out...better than a cigarette

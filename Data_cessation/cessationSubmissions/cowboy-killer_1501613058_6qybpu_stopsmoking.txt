I just made it 1 year, Cold Turkey!

Hi Quitters! Just wanted to pop in and say thanks for helping me quit smoking. I smoked for almost 20 years and yesterday marked one year since I had any tobacco or nicotine in any form. This was a hard year for me in a lot of ways, but I'm feeling happier and healthier than I can ever remember. My post history has lots of info about the tools that helped me. If you are quitting or thinking about quitting, I know you can do it!

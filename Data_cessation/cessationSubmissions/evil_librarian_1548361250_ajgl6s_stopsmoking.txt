What do I do on my lunch break now?

I had my last smoke last night. Since I've been at my job I would spend my 30 minute lunch break driving and smoking. I don't know what to do with that time now. I refuse to go to the staff lunch room and make small talk with people I can't stand. If I get in the car I'm afraid I will go to the nearby -11 and buy more.

Any ideas are appreciated.

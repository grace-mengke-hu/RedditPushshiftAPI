Day 4 what to expect?

Hey guys, I found this sub and it's amazing how everybody encourages each other to keep going strong! I'm on day 4 and surprisingly, it's been relatively easy not to smoke so far, I realised that I'm the only one in my social group to smoke, so I'm not exposed, although I still feel the need to buy a pack but I've been eating a lot to compensate for that feeling. Is week 2 more difficult than week 1? And what do you normally do to tone down your symptoms of abstinence? I hope everyone have a great weekend.

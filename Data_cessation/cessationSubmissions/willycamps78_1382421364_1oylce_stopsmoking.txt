I feel like crap right now

I'm starting day 8 in two hours and its been pretty easy so far. Only thing that bothers me is the insomnia and the taste of blood in my throat when I wake up after sleeping. I don't know if this has to do with smoking or not but my teeth, every single tooth in my mouth, is in pain and I want to rip them out of my skull. Has anyone else felt anything like this before when quitting?

Dealing with withdrawal

Hey everybody! Long story short: I've been a heavy smoker for 6 years and after almost passing out on the treadmill last saturday I decided to quit cold turkey. I'm already feeling A LOT better (especially when it comes to breathing and such) but I'm having a hard time when it comes to cravings and the withdrawal. I feel extremely anxious, angry and also kinda sad. Is this all normal? Any tips on how to deal with it? Is working out useful? I really don't want to fail this time so I'll be checking this sub often. Thanks!

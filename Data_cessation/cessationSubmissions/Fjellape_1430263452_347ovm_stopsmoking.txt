Smoker for 10 years, finally decided to quit

Hi

Been feeling kind of shit latelly, decide to do something extra for my health. Cold turkey, I know I have a long road ahead.

Does it really improve your overall appearance? any case of people with premature grey hair that managed to come back? 
Any suggestions?

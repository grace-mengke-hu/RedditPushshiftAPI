Went to a stop smoking clinic today blew 33 on smoking machine

Blew 33 on the machine they use to detect the damage done to myself, i am only 26, Doctor told me give it another 20 years at this rate and ill be in a box. He was quite worried about how high of a number i blew and my age.

I have been smoking since i was probably 12 or 13, and i smoke minimum of 20 per day. 

Wake up call if ever. 

Going back tomorrow to collect the champix stop smoking tablets and hopefully 10 day's later ill be smoke free!

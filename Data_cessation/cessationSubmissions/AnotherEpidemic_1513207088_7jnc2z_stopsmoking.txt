Set a date!

Hi guys! 

I recently joined this subreddit. I’ve been smoking for about 10 years now and for the past month, I’ve found that I’m disgusted by the habit. I realized how big of a toll smoking has on my health and my finances. So, I’ve set a date to quit smoking. On December 31rst, I’ll be throwing out all my lighters, ashtrays and packs of smokes. I’m extremely excited and motivated to do this!

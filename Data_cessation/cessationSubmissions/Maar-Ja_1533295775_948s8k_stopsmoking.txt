So disappointed in myself.

I only managed less than 24 hours. Yesterday, after finishing Carr's book for the eighth time I threw away an entire carton of cigs and ashtrays. I couldn't sleep all night. This morning I went and bought 3 packs. I am disappointed that I couldn't do it again. How do I make this a permanent change in my brain? How do I make it so I don't want to smoke anymore? Please help me. I feel like I am a prisoner who wants to stay behind bars and on some sick level I enjoy it so much. Time is running out. I MUST quit this bad habit. I have to. But I just can't. I have tried countless of times and I fail every time. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

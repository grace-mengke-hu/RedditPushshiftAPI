(Day 1) What are some good coping mechanisms people have employed in their quitting quests?

I've been smoking for the past seven years - managed to stop completely for one of those years - but I'm now at the point where I want to stop for a variety of reasons (main ones being long term health & the girl I'm seeing), and so today is day one of what I'm determined to be my smoke-free life.

I'm curious to know what other people who have / are in the process of quitting have done to either replace smoking or supplement their lives in its place. For me, I plan on exercising a lot more regularly, maybe reading too, but I want to know what people have found works for them. Has anyone tried things like meditation, or found a hobby / interest they never expected to have?

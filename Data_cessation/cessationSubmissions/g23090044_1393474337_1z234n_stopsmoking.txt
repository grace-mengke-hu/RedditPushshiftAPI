I broke, but...

I quit last month for about 5 days, started up again, and stopped again last Monday. After 10 days of not smoking, I broke and bummed one off a coworker today after lunch...

...and I feel terrible. A little bit disappointed in myself, but mostly just physically ill. There is this heaviness that crept into my body when I finished and now an hour later I still can't shake it. My head hurts, I'm sweating, and I feel like I just wanna puke. I cannot believe that I allowed feeling like this to become normal for so long.

Anyway, where as the other times I've tried to quit (a few times last year in addition to this year) lighting up again was a relief, this time I just feel disgusting. This might be just the motivation I need to never touch a cigarette again.

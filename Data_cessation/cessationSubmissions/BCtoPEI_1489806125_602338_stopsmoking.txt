Day 0

I threw a whole tub of tobacco out last week. Scrounged through the garbage for dry bits.

I soaked and flushed a pack out after smoking one cig. Found every butt in the damn house, every vehicle ashtray, every pocket, every nook and cranny and rolled toothpicks out of em.

HELP

I cut down from about 25-30 a day to maybe 5-10, but I bought a pack earlier today and I'm chainsmoking again... 

I should mention I've cut down massively not only on smoking, but from 8-12 cups of coffee a day down to 1-3, as well as 1/8th of weed down to.. barely anything. A joint. All at the same time. No pride here, no ego, but also no shame or guilt. I was brought to this understanding naturally and it was a difficult recognition, I've been fucking up for a long time. Thankful to fully realize it.

These things all go hand in hand in hand and I feel must be dealt with at the same time. Wasn't surprised to see the study linking coffee drinkers/cig smokers at all, what a beautiful curse of a pleasurable experience that is, fawwwk. 

These are my worst vices along with sedentary existence (Long walks with the dog every day doing wonders now) I'm really trying to transform my whole life. Mentally and spiritually I feel great, physically is what I need to work on.

Coffee and weed is easy. Getting active is less easy. Ciggies is the hardest. 

What do? Much love and thanks for any help in advance

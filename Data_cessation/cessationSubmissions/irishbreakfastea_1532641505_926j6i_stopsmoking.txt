Why do I only begin to fear the damage of smoking after I quit

On day 2 right now of no smoking and I noticed that once I quit I begin to really worry about all the damage I have done to my lungs and body.

For 15 years I smoked between 1/2 - 1 pack a day (probably more when I was drinking-which I did a lot of).   Now I am 30 years old and I am starting to really worry about how badly I have mistreated my body. 

Why is it, when I was smoking all those years I was able to shove those thoughts into a corner and make excuses but now that I have quit it's starting to come up again?

Anyway I am 25 hours into my quit and I ain't going back.  I learned a lot from this forum and my own experience and I am committed to never taking another puff, no matter what!

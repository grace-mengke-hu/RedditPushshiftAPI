First (hopefully only) attempt. Didn't mean to treat you people as "Dear Diary" but...here we are.

I am a half hour past 7 days as I type this.

In addition to quitting smoking, I'm facing a potentially life changing event in the next couple days here (I'm trying to change jobs and will hear tomorrow if I got it or not). 

In the past 7 days I've learned how to deal with irritants in ways other than escaping outside to smoke.  I'm fearful of not being able to devise a way to combat basic anxiety, along with the added anxiety behind making such a large change after so long.

After 7 days I find that my random flashes of anger have gotten steadily less intense, which is a relief.  

I find myself sad at the prospect of having to decide to not smoke every 15 minutes, and wonder if I can continue to say no to cigarettes that often.

My sleep patterns are completely fucked, and I've found myself having really strange dreams.  

I feel that the only things that keep me going will be the streak that I've accumulated (7 days, 1st quit), and the vanity that I carry (specifically, needing to appear strong).

Finally, I rest on "Who gives a shit if those are what keeps you quit, quit is quit, and this will help you not die."

I apologize for the ramble, this is new territory to me, and I don't really have ANYONE to talk through the struggle/feelings with. At least, not anyone who can relate. That said, I tend to cycle through this thought pattern at least a few times a day.  Here's hoping the roller coaster evens out.

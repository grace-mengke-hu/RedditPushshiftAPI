Smoking/dipping/vaping

I've dipped since I was a freshman in highschool and smoked since I got out of basic training and picked up vaping as well along the way. I would go through about a can of dip every few days. A pack in three days and a 60mL bottle of juice in about a week. Now I'm proud to say I'm finally taking steps to quit. It's been about a week since my last cigarette and a good month since my last dip or vape. I joined this page in search of support in the times that I become weak and really crave. I've got nicotine gum to help with cravings. What have yall used in the past or present to help with the oral fixation?

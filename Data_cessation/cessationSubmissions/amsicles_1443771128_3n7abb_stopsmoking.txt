Intermittent smokers - how do we quit?

I am terrible at quitting smoking. It's currently 6 days since I last had a cigarette - and the problem is that's not uncommon. I don't miss it at the moment, but I know as soon as Saturday comes around or if I go out tonight, I'll have a couple. If I really go out, I might have 10 or 15. Then I'll swear off it again... Until the following weekend. 

One of my good friends successfully quit after years of 40 a day - he swore if you could get through the first 3 days, then it got easier. Trouble is for me, 3 days - even 3 weeks - is ok but then I break and 'just have one puff', which inevitably means I'm back to being a weekend warrior. I just can't seem to convince myself that it's forever. Anyone else had this problem? How did you get past it?

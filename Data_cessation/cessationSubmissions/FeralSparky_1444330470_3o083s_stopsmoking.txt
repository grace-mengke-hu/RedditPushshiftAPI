Going to quit today

This is attempt 15 over the last 5 years to quit smoking. I've always tried to wean myself off only to pick back up and it get worse. 

I never smoked a cigarette. Never even thought about it until I started working at a gas station on 3rd shift. But the loneliness and stress was crazy high and for some stupid reason I smoked a cigarette when offered one during a bad night and haven't stopped since. Even after quitting that job. 

My main reason for quitting is financial. It costs a significant part of my paycheck to keep smoking. I make barely enough to get by and now have 2 people to support and I  just can't afford to do it anymore.

Quitting smoking is easy when I vape like there is no tomorrow, but nicotine itself is pain in the ass to quit. Help

I can easily quit smoking if I vape.

But if I do not have access to my vape maybe for a few days, I walk to the nearest store like a zombie, buy a pack, smoke them until I get my vape back.

I researched a lot of articles about nicotine, but they say it is not as addictive as you think.

So for me, I guess it is more like psychological addiction. I used to study and work with nicotine for the past 10 years. Even I am out of school now, I code every day for a work which requires heavy nicotine  for me.

Whenever I try to quit nicotine,
I can't concentrate, I can't come up with logic for my codes, I feel depressed which leads to heavy reduction in my work productivity immediately. I am not sure if it is really a slow down of my brain's neurological function or it is just all in my head.

The reason why i want to quit nicotine is that benefit from quitting will outweigh the withdrawal symptoms that I have to go through. Increased energy from increased appetite leading to more workouts, saving money, better cardiovascular function maybe.

However, whenever I try to justify the benefits are far more worth than the cost of quitting, I come up with so many research papers saying that nicotine is actually not a very harmful substances in moderation like caffeine. This keeps me back into this vicious psychological addiction trap,  

"why would I quit this if it is indeed not very harmful to my body? it seems obvious I perform better mentally with it for sure... Maybe I can try to work out more while keep nicotine in my life if I am really worried about my health. ALSO, I need to finish this work by the end of the week before meeting with my boss. I cannot waste any time by trying to quit and reducing my productivity "

Help, I need to break this whatever physical or psychological addiction.

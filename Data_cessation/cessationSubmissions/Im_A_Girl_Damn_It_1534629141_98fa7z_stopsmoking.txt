Do you live with smokers?

So, when I didn't live with smokers, quitting would be relatively easier because I couldn't just get more at anytime. However, I had no choice recently but to move in with my dad and I won't be able to afford to move until January 2020. 

I have not paid for any cigarettes since I've been here. He buys a ton and just gives them to me, even when he knows I'm trying to quit. Honestly, I think he gets jealous when I do quit for more than a day or so because he starts making comments about how "he doesn't want to hear about it." 

I know I just need more willpower, but do you guys have any advice here?

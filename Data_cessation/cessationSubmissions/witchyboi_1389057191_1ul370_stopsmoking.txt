Day 4: Suck it, brain.

I quit before bed last Thursday nite, soaked my remaining cigarettes in water and twisted them into mush. Bought a pack last night while delivering for Domino's. Destroyed them before bed last nite. Brain has been bugging me all day, but I know it's full of crap. I'm in PJs with my kids and not going to out get cigs tonite. Do your time by the minute, not by the hour.

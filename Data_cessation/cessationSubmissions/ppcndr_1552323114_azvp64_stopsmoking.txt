The last cigarettes every night

Hi everybody,
I stop smoking for 4 month reading Allen Carr book's
Now I'm trying again
Every nights I smoke the "last cigarettes" and every morning I smoke my first
Every day from two months
It's difficult for me the first days when nicotine is still in my body
Have you got some hints for me?

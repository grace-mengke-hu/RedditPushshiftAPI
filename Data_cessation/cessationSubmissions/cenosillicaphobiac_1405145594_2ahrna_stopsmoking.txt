It's so basic

A couple of days ago I told my wife that unlike the other drugs I use or have used, smoking isn't about how I feel when I do it but more about getting back to feeling normal because I haven't done it in a while.  Watching Allen Carr (thanks for the tip guys) when it got to that part I felt like a fucking genius for a second or two.

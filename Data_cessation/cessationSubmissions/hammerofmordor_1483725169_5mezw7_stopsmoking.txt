How long does the anger last?

My partner has quit smoking 5 days ago, and this week he's gotten angry at me for how I take out the trash, how I feed the dog, and more. He's been totally irrational and edgy. I understand this is part of the process for some who go cold turkey, but I'm wondering how long I can expect this to last? I'm being patient and understanding but it's difficult for me. (He's usually not like this, and we rarely argue so I hate seeing him like this!) that said, it's more important to get through this temporary phase and save his lungs and his life. Any advice here is welcomed.

Does this feeling go away :/

I believe I'm on day 9. Every day has been a horrible struggle. I miss smoking every single second. I find myself wanting the day to hurry up so I can just go to bed and stop thinking about it. And I'm even using the patch. I have posted earlier, but I quit drinking as well a little over a month ago. So now that both my 'vices' are gone I have NO idea what to do in a social situation. I find myself stressed out for the summer, and picnics/parties. What do I do if I don't smoke or drink anymore?? I don't drink soda or juice, so I just hang out and sip on water? That sounds so crazy to  me.
I really don't think I wanted to quit, I'm just doing it because obviously it's horrible for my health and I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. Although I've probably spent almost as much in gum and mints. Does this feeling go away?! I go home from work and just furiously chew gum, clean the house and count the seconds until bedtime. I know, I know I need a hobby. But WHAT? I'm honestly not good at much. I do enjoy being outside, but it's been to cold and snowy. My poor fianc√© has been enduring absolute torture with my mood swings and cravings. I feel like I can still smoke socially- although in the past that hasn't worked (clearly) but my brain keeps saying that's a possibility for me. Do I give up and start smoking again until I'm actually sick and tired of it, or just keep pushing through hoping I'll eventually see the light. This post sounds absolutely ridiculous and borderline childish, but it's my reality at the moment. Words of wisdom from people who ever felt the same would be greatly appreciated!!

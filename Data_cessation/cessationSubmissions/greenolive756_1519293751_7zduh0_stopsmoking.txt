Wife of smoker looking for advice

Hope that I'm allowed to post this here, seeing as I'm not the one quitting?

My husband quit smoking nearly 4 years ago, pretty much cold-turkey. He had been smoking at least a pack a day for about 15 years. His main reason for quitting was because of my health - I have a condition that is easily exacerbated by second-hand smoke. I wanted him to stop but didn't give an ultimatum or anything.

Fast forward to 2018 and he's come home nearly every day with breath that smells like smoke for the past two or three weeks. Sometimes he tells me, sometimes I have to ask or find out when we kiss. He's having a challenging time at work and that is his trigger, he says. 

I've been trying - probably too hard - to help. He also gets migraines, and his doctor says he should do relaxation exercises and jogging to keep them at bay. I figure they would help with quitting smoking again, so I've been trying to encourage him to do both. We go jogging together. But it feels like pulling teeth, he's totally uninterested, "forgets" to do both things, complains when I bring them up... I feel like I'm trying to change him and I hate those couples, I just wanna be his partner, not his Mom. I've decided I need to back off, majorly.

What kind of behaviour from your partner/friend/family (if any) helped you in quitting? I'd really appreciate hearing from people who have been through something similar.

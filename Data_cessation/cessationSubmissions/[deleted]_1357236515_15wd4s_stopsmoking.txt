Second day back to work and I really miss smoke breaks.

What do you do when you're used to taking two smoke breaks a day? I just miss going outside and freezing my ass off for ten minutes to catch a break. I really enjoyed the break from my desk. What did you do when you quit? I can get up from my desk at any time but it seems super silly to me now to go outside when it's 30 degrees. Just because I want to get away from my desk. LOL sorry for rambling. BTW I love this subreddit, you all are so encouraging!

failed on day 7, quitting tomorrow again.

As my body was just starting to experience the good things that come from not smoking, i started getting real cravings last night and got a pack of sigarettes. I smoked about 7, and i think i'm going to smoke the rest of the pack today. 

I'm starting fitness tomorrow, and i'll request a new badge then. 
I can't remember having not smoked that long in my whole smoking career (12yrs), and i'm already a bit proud of that, although i do understand much better how hard it will be.

The hallways in the house i live in smelled really bad (there are other smokers living here), and now i smell like an ashtray again as well.

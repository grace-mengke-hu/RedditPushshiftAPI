Day 3, where will this lead?

Hey guys. I have been a light smoker off and on for years. I'm 35 now, and have smoked four-to-five cigarettes per day pretty regularly since I was about 20 or so. When I have alcohol, I smoke considerably more.

So, last Saturday, my wife and I both ran out of fags on the same morning. I had one left from the night before. We split it after our morning coffee and we didn't buy any more. It's Advent, so we decided to ditch the smokes at least for the season until Christmas. When Christmas comes, we haven't made any hard decisions.

So here is my question: I'm not drinking alcohol during Advent either, so it's kind of like I'm cheating. I'm concerned that once I have a few beers on Christmas, I'm going to want to light up. I'm almost at the point where I think that if I want to quit smoking for good, I need to quit drinking as well. Is this the case?

Also, my kids are now commenting on my smoking and I don't want them growing up with smoking parents. Any thoughts?

Why am I not coughing up more stuff?

Hey all, I smoked a pack a day from age 15 to 44, stopped 16 days ago (woohoo) and I have been vaping quite a lot.  I expected to be coughing up horrible stuff by now, but it's not happening.  I am coughing somewhat less than I was when I was smoking, and the stuff itself seems the same.  What gives?  Is it because I'm vaping?  Should I be concerned?  Do I just need to wait longer?  Many thanks for any insights....

Update: so looks like not everyone hacks up a ton of stuff as a result of quitting... TIL, thanks everyone!

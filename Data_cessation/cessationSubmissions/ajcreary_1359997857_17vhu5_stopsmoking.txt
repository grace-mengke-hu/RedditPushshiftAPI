Just a little rant about adderall and smoking.  My first thread started here.

I smoked heavily for a little more than two years when I got to college.  Before that, I smoked cigars with guys in high school a couple times a week.  And I quit with the help of Chantix 3 weeks ago today.

I take adderall to help me study and stay focused in class.  But when I take adderall, I want a cigarette very badly.  It's really obnoxious.  I know it won't do me any good to smoke, and when I'm not on adderall I feel like I'm completely quit and don't have many real urges.  But I really just want ONE OR TWO cigarettes, which I know is junky mentality.  Since quitting, I've only smoked one when I was really drunk and it just made me feel like shit.  That is probably the only reason I'm not picking up a pack right now in between classes.

Some days, I feel like I absolutely need adderall.  I'm a Biology major, and I'm finishing up my major requirements as a Junior, so my classes are getting pretty tough.  If I don't take adderall, I have a hard time following what professors are trying to explain to me in class.  We were talking about protein pathways last week when I didn't take it to avoid wanting a smoke, and I was utterly lost.  When I took it before my next class, I really wanted a cigarette, but I had no problems in class working on a more complicated concept.

It's really driving me crazy.  I love not being a smoker, but I also love doing well in school.  It's not even that I really WANT a cigarette.  It's just a little demon in the back of my mind going, "Hey, remember how you used to chain smoke when you took adderall?"

Even though this is the first time I've felt the need to start my own thread, I've been on here since last year trying to quit.  And this is the longest I've gone in 4 years without smoking any tobacco.  You guys helped a lot, so I just want to say thank you as well.  To all of you.  This is a great community and I appreciate the support.

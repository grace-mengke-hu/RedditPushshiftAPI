I want to reduce smoking and then quit . Is that wrong ?

I am really having hard time quitting smoking. I just past some hours and then I fear many things and I have always these people in my head who are always smoking. I have always followed bad people. I want to know how does someone really quit smoking. It looks so impossible.

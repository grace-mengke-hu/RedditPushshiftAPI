obviously

Best mental tip I read here so far: I am craving cigs, but if I smoke, I will still be craving cigs. Basically, craving is the mental state I ve been for 20 years (I started as a teenager, so stupid). Nothing new so far, because smoking doesnt satisfy my craving. On the opposite, enhance it. Because it makes me want to smoke more and more, one after the other. I know it seems obvious. It looks like an enlightment now! Lol! (I stoped on jan 7th)

Started at 13 and finally quit almost 17 years later. Now terrified for my health.

I’m 30 years old and quit smoking completely earlier this month after slowly cutting back for the past six years. Before that, I’d smoked at least a pack a day since I was 13. 

I don’t feel unhealthy. I’m quite active, and my breathing, oxygen absorption and blood work are all 100% great. My skin and hair look nourished. Still, I can’t help but look back on those years when I was so young and chainsmoked and think that I’m in imminent danger of developing cancer in my 30’s. Thinking about it drives me to the brink of panic at times. I do have medical insurance. Should I ask to have a chest X-ray and/or an esophageal biopsy (or whatever they do)? Do I have a chance at living a full life?

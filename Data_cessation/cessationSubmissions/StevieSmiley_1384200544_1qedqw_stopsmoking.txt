The Void

I'm now in the 3rd week, and all is good. Well. as good as expected I guess. I'm still suffering from insomnia  or it's just that my sleeping pattern is now all out of whack. 

Every once in a while I'll be sitting around have an odd emotion or 2 and for whatever reason my mind plays a trick on me. Hmmm ya know. a cigarette sure would be great right about now. Then I snap out of if and recognize that the void is still there trying to suck me back in if I stop paying attention.  

Often enough I find myself stuffing the void with food, which is not all that great an idea. now have been trying more so with water which is probably a much better idea, considering i've always been kind of dehydrated int the past anyway.

It should be stated that i've been smoking for 25+ years. That's a lot of habit forming to break. I kind of compare it to deciding it's ok to not wear pants any more. I dont care how luid or sexually secure you think you are, eventually your going to want to throw on a pair of jeans, just because you've done so most of your life. 

I really have no answer to how to fill this void but I wear a bracelet as a fly trap. Of course i don't have my own cigarettes to worry about now either. Most of the time I catch myself even without the reminder. But it's there just in case. 

Anyway I'm rambling on and on because I just recently had one of those voidal episodes. it irks me because they seem so much like the chemical dependency except that it goes away the instant you catch it.

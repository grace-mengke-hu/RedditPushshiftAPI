12 years ON-AND-OFF smoker

I started smoking when I was 18, and I'm 30 now. A few years ago I managed to quit for about 16 months, then eventually started again with a cigarette here and there. After that, I've gone for a few weeks, some months here and there but was never as succesful as before. Last year in August I put the cigarettes down, and managed to stay smoke-free for nearly 6 months... then, one afternoon just couldn't beat the urge. Now I'm on 10 cigs per day again. This fight just never ends.

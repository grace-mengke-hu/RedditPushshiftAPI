To keep me honest

 Today is the day I finally quit! My husband and I have both decided to finally give up smoking for good.  We both have a pack and a half a day habit,  and its time to stop!  We have two boys who we want to be healthy for,  and smoking makes it hard to run around and play with them like they deserve.  We just have to keep reminding ourselves that this is a good thing and not a bad thing.  Send good vibes please. I have a feeling this is going to be extremely hard!

Trouble Sleeping :/

I have been smoke free for 8 Days, and it seems to me that I am getting up earlier each day... Today was 0400, yesterday was 0500. I'm a good sleeper usually, and this has only started since I quit....

Any suggestions, or has anyone else gone through the same thing after quitting?

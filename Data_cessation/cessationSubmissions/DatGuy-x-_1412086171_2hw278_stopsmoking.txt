1 month

well, its been a month.

at this point everything is feeling normal. I don't really think about smoking at all anymore. 

- I eat healthier
- I have more energy
- I have more money
- I can concentrate better at work and get more done

I'm excited as to what the future brings as my body heals even more.

for all those people just starting out, keep with it, it gets so much easier and the benefits are worth it.

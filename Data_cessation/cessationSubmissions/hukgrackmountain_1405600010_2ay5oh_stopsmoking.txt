Been about a month, starting to get feelings in my chest when I wake up like I just smoked a cigarette

Maybe it's the old ass AC that I have?

Maybe its from drinking? or stress?

On the occasion where if I get really drunk the night before, I get paranoid I had a cigarette while drunk, thats how similar this feels to waking up after smoking.  I quit to avoid this.

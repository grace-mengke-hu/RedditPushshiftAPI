How do you deal with cravings?

I have stopped smoking 3 days ago (and 10 hours but who's counting).

I have huge cravings that come periodically (usually once in the morning and one at dinner). They are like a contraction in my chest and I feel like smoking so badly. I get irritated quite easily if people "speak the wrong way" and I feel like yelling at them.

How do you deal with that? How do you calm it down?

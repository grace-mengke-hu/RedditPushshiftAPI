I give up. I wish you all good luck with your journeys.

My life has been in a shit state for a while. I can't really say it's all the cigarettes fault for that. But it sure contributed its part. I am currently trying to crawl outside of this pit and I thought, that I had to quit smoking in order to do so. Because it always made me so sick, but I just can't do it. 

I've read all books and I know why we smoke, why we should quit etc.
But not smoking just makes me even less productive. For some reason I suddenly don't feel like doing anything and want to waste even more time playing video games. 

For the last 2 weeks I tried to quit where I managed to get to day 2 two times and the rest failed all in the evening. Every single time I regretted smoking and had to try again and again. But I just can't do it anymore. I just can't do that transformation to a non-smoker anymore. 

I spent new ears eve alone at home and smoking again after my 2 day streak. Its 2015, a new year, I wasted a whole year doing nothing whatsoever and trying to escape and haven't managed to make something happen.


 So my goal is now to climb myself out of this pit of Low self esteem, anxiety, lazyness, depression and so on. And I hope that either on my way out or once I managed to climb out of that I'll be able to quit for good.


I feel like I need a time where I am a bit more busy, where smoking is not the main thing in my life.


I just wanted to let you guys know that I am proud of every single one of you and hope the best for you. Now I can just hope that smoking won't damage me beyond repair.

Happy new year.

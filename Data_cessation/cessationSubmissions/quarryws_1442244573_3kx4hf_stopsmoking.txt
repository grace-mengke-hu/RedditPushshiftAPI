Today is one week for me! Is anyone else experiencing sadness and mourning saying goodbye to your "fun" smoking self?

Today marks one week since I had a cigarette. Although I feel really great and proud of myself, I spent the better part of yesterday afternoon feel pretty depressed.  It's worth noting that a week before I quit smoking, I quit drinking as well. (I knew there was no way I'd be able to quit smoking without first quitting drinking).  Anyway, the boyfriend and I got in a huge fight, and I got out of the car and began walking home. All I could think about, and I mean ALL I could think about, was wanting to go buy a pack and a bottle of wine, and sit on my back porch for the rest of the day.  I've always been the uncouth, funny friend, who always has a cigarette and a glass of wine in her hand. I am happy to be healthier, certainly. I suppose I'm just having a hard time saying goodbye to that person. Anyone else experience this? 

No, I did not smoke.  :)

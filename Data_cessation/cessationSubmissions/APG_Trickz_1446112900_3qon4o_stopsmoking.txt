One week down!

So I've tried a few times in the past, some for hours, some for days, some for months - but every time it didn't quite feel right. I felt like that self control wasn't there, however this time is different. 

Sure, I still get cravings - like all hell, but I have the restraint to not go to the servo and buy another pouch. Fill up my water bottle, read a book, drum for a while, go to the gym. It's all coming together really nicely!

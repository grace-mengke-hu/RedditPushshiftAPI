Almost done with the first day.

I started smoking again and I don't even know why. It was my third time quitting and I had a couple months under my belt. I just started again, and unlike the last couple times, I couldn't pin it on a bad day at work or a fight with my girlfriend or playing a really good show. I just...started.

So now I'm just...stopping. If there's no real motivation or rationalization for starting, then I've got plenty of motivation and rationalization for quitting. I'm burning money, I can't hit high notes as strongly anymore, and daily bike rides are starting to kick my ass. So, patch on arm, smokes given away, let's rock and roll.

I'm jonesing right now, at this very second, so I joined this sub. And quitnet. And I've got Pokemon on netflix going, 'cause that never hurt anything. If anyone's up for a conversation, or has advice, anything at all, please message me. I could use all the help I can get.

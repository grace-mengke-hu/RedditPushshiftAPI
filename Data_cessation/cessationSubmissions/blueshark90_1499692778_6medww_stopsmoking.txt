Started 6Month ago - Stop now

Hey folks, I'm 26. My first cigarette with 24!
Never touched one before due to my religious upbringing.

Started in January..but It really make no sense. 

My curiosity ends here. It's simply a habit that ruins my body.
Haven't smoke for 3 days now and I feel the urge

Any recommendations?

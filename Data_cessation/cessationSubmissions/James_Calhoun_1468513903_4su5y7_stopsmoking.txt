Insane cravings

So I am 67 days down the road and was almost completly craving free. Until this week. Last tuesday I got wasted with friends and that night I was all of a sudden craving cigarettes like crazy, even though I've been drinking and got wasted a few times before. Anyway, ever since that night I've been getting cravings like its the first three days again, making me crazy. But I will not buy a pack, not since I've come this far. 

Anyone can relate to this?

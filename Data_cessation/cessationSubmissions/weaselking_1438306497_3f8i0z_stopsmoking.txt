Almost made it

Well, gotta play fair, 720 days wasn't a bad run. I dropped the ball. Life got especially hard and annoying and I am not better than any other relapser. I'll make another run at it soon. Hopefully nobody shits on me too hard while I'min the midst of a difficult struggle. But then they undoubtably do, hopefully iI carry a piece of this lesson with me and remain dedicated. But like i said, that will be on the next go 'round. I don't know when it will be, but I imagine I will go for longer and will have more of the tools I have picked up along the way to guide me. Shit happens. Talk to you all soon.

Quitting reveals all sorts of ugly truths for me

I'm about 5 days in cold turkey 100th attempt... Someone on this sub mentioned chain smoking and it made me think "pretty much gives us all something to do for big chunks of time." I chain smoked of course I was a hardcore 20 year smoker. I guess I'm realizing how much of an "escape" it was and how frequently I seek escape or avoidance in my daily life. Do you get it? There could be a hundred different outcomes to a situation - or there can be "just smoke." I LITERALLY traded smoking for LIFE.  For life experiences. For health. I closed doors with it. I put up walls. I had an excuse. And apparently I needed it :( I just wanted to express this because I KNOW there are more like me out there facing their demons. And it's fucking scary and it reveals so much. I've struggled with depression for a lot of my life, the kind that just makes you complacent and somewhat content doing life's bare minimum. I now have one less distraction from it all. I've been poring over this sub for support since the day I quit and I thank you all. I wanted to write this because I hadn't seen anyone else really address how much it can shake up your entire existence. Granted, my existence was/is kind of in need of shaking up. Years of depression, smoking, regular pot use and drinking, these were my answers. Ill keep you posted on new discoveries and pitfalls on the journey. Thank you

Recovering from smoking

I had my last smoke about one and a half years ago. But since quitting I have had throat problems, sore throat coughing a lot etc. I figure its just my lungs and throat healing and it has been slowly getting better but after a year and a half I'm fed up with it.

After I quit I was eating a packet a day of throat lozenges to try and help get rid of Phlegm but I feel like they went to far the other way and was drying out my throat. The best thing I have tried seems to be tea with some honey in it, it wont help repair the lungs or throat but it helps sooth a sore throat.

Does anyone have any advice on supplements or things I can be doing to encourage and possibly speed up this recovery?

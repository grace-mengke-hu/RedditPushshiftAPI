After 14 years, it's time.

I'm posting this here because... well because i think i *need* to make it official in the face of a group of people to help convince myself. 

I'm 26 and have been smoking since i'm 12. I love smoking, but i hate all that comes with it. I'm sick and tired of the smell in my appartment. Sick and tired of walking outside of parties for a smoke. 

I've had enough of this shit. It's expensive, it fucking reeks and every damn morning i get up i feel like shit.

I'll do this, for myself.

I know it's nothing original, but thank God for this subreddit, this might just be what i needed.

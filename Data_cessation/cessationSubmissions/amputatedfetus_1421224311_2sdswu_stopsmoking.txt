Finally had my wakeup call

Wound up in the hospital with an asthma attack on the 2nd, best wakeup call I could have gotten. I spent a solid 6 hours barely able to inhale and felt as if I was breathing through a straw. I could hardly speak it was so hard for me to breathe. I don't want to keep doing this to my lungs. Wasn't expecting to quit any time soon but now I am convinced that my cig habit needs to come to an end. I'm not "trying" to quit this time, I am going to quit. I am not a cigarette smoker anymore.

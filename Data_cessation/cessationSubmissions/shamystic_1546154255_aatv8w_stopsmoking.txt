Thanks r/stop smoking

Been lurking for a while. I quit smoking almost 3 years ago to the day, however there’s a but. 

Every now and then I smoke. When drinking I often smoke. I had a 3 month honeymoon in SE Asia where I smoked for most of it. I just did a 6 week project that was 16 hour days 7days a week and the only time I could leave my desk was for a smoke break.

Last night I went out for some drinks whilst on holiday, pretty sure I’d buy a pack of cigs. Waiting for the right time to tell my wife hoping she wouldn’t get too mad. 

I DIDN’T. This sub was in the back of my mind, and how well everyone else is doing and it made me say no. 

I’m just so happy with myself and grateful this sun exists I had to share. Thanks.

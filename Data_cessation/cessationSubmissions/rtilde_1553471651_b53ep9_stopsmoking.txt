I'm quitting, but do I want to?

Don't get me wrong, I dislike the smell, the taste, all the money spent on it, the effect it has on my already loud snoring, the little secret shame I feel whenever I go on a date and I have to pretend I don't smoke until I'm sure the other person smokes too. I live in a country where smoking is still pretty common, but the times, they are a-changin'.

I do miss the little moments I had for myself, going out for a walk or sitting down at a caf√© and having a smoke. A lot, actually. Right now I'm thinking about just putting on some clothes, going downstairs and buying a pack, just so I can have "just one to calm my nerves".

I think I came here hoping to hear from someone that one little cigarette won't do any harm. Just, like, one per day while I wean off it. I mean, quitting cold turkey is probably not the easiest way to do it, *right*?. But I know about this slippery "one last cig" slope.

But I want to lie to myself. 

It's been a little over two days, after four years of smoking a pack-a-day. I think I want to stop, but I'm pretty sure I can, and am going to find a way to justify getting one more smoke in sometime soon.

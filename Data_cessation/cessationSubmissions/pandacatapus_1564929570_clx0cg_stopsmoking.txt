Struggling

Gosh it’s been about 3 months since I quit smoking but I keep finding myself in situations (like at parties or camping) and I’m with smokers and I end up either taking a few drags or smoking a cigarette. I try not to guilt myself too much for this because I don’t think guilt will get me far. But socializing and having a couple drinks with my friends who are smokers is proving to be a big trigger for me. When I am not drinking around smokers, I am fine and have no urge to smoke a cigarette. Even when I have a couple drinks with friends who are all non smokers, I have no urge. But dang it, if you put one smoker in the group, I absolutely crumble for it. Luckily in the last 3 months of quitting I’ve only smoked twice and I feel proud of that. Anytime I do smoke I just get back on the horse again but I just don’t know what to do when I hang out with smokers.

Dental floss and pistachios! What's yours?

Hi guys! I had my last smoke Monday morning and am loving how it feels to be a nonsmoker! For the time being I'm still experiencing cravings, so I have my own little "tricks" to get through them. Here at work, I go floss my teeth in the bathroom instead of ducking out for a smoke. While I'm driving (huge trigger), I chomp in-shell pistachios to keep my mouth busy. I want to hear about your craving-stoppers!

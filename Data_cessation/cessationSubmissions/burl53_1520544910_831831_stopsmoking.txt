No longer keeping track of days without cigarettes

Currently entering my second week without cigarettes (still getting my nicotine from a vape) and I’ve found that I keep obsessing over how many hours and minutes I’ve gone and how much money I’ve saved. I told myself today that I’m done constantly checking how far away I am from my past life as a smoker and moving on to living life as a non smoker. Not letting cigarettes have any room in my mind for thoughts.

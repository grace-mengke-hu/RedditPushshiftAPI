Day 1 I've tried many times before, but I'm 19 and have so much more to live for than smoking.

Hey there. First post here, long time lurker. 
I'm 19 and have been smoking on and off since I was 16, I've quit for over a year before but then started again last year sometime in October. 

I'm right in the middle of exams, and the stress is getting to me, but I know I'll be able to quit for good this time. 

I've read Allen carrs book, and while I smoked my last cigarette I realized I never really needed them. I could have been doing so much better at university if I didn't smoke, gotten fitter, and pursued my dreams. 

So here I am, a non smoker from today. 

Good luck to anyone else quitting today! We can do this.

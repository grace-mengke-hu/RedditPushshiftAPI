Smoking for last one year...Last few months 2 packs ( 20 cigarettes) a day.. Deciding to Chuck nicotine out of my life.

Long time lurker here. Reading posts in this community and Allen Carr book along with whyquit articles have immensly helped me to form a perspective over the extent of this addiction. I have come to realize there is nothing inherently wrong in my character to 'Want to Smoke'. All the thoughts and beliefs I have regarding smoking in my mind are due to the addiction and conditioning. I chose the nicotine use due to my curiosity about what makes people smoke and honestly saying, I liked what I felt that day and wanted more of it . Nicotine hooked me that day onwards and I have been smoking more than 10 every day for many months now. But it also started a cycle of self hatred, shame and guilt in me. Still I smoked because my  brain suggested me it would be good idea to light up a cigarette by showing up high definition images of those blissful feelings. Also I was afraid that I won't be able to handle withdrawals and urges.

After reading here and other support articles on the net, I now know that there is nothing to be afraid of those withdrawals. They are just a sign that my neurotransmitter levels are out of balance at the moment and will soon normalize if I allow them to. And the only way I can allow them to be normal is by not having another puff again. I also realize that urges are a sign of highjacked brain and nothing they tell or show me is true, no matter how emotionally charged or high-definition they appear to be.

I also know now that I can never take this addiction lightly. I can never be over my nicotine addiction. That means I dare not think I have defeated this addiction and can have one now and not have a full fledged nicotine use at my current level later.

I hereby start work on leaving  behind the days of intense self hatred when I smoked. 
Wish me luck.

Quit 2 months ago now bad cough

I quit on Jan 2nd and now feel like a non smoker, don't crave and feel i've cracked it. However for the last 2 weeks i have a really dry cough. it started with my chest feeling like i have smoked 2 packs in a night and a dry tickle throat. I'm living on cough sweets but don't feel like i have a chest infection or virus. I'm not coughing up green or brown. Does anyone else have this? i know you can get a cough from stopping as your lungs heal but thought i'd have it in the first month not the third. anyone know how long it lasts or the best way to manage?

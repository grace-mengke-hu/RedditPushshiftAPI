I’ve decided to quit smoking weed.

I don’t know if this is the right subreddit, but I’m cutting weed out of my life. Every time I smoke I feel defeated like I’ve given into the urge and feel like I’m destroying my body. Yet, I still light up another joint the next day knowing I’ll still feel the same effects. I’m only 17 and this stuff is rotting my brain and tearing up my lungs.

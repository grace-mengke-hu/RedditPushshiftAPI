Three Weeks and counting!

Week Four is upon me. Still not too bad, but I do get bouts of depression still. But I do breathe easier, and my nose is less stuffy. Still, I have lost a few friends, just because I normally hang out with them in the smoking area at my office, and now I can't/won't/don't hang out there any more.

Oh well.

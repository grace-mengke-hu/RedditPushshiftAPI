Trying to quit again...

Hi,

So, I posted around 9 months back about my quitting ( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/99mstt/just_passing_a_very_strong_craving/ ). Unfortunately, I had a relapse. It's like the 100th time I am trying but this time, I intend to stay strong. Hopefully, this will be my last time. I think I will pick up a hobby as the guy who draws pokemon. He truly is an inspiration. I have joined swimming and love it and hopefully it will be the alternative addiction I need.

Thanks for hearing me.

Methods that worked for me as a repeat quitter.

Hey everyone,

This is for people like myself who have had tremendous difficulty quitting cold turkey and don't respond well to cessation aids (patches, gum, etc.). I am not proposing anything to be superior or guaranteed, but more so as simple alternatives since everyone's physiology is different and responds differently. I was more addicted to the physical habit itself rather than the nicotine, and this is what worked for me (currently free for 5 months now):

- Up until your quit date (if you have one), take an herbal or fruity tea outside with you on your smoke breaks. Unlike coffee and black teas, the taste from herbal tea or anything fruit flavored does not pair well with the taste of tobacco. Also, the habit of going outside with herbal tea will be helpful as a substitute after quit day if you're like me and equate being outside with the action of smoking. My go-to was green tea. Other teas that work are listed [here](http://www.livestrong.com/article/32084-teas-stop-smoking/).

- While on that note, start abstaining from coffee and alcohol when possible, substituting with tea if needed to (especially if you're a coffee shop lover). Coffee and alcohol is a major trigger for many, since they both tend to increase cravings and enhance the taste of a cigarette. 

- If possible, exercise or get a workout somehow (and drink a lot of water while doing so). I've never been able to finish more than a puff of a cigarette after jogging for an hour. Plus the endorphins helps curb any unpleasant anxiety or irritability from withdrawals.  

- As far as mouth fixation goes, chew some toothpicks. My favorite are the flavored ones (such as cinnamon and tea tree) and I find them to really help curb cravings. Other people may prefer gum or candy.

- Find a source of reinforcement. Try to enlist a smoking friend to quit with you if possible. Tell those who live with you about you quitting so they can be the voice of reason when the cravings start to become unbearable. And, as always, you have this subreddit to come to for support. 

- Track your progress. This is also a method of reinforcement. It may seem fruitless, but it really does make a difference. There is a plethora of apps you can download on your phone that keep track of days you've been smoke free; as well as money saved not buying cigarettes.

- Remember this phrase: "You don't need them."

I hope these will work at least a little bit for other people as they have for me.

Just Discovered this subreddit. This October marks 1 year of not smoking for me...

I'm currently 25 years old and started smoking when I was around 13. At my peak I was somewhere between 1 and 2 packs a day. I decided a year ago that there's really no reason to smoke so I quit. I finished my pack I had and bought one of those e cigs . I hated that thing and it lasted a day before I tossed it . 

Withdrawals started immediately, which most of you have seemed to experience. I was mostly very cranky and that lasted about a month. 

One noticeable side effect from quitting smoking is how much my appetite grew. Also because my parents are both smokers and I started so young I never realized how bad an ashtray stinks.

Anyways that's my story , if anyone here needs any advice I can do my best to help you out. Good luck on kicking the habit!

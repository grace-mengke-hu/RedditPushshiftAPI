I still want to smoke :(

I quit as my new year resolution on the second. (This is the second time I have quit. I quit for a year and a half from 2009-2011.) Yesterday I cheated and smoked a cig. I hate that its something I still want. I find that I am more stressed mostly because I am eating more and I am afraid of gaining more weight. Any suggestions for calming the cravings without food???

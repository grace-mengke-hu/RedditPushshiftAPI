Almost 2 weeks in and this is what I've learned.

12 days and now its easy. The first 5 days were very rough and if you like to go out like me, it is pivotal to not for the first weekend or in my case till I feel I can go to a bar and have a drink without wanting to smoke. I haven't drank since I've stopped smoking because for me they go hand in hand, and I've learned a few things. 

1) I like being sober and smoke free. I wake up early have some coffee, read the newspaper go to work, gym, rinse and repeat. 

2) Smelling fresh all day is awesome

3) My non smoking friends are the most supportive people and hold me accountable and even my smoking friends are saying I'm inspiring them. I've been a smoker for 12 years.

The biggest thing that helps when I have a craving, (now 1 a day these last few days) I grab a straw and breathe through it till the craving is over. It's incredibly difficult and reminds me that this is what my life can and probably will be like if I don't quit forever. Breathing is a luxury and I enjoy it 10x more than smoking. 

Good luck you quitters. I'm rooting for all of you.

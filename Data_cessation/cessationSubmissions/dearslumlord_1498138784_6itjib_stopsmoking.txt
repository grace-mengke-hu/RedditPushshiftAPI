The work smoke break of death

Man, I can't tell you how many times I've relapsed from what I call the work smoke break of death. For the longest time I would just say "fuck it" and have a smoke with my co-workers.

Luckily, 90% of them have quit, or are in the process of quitting. 

Has anyone fell for the work smoke break of death? I have more times than I can count....that and being drunk. My urges to smoke have gone from extreme to none over the course of 7 days. The first few days sucked, but today I woke up and I didn't have such a dire urge to smoke. Here's to hoping that this streak lasts me a lifetime!

edit: I've been using General snus to help me quit. I highly recommend it!! Granted, it still has nicotine, but it is unquestionably safer for you than smoking. I'm also using Smokey Mountain to help as well, and they're both working! Highly suggest you all check out these!

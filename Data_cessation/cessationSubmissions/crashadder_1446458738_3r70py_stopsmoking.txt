nearly there

Hi,
woow. 15 days left to my anniversary. very excited and somewhat emotional too.  looking back i dont remember the last time i had anything strong to call a craving. For me they were all gone after 2 months. Triggers however might posses greater risk unless you have the right mindset. that is not to forget about the fact that you dont smoke because you enjoy it. its nothing more nor less than an addiction to the nicotine. cigarette is just the fastest way to deliver the drug because the feedback is instant. this mindset will protect you. I know i will never smoke again because i simply cant picture myself being addicted to a drug ever again. Life is way better without it.

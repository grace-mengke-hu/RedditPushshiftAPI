Whiter teeth??

I don't see my badge on the phone but I think I'm near to 4 weeks not smoking a single cig. This is quite an accomplishment for me and I'm really proud of this. I don't think I would possible to do it without people who where really helpful for me. Ofc I mean ppl from this reddit :). Big thanks!Anyway, about 2 weeks after last cig I bought new tooth paste(whitening) and like couple of days ago I bought myself new tooth brush(whitening one somehow). I noticed like really big difference in my teeth color. I think they are whiter. Is it really possible? It is true that I always wanted to whiten them just a little bit and I was using normal tooth paste and cheap tooth brush and I was smoking. But would it really be that easy to whiten teeth? I'm sorry for gore text, English is not my native language.

Checking in to give you some motivation

Hello to all you new and old former smokers. (you don't smoke anymore so you are not a smoker)

I don't really think about smoking at all anymore, and I haven't thought about this subreddit in several months. Almost all my triggers are gone now. but as i was just working on something here in the office, i let out a deep sigh (frustration) and a warning trigger went off that caught me by surprise. It wasn't the "need a cig" feeling though (apparently that one is long gone), it was the "you are about to cough hard so get ready" feeling.

Except I didn't cough at all, and in that brief moment I was really able to appreciate at a deeper level how enjoyable it is to be able to breath well. How euphoric it is to feel the air moving smoothly in and out of your lungs.

It is amazing, and you can feel it too!

Keep up your good work.

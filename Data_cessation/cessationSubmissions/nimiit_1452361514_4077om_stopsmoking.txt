4 days without smoking. When do you start feeling better?

Hello ex-smokers of Reddit! I decided to quit cold turkey after 5 years of smoking.
So I thought nicotine goes out of your system in 3 days? It's been 4 days since I last smoked and my cravings are strong still, I feel so pissed off and have a headache  from morning to evening.  

So after how many days will I start feeling okay? I really want to quit this time but I feel so freaking dead.

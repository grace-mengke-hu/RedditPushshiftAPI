Day 2 coming to an end!

I don't know why I keep putting myself through this misery.
This is probably day 2 for the 15th time.. I quit for a month, 2 months, 3 months, 1 year, 1 week, 3 days but always smoked that 'just one' cigarette. ####!

Day 2 will be coming to an end shortly (in just a few hours) and then onto day 3, which will not be any better than today if my memory serves me correctly!

I hate this anxiety feeling which is slowly building up in my chest.. and the sad feeling at the same time, almost like mourning, which is crazy, because when I smoke all I can think about is how filthy it is!

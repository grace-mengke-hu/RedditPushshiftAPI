Stopped smoking yesterday

I decided ~24 hours ago enough was enough. I'm 18. I've been smoking pretty consistently for around a year, off and on since I was around 14 (maybe a pack a week or less). But for the past year, I've not went a single day without a cig. My lung health has diminished greatly, I'm coughing and feeling congested all of the time. And while right now, I'd like nothing more than to smoke a cigarette, my lungs would like nothing more than to breathe fresh air. 

But here's to 24 hours without smoking! and hopefully a life time without another cig. 

(I heard the first 72 hours were the worse on physical withdraw, I've had kind of a flush and a slight headache today. Slightly moodier, but other than that.. I think I'm going to be okay)

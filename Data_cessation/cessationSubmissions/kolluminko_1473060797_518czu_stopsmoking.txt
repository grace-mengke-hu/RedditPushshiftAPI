one week in. slept like a baby this night.

woke up with unexpected energy in my body. so confident not to ram coffinnails into my throat ever again. 

survived this last summer weekend with friends and drinks.

first thing i read in the morning is this sub. when i have cravings, i read this sub. i am not alone with this. helps so much. .

met a focused version of myself i wasnt even aware of. constant threat of the beast. it waits for me to get slightly slippery to haunt me down.

true freedom is self-control.

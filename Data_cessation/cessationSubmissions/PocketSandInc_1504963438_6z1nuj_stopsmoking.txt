This will be my first time having a night out with friends since I quit. Any tips you have to resist the urge to smoke when drinking?

Two out of the five people I will be with smoke, and I'm a little worried about relapsing.  For the last couple years I have been mainly a weekend social smoker, so I'm facing my biggest weakness tonight.  Of course I will tell my friends to not give me a cig under any circumstances, but you know how it goes sometimes...it's easy to bum one off somebody else.  Any advice to calm the powerful urges that are sure to come after a few drinks is much appreciated!

I dont know if it's too late

I have been a smoker for 5 years. Unlike most of my friends, I did not started it out of curiosity. It was a path of self destruction after break up with my girlfriend (i know the reason is hilarious). Soon i started smoking marijuana too. Initially it never bothered me even though my well wishers were against it. Just in 1 year i became a smoke addict. All the day i would do nothing just lie on the bed and smoke joints after joints and bongs after bongs. My performance started to decrease and i lost my reputation among my acquaintances. I thought i would never come out of it. My health was deteriorating. Suddenly something happened. Two of my smoke buddies went to a cancer institute a week ago to visit a 7 year old patient. Their experiences there made them cry. Two 23 year olds cried. They shared the things they saw, with me, and it sends chills down my spine! Together we vowed never to smoke again. I dont know if it's too late but i am definitely not going to touch that substance ever again. Wish me luck. Stay healthy and strong.

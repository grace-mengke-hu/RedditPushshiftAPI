After quitting, will the smoke ever wash out of your clothes?

How long will it take to wash out the smoke? We smoked in the house and it seems to help rid the house of smoke smell I have to wipe down (well I'm lazy I got another mop and moped) the walls and ceiling (no money for just painting over it). Did anyone end up just saying screw it and have buy new clothes? And then not contaminate them with the smoky clothes? Is my sniffer too sensitive?

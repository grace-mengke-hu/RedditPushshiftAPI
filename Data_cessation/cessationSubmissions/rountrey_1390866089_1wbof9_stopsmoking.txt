So, um... day 1 started this morning.

Been smoking for somewhere around 16-17 years, and to be honest with everyone, I've tried all the patches, gum, candy, pills, and stuff. Even the more recent e-cigs. None of that did anything for me. So, I'm going with the cold turkey method.

From what I can gather, every method really depends on the person on if it will be successful or not. I'm going to go with this. 

But, if I could gather some information from everyone who reads this. I know that nicotine will be out of my blood in roughly 3 days, but there is the chemical that nicotine metabolizes to, cotinine, that sticks around for up to 10 days. What I want to know is a first hand account of how long the withdrawal symptoms last. 

Simple is good, if you just want to say "3 days" that's fine or "2 days were bad but it was managable after 5". 

Thanks to all, and now I'm going to go pace some more.

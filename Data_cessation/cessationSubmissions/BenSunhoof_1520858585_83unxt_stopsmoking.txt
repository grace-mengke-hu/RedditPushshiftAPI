I want to convince my girlfriend to quit. Please help.

I love my girlfriend, hence why I want her to be well. The fact that she's been smoking for such a long time bothers me a lot. I get that it's her decision, so I have no say on the matter, but the problem is she doesn't find any enjoyment in smoking cigarettes anymore either, and she told me that herself. The only thing that is stopping her from trying to quit is the struggle of quitting itself. She doesn't want to feel shitty after long periods of not smoking, she doesn't want to spend money on different additives to help her quit. We both agree that smoking is not very good for her (she's coughing so much lately), but she just won't bother trying. I want the love of my life to feel relief after quitting, I want her to feel that spending hundreds of dollars monthly on something that doesn't really benefit anyone is not a good thing. I would really appreciate if someone could help me out convincing her to at least try. I hope I don't sound too much like a selfish prick, but I just want her to feel better. Thank you in advance.

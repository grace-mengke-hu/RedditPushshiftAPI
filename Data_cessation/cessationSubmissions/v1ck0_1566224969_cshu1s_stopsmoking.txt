Quitters flu

Oof. Day 3. First few days waking up with a sore throat. Lastnight and today its definitely feeling more like a sinus infection. I ate a bunch of honey infused garlic last night which helped a lot with the pain. Going to stick to that before antibiotics. Any advice out there? Everything sinus hurts especially throat.

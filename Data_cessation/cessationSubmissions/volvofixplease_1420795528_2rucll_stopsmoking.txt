Three weeks of awesomeness

The first seventeen days were really really tough for me but for the past 4 days I literally had zero cravings-just thoughts which were so easy to dismiss as silly that its almost like I was never a smoker at all.Lets look at the pros and cons I experiemced in these three weeks:
Pros:so much extra money,i can smell shit,i can taste food,no coughing,i smell like a flower,i dont look so pale anymore,blood pressure optimized,can enjoy things without thinking about next cigarette,increased bloodflow (if you know what i mean) ,godlike confidence,self-respect,stress and anxiety reduced.
cons:im trying my hardest but i cant think of any 
Stay strong my fellow new quitters it really gets easier i promise

Nicotine helps improve my confidence and performance at work. Really makes me not want to quit...

Every single time I quit for a couple months, my anxiety increases and my performance goes down.

When I’m on nicotine though I feel so energized and confident and can tackle anything.

I really don’t want to quit because of this, can anyone give me a counter argument on why I should quit? I’m early in my career, and doing well and getting shit done and getting promotions sounds like a great incentive to stay on it.

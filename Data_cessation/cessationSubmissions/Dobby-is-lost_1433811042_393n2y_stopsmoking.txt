Struggling tonight...

I had a pretty bad terrible two tantrum filled day with my daughter.  To top it off, she threw something at my face and out of instinct, I pushed her. It wasn't very hard, but hard enough to make me feel guilty as shit. I feel like a terrible mother. A gawd awful terrible mother. Usually I would deal with these feelings with smoking. I'm on day 17...and for the first time,  I'm really craving one.

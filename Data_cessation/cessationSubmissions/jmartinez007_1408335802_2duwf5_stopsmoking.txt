Today is the first day of not smoking

Today is the first step in me wanting to quit smoking. I was craving a cigarette so badly earlier but I refrained from it. I have come to realize that even though I do enjoy the tobacco, I enjoy the automatic movement more. Also, I have viewed the reasons for smoking and have come to the realization that they are not the best reasons for a well adjusted individual. Does anyone have ANY tips to help make this new harrowing journey to being smoke free any easier? ( I will be starting a new college semester in about a week and I want to stick to quitting).

Day 1 completed

Hello, this is the first time I've ever (EVER!) tried to quit. I've been smoking since I was 12 years old (horrible, I know), every day 15-18 cigarettes and I'm almost 23 years old now. I just decided I want to try this, and I forced myself not to buy a pack. 24 hrs have passed and it hasn't been as hard as I thought it would be, yet. There are moments where you feel like something's missing or there's nothing to do with the time, but overall the psychological triggers are defeatable. When I started this I did this for fun, and experiments sake, to see if I can go 24h without a cigarette, instead of carefully researching and preparing for this. I do not have the "I'll never ever smoke again" scary feeling because of that. Me being able to last 24h is actually kind-of cool, and now I'm sort of addicted to seeing how long I can last. So, in my head I've not given anything up, but I'm also not smoking. I'm a smoker that's not doing it, instead of a quitee or non-smoker. 
It's the first time I've felt so in control, so powerful, and the first time since childhood I can smell better and breathe easier. This is amazing! Wish me luck!

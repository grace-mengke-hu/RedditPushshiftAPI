Christmas was rough.

Yesterday was rough for me, I had a ton of opportunities to go get some smokes, and the whole family Christmas thing was brutal on the senses.  I had a craving for cigarettes literally for 12 hours.   Wasn't the 10 minute then it's faded away kind, it was fucking brutal.  Thankfully as it's day 5 (this go around) I know it was just my body talking desperately, and my brain was smart enough to know "this sucks, but I don't really need a cigarette".  Also I weened myself a bit before I quit this time, which helped a little.  The days leading up to my last I only had 2 a day, and my last day I only had 1, so the nicotine level had already dropped pretty low in my bloodstream prior to stopping altogether.  

Woke up today happy I didn't partake in a smoke yesterday.  1 more day smoke free, one more day past my last smoke.  Over the physical addiction hump now, but the mental game still is tough.

Normally I would be chewing gum or something to help, but I got braces over the summer, so that' no longer an option.  This go around it's extra rough.

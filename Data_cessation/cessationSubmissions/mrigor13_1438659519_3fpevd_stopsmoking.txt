I wrote a poem to help me stop smoking. I hope you like it.

Goodbye, My Love   

Hello, my love, where have you been?    
I’ve felt you deep beneath my skin.

I crave to see your gentle curves.    
They bring me peace as I observe.

This love has grown for many years.    
Of which have never brought me tears.

I sit and ponder where I’d be,    
If you decide to leave from me.

Your gentle kisses burn like fire.    
The mist from you is my desire.

However sad, the time has come,    
For me to leave and struggle on.

I know you’ll watch me as I go,    
So far from you – so far from home.

My love, I know that we are one.    
Goodbye, my love, we are now done.

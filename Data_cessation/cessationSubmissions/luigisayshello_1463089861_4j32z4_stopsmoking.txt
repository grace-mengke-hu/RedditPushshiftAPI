How did you reduce your hunger during withdraw?

Title says it, but I'm already above the weight that I should, I'm putting together some things to help me with the withdraw and the first time I tried to stay away from tobacco, I noticed that my testosterone rose a lot and I had a lot of hunger/need to eat, like a lot! Is this normal? If so how did you cope with that?

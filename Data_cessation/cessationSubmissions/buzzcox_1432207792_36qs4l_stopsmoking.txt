I quit smoking on Tuesday!

I am a non-smoker now after 15 years. It's day 3, I've drank about 10 litres of cranberry juice, smashing the oats, and have pretty much locked myself down in the office. I'm almost there guys! What's helping me is that I looked up what people have to go through with heroin withdrawal, and if people go through that, I should be able to go through this easy! Great work ex-smokers! and ex-addicts of all sorts!

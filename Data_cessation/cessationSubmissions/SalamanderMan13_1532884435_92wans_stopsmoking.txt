Need some help......

On day 11 of no chewing tobacco. I used Snus and once in a while dip for a little over a year. After quitting I Now feel tired quite often, very somber/mopey or down every once in a while, and have little to no sex drive which is probably the most concerning. No interest to masterbate even. I even went to the doctor because I was worried about low testosterone but they did blood tests and said it was good at 298 NG/DL. I’m just worried about this and how much longer it’s going to take? Feeling frustrated if my libedo is ever going to come back and am almost wanting to turn back to the can. Has anyone else been though the same kind of symptoms or is this A-typical? Thanks.

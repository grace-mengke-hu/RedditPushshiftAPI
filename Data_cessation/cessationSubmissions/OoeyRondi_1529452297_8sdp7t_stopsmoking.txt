About to be a real week without a cigarette!

Technically quit 9 days ago but caved and bought a pack while out drinking three days in, smoked one and threw the rest out. Tomorrow is a week from that day and I'm feeling great! Cravings have been not the best but I've been able to manage. This is I think my 5th attempt at quitting but by far the best already. We can all do it!

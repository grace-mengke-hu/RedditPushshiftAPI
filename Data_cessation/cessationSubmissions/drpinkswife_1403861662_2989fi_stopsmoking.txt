Im going to discuss bowels, don't click on the link if you don't want to know.

So yeah, I quit smoking and caffeine at the same time because they go together. I thought I'd get all bunged up, but I have the opposite problem. I thought I'd gain weight, but my stomach feels rough and I really don't want to eat. Baking like a madwoman; I just don't eat the stuff. 6 days in, I guess I'd like to know when the digestive tract is going to settle! Please and thank you. Also last night was rough, but I'm proud of myself for waking up a non-smoker! :))

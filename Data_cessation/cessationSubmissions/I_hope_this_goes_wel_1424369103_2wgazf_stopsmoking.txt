Almost there!

Out of the 10-15 times I have attempted to quit I have only made it this far two other times. The longest I have ever gone without smoking a cigarette is 29 days. My girlfriend was actually about to surprise me with an accessory for my guitar until she found out I had caved. This was about 6 months ago. 

Now... I have truly quit! Granted I am only at day 22 I KNOW this is it! I just need to make it past a month to prove it to myself.

I am nearly tearing up just feeling the feels I have about this right now.

What changed you ask? I also stopped drinking since I quit. Not permanently. I just found my ultimate trigger that I could never control and decided to completely cut it out for the time being. This community has also helped me tremendously. Any time I get a craving I just pull out my phone and read some of your guys' success stories! It helps me more than you could imagine!

Will post again on day 31 and let you all in on my personal milestone!!

I'm still counting in hours...

I've quit. For the 34th time. My last smoke was August 22nd around 5pm. 

I'm doing ok. 

When I was smoking I was always bitter standing outside puffing away thinking I could be doing so much more with my time. Now, a grand total of two days in, I can't figure out what to do with the time I would normally have stepped outside to smoke...

Brains do weird things for those dopamine fixes...maybe that's what we need. Instead of nicotine patches we can have dopamine patches and shut our brains up...just a thought.

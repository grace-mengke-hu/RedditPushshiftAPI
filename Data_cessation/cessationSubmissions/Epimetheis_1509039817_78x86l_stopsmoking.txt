This party coming up...

So tomorrow night there is this huge party at a friend's and I know for a fact that there will be tons of smokers around. Also weed/alcohol. Any pro tips on how to stay strong? Kind of worried about losing all my progress (reduced smoking over the Last 2 months, smoke free since 11 days, feeling great!)

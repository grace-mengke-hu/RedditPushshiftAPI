Day 23...sudden cravings but never giving in!

For some reason, after having a pretty docile third week, the cravings ramped up again!

Resisting was easier than before, but I still needed to watch myself. I took a good hard look at why and deduced it was due to not having the usual coping mechanisms for stress and frustration. 

I've settled on chewing carrots to get my anger out. It's been great. I'm loving this community where I can get out these feelings!

I'm never going back and I'm enjoying defining the new me!

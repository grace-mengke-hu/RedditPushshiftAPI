About to relapse, please help

I don't know why it's been so hard today and yesterday. I've been trying everything to take my mind off of it but the physical cravings are totally overwhelming. I've been exercising, drinking tons of water, reading Allen Carr. I've been trying *so hard* to stay positive. I tell myself that I will not smoke and I mean it, and I know that I don't really want to smoke. 

But the intrusive thoughts just keep coming. Any time my mind wanders off at all, I get the mental image of myself going outside and lighting a cigarette. I feel ridiculously overemotional, everything is overwhelming me, I feel like I can't think or express myself clearly at all, and I feel fat and afraid that I won't lose weight now that I've quit. Going for walks doesn't help anymore. Nothing takes my mind off of it. 

I just don't understand why I keep feeling like this, it seems like I should be past this. I felt so great the first few days and I had so much momentum. Why is it getting harder instead of easier? 

Edit: Thanks guys. Still haven't had a cigarette 20 hrs later!

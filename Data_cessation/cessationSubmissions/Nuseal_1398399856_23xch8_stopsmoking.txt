Ok for real this time.

Ok so I posted almost a week ago that I was starting my day one. I said I was doing it for myself and my girlfriend. Well I no longer have a girlfriend and said stress caused me to cave, not even 24 hours later of posting on reddit/r/quitsmoking. Well I'm essentially in a better mental state now and I can say that without a doubt I am done. 

I just smoked my last cigarette and dumped the rest in the toilet. I should have done this months ago along with other things in my life. Its time to move forward! 

For real this time.

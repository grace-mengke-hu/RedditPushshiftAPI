Its harder to quit vaping because no danger.help

It was easy for me to stop cigarettes after reading the book (Allen) and because I was feeling soooo much better,my youth and energy got back .
But down the road I fucked up and started vaping and this is way harder because...well I don't see any difference and I dont see the harm in vaping .
I don't spend more then 20$ a week on it (MAX) and my athletic abilities are the same .
I try to talk to people who have stoped smoking by switching to the vape .and they all feel great ,now I talk to people who stoped the vap and they are like "yeah ...I feel a little better ,better sleep maybe ? O and I feel free !!!" .
I dont really mind being a slave to it ,optimizing my body and mind is my only goal.
So basically I desperately need some stories or something to argue against vaping!
Thanks !

Last cigarette.

My first post. 

I am currently smoking my last cigarette. I started when I was 17. Smoked until 22, I quit for two years. Started smoking again last year when I was offered a cigarette by a friend. Didn't think one could lead anywhere and now here I am a year later. Since then I've quit for a few weeks here and there. 

This time it will be for sure. I am tired of waking up out of breath. I used to do yoga and be healthy. I will get back to that. 

Edit for spelling.

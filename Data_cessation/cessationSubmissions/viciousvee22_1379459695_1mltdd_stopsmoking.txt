I recently quit smoking, which then encouraged my BF to also quit smoking!

I know it's only been 6 days, but it feels like such an accomplishment! After failing so many times, I finally did it. I got SUPER emotional, which was not fun, but I stuck through it and I feel great. I didn't pressure my BF to quit, he just felt the good vibes coming from me and asked me if he should quit too. I told him of course he should and I know he would be able to. Yesterday, Monday, was the hardest for him... he was on his third day and his job was making him go insane, but he made it!

Kinda weird to think I could be so happy about quitting what used to be one of my favorite vices ever. 

The really weird thing is I feel like I have SO much more time now. Has anyone else experienced that?

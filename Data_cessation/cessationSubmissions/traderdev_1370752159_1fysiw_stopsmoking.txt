ex-hookah smoker here.

Been smoking hookah nonstop for the past 12 years.  Rarely I'd go a 4-5 days without it.  Mostly I was smoking every day probably an average of 6 hours a day.  I got a scary call from the doctor this week and decided I needed to stop.  I got the call 6 days ago and haven't smoked it since.  I threw out all my hookah stuff and feel like a non-smoker.  About 10 years ago I went through the easy-way program, and I was able to be hookah/nicotine/tobacco free for 46 days (then I fell because I smoked once).   Hubris got to me.  

Things have changed since.  I now have kids and need to get healthy to spend time with them and see their grandchildren.  I'm leaning heavily on my ecig setup now.  I was thinking of weening off the hookah and transitioning slowly to ecigs before the call, but now vape exclusively.  I've told my closest friends and coworkers and they have become my support network.  

I was curious to hear what /r/stopsmoking's thoughts were on ecigs...

fuck luck (I feel like this should be /r/stopsmoking's mantra)

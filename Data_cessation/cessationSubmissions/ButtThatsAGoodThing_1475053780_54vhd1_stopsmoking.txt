Here we go again. Some support would be very much appreciated!

I've tried stopping smoking now 3 times seriously and all 3 times I failed due to drinking.

When ever I light up it's not due to a massive urge, It's more a horrible routine. I light up before I actually start feeling nervous. (Average is little bit less than 1 package per day).

Today I went to work but I haven't had any time to buy cigarettes. I nicked 2 off my colleague and for the rest smoked nothing the whole day (now is 5PM). Actually I feel great and I still don't feel the urge to light up. 

Long story short, let's do this again! Go to clean up my lungs, teeth, general health. Back to the MMA lessons and saving some money on the side!

I'd really appreciate some feedback from you guys, It's meaning a lot for me!

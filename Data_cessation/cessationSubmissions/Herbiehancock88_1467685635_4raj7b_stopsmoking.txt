Day 1 tomorrow for my fiancée and I.

Just want to say I forsee myself visiting this sub a lot in the months to come. I'm 27(m) and I've been about a pack every two day smoker for probably 10 years now. I started a few years before that (13-16) but it was more like as many as I could bum from my older brother. My fiancée has been about the same amount per day as me but for a few years less. Gonna be tough but it'll be great to have a partner in this battle. Good luck everyone else!

I quit smoking and I feel nothing?

I quit smoking cold turkey about a week ago and haven't had the desire to smoke since. But I don't feel any different. I'm not liberated or anything, I don't fee like I've accomplished anything great? I just always thought that once i quit smoking I would feel like I was on top of the world or something. Anyone have any input?

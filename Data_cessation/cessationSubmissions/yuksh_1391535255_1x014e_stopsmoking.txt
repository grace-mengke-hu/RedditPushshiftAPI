I'm struggling with exams, should I wait?

I have stopped smoking (2 days) with some aid from gums. I am really concerned that I won't be able to study AT ALL for my incoming exams (10, 18, 19 and 21 of this month). 
I am very determined to stop but this is my last year of university and I don't want to screw it up, should I pospone quitting?

I have won, but now the real battle begins

I've been compleatly nicotine-free for the past nine days. It has really been an hard experience, where it has been extremely hard to get any sleep. Some nights i went sleepless, but i managed. 

Im an nicotine addict,and will always be - but i resist my urges and impulses.

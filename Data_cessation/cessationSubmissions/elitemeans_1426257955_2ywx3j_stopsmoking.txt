1 year without smoking!

i was a nicotine addict for 4 years.... everyday minimum 10-15 cigarettes.

I started sports, running and body building... cardio...

i stopped smoking cigarettes... and i am clean for **nearly** one year. i really don't count it, i don't give a shit about it... 

i feel no urge to smoke, i am 22 years old.

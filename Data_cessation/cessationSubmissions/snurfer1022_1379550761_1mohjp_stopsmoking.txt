Alcohol

I've quit before, and every time I go back its when nicotine's partner in crime alcohol is involved.  I'm on day one now, and heading out to a concert where I will be having a few drinks.  Any advice to curb those cravings?  The thought of never having a drunk smoke is kinda freaking me out.  

Edit:Thanks for the advice, had a few drinks but stayed away from the patio and didn't have a smoke.  Now for day 2

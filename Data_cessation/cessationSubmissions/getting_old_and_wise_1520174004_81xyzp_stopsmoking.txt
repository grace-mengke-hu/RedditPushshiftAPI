Vaping vs Smoking

Hi,
I have bought a vape and should get it in another 3-4 days. My plan is to stop smoking and start vaping, gradually reducing the nicotine content to 0mg. I have tried cold turkey, nicotine gums, etc but nothing seems to work. The mood swings just get too much for me.
So, if I start vaping can I count that as quit smoking or should I start the counter after I have stopped vaping too?

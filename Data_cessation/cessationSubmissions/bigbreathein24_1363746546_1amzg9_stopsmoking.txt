Everybody at work smokes.

Which is okay because I don't anymore! But I still feel a little "left out" of their social time when we're on break. I kind of just walk around the office space and eat my sunflower seeds like a hermit. I feel so awkward but I don't want to go stand outside with the smokers and be tempted/smell the shit. 

Anybody else experiencing this?

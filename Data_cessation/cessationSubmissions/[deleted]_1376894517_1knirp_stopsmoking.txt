I have not had a cigarette in 3 days and feel great but am starting to worry about what is to come.

I was mentally ready to quit. I took the CA bar exam in July and told myself I would quit. Smoked for 8 years, pack a day.

I stopped 3 days ago, and bought the patch just in case. Just having the patch close made me more confident. I then stumbled on this sub reddit and read about Carr's book. I downloaded a copy and began reading. The book reinforced why I should not be smoking. I go through moments of panic, but those are overcome knowing smoking won't help.

I am reading through comments to other posts and am getting anxious that people say after a few weeks it gets worse. Isn't it supposed to get better?

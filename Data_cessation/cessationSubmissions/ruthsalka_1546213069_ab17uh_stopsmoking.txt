Failed on what would have been day 50

on the way home after work, anticipating 3 whole days off in a row, a rarity for me, I let the 'one won't hurt, you deserve it voice' lull me into complacency, and I bought a pack. There's one left in that pack and I am going to smoke it either tonight or tomorrow and then START AGAIN. Looking back, thinking about having been smoke free 7 weeks, I have to admit how easy it was.  It's mind-blowing how easy it was to undo that, as well. Shouldn't be, it's not like a zillion non-smokers here and elsewhere didn't warn me. 

Maybe I'll just go wrap that one last smoke in clear packing tape and leave it on my desk as a reminder. My last cigarette- unsmoked, never to be smoked.

stretch time, then stop!

finally,  finally, finally i seem to have broken the spell... 
i'm 19 days in, and have celabrated going to the pub without smoking, meeting my best smoking friend, having a natter and a cackle with her for the first time in 20 odd years without smoking... and not least, have had a humdinger of a stupid argument with my significant other, without settling it all over cigarettes! that is to say we did, but only he smoked. then we made a snow dog.

the method that finally worked for me was:
i spent 4 months stretching time between cigarettes. not stopping, but seeing how long i could do without. in the beginning we were talking hours. then smoking only evenings. then one day without and lots next day. or one per night. then a couple of days at a time. never saying i'd stopped, allowing myself cigarettes if only i'd make it through this day or this situation. my personal best was 6 days in a row. not saying i'd stopped made it not be a defeat when i smoked again. it became game of just trying to challenge my personal best.

then i set a date. it was about a month and a half ahead. so i had plenty oportunity to smoke before quitting, but having weened myself off the worst of it, i didn't need to, much. new years eve - probably smoked a whole packet. after that - nothing. 

i am really really pleased, and i really really hope i'll manage to stick to it this time.

I stopped smoking and started vaping. Is it fair when people ask me if I quit smoking to say yes?

I had my last smoke a couple days after new year's and have been vaping ever since. I get 12mg nic in my vape juice so I feel guilty when people ask me about if I'm still smoking or not I say no, but I don't mention vaping. Something I feel bad about is I told my boss that I stopped smoking and he said he would give me $50 if I still haven't had a smoke in 2 months, I never mentioned that I vape, and I don't vape whenever he is around. Now I just don't tell anyone I quit smoking because I hate the stigma of vaping

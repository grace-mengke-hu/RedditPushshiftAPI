I'm almost 3 months into quitting, and I'm now discussing openly with my 9 year old daughter the errors of my delusional smoking ways and what I was brought up to believe.

I've smoked heavily for 20 years since I was 16 years old.  I've smoked near 30 a day up until 3 months ago almost.  My eldest daughter of 9 years has pretty much grown up with me smoking.

I talk to my daughter about how she feels about me quitting and her response is happiness and pride.  She's 9 years old and she already knows that what I used to do was wrong! She tells me that she's happy I've stopped, that I stink less and that I spend, noticeably, a lot more time quality time with her and her younger sisters; playing, chatting, reading, exercising, just being present, etc.  And it's noticeable with me too;  I'm not preoccupying myself with smoking and having to leave the company of my kids and family to satisfy my drug addiction.

I'm 36 years old.  I grew up with smoking parents, smoking indoors and right in front of me.  My dad used to ask me to fetch him a pack of cigarettes from the other room while he'd talk to his friends.  I'd eagerly comply, rush and get them and in the meantime, all his friends would comment "how cute" while puffing away.  I'd look on at the grown ups that I inspired to be and thought "When I grow older, I'm going to do the same."  But when I did grow older, even unto the point I took my first puff, I knew it was bad.  This was when awareness campaigns started to rise and grow.  But it was already set in my mind that this was the cool, adult, mature thing to do.  Needless to say, without any awareness campaigns at the time, I was drawn to the mature appeal of smoking and it got me hooked. 

I'm only glad that in this day and age that the outlook on smoking is changed drastically and that our young are much more aware of the dangers and drawbacks of smoking.  My 9 year daughter is so happy with me quitting and I try grown up talks with her about cigarettes, nicotine and addiction.  I'm not going to prevent her from smoking.  But I'm just going to press on her as much as possible, the benefits of not smoking.

I'll just leave you off with a youtube video of [teenagers' reactions to smoking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZeiLwHKlds&feature=share)

It’s all in your head. You can’t crave something you hate

I have quit about a million times in the past few months. The first few times were awful! Then I realized I was doing it to myself!! If you’re gearing up for the worst experience of your life then that’s what quitting will be and it will never last if you are constantly wishing you had a cigarette. 
People have always told me “you will quit when you are ready” and I never understood, but if you truly don’t want to smoke anymore it will be a price of cake because you’re not “missing” anything, but gaining a whole new life instead!

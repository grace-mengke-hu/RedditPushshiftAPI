Bronchitis - but for only 7 days!

Every year as the weather turns cold I get a nasty cold that turns into full blown bronchitis. This usually lasts for about four weeks. This year I was hoping that since I wasn't smoking I wouldn't get sick. Well I did get sick because germs.  I was totally miserable for exactly one week! I feel fantastic now!  

Also, I couldn't even imagine inhaling smoke into my inflamed lungs - which historically is exactly what I did do! So the desire to smoke seems to have finally and fully gone.

TL;DR - Stopped smoking and stopped struggling with bronchitis. Realized I no longer crave smoking.

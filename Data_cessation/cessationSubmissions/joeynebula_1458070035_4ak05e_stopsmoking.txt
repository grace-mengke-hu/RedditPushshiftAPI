Been smoking on and off for 20 something years.

As the title says I have been smoking or vaping for the past 20 some odd years. I've tried to quite several times in the past and even made it a year once but I have never been able to to make it the long haul. I took up vaping a few years ago and that worked for quitting cigarettes but I'm trying to quit that now. With some of the resent studies showing the decreased immune function and danger of popcorn lung I have realized I was just lying to myself in thinking they were a safe alternative. Also I'm sick of nicotine running my life. I have to little girls now and the thought of getting sick because I had to have my stupid nicotine makes me feel like a selfish, garbage human being. I've never tried reaching out to a support group before and maybe thats the missing piece. I hope by posting here and hearing from some of you I can figure out how to make this time stick, for mine and my daughter's sake.

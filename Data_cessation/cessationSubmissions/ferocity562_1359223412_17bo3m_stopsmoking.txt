So early on in my quitting, I ended up picturing the "nicotine monster" as No-Face from Spirited Away....

And after just over two months, I am happy to say he has gone from [this]( http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120726173755/spiritedaway/images/7/7c/No-FaceLarge.png), to [this](  http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120724115626/spiritedaway/images/thumb/c/c8/No-Face.png/480px-No-Face.png)
     Still there, but quiet and mostly in the background. And I look forward to the day when he ends up more like [this]( http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110312142045/spiritedaway/images/5/53/Susuwatari.png)
 (Which I know steps outside of the actual Spirited Away canon, but it is my visualization and I get to think what I want.) I know I am well on my way!  

Edit because I suck at formatting

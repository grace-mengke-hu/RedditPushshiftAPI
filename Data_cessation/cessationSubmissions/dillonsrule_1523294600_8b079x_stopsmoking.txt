Nine Months Quit today.

I quit nine months ago after years of trying and failing to quit.  I had read Allan Carr's book, and had previously quit and backslid into regular smoking again about 2 years back.  

Today, I very rarely get the urge to smoke anymore, and it is very manageable.  Plus, I know the risks of "just having one for old time's sake".  I feel confident that I will stay smoke free for another 9 months and more.  For those just starting out, know that it is doable.  This is a great community for finding encouragement and people that want to help.  Just keep at it!

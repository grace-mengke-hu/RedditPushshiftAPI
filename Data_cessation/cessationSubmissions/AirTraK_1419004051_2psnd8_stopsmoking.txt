quiting smoking, again, but this time I fixed the chink in my armor!

I failed miserably the first time after such a good 2 weeks straight.  Went back to smoking, doesnt help that i work for a casino as well, the habits repeating itself.  Clocking in, smoke, go to work, take a break, light up, go to lunch, finish your meal...spark another cigs.

But despite all that, i was able to quit, until 1 night of heavy drinking, go really drunk and a smoke sounded so good, spark it up and went back at it for months now.

This time im smarter and ready, i realize to really quit smoking you have to quit ALL YOUR VICES AT THE SAME TIME.  No smoking, no drinking, no taking breaks in the smoke room, no hanging out after work with co-workers who smoke.

It will be hard, the sacrafices, but it will be worth it in the long run.

WISH ME LUCK!

Quitting smoking & bad skin? Questions....

Hi guys. Ignore the badge, that was a previous attempt hehe. I'm currently on day 14 of quiting cold turkey (been smoking for years, and quite a lot daily)

Since I've quit my skin have gotten terrible, reddness almost all over, spots everywhere, just general acne looking soreness especially around my nose and mouth.

Has anyone else experienced an outbreak like this when they quit? How long did it last? I was under the impression skin would be better after quitting. If this happened to you, is your skin now better off after the outbreak has subsided?

Read a few posts of people having outbreaks, but I'm more curious on how long this will last and if my skin will be nicer after all of this. 

Anyways, I think I'll leave some benefits I've experienced, just to keep people motivated in case they feel like giving in

I can breathe SO much better, deeper, clearer.

My voice is clearer, smoother and isn't lazy sounding.

Hangovers are nicer.

LOTS more energy - mentally and physically.

(Really didn't think quitting would do so much for my mental state but I feel great after just two weeks)

Stay strong folks!

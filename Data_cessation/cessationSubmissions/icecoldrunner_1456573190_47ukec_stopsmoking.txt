I quit smoking 20 minutes ago. It's time.

It's the laziest, stupidest, most casually toxic habit in the world, and I know I'm going to miss the hell out of it, but it's really simple: I'm going to be a non-smoker either on my own or someday down the road when I get horrific news from a doctor. I prefer the former.

Wish me luck. This is going to suck hard for a bit. Have the gum, so we'll see if I need it. Thanks for the motivation guys, been lurking here for almost a year.

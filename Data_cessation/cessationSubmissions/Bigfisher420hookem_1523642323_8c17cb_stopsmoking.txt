Recurring dreams

After nearly 10 years of off and on nicotine use. I’m quitting again after a 6 month binge after being nicotine free for 3 years. 

I’ve started having these reoccurring dreams where I’m at a liquor store purchasing tobacco (smokes or dip). I’ve been waking up with a feeling of remorse. 

Has anyone else experienced intense dreams while quitting?

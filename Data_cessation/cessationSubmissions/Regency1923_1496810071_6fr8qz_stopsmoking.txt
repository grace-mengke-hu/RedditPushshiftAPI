Day 2 and it's already rough :(

So I finally made it, the first 24 hours done!.......God is this rough though!  My husband smokes so in the car while I was driving, as if we know that's bad enough. HE WAS SMOKING, he smoked two cigs and when he got out of the car for work and I started back home all I could think about was THANK GOD!.........Coming home, the same and it felt like the worst struggle I ever had. 

The only thing that kept me from doing it was the serenity prayer over and over. I swear I said that thing 20 times!  Oh and music too.  I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooo glad to be home, smoking has never been allowed in the house.

God was that hard!

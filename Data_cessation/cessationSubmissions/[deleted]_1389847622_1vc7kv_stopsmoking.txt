How long does the depression and mood swings last?

Around this Thanksgiving I decided to stop smoking. I have had some hiccups when drinking but am overall not really having too bad a time with cravings. I usually love the holiday season but this year I have been feeling more depressed and hopeless than I have in a long time. I got accepted into a post grad program and things are looking up for me but I have lost a lot of interest recently in things I usually love and haven't been spending as much time with friends which always used to pick me up. Only until I looked at this subreddit did I put two and two together. I have felt a little sick since I stopped smoking so much and it has been a week since my last hiccup and I wake up in the morning feeling good then feel like shit by the evening. I also wake up hours before my alarm for work. Is this normal and how long can I expect this to this last?

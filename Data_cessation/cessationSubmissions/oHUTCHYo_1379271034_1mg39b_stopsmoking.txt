48 Hours Of Hell... (13 days in)

Ive had a terrible 48 hours this weekend, the feeling of novelty and win have all but gone now and Ive done nothing but think of smoking. I mean literally every 5minutes over this weekend. 

Clearly this isn't physical craving, but mental. Is this normal and will pass or a permanent fixture and a sign I'm not committed enough to quitting and am reassuring myself to go buy some?

I hate these things

After an awesome streak of more than 100 days, I relapsed.

Stress and anxiety were the triggers. What happened? I bought a pack, smoked for a couple of days and in the end, I feel more stressed and anxious than previously.

Did cigarrettes ever do anything for me? No. I have a bad taste in my mouth, I started having trouble sleeping and I feel like I'm losing lung capacity all over again.

I have to create coping strategies, I need to exercise regularly and I need to put things into perspective when these pangs show up (which were not frequent at all). Screw these sticks, I wonder why I thought smoking was a good idea in the first place.

I learned something with this process though. If in the first time I thought I may have something to loose, right now I am sure that life without smoking is better in every sense of the word.

I am done smoking, I need to erase this addiction and let this be a message to everyone who is starting: these last months were awesome and I let a insignificant event delay my progress. But I am back on track.

Attended a wedding on Saturday. In the evening after the party kicked off, everyone was bumming smokes. But not me.

The wedding party consisted of quite a number of colleagues whom I respect and admire for their individual talents and work ethic, so it was strangely gratifying to slowly realize as the night went on that I was the only one who wasn't debasing himself for a quick nic fix. I didn't even know that some of my friends smoked, yet there they were, bumming cigs from the couple of people who brought their own. I don't think I've ever felt as good that night as I did when someone asked me for a cigarette and I said flat out: "I don't smoke."

If you're stuck on that train like I was for ten years, you can change. All it takes is to realize that you're better than that. Maybe that sounds self-aggrandizing, but maybe that's what it takes. I just felt the need to share this in case it helps anyone in any way.

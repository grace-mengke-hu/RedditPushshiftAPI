5th Day of not smoking

Hi All
i have been following this group for a long time. I have been struggling to quit smoking (second time now, i did quit last time and started again after 2.5 years) and this is the longest i have come in recent attempts. Its been 4 days 15hrs 15 min since i last smoked. I use to smoke a pack a day. 
Smoke Free app says 100% nicotine is out of my body but i dont know why i still have these intense cravings. I have had severe mood swings since morning and am awfully close to smoking one.

Maybe posting here will help!!

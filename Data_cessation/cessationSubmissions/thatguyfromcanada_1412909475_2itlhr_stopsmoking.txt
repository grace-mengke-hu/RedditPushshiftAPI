Just starting day three. Just a little venting.

Shit. This is the most intense craving for anything I've ever had. I'm a recovering addict/alcoholic and I've never felt so strong of an urge to have something I know will hurt/kill me. I've held off on dropping smoking until I had everything else sussed out half-way coherently, but damn, I thought I was prepared. Turns out I wasn't totally. Tonight, I'm eating Milk Duds, drinking Coke and playing Drive Club.

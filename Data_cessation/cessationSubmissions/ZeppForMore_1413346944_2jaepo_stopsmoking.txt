:) Hoping tomorrow is a clean day

For the past week I've been convincing myself, every time i go to bed tomorrow morning will be a clean day. Yet the smell and taste off coffee in the morning isn't quite perfect without tobacco. one smoke and that's it...three cigarette butts lay crumpled in my ashtray as i carry on with the rest of the day. That was one hell of a subway sandwich, what would make it better is a nice smoke to seal the deal. I stomp my 5th cigarette as i head to class... Im hoping that tomorrow morning will actually for once be a clean morning. Im getting disgusted by the smell and taste yet i love it.
Sorry for the long post...felt good to share it :)

6 months today!!

I can't believe I have made it this far and had such a great experience.  About 7 months ago, I had made the decision to quit and was dreading my quit date approaching.  Then I read The Easy Way to Quit and suddenly I couldn't wait for the day to come.  I have had a couple of difficult moments along the way but this experience has been so different from other times I've attempted and failed in the past.  

I am so thankful to this community for the support and the recommendations for how to prep (which included reading The Easy Way).  I am thankful for my family and friends who supported me and held me accountable.  I'm loving life as a non-smoker.

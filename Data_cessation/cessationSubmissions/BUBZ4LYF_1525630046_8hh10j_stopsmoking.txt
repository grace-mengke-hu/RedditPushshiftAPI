Nicotine gum long term?

Im 17 now i started smoking at 12, 10 a day for about 4 years up till the age of 16 when i switched to vaping, during the time i vaped i began to feel healthier but was vaping about 240mg of nicotine a week. So about a month ago i realised how much nicotine i was vaping and threw my vape pen in a outdoor bin and starting using gum. For the past month ive been using about 20mg of nicotine gum a day is this going to be bad for me in the long run?

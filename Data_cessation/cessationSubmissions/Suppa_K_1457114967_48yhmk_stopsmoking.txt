The last cigarette from a pack I bought over a month ago

First time here. My last day of full on smoking was the 9th of last month. Since then I've been whittling away at a pack I bought before that date. 

Since then I've gone from a 7-10 cigarette a day smoker to 0-1, maybe 2-3 on my worst days which have been a few and involved drinking which I don't feel bad about. 

The fact that I could get by smoking one or two a day just astonishes me, and even more so when I go days without. 

It's hard, driving is hard and cravings get bad. I've had this pack to lean on, it's helped me resist, and cave in. It offers a weird comfort knowing when ever I need or want I can just go back. 

Well I'm nearing the end and I think this will truly be a test, I won't have that pack much longer to fall on. Buying another would feel like a major defeat. 

I'm taking it one day at a time and for once in my life I can imagine quitting, for ever. I just how it gets easier and the cravings die down. Thank you for a place I can put my feelings into words. I always heard that after 3 days you woulda want to smoke anymore, but that's painfully untrue and I feel like it will be with me for life. I take solace in knowing though I can live my life not being a daily smoker but even as I write this my thoughts start to twist and turn. I just want it to get easier but I'm already so proud, even if I go back in full force which I doubt I at least know I can do this. 

Thanks for listening.

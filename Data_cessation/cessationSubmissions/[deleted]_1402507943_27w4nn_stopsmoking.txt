6 Months

Today I sneezed twice. I felt weirded out, I hadn't sneezed in months, that's when I realized I've not gotten sick this year, nor I've had allergies. 


I used to get really bad allergies at least once a month, and May was flu/cold month by default, and that would transform into a struggle with a runny nose and cough during June and July. This cycle would repeat during October. It was *normal*. It had been for the past few years, even when I'm still in my 20s, fairly active and I didn't have a story of respiratory problems during my childhood. 


You see, I had smoked for almost a decade and that's more than enough time to get used to the tight chest, short breath, coughing fits during sleep, permanent stuffed nose, terrible blood circulation in hands and feet... It doesn't happen all at once, it's progressive, it's sneaky; and the human body has an incredible capacity to adapt. 


1 year ago I would have never thought possible to feel better than I did, to be able to quit and to live without all those physical annoyances that were bound to become bigger health issues. 


This is why I'm sharing this, a lot of current smokers are on the same spot I was 1 year ago. You probably still think that quitting is just too much work and you're too weak, or that you prefer suffering through the health problems than *missing out* the pleasure of smoking. I can assure you that I was the one missing out when I smoked. Nothing compares to feeling healthier and recovering the control that all addicts have lost - not the short high in the mornings, not the constant dopamine release, nothing. 


Happy 6 months smoke-free to me! Woohoo! ;D

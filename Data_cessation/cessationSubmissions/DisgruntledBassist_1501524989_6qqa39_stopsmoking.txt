Lost count of days. Not very long. Just a final note on love.

I....was? A pack a day smoker for about the last 8 years. Been smoking since I was about fourteen or fifteen. I had my twenty third birthday a little while ago. Y'know what Marlboro got me for my birthday? Another lung infection. That's been chronic bronchitis since about age seventeen. Finally I got my wits about me and mustered the courage to say no more. I hate having to take penicillin every time the damned seasons change. I'm too young to not be able to climb fucking stairs. Slowly I cut back over the course of a few days and then just stopped. It felt really good to have something to rail against; an enemy, something to beat. As a Satanist the commandment is, indulgence NOT compulsion. But now I miss smoking. I really miss smoking. To me, it wasn't anything really about stress or whatever...It was hedonism. Smoking was the ultimate hedonistic pleasure. It was the perfect product. So profoundly beautiful was the idea that, when used as directed, this product will kill me, AND offer me nothing back in return but for twenty small moments of selfishly rewarding pleasure. I miss the taste. The smell. The texture. The note it left on a jacket or in a cloth seat. But I know I can't have it back. My physical addiction is long gone by this point, but the warm reminiscences of my brown leafy lady remain. After two weeks free of nicotine, I still miss smoking. Thank you.

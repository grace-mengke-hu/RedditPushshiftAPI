got very drunk last night - still didn't smoke!

I've been lurking here for a while, but I'm feeling a bit of pride about last night so I thought I'd post about how awesome I am.  I am quitting in china, where I think the reaction to quitting is more like "why would you do that?", and where you can smoke pretty much everywhere.  Anyway, went out last night with smokers, at bars/clubs where you can smoke.  I made some questionable decisions, but somehow managed not to even take a puff (though there were some tough moments).  Still some trying times ahead, but I feel pretty good about this quit!

First day today, with me luck fellas

Wanted to quick for more than a year now, best I did was twice holding out for one week, first time I had dreams about smoking and missed it a lot so I crumbled. Second time I felt amazing and new, but went to the birthday party where I got tipsy and went back at it. I have throat problems and am afraid if I dont stop I might die. I am happy I found this subreddit which is full of inspirational people.

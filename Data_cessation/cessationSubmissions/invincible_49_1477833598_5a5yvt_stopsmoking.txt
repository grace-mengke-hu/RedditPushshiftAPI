99 days nicotine free!

Official quit date was 17th July but for some reason bummed a ciggie on the 23rd night. I remember thinking when I woke up the next day that that particular cigarette did not do anything positive for me. Since then I've had almost no cravings and have gone completely nicotine free for 99 days. I've had friends blowing smoke right on my face, been to the most crowded bars and an awesome trip to Thailand without having to even think of lighting up.

I chose to read Allen Carr's book, it really really helped and I highly recommend it if you absolutely want to quit. I'm so excited for day 100! After almost 10 years of smoking, I really needed this victory right now. For once I actually feel proud of something I've achieved. Good luck to all you quitters. It just gets easier and easier :)

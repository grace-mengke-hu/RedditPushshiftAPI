So, it's been 276 days, and I have mild cravings

So yeah, 276 days or so Google tells me ("days since may 27"). It sounds like a rather long time! I have even uninstalled the app, because I thought I no longer needed it.

But lately I have these cravings when I'm annoyed with people and when I'm bored. It's not much of a craving, just a feeling of "OH GOD, it'd feel nice to light a cigarette now!". I can even kinda feel that pleasurable sensation. Sometimes even that dreaded thought crosses my mind ("one cannot hurt").

And sometimes I feel it's just not worth it: yeah, I'm a lot better at sports (took up running,  woo) and I don't stink, but there are also the downsides: I gain weight slowly but surely (~4kg over this 3/4 year), I have a newfound difficulty expressing my thoughts, I have this problem that I sit at work until my butt hurts, forgetting to stand up. I have pimples too, and my skin is still kinda greasy. Even my English is getting worse! Seriously, this difficulty of expressing myself, this is the worst, a totally unexpected side effect. I'm  just worse at communicating, somehow.

Then again, I know all the stock answers, and I know it will pass. I still have my lists of reasons to quit here in the phone: having reviewed them now, some of them kinda hit close to home ("I don't want this funny feeling in my throat", I forgot that feeling).

On another note, I was reading an article about opiate addiction, and I could relate so much. Though I know that's a much harder battle.

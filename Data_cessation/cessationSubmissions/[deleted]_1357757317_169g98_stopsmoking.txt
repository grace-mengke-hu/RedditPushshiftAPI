Just putting myself out here -- affirmations/other helpful thoughts.

Hi everyone - pretty proud to be a first-timer showing my badge. However, I am no first-timer to the smoking --> quitting process. I've tried SO many times. 

Even now I look back in angst and wonder if I really did have my last one...

But, I associate the above with a "craving" though. I really try and power through a few minutes afterward to get past that.

This time seems different in the fact that I have made myself literally SO sick over smoking. I've smoked for 8 years, am 26f, and I am now a nonsmoker.

Affirmations, in regards to self-esteem/life-betterment/etc., are my go-to savior right now. They've helped in every other area of my life, so my current affirmation is "I am a nonsmoker." I've seen that others have the same thing going as well.

If any of you have additional suggestions as far as how to pass the time with the sudden cravings, let me know! 

Just wanted to show my badge off... :)

If you are feeling depressed right now: it will get so much better

Hi everyone,

Just wanted to jump in and let everyone who is depressed right now know, that it will get so much better. 

3 weeks ago I wrote a really depressed comment, didn't think I could feel this Bad before. I hadn't had a smoke for 4 weeks then. 

I Made it and it really is so much better now. I feel least anxiety than when I was still Smoking. So hang in there Guys!!!

4 Days Cold Turkey No Nicotine, Almost 5 Now

im on 4 days cold turkey no nicotine right now (I also quit drinking the same day) cravings have been awful tonight, drove to a gas station but bought a gatorade/chips instead.

the cravings have been intense different times throughout days 2-3-4 (1 was easy). I am exercising/yoga/heavy breathing throughout the day and it's still tough. 

I will say I think switching to Swedish Snus the last month (before quitting) instead of smoking probably helped a little since it has less nicotine. 

Did it for 4.5 years. Am 24 right now. I'll be on here, any tips would be great. Hopefully this shit gets better

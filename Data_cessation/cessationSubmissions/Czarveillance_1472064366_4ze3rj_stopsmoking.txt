Non-Nicotene Quitting Aids?

I'm on a prescription of Wellbutrin right now and using suckers to give my fingers something to do when I have a craving.  I have some gum for the toughest cravings but I feel like adding the nicotene to my system even just through the gum is a step backwards.  Does anyone have any experiences (good or bad) with Wellbutrin and/or any advice on non-nicotene smoking cessation aids?

2 left in the pack. I can't do this anymore.

I'm a stress smoker. I quit weed and that was easy. Tobacco is a different creature.

The last 3 packs I bought were from inappropriately handling relationship stress. After I acquire the pack I have no willpower. I even want one of my last two right now as I'm writing this.

In the past I have been athletic with strong willpower and high self esteem. Smoking has diminished all of these traits.

I want to handle my stress better, remain athletic and have high willpower and self esteem again. I'm worried about the cravings and mood swings. Maybe I should make a doctors appointment to get patches.

As a friend, what can i get someone who is quitting for a 1 month smoke free!

One of my oldest friends decided to quit smoking for a new-years resolution.  Shes gone cold turkey after 4 years of heavy smoking.  I am unbelievably proud of her.  Soon she will have gone 1 month and i really would like to gift her something to show her how proud i am and maybe encouragement to keep going!

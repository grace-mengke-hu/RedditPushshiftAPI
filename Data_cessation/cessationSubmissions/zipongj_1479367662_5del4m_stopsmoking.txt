Almost 12 hours in. Will this get easier or harder?

I stopped smoking at around noon today. It's midnight now, and I feel like shit. Anxiety, headache, cravings. If it weren't for the fact that I threw out all my smokes and don't have any money, I would of smoked by now. 

I can barely fucking think. It took me three minutes to figure out how to spell physical.

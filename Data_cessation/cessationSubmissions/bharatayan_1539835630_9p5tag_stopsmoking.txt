accidentally quit smoking because of illness. 5th day today.

so got an allergy type nose and throat infection.  and even though i went to work during these days propped up on antibiotics, i was in too much discomfort to even remember to smoke.

from what i read it seems the nicotine addiction has already cleared. i just need to know what else i have to do to lock down this state of becoming a non-smoker again.

3 days since my last cigarette, 15 days on Chantix, and an office full of idiots later...

I still have not smoked a cigarette.

I feel like I want to feel that harsh drop kick of smoke in my lungs right now but I know it won't do anything to help or make me feel better for more than a few minutes.


I'm pretty sure that 90% of the people I interacted with today woke up, thought to themselves "My, my! This bottle of glue sure as heck looks inviting! It would sure be swell if a portion ended up on this handkerchief and the fumes somehow ended up damaging my brain during inhalation!" 

People are goddamned retards.  

Smoking doesn't change that.

The same window lickers would have been there if I smoked or didn't smoke.  

I have $15 (so far) this week I wouldn't have had if I were smoking and I can smell smells which is pretty cool.  

I really want to smoke right now but am trying to shift my perception of the idiots from annoyance to entertainment.  I'll probably go to bed soon but, seriously, people should stop huffing glue.

Yet again, at day 0. Welp.

I started smoking about 8 years ago, have "quit" a few times, anywhere from a year to a day. I've finally reached a point where I know I need to quit. From effects on my psyche to skin to nasty hangovers, all of it. I'm tired of telling my friends/family I'm quitting because I always seem to fail and I don't want to burden them anymore. Let this be day 0 of a new life. Thanks team.

edit: Whoa, so nice to wake up in the morning and see all of these very thoughtful comments and encouragement. Means a lot. Cheers!

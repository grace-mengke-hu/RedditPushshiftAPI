Day 2 and I'm already upsetting my sister in law

I didn't realise it but all day I've been contrary and snide with my brother and sister, just now I made a comment about how I was looking forward to a quiet day at my own house, because their two year old is not conducive to a calm cigarette free environment, the words loud, and obnoxious were used. Sister snapped and Brother had to explain to me how unpleasant I've been today. My nerves are fried and now I feel terrible.

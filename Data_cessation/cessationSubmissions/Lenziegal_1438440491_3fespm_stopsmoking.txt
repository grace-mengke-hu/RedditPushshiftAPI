Day 14

I've been doing not bad up until today. Been using nicotine patches and going through a ton of chewing gum. I've been smoking since I was 17, 33 years!!! and probably smoked about 22 cigs a day although my husband thinks it was a lot less. Have managed to stay off them twice in my life before and that was when I was pregnant but that was nearly 18 years ago. Anyway as I was saying was doing great up until today and the cravings are a flaming nightmare but I'm determined not to give in to them. Wish me luck.

Withdrawal symptoms *before* I quit smoking :D

I quit smoking many times in the past before I succeeded. I just remembered that on some half-hearted quit attempts I would start experiencing withdrawal symptoms -- irritability, head buzz, cravings -- before the quit started. They would come just by thinking about quitting. I say this just to point out that cravings are mostly a mind game. If you delight in your freedom the withdrawal symptoms will be much less or nonexistent. Best wishes.

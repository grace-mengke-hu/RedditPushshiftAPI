Getting rid of the last few triggers?

I quit smoking two weeks ago after six years. The first week I was craving for a cigarette constantly and it took a lot of effort to stop myself from buying a pack. Then came the weekend. I was drinking some beers on the balcony with a friend who's a smoker and before I knew it I found myself smoking one of his cigarettes. Later on we went to a pub and I bummed a few more from some random people I met there.

For some reason the urge to smoke completely vanished in the days that followed. In the past week I've only experienced cigarette cravings once or twice, nowhere near as strong as in my first week. I'm starting to think that now the nicotine addiction is gone (?), I more or less only miss the socializing aspect about smoking: outside the pub talking to strangers, on the balcony with a friend, sometimes alone to get some peace of mind. 

Regardless, the thought of 'having an occassional social cigarette is not a big deal' is keeping me from smoking, while last week's thought of 'I'm never smoking a cigarette again' caused severe cravings and stress. Right now I feel like I could smoke a cigarette tonight if I'm going out even though I don't necessarily feel like smoking right now. But I understand fully well it's a slippery slope, so I'm asking if anyone had a similar experience and what did you do to stop thinking that an occasional cigarette is no problem?

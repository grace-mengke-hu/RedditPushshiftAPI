Day 36 - cravings are so bad, don't know why...

I don't get it, I quit on 1/23/15 and it was easy - well, I was sick so no need to smoke.  Then, all of a sudden - I have had super bad cravings the last 2 days.  I even went as far as FAKE SMOKING in the car just to see what it would do...

Why all of a sudden?  Nothing changed...

3 years, blindside craving. Posting this instead of walking up and "bumming" one from the guy smoking my former brand.

Waiting for dude to get his food so I can grab mine and get down the road. 

This is a long battle and i'm keeping off, for life, even if it means making Reddit posts to distract myself. 

Man, it's been a long time since smoke smelled good, but for some reason that was like willpower penetrating ammo. 

Deep breath (Couldn't do that when I was a smoker). I'm good. Thanks for being here.

I want to stop smoking. When is the best time?

So ive got about 15 cigarettes left in this pack. I don't wanna throw them out. Or should I? 
Im just done with this shit...it costs way too much money.. I'm almost 30 so the smoking is starting to do some real damage to my skin. 
I just want to be healthy and happy. 
Most of the time I smoke and I don't even realize I do it anymore.. 
It's useless money burning. 
I do also smoke weed.. And I don't want to stop doing that (it helps with my adhd).  You guys think I will still be able to quit? Is it even worth it if I keep smoking joints with tobacco in them? 
Should I quit everything? 
And when?? 
Should I build it off, and let's say.. Start smoking outside only and a max of 5 cigarettes a day? Or do you propose cold turkey as the best method?
This is really one of those things in life that I wish someone else could do for me...

Had my last cigarette at midnight last night.

I watched Allen Carr's video and it convinced me completely. I broke my almost full pack in half and threw them in the trash. I was given the thought to quit when a coworker of mine told me I smelled horrible when I came back in from my smoke break. My self esteem is bad enough, and cigarettes don't help. Today hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be, but it's still hard for me to resist since I have family members who smoke and there's a carton just sitting in the kitchen that I could easily take from. I hope I can get through tomorrow and the rest of my life without caving. Just wanted to vent. I'm sick of cigarettes killing me and controlling my life, not to mention making me unattractive and smelly. Fuck cigarettes, I quit.

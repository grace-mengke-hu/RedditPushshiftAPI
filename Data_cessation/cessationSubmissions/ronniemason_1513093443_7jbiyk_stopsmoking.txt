Don't Be So Quick to Dismiss NRT

I posted here about a month ago, and wanted to give a quick update and also a word of encouragement. This is my fifth (significant) quit attempt, and so far it is going better than any prior to it. I'd tried many things before: Chantix (twice, which was definitely a mistake the second time), cold-turkey without NRT, cold-turkey after reading Allen Carr's book, and then this time - nicotine patches and Wellbutrin.

To say that it has been easy to get to day 35 would be an absolute lie. I had a couple "cravings," or rather, hour-long mood swings that forced me to miss out on a couple great times with friends.

However, I recently went to see my first movie in a theater as a non-smoker. That was a great new experience, not having to think about a smoke halfway through. I'm about to take my first plane ride as a non-smoker, and I'm thrilled at the thought of not having to plan the flight around cigarettes. I am getting to enjoy so much more in life now that I'm not relying on those little buggers.

I just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone else is struggling, reading along and feels as though they shouldn't post here because they're relying on NRT to do so. It truly is about what works for you and what helps you quit for life.

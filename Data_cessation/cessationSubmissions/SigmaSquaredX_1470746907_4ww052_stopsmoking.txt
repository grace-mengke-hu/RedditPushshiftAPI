140 days, cravings and a lack of structure.

The quit ride has been relatively easy for me up untill now. I smoked for 6 years before quitting, and i've been pretty happy about it till now.

I have exams, i'm studying hard and i so miss those smoke breaks. Those moments where i can relax after a hard statistics problem or a frustrating theory. It used to be so so rewarding to just lean out my window, light a cig and enjoy peace and quiet for five minutes before rushing back in.

I feel like i have nothing like this anymore. Instead of neatly ordered hour and a half intervals, clearly divided by five minute smoke breaks, i feel like every day is just a long struggle, without a clear structure. 

I hate it and i don't know what to do about it.

Any good tips would be a godsend!

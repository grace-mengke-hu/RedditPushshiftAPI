Today I cried

It was like having a bad dispute with myself. I wanted to smoke so badly!!! But than there was this voice, telling me "Are you f****** crazy? You know what it does to you? Why should you do this s***?" and stuff like that. The voice did not sound nice, just to say that, but for me it was the right way to talk to myself... I think I get a little nuts. How are you guys feeling today?

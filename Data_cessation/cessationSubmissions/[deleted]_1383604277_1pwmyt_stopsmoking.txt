13 Years

I have wasted 13 years of my life on smoking.  I'm not yet 30. I'm so tired of it. With all the time, money and precious youthfulness and health I wasted and am never getting back I could have lived a life of purposefulness and adventure instead of becoming the slave of addiction looking upon the past with envy.  I am truly finished with this foolish mindset. I'm done using smoking as a crutch. I want to really live and feel every excruciating moment of this short, wondrous life instead of running for a smoke in order to keep my world in balance.  I was born on a Tuesday.  Tomorrow is Tuesday.  Tomorrow I will be born again.

Need Some Help And Advice...Please.

I'm going strong on my 10th day without smoking. Cravings haven't been too bad, and I have been way out of my normal routine. I'm a little worried about going back to work tomorrow, I've been off for 5 days out camping with Boy Scouts and Family. I'm not too worried about that though. I have had a couple of really intense cravings, like last between 90 and 120 minutes. It seems like no matter what I do, they just won't fucking stop. I'm sure I've heard it all but If anyone else had experience with this I'd love to hear about it. I'm super anti-social especially when It comes to my shortcomings so I have a really hard time reaching out. But anyways I really want to beat this beast and those long cravings were always my downfall in the past. 

Thanks! I really appreciate this community and Love the support you deal out to each other. Maybe with some time I'll be able to lend out a hand too once I have some time under my belt.

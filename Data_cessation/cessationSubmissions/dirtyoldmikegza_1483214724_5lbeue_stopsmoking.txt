Just survived my first argument with my wife without blowing up or smoking!

Im on day 12 using wellbutrin and patches. ive smoked for 25-30 years (depending on how you count it) and arguments and anger control where a big fear of mine so its huge to me that i made it.

it was a stupid argument about housework (which i'd done but wasnt getting credit for, she's nasty before coffee in the morning) so instead of acting out and losing my big-Irish-temper, i went for a walk through a nature reservation around my house. came home and she apologized. and i havent has a cigarette over it!....

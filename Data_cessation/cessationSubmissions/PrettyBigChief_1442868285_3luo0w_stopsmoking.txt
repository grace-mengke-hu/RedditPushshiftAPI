Water

Well, as can be seen from my badge, I quit over two years ago. Going strong. I quit via Allen Carr, with the "give up nothing, gain only freedom" mentality. I drink a lot of coffee and soda.

Regardless, the point is I didn't change anything when I quit. I recently listened to some self-help stuff and one of the obvious tips was *drink plenty of water,* which for some reason I never really was a fan of.

The advice given was "half your body weight in ounces per day" .. damn, I thought, that's a lot. Well, I'd be doing well to meet half that given my average intake of plain water before was zero ounces per day. So I got on it; for each coffee or soda, I also drink a decent-sized glass of water along with it.

I am on day three and haven't felt as much of a difference in my health as when I actually quit smoking. It's *remarkable*. When I quit, I got lots of the benefits (some energy, better senses, sex, skin, hair, less stench etc etc) but I had heard people report surges in energy I didn't think I was getting. Now I think it was because plain water wasn't really part of my diet.

So, my quitting friends, I cannot recommend to you enough to drink as much plain water a day as you can while you're quitting. The idea is to give your body enough water to flush out all the toxicity, and I think for that energy boost I've heard about you need to be well hydrated.

Good luck everyone, and remember:

1. You are not alone

2. You can do this

3. If I did it, you can too

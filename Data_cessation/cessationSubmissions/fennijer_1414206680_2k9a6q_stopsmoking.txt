This is not a pretty story.

I think I had my "Eureka" moment tonight. I was going nuts earlier tonight. For many reasons i thought i needed a smoke. Texted husband. He's trying to quit with me. Told him to buy smokes. Of course he does.

For the first time in all of my years of being a smoker trying to quit i actually physically fought the urge to have one!!!

I opened the pack!!! Annnnnnnd walked away!
Grabbed a lighter!! Annnnnnnd walked away again!

I have NEVER DONE THIS!!!
I always cave. A-L-W-A-Y-S!!!

I stood there, shaking, crying and almost falling to my knees, having the fucking fight of my life with these God damned, horrible, life sucking....Monsters!!!!

I then begged my husband to destroy them! As I wept, i saw how hard it was for him to do it. I felt the hold they had on him too. It felt like forever before he crumpled and broke every last one.

And then he held me. And i cried........... For a very long time.

But something feels... Different this time. I think I won. 
For today at least.

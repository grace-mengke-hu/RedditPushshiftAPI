DAE Dream of smoking?

I quit about 2 months ago (maybe longer). I started by switching to an e-cig then phased that out. I havent had any nicotene in my system for at least a month. 

Recently I have been having dreams about smoking. I had them when I first quit then it seems like they went away and came back. 

It doesnt really bother me except that I have a strong urge to smoke when I wake up from these dreams.

Did anyone else have this problem? Did they go away for good at some point?

Heavy Addict joins your team!

I've been lurking in this subreddit trying to prep myself for a while. It helps reading comments from the older & heavier smokers who have habits that span long periods of time. Yesterday was my first full non-smoking day. I've been smoking since I was a kid. I've tried unsuccessfully in past using different attempts like, Allan Carr's book, cold turkey, the flu, patches & Chantix. I felt strongest with Chantix & got close, but caved during stressful times with my ex.

Anyway, I don't feel nicotine addiction is *my* greatest hurdle here. For me it's that actual smoke. That cigarette. I grew up with the tangible stick in my hand, the cloud of smoke in my face. I'm a french inhaler, too, so I've learned to eek out 2 times the pleasure. I have a heavy psychological addiction to kick, too. In past, the nicotine leaving my body hasn't been the worst part of it, it has always been about dropping that actual cigarette. Living under that cloud of smoke.

Here's my plan forward:

- I am on day 9 of Chantix, this is my second day with no cigarettes.
Continue Chantix until pills run out. Logically, due to Chantix, I know that my brain can't even feel the nicotine reward, so it's just the actual cig & smoke that I want in my face. 

- I live a very social life, lots of nights out with drinks & smokers. I can't avoid them. I will make sure to *always* have an e-cig on me. I need all the help I can get. If I want a smoke, I will drag on that.

- I ordered new perfume & a tooth whitening kit for extra incentive. Downloaded a quit smoking app called, "Cessation Nation," and it has distracting games to keep my fingers & mind off a crave. I am taking myself clothes shopping with the first 2 weeks of saved funds, and then from there I will direct at least $5 per day into my savings account & leave it untouched. I will pick up my workout schedule & try to drink more water.

I need to say goodbye to cigarettes forever. Cigarettes cost $12.00 - $12.50 a pack here! I smoke a pack a day. I reek of smoke. My breathing is weak when I climb 3 flights of stairs. I don't want to die of cancer & I don't want to pull around a breathing tank for emphysema in future. From now on I want to be a NON- SMOKER. Wish me luck, I'll need it & am happy to be here with you all!

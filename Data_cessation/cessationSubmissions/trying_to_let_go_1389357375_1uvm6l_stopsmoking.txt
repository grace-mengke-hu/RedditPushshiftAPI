Day 2: There is so much time now

I've quit a few times before but I always forget how much time gets freed up by not smoking. See smoking isn't just the 5-10 minutes spent on a cigarette. 

It's also the 10-20 minutes prepping that coffee to go with it.

Or the 10-20 minutes of waiting for a colleague to go for a smoke break.

Or the 10-15 minutes of driving around to buy smokes.

Or the 30-40 minutes spent failing to find that last fucking lighter in my apartment and googling how to light a cigarette from a glass top stove.

Or needing to plan ahead cos I'm down to that last smoke and the stores will be closed in a bit.

Or needing to smoke 10-15 minutes early because I'm going to pick up friends who hate the smell of smoke in the car and I need to air it out.


Its only when I quit do I realize that smoking takes up so much time and headspace on a daily basis.

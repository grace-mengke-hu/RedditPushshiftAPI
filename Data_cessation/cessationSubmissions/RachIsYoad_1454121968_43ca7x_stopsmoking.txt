24 days weird breathing sensation please help

Hey guys I am on 24 days smoke free (will be 25 in a few hours - yay!) and I've been doing pretty well overall. However today I've had this strange tightness in my chest. It's almost like I am not getting a full breath. I'm obviously breathing and when I try really hard it seems the breath does come - it almost feels like how my chest feels after a good hard cry, if anyone knows that sensation. I haven't had a good cry today though, everything's been good and the day started off normally. I thought it might be a panic attack but I feel chill besides this crappy feeling. So I started wondering if it might have something to do with having quit smoking nearly a month ago and figured I'd ask if any of you have experienced anything similar or if I'm going mad. 

TL;DR feeling like I can't get a full breath - anyone experience this due to quitting?

20 year smoker - 2 month quitter. Exercise and breathing is a lot easier, but still have smoker laugh and cough.

Breathing improvement happened pretty quickly, which was a pleasant surprise.  For those long-time quitters, when did you start being able to laugh normally (without wheezing) and cough normally (without hacking)?  I know the body needs time to heal, but I'm curious how long these processes take.

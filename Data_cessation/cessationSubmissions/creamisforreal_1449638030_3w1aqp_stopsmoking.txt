anxiety from quitting?

its been all day, but my anxiety is acting crazy! my chest was feeling really tight and i was taking huge breaths but it still didn't feel like i was getting a full breath of air, despite my lungs being filled. i smoked a little short (maybe three puffs), and then i felt my anxiety go away almost immediately. this was about ten minutes ago and i already feel like i can breath and im not having a panic attack lol... i'm convinced i want to quit because its a disgusting habit, and i've only been smoking for two years. i don't want to relapse anymore, but how can i relieve the anxiety from quitting? i've tried mediation and deep-breathing exercises, but they somehow make me more anxious. :/

2 weeks! Despite the depressive episodes!

I made it! I can’t believe I made it. I’m on the patch, so that helps a ton but days 3 and 4 were awful with cravings. Days 11, 12, 13 were awful with deep depressive states. I almost caved due to the depression even though i didn’t want a cigarette for the taste or smell or craving but because I needed the depression to subside. Instead I spent a solid hour or two crying each day (sobbing, really) and that helped a ton. I also kept reminding myself that these feelings would pass and it was the cigarette trying to get me to cave. I refused to give cigarettes that power. So moral of the story.....keep going! Even when you feel extremely low, it’s only temporary. If I can get through it, anyone can. I was a hardcore, first thing in the morning-last thing at night, 1.5-2 packs per day smoker for over 20 years. You’ve got this! We’ve all got this!

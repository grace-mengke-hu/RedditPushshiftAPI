Finally decided to finally quit!

After smoking a half-pack or more a day for over a year I have finally quit!

I've had many failed attempts in the past but this time feels different. It's only been 4 days but I feel inspired and excited.

I recently went on a date and had a really good time. I realized at that moment that no one wants to date a smoker. I certainly would not want to if I was not a smoker. Luckily, she didn't mind that I was a smoker. Either way I told myself I NEED to stop.

I've also started running and working out again slowly.

I just wanted to share my story and say thanks to this great subreddit.

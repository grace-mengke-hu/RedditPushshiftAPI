Obligatory one year post.

Honestly can't believe it. All my friends said I was the last person  they thought would give up. But I fucking did it and here we are 1 WHOLE FUCKING YEAR LATER! Such a good feeling. I want to say thanks to everyone on this sub for the help and support. And you can all do it seriously. Just keep pushing and don't give in, ever. Cheers.

Need some excellent advice from a seasoned quitter.

Okay, I know it might not be as much as some of you, like 3 months nicotine free, or one year free, and that certainly is my goal. The stress from quitting made me come down with a full 100% case of SHINGLES. What is your best advice for me when I get that BIG DAMN "just one" craving for one.

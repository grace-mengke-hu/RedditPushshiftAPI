Tobacco and occasional weed smoker, wanting to quit cigs only

Hi! I am smoking for a year and a half, tried quitting about 5 times with cetirizine, but in the end I always come back because I really enjoy smoking. ATM i haven't smoke for 24 hours and I am encouraging myself, but I have a question for all of you who like to light up a joint from time to time.

In general, most people say that if you wanna quit, you quit for good. Not even one cig because it can turn you back to a regular smoker. However, as I said, I like to smoke a joint from time to time (tobacco and weed, not weed only).

Do any of you have experience with quitting cigs successfully with occasional tobacco consumption through joints? I am afraid that it will keep me from fully quitting.

/r/stopsmoking's opinion on current selection of smoking cessation apps available (iOS and Android)

So there's obviously a sea of apps out there on both platforms to choose from, but **which one are you using and why?** (*include which version you're using i.e. pro/paid or free*).

I searched for previous posts regarding opinions on apps but from my cursory efforts it was clear there hadn't been one for quite a while. I'm personally interested in Android versions although in the spirit of community, contribute any experience you have of Apple related apps.

Perhaps if it was of any merit, the mods could put a link into the sidebar of a collection of /r/stopsmoking user's comments regarding different apps (I'm sure there's a valid reason that I'm missing, it's just I'd rather be able to see that someone has been actively trying to stop smoking through their comments rather than a one off endorsement in the respective app store).

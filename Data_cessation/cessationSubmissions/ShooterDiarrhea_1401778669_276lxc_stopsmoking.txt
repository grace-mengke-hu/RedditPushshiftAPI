One week since I quit. Body giving me a hard time.

So I started smoking when I was 16. Smoked for two years, then quit, before starting again when I turned 20. Been smoking for four years now. My parents don't know I smoke. They're highly anti-smoking. (My mom had given my dad an ultimatum to quit smoking after he retired. And he did.) Now I'm 24. Been a week since I had my last smoke. My throat is parched. I can't sleep. I'm having light coughs. I'm sweating when I shouldn't be. I'm 5'11" and weigh 60kgs. I'm so fucking thin you can literally see my heart beating on my chest. But I'm gonna keep going. I'm gonna quit. This is my chance. Fingers crossed.

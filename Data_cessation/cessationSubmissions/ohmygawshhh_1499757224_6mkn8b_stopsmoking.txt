More energy, like actually too much energy.

So here's something I didn't expect as a factor at all when quitting I didn't even consider it. 
Usually I have 3-4 coffees a day, since quitting I actually have way too much energy almost, today I only had two coffees and didn't need the second one, or even the first one I think...I was bouncing off the walls with energy. It's been like that for the last two days. 

Will this calm down? I feel like its actually too much, Or do I have to give up the one thing that I love...coffee?
Please say no. I love coffee so much.

Quit drinking first, or quit both together?

My 30th birthday is next week and my gift to myself is going to be caring about my future.

As such, I've decided to quit smoking. I've quit probably 30 times, and each time drinking is what's done me in.  I know that I can't quit smoking and still drink, so the beer is going too.

I have friends who've quit both who recommend that I quit drinking first, and deal with smoking later.  For me though, I'm only quitting drinking so that my quitting smoking will be successful.  It's a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.

I'd like to get your guys' opinion on this.  Should I quit drinking first, then quit smoking later, or quit them both simultaneously?

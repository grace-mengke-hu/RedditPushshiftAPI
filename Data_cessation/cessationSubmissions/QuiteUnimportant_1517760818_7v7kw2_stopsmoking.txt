Quitting: Not even 21, and smoking caused me health problems

I'm 19 years old and I've been an active smoker for 3 years. Recently, I've noticed some symptoms that are worrying: breathlessness (while not being physically ill), tachycardia, chest pain etc. that usually appear after smoking. What is worrying the most is that they started appearing when I don't consume cigarettes as well, it can just come all of a sudden.  

Until now, I've been smoking ~1 pack/day, sometimes more than that, sometimes less. It's been around 12 hours since I took a cigarette and I'm not doing well. I don't have cravings, but I do experience some withdrawal symptoms. Sore throat and problems with breathing...  

But I won't come back to smoking. I'm only 19 and I'm already noticing some worrying consequences of nicotine consummation. I don't want to have health problems in this age. Brain fog is intense.  

Just wanted to say hello to the community that I'm glad I became a part of. I mostly smoke because of feeding my emotional, psychological needs, cigarettes gave me sense of security, safety.  

But right now that doesn't even matter because having symptoms that I described is scary and many times I felt like I am about to die. Even though smoking may not be the main reason for that, I'm sure that quitting can help me.  

I can't wait to be able to fully taste my favorite food again, to be honest.

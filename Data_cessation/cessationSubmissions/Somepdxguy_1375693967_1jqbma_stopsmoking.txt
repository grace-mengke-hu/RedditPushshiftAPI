Keep trying

I'm proud of the people here trying to quit, or have already quit on this subreddit.  I was a smoker for four years, and it took me countless tries before I could finally consider myself a non-smoker.  So don't be hard on yourself if you slip up.  Staying a non-smoker definitely gets easier the more times you keep trying.

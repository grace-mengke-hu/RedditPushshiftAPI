Starting all over again. This time with resolve.

My story is like each one of yours.

I've quit a bunch of times.  My badge may still reflect the last time I said this months ago.

Yesterday, I was out to brunch in NYC.  We finished our meal, and I excused myself to go smoke.  And as I was doing so, I looked around. NYC is full of people smoking and doing whatever, but I zoomed in on those people with cigarettes in their hands.  I looked as they walked; each one of them alone, cold, with sad sunken eyes and grimaces as they exhaled.

I have always, and will always, romanticize smoking.  There's something so COOL about it to me.  I believe Vonnegut said it best: "It's the most noble form of suicide."

But I looked at my friends inside the restaurant.  I looked at the other groups of people enjoying their time together, not needing this stick of dried leaf wrapped in bleached paper that makes my skin and mouth smell and taste like death.  Why do I do this?  I don't even like this.

So I put it out.  I went to our waitress, and handed over the cigarettes to her, knowing someone in that restaurant would want the half-used $15 pack I bought just two nights prior.

Just minutes later, another waitress came up to me.  She was 8 years quit.  She told me, "You got this."

I'm done.  I hope it's the last time I ever need to say that.  It's going to be hard, but I got this.  

We got this.

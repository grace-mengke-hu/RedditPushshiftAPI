I've had a incredibly stressful two weeks, caved and just had a cigarette...

Holy christ that was foul. That was NOT what I remember smoking being like.

Gone was the satisfaction, the instant gratification I used derive from smoking. 

That tasted like eating the remains of an old skanky ashtray. 

I bought the cigarettes in a 'fuck it, life sucks right now and I need to feel better' way.

I do feel better - though not because I want to smoke. 

I just had my non-smoking reinforced. For the past month, though I've been happy with myself for quitting - I still felt I could smoke. Seeing people on the street made me think 'I kind of miss that'.

Not anymore.

You know when you see a person who you used to have strong feelings for after a long period of time - and you think, 'what the hell was I thinking?'. That's how I feel right now.

Stay the path people - smoking is foul, the only reason you used to enjoy it was because your taste-buds had stopped working. 

I think I need to brush my teeth again.

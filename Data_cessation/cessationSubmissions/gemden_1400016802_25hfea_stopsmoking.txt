All of a sudden..BAM!

Ok, I am 10 days in and the first week was rather easy. I had taken the week off of work and relaxed at home. This is my first week back at work and so many times during the work day (I would smoke at work, as I would never smoke at home), BAM, suddenly it's like my brain just "needs" to go for a smoke, and starts scheming ways of getting a pack of cigarettes. It's frustrating, I feel like I am arguing with my brain all day!!

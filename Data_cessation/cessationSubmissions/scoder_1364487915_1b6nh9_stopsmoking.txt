Almost two months and cravings have gotten worse. What the fuck?

So last year, I reached 4 months smoke free and then relapsed for the dumbest reasons. But it began with cravings that got worse and worse.

I'm almost at 2 months now, and cravings are getting bad again. It's as if the better I feel, the more I can justify one more fucking cigarette. Ugh!

Any suggestions?

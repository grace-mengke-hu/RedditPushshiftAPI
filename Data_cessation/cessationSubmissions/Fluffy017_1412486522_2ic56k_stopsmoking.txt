1 week, couldn't be happier

I quit last Sunday on impulse, with the full intention of never having a cigarette again.

With the help of vaping, I've made it a week. I know nicotine is inherently bad, but the fluid I'm using is 3mg, and I plan to go to 0mg at the two week mark.

In retrospect, I've gotta say that quitting has allowed me to shed the negative memories that caused my stress induced nic fits (breakups, car trouble, work stress, etc.), as well as alleviated the symptoms of my chronic depression.

Oh yea, and I'm getting hired on as a permanent employee into my dream career (Industrial Research and Development) on Monday. Life rocks :)

Stay strong, guys and gals. <3

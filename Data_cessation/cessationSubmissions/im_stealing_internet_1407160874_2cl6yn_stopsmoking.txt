Forty one days tobacco free, only day two nicotine free...

Yesterday was packed with stress. Late on rent, picked up serving shift at the restaurant I work, make rent (barely), given a free beer after shift, and watched my coworkers puff away while venting their own daily qualms. All excuses I used to use to smoke a cigarette. 

If I can give anyone advice on quitting, its this...

It gets so much easier. Stick with it. Use a patch or an e cig if you need, but once you get past the cigarettes, ween off. 
I hate my e cig. It tastes bad, it never hit the spot like a cigarette did, and I feel like I'm using a crack pipe when I hit it. Yesterday was like a switch went off in my head. I didn't need it. I didn't want it. I was awash in all my old triggers and I didn't care. 
Stick with it, quitters. It gets easier.

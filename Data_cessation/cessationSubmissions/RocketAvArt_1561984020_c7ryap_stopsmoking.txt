Trying again for the 40th time (maybe an exaggeration)

I've quit for a week or so at a time before, many times. 
My question though, and a stupid one. Does it grind anyone else's gears to hear people's remarks like 
"you should've done this years ago" 
"you know how stupid you were for smoking?" "you know how much money you waste?" 

I could go on but it's something I get from some friends and family and I've kept smoking because I didn't want to hear it and for some reason, they never say anything if they don't know I'm quitting. 

Like, I know better than anyone how stupid I am/was, don't remind me. 
It's hard enough as is. 

Trying again this time while I'm home-bound and won't be seeing anyone for the next few months, so they can't say anything.

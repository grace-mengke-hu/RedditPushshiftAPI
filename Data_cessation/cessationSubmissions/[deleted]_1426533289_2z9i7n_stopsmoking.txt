Should I start using e-cigarettes?

I'm a few years shy from being 30.
Been smoking on and off for about 10 years.
There have been days to severals months where I've smoked a pack if not more, and there have been days to months where I smoked nothing.

During the past 18 months or so, I've been smoking around quarter to half a pack of cigarettes, harsh ones.

Couple weeks ago though I just stopped. 

I like cigarettes, especially when drinking or after some other things which feel quite good.

So I'd like to ask if I should start using e-cigarettes since they seem to deliver mostly just nicotine. I have no idea what it feels like to just to have nicotine and nothing else.

I'm hoping there might be some other people here in similar situations but ahead of me to tell me where it might lead...

Cheers.

Let's go!

I've lost count on how many times I have attempted to stop smoking. Probably close to my 20th time in the last 1.5 years. This feels a little different though (which is what I think I always say prior to my attempt to quitting). Being recently unemployed for the last 10 months hasn't helped at all, but my first day at my new job starts Monday. I don't want to carry this into my new "life".

I am a closet smoker and for sure can get through the weekend without one as I will be staying with my gf. However, it's the binge smoking (reward I give myself for holding out x number of days) when I am alone and bored, that kills me. Anyway, as I said, I have something new coming up that will shake my routine and my triggers up - I am hoping that it will aid in my quest to quit.

Not really looking for a response; rather, I'd like to look at this post x days/weeks/years from now knowing that I was able to get rid of this habit - something that I hate so much, but have been dependant on for the last... 3 years or so... I can't really remember - which bothers me because I can't believe I let myself go for so long.

Let's go.

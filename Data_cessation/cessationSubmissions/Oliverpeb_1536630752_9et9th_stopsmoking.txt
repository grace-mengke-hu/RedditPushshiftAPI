Lets help eachother quit smoking!

So.. I've been a smoker for about 4 years now. When i started smoking it was to be cool, and i found it to be a great tool to socialize and make friends. Im smoking between 10-15 cigarettes a day. I have asthma, which is the main reason i want to quit smoking. I've heard about nicotine patches, gum and other things to help people quit smoking, but im going to do a cold turkey, and just persist. Im making this thread, so that we together as a community can post tips and trick, and share our stories and progress with eachother. I will be posting my progress on this thread, and i urge you to do the same.   


Lets kill smoking all together, as a community!

The next time I post I will have 3 days behind me

I broke down late afternoon, after a day and a half. I won't make excuses. I will quit. I will be done for good. I can taste it. I'm so grateful for your support. I won't get sappy with apologies. No. I will gather my powers for the last quit. Next time I post I will have 3 days behind me. I am resolved.

Identical Twins, one smoked, one didn't.

Hey!

I've never posted here before but, I'm currently quitting smoking for the 3rd time. Last time was back in 2014 and I lasted 3 years. I went travelling and ended up smoking again, due the abundance of cheap cigarettes and booze in South East Asia. 

So one of my biggest motivations I'm ashamed to say, is wrinkles. None of the horrible diseases seem to bother me as much. I suppose because I'm lucky enough not to have anyone in my family get cancer or lung disease, so far.

Anyway, I came across this article ages ago and I looked it up now because I was having a bit of a wobble. If like me, you're vain as fuck, you may find this motivating. It's identical twins, one of who has been smoking longer than the other (at least 5 years longer or not at all). The difference in their faces is quite pronounced and has helped me get through today's cravings.

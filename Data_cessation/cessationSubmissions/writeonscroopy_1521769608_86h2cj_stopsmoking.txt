4 days without a cigarette!

I've posted a couple times before and I've always relapsed, but I'm proud to say that I haven't had a cig in 4 days! It may not seem like much, but I've been smoking for 23 years and I've tried to quit eleventy billion times. I'm also 53 days off booze, and feeling really good. 

I did something different this time, that I think is maybe helping me feel like this is for good this time. I was down to the last cig in my pack on Sunday night. As I was smoking the one before it, outside in the cold on the back patio, I noticed that it tasted like shit. I thought, "Well, I'll finish this, and smoke the last one. It will taste like shit, too. Then I'll be done." But then I thought, "Why wait?" So I took my last cig out of the pack and said to it, "FUCK YOU, cigarette! You're gross and disgusting and don't offer anything positive to my life. You only bring me down. I'm breaking up with you!" Then I broke it and threw it in the trash. Then I took the trash out so I wouldn't be tempted to put it back together. 

One thing that I always struggle with is seeing other people having a smoke and thinking, "Man, it would be so easy to bum one right now!" But I've been on a few walks this week and even though I saw people smoking, I haven't had the urge to ask them for a cig. (I won't be that asshole!)

I'm vaping (3 mg), and chewing gum (2 mg). Sometimes at the same time. But no cigs! I'm really proud of myself and really hope I can make it a week; that seems like a big hump for me to get over. I have to go into work tomorrow where people will be smoking, and the urge to bum one will be strong, but hopefully I can abstain. 

Thank you all for being here, and giving me and everyone else encouragement. I won't smoke cigs with you today!

Not smoking through a death in the family

Hi all, 
Just wanted to share that over the weekend my step-father passed away after an 8 month battle with a very aggressive cancer. It was such a difficult time saying goodbye and also supporting my mom who is taking it very hard. To be a widow at 55 is just not fair. Anyways, she is a smoker and of course was doing a lot of that. We always shared smoke time as a way to sit down and talk and bond. I was able to still join her outside and during smoke breaks without smoking. Of course I was tempted and almost used the excuse that I deserve one for dealing with the loss.. but every time I thought that I shrugged it off. I am not really sure if sharing this will help anyone else.. but it is possible to deal with life like a regular person and not a smoker! I just kept telling myself that a cigarette would literally help in no way at all.

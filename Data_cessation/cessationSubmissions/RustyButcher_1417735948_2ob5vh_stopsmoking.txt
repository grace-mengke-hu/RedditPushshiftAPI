Tell me to stay home.

The first few days of being nicotine-free were actually really easy for me. About two or three hours ago a huge craving hit and I haven't been able to shake it off. I put my shoes on to go buy a pack and have been sitting on my couch for the last thirty minutes debating on what to do. I keep trying to convince myself that I will just buy a pack and quit again tomorrow morning when I wake up. I have tried to quit so many times and I usually break a few days to a week into a quit. I don't want to reset my badge again. I am tired of day ones and tomorrows.

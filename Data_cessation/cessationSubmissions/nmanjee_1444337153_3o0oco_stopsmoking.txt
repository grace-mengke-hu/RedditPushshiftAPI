I want to quit. I just bought a Joyetech. Now what?

I am a 31 year old male. I've been smoking for about 15 years. Marlboro menthol lights (gold). I also smoke Marijuana concentrates and drink 4 times a week on average.

I want to quit smoking cigarettes. So I went online to Joyetech.us and purchased the VTC mini and 12mg menthol juice.

Aside from putting the juice in and pushing the button, what do I do?

Should I begin midday or start in the morning?

What is the difference between these titanium and nickel cartridges?

What's the story with all these settings? Ohms, watts, voltage. I know what these terms mean, but not when it comes to this device.

My milestone. Quit Smoking

I have been trying to quit smoking for last 3 years. Every day have been the last day of smoking but there were few terrible happenings in my life thus I always found support in smoking. It's like a swamp where we just get into deeper and deeper. I want to come out of and let my strong character and determination solve the problems instead of this stick taking over all the time and getting into the vicious cycle again and again.

Now it's a call to self. Enough is enough!  I need your support guys. 

Thanks in anticipation.

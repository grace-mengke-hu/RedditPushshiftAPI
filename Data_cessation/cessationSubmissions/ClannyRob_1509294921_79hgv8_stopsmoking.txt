Why does it feel like the craving is a constant nag and not an every 20minutes thing

I'm only one day into my quit, Im going cold turkey, but the cravings feels like I'm hungry you know? Not like it's hitting me in intervals but always a nagging itch. This is not what i thought it would be, or how i heard it would.

I dreamed about smoking

Yesterday I woke up and remembered a dream from the previous night, a dream in which I smoked.

In the dream, I was having a really tough advanced math exam (haven't had one of those in 5 years) and I asked the person overseeing the examination procedure if I could smoke, and he said yes, and so I lighted one up and 
started puffing, and it felt good.

Then I woke up and was horrified, *"what did I do?!"*. In a few seconds, of course, I realized it was just a dream.

I know from past attempts, that smoking after you have quit is an awful experience. It tastes bad, makes you dizzy, makes your heart go crazy. It never feels good.

I don't know what to make of this...

This is it.

I recently went through a very hard few days which involved breaking up with the most important person in my life, moving out of our flat and going back to my old live-in job that makes me bored out of my mind. With all this has come stress, the most I've ever felt since I can remember. And all I've ever done to deal with stress in my life is smoke cigarettes. I made a promise to myself, and a promise to my now closest friend that I'm giving them up once and for all. I've given them up many times before, but it has come to that point in my life where I'm 100% this will be the last time. I haven't smoked since Sunday night and I feel amazing. I think with all that's happened, it's really given me a kick to get myself back on track with my life.

Anyway, I just wanted to say hi to everyone, and I look forward to us all supporting each other as we are on the same path :)

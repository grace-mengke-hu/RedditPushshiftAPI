Keeping nicotine patch on with a physically intense job?

Hey, so I've been doing some trial runs at quit attempt #2 recently with partial nicotine patches, 2/3 of a patch gets me through the nights I try it, but I work a job that's extremely physical and not even Band-Aids hold grip long. Has anyone found a way to keep patches on reliably during long workdays with a lot of motion? I'm interviewing for a new position in the company that'd reduce the physical side by about half which would help, but part of getting that job would involve quitting smoking (or already being on the path to quitting). Thanks in advance&lt;3

Hi I’m Olivia and I’m 20 (this is my first reddit post so I don’t really know what to say haha I’m a newbie!) I’ve been smoke free for 23 days. At times it’s been tricky but I definitely want to give up for good! Any tips for staying committed to being smoke free? Thank you! Keep going everyone☺️ x

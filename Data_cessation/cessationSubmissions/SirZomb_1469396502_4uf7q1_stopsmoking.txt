Planning to stop. Tips?

Hey,

Little back story!
I'm 17 and i smoked weed for like 1.5 years. I stopped smoking weed for 2 months now and i don't care that much. But smoking seems to be harder. I'm having my last 14 cigarettes in my pocket and i want to stop so badly.
I'm planning to smoke those tommorow and the day after.
Any tips on stopping? What can distract me from cravings?

The only thing that helps me right now is that i'm 17 and i can't get them myself ;)
EDIT: I smoke about 10/15 cigarettes a day. Depends on what i do.

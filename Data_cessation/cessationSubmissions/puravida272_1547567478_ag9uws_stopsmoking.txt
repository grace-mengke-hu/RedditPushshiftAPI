New winter coat

This year I purchased a winter coat during the post Christmas sales and it’s the first coat I have not smoked in in years, nearly a decade. I love wearing a warm coat that doesn’t smell like an ashtray :D 
It’s also leading me to wander away from outdoor smoking groups to keep it smelling fresh and I think that distance from my friends and family who are smoking is helping lessen the cravings. 
Isn’t it nice our clothing smells so much better? 
Happy Tuesday team!

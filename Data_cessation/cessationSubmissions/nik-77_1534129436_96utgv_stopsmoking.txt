1 month smokefree and it’s my birthday today :))

Hello everyone!!! 35 days ago never thought I would reach this point.. quit smoking cigarettes , quit smoking weed , quit porn and masturbation , quit my addiction to tramadol , quit social media..all at once and have not looked back since then..my one and only mantra : Meditation.. specifically vipassana meditation . Read this book called meditation in plain English by Venerable H Gunaratana a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka  ..amazing book.. It helps. Really really helps..if I can quit anybody can do it. Never been soooo happy and positive in life..  its happiness from within.. feels like everything is falling into place.. Thank you to all of you for the motivational posts.

PS : it’s my 27th birthday today. Can I get a happy birthday? Since nobody remembers my birthday as I don’t have a social account.. Thank you :) :) :)

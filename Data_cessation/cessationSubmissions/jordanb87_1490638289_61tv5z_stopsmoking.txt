Former pack-a-day smoker, transitioned to VUSE brand e-cigs, and just threw out my pens and refills. Fuck nicotine.

I used to smoke a pack a day and shoot dope. Two years later, nicotine is what I used to call "the only thing I have left," but after blowing through two cartridges in 12-16 hours, I've had enough. I can't afford it, it's bad for me, and it's just as bad as street drugs when I put something unregulated and unknown into my body on purpose. 

I'm going to update this thread every day with a comment just to keep myself accountable. I hope this isn't a shitpost. 

Thanks

Social smoking - any better?

For a long time now (5+ years), I've considered myself a social smoker. I only smoke in certain situations (at bars, with friends, stressed out), and have the ability to control my smoking to only weekends. I rarely by packs, and have convinced myself that I'm somehow better off because my habit seems contained. It's one of those things that I've always thought "yeah, it's not the real me, but I'll quit doing it eventually." Now is the time I feel like I need to stop, for fear of waking up one day and still having the same problem. Not to mention, my girlfriend has caught me multiple times now, which has led to trust issues and is affecting my relationship. Anyone else in a similar situation? Agree/disagree?

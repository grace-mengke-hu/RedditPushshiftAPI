Stopped smoking for 40 days and I dont understand why is it so easy, even from the beginning. No cravings, no nothing...

Title pretty much sums it up. (started smoking since 2012, without breaks);

More details:

Before I decided to stop smoking, I was on IQOS for almost 3 weeks. I got along just fine with it and everytime I wanted to try and smoke a normal cigarette the taste of it was unbearable. I could not even smoke more than 3 puffs.

One day I ordered some really spicy stuff from a local Asian restaurant. Almost choked with the food, that's how spicy it was, and somehow I managed to catch a cold.

NOW HERE COMES THE TRICKY PART (If someone can explain this):

I started taking KLACID 500MG antibiotics to fight the horrible infection in my throat, and TUSSIN FORTE, to help with my throat breaking coughs.
I'm almost certain that antibiotics fuck up your body, that's why their called that way, BUT after I started taking the meds the next day my energy and productivity skyrocketed.

IM NOT JOKING..... 

Since then, I wasnt been able to feel much from smoking my IQOS, which led me to cutting cigarettes and coffee with so much ease and no cravings at all!!!

Can someone explain it? Is it because of the antibiotics?

Before this I have never been able to resist smoking not even for a day ...

Got a nasty reminder of how smokers' lungs feel this week...

I had an allergic reaction to some antibiotics and part of it involved not being able to breathe very much and having a sore throat. I was wheezing away last night on the subway and it suddenly occurred to me that this is exactly how my lungs felt back when I was smoking. 

I didn't realize back then how awful my lungs felt, but since I've been able to compare them to the healthy lugs I've had for the past 300-something days, it was like night and day. 

So glad I didn't go through this reaction as a smoker; I'd probably be in the hospital right now.

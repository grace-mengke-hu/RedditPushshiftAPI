Failed Again

I keep quitting. And I keep quitting quitting.   And I think I need a new plan.

I have the best luck when I start from a moment of clarity and resolve and quit cold turkey (usually randomly).  I can go weeks or months.  

Then suddenly, I get this idea that I really want to smoke, just for xx period of time (vacation, a special weekend, whatever) and like an idiot, I do.  But it never ends there!  The cycle continues...

Anybody else do this?  How do I develop my willpower better?

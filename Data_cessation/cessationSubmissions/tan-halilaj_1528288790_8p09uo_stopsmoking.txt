Relapsed after 4 years, this time feels harder quitting again

First time poster, English is not my native language so bear with me please!
Ok so it might get long , I started smoking when I was 19yo, been going through hard times and I think I was depressed at the time.Progressively I went from 40 cigs a week to 40 cigs a day over a short period of time , continued smoking 2 packs a day(sometimes even 3) for almost 8 years.With the help of my wife I decided to quit and switched to vape wich turned out to be a mistake, the vape developed liquid in my lungs and I begin coughing so bad that couldn't sleep at night.After a week I dropped the vape and went cold turkey!Worst time of my life, on the third day my body was literally shaking craving for nicotine, it was really bad but starting from the 4 day the cravings were bearable and soon I didn't even think of lighting a cig.After 4 full fucking years without nicotine I fucking relapsed, AFTER 4 FUCKING YEARS!!!This time I never smoked more than 10 cigs a day for about 3 months, generally 6-7 cigs a day and only during the first half of the day, starting from 4pm till the next morning I didn't smoke cuz I had my little son around and family, only my wife knew I relapsed, nobody else doubted it.After several poor attempts where I miserably failed I finally made up mind and committed to quit once and for all going cold turkey,  I'm at 116 hours without smoking currently, I've been experiencing extremely painful cravings during the last days, this is the fifth day without smoking, I imagined it would be easier by now according to my last experience but surprisingly the cravings seems to be more powerful day after day, it's getting extremely hard for me to resist the temptation, the thought of lighting a cig is costantly tickling my brain.What can I do to ease the pain?!Some suggestions are appreciated, I don't want to fuck up after almost 5 days without smoking

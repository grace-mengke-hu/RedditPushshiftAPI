How do I quit for good?

Hey guys.

So I first quit 8/2016, but due to recent stress with class and work I cracked and bought a vape. That wasn't satisfying enough for me so I went back to actual cigarettes. That was about 2 months ago. Today I threw away my vape and all the liquid, and I'm almost done with the pack that I have right now.

What are ways people use to prevent going back again? I've read up on nicotine gum and whatnot but I read that it's linked to mouth cancer and easy to get hooked on. Is there a better option that I can use to stay clean for good this time?

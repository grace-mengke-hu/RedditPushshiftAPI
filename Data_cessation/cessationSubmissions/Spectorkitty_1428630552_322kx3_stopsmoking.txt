I just had my last cigarette

And I'm afraid. It's silly, but I am. I have ecigs, chantix, and have read Allen Carr. But I've smoked for 30 years and it feels scary. I'm 45, have trouble with simple exercises and walks, am embarrassed by my weakness and I want to quit. But...it feels hard and impossible. Help!

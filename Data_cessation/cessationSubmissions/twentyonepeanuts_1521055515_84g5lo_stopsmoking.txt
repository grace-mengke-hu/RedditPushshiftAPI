Quitting with my mum

Hi all. Was at a doctor's appointment for my mum, moral support and all. She's had high blood pressure and lacking energy so hard, she's been sleeping all day after her 3 hour long morning shifts. She's also had asthma all her life. The doc had to take her BP three times he couldn't believe it was so high and then listened to her heart and lungs. And said that she absolutely must quit smoking, or she's sure to get lung disease. And it will kill her. His words, he wasn't about to sugarcoat, y'all. It was scary. So we're both quitting. I've been smoking for 3 years and wanting to quit for 1.5 of those years. Any tips, advice?

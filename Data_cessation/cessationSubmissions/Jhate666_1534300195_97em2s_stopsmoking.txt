5 hours in... I don’t like it... can I use a e-cig while on the patch?

I started with patches today and I’m 5 hours in I also have some gum but just that feeling of inhaling is overwhelming me I feel like the cravings are tamer but I’m still on edge nonstop. I have a cheap Marlboro Mark X e-cig and I’m thinking about taking a couple puffs off of that to hopefully mellow me out. Is it okay to do that?

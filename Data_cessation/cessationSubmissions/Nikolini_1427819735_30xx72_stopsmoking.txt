After three years and many attempts I'm going to do it finally...

I've attempted (half-heartedly) many times over the last few years to quit but always found a way to justify continuing to smoke.

I tried for the New Year and made it two days (my longest streak) before being stressed out and buying a pack.

With this new month I'm making another attempt to quit cold turkey.

Wish me luck guys!

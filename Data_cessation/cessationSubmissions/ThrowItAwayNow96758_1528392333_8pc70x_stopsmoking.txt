Wheezy Lungs

Hello All,

I officially quit smoking yesterday. I went to the doctor for a yearly checkup and she expressed serious concerns about a wheezing sound she heard in my lungs. I was exposed to black mold and developed a wheezing during that time that has never fully gone away. 

Don't be like me. Choose to live. I'm scared as hell, but I'm ready to start fighting for my life no matter what that means.

Send good thoughts and prayers my way.

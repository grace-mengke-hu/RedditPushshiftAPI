Anxiety

I quit once before, and my anxiety was through the roof. I couldn't get out of bed. I simply freaked the fuck out. I've wanted to quit again for a while, but the fear of that anxiety kicking back in has held me back. 

On Monday night I had a bit too much to drink so a buddy drove me home and I left my smokes in my car. I ended up deciding around noon yesterday that it was my quit day. Well it lasted until about 5:45 before the anxiety and stress became too overwhelming and I caved. 

In the past 33 hours I've only had one smoke, which I think is pretty damn good, but I have no idea how I am going to push through with these anxiety attacks. Does anyone have any advice?

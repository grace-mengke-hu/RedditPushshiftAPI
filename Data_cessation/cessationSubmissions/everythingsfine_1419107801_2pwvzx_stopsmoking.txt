Day 4, having a super intense craving that will not go away

I had my last cigarette Tuesday night, making this my fourth day of being smoke-free.  I decided to quit cold turkey so I'm not using any nicotine replacement.  I'm using a phone app to help track my progress and according to that, the last of the nicotine has just left my system.  This would explain why I am now having one HELL of a craving - my head hurts, my throat feels constricted, I'm irritable/angry, my ears are ringing (side note: is that normal?) and I'm so frustrated that I'm on the verge of crying.  Sorry to be dramatic but this sucks and I would just really appreciate any advice to get through this, because it's been 2+ hours and it's not going away no matter how hard I try to distract myself.  I know 4 days isn't that long but I'm proud to have even gotten this far, and I don't want to have to start over.  

Thanks guys.  It feels really good to let all that out.

EDIT: thanks everyone for the great advice and words of encouragement. I am excited to say that I made it through, and I feel about a million times better today.  Thanks again! You all are awesome and I'm glad I found a support community

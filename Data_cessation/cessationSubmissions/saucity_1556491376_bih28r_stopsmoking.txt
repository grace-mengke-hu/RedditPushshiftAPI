My kitty died of lung cancer. He was 14 and my best friend.

I didn’t ever, ever smoke inside btw, it was just one of those things. 

But watching my best friend suffer like that... I can’t do that to my family, to myself. 

I’m so stressed out and very deeply sad missing him, and I want to smoke so badly. But that won’t make anything better. Life is never gonna give us the perfect opportunity to quit “when things settle down” - they never will! 

Keep quitting ,ya buncha quitters! Love to you all💕

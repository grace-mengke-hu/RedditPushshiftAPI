Smoked for 32 years and have been smoke free for 50 days. Very happy about that but feel lost. Who am I?

I have been smoke free for 50 days. I have been smoking since I was 14 years old so that is a total 32 years! I have attempted to quit 6-7 times. Who knows? I have lost count. I have always smoked 1/2 to a full pack a day. I literally feel like I do not know who I am. I am struggling in every area of my life. I love the fact that I don’t smell anymore, that my car doesn’t stink and that I don’t have to feel ashamed of smoking but I feel like I have lost my identity. I know this sounds weird but very true!

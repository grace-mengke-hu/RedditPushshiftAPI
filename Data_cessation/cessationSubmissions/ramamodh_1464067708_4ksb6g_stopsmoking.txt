After a failed attempt/s, starting from day 1 again.

I have had 2 failed attempts so far. The first one was successful for 50 days and the second one was successful for 90 days. Slipped and gave in during a moment of weakness. Have learnt some lessons from my previous attempts. Going to forgive myself and with the help of my previous lessons and most importantly help from the amazing community here, I am poised to be successful forever this time. Wish me luck, folks ! 

Also I wish all the very best to everyone here ! Cheers

For those who have failed with Allen Carr, This is how you succeed! (Part 2)

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, I made a post about how I finally succeeded with Allen Carrs method after failing to do so which can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/9g9c43/for\_those\_who\_have\_failed\_with\_allen\_carr\_this\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/9g9c43/for_those_who_have_failed_with_allen_carr_this_is/)

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday however, I had such a strong urge to smoke that I almost failed. This was during work, when I had to keep telling myself that the pain would pass in time. I told myself if Allen Carr said it would take between 3-5 more days before the little monster died, then I wouldnt be able to do it. Yesterday night I was still feeling atrocious and ended up reading Anthony Robbins, Awaken the giant within and there was a chapter about pain which helped me shift my mind again. He his main points were:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **What we link to pain and pleasure affect our destiny -** But what I got from this point is that that **I can manipulate my mind into deciding what causes me pain** and therefore I could unlink that withdrawal feeling from pain and link it to pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not in the thing itself but your own estimate of it and thus you have the power to revoke at any moment -** Robbins took this quote from meditations but while I read it, something clicked. Essentially, what it is saying in relation to smoking is that: **We fear the withdrawal symptoms we may feel in the future more than actually feeling them.** In my case, I felt the hunger pangs that allen carr described as part of the minor physical withdrawal symptoms. But I also had this headache every day at work around noon when I quit. **This headache was caused by the ANTICIPATION of withdrawal symptoms and is not part of the physical withdrawal symptom itself.** The withdrawal pain in quitting was just the hunger and he was right in saying that it was easy to deal with. Once I realised that headache was cause by my fear of feeling future pain, I stopped feeling it. I have gotten to noon today without a single pang compared to yesterday and its only my 3rd day smoke free.

I hope this helps those who are using allen carr but have withdrawal symptoms that the book didn't describe get free.

Coffeeeeee

I am unspeakably happy about the fact that I am still anticipating and enjoying my morning cup of coffee. Smoking with coffee is second only to smoking with alcohol, but I think I've been saved by my preference for iced coffee and iced lattes because now I'm drinking hot coffee and the association is rather light. 

I still can't imagine ever enjoying alcohol again but this gives me hope that one day I might have a glass of wine and enjoy it sams cigarette, too. Happy quitting everyone!!

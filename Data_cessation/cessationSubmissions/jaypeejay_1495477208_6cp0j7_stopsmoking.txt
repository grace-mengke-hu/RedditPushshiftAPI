Checking in at Day 3!

I think it's really day four, depending on how you count your days, but it doesn't really matter.

I'm feeling good. This is the first day that the withdrawals feel super muted and easily manageable. I think meditation, particularly meditating on why I want to quit has been the most impactful part of my process this time. 

I have the same feeling I did in my last (most successful) attempt to quite - I think I went 6-7 months. It felt, and feels, easy and natural - much like The Easy Way preaches. I attribute this to the mindset of quitting from a positive perspective vs. negative or fear based perspective. 

Ultimately I wanted to feel better and healthier, and not couch when I cycled or played basketball, and that's what drove my decision to stop smoking. This, to me, is an absolutely key to success. 

I'm not saying I'm out of the woods, or won't struggle, but I feel very cautiously optimistic.

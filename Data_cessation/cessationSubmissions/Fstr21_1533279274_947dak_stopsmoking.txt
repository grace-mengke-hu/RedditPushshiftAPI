Trying to quit hookah routine

I am very much a creature of routine so I dont know if the hookah smoking is an addiction or a routine that I need to do while on the computer. I do it the entire time Im on the computer for the entire duration, when Ive tried to replace it, doesnt work it feels like I dont know.. I feel off. I dont really know what I am trying to get out of this, Im sure the easy answer is just stop. But I figure this being a stop smoking sub, people might understand its not that easy.

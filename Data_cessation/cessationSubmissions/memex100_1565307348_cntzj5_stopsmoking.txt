What I’ve learned

No matter how good my intentions are when I go to bed, they’re all out the window when I wake up.  I’m up to a pack/day of AS, so I’m heavily addicted, and in the first morning of my quit, I don’t even want to get out of bed.  Then I think about One More Day.  My body perks up, and I come up with a laundry list of things I can get done before I officially quit.  I’ve kept smoking for years with that mentality.  One thing I’ve learned is that list is absolute bullshit.  I rarely get done even two things on it- it’s just a tactic to get me out of bed and to the gas station.  

I’m almost eight months sober, and quitting drinking was infinitely easier than quitting smoking is for me (I’ve quit more times than I can count), and I was drinking almost a 12-pack a day. I have zero desire to ever drink again, and I know this is possible with smoking, too- just got to get past the lies I tell myself.  Tomorrow is the day- wish me luck.

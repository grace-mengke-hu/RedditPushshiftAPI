Quite smoking three days ago after two years. Need some tips

I smoked heavy for about two years and decided to quite recently. I knew it was going to be hard, but i didnt know the type of difficulty. Im having trouble focusing, sleeping, and most expected, not being angry. Il catch myself reaching where i had my smokes without realizing it and then i cant stop thinking about it for hours. Ive also been extremely hungry and know thats common, but i need some tips and help on how stop thinking about it or occupy my mind.

sick n tired

Hello everyone, I'm obviously here to stop smoking but I have some questions!

I used to be a 2 packs/day smoker, now I smoke 5 to 10 cigs a day so

my health is fucking bad now.. my heartbeat per second is high now and I can't sleep properly because I can feel my heart pounding..I drink too much coffee too

the question is, will my heart ever go back to normal or slow it down a little bit because it's so damn fast?

does health improve if u ever stop smoking ?

is it a life changing decision to quit this shit ?

I'm addicted and I need help 

I really need some answers please!

thank u

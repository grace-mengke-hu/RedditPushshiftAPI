I just smoked my last cigarette!

I just finished reading Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking and smoked my last cigarette! I am overjoyed to finally be a non-smoker! He's right, It doesn't have to be so hard! I changed my quit date on the smoke free app to 3:00 pm on August 26th, 2019. I will take the warnings to heart. That first cigarette is not just one, but a lifetime of smoking. Not another puff no matter what! Anyone else quitting today... we got this!!!

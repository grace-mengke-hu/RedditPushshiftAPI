I'm in!

Been smoking about 20 years, about a pack a day. The longest I've been without a smoke was about a week. 

I'm done hating myself about smoking. I'm done having to have my wife deal with the smell. I'm done with this crap.

I know it's not gonna be easy, but it's happening now.

Fuck smoking.

How do you stop yourself from bumming a smoke?

I'm back after another badge reset. I went a week without buying a pack, but hung out with smokers on Friday and Saturday, and ended up buying a pack on Saturday night, and smoking them all throughout the night and all day Sunday. I haven't had a cig yesterday or today. 

I find I keep going back to buying a pack when I start bumming smokes from people, and I just can't stop bumming smokes! If you're hanging out with someone and they light up and offer you one, how do you say no? Or, if you see they are smoking, how do you not asking them for a smoke? They're right there! Waiting to be smoked!

I know the obvious answer is "just don't ask" but I have zero willpower, so any tips or tricks that you can offer would be really appreciated. I also can't stay away from these people completely because they are co-workers and I see them at least once a week. Thanks!

Things to do instead of smoking?

I suffer from depression and I started smoking as a way of coping when I'm too miserable and under too much pressure to cope.

I think the thing I like most about smoking is not so much the taste or the nicotine high or any of the culture that surrounds it, but just the little capsule of escapism that comes from going out for peace and quiet and a bit of instant satisfaction. It's just having a tiny moment where I can focus on doing something that makes me feel good without having to think about anything troubling.

Since I realised this, I've tried going outside for a bit (without any smokes) when I'm feeling particularly under pressure, but it honestly made me feel worse because being outside without doing anything just made me start thinking about all the stuff that was bothering me.

I think I can tough out the nicotine withdrawal (so I'm not interested in e-cigs or the patch or anything like that), but I feel like I need to find another habit to replace smoking if I'm really going to quit long-term.

Any ideas about what I can do to replace my habit?

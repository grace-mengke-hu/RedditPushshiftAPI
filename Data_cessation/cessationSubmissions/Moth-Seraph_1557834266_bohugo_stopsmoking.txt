Starting to idealize the whole nicotine experience?

I quit smoking December 2017. Never going back. I quit vaping January 2019. And i miss it horribly. But i feel like I'm struggling MORE now than i was when i quit. Like, i miss the dopamine spikes. I miss the comfort and the stress release. I just miss it in general and am struggling with not buying another kit. But i don't want to be trapped by the nicotine demon again. I know quitting was the right thing to do but i miss out so much i cry sometimes.

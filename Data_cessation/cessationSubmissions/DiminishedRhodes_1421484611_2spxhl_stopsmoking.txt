Nasty Cough I've Had Since Quitting Smoking

Hey everyone!  It's been almost a month and two weeks since I've quit smoking and just last week I developed a nasty cough where I cough up a lot of plhem. No blood. 

I've been taking nasal decongestant,  cough suppressant.  It is still here just not as bad. I  getting into hypochondriac mode thinking the worst of the worst.

I unfortunately can not visit a doctor in my current situation. I am hoping it is just my lungs kicking a lot of the nasty stuff out of my lungs associated with smoking.  

I just feel really alone in my quitting as dont have a lot of support at home and with this going on its giving me extreme anxiety and I cant sleep earlier than 4:30 am from coughing so much. Thanks for reading my rant, I appreciate it!

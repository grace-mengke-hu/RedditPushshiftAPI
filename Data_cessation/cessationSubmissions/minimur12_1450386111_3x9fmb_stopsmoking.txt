I need to help my parents! Advice from the inside?

Both my parents have been doing well in regards to stopping, but today we had a bit of a problem.
Mum thought she saw an unopened pack of 10, either my dad is hiding them or they never existed. It was causing an arguement, so I settled it by going out and buying a pack.

When I got back I said

'If you're going to act like children I'll treat you like one. This is my pack. Ask me if you want one, and don't buy any more.'


I would like an insight so I have a better understanding on how I can approach and help them out in the future.

Any advice?



Additional details:

Smoking 3-6 a day, using a vape throughout the day too.

I've never smoked



Personally, I'm kindof hoping the guilt trip they feel from having their son settle the dispute will also knock some reality into them about the whole situation.



Thanks!

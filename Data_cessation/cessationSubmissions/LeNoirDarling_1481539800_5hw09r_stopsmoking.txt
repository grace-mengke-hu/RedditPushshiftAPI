90 days smoke free!

So When I quit smoking I never really got around to downloading one of the apps that tracks days and dollars etc, but I did add flair to this sub within the first few days. 

Now when I want to know how long it has been that I quit, I have to come to this sub and read people's posts and support others to check my flair. It's a win win.

I have to add that this subreddit has been so helpful and impactful to my recovery. I never would've thought that I needed the support of others to quit a habit that  reinforced the idea of me being a loner.

I smoked for 20 years and though I have "tried" to quit before- I have never lasted this long, or have been so resolute in my decision. This is really one of the hardest and most rewarding and things I have ever done. Thanks.

Smoking is the stupidest thing I've done in my life.

It's now been a little over a month since I quit cold turkey, I have no longing or intention to ever start again.

Over the past couple of years I've really come to internalise that smoking is most likely the stupidest thing I've yet done in my life. Shame it took me a decade and a half to finally get to this point.

Also I hope I didn't do too much lasting damage to my body.

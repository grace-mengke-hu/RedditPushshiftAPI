my week so far

happy with the overall fact that im 7 days without a cancer stick.
ive been having withdrawl headaches mixed with my chronic migraines all week but im trying to stay strong and power through them.
i don't feel much different physically, but im proud of myself to say the least.
im looking forward to hitting the gym, eating right and starting a healthy lifestyle for the rest of my life.

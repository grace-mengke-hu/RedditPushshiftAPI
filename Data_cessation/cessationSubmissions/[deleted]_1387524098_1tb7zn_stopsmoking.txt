18, smoking for 6 years, and getting worse, now killing more than a pack a day. Ideas to ween myself off?

I'm looking to cut back severely.  The amount I've been smoking has been fluctuating up and down for the past 6 years.  There was a point I was smoking 2 packs a day, and where I was smoking 3 cigarettes day.  I'm currently smoking about a pack a day, give or take a cigarette or two.

Tips on weening myself off, or cutting back, would be appreciated.  I can't financially support this anymore.

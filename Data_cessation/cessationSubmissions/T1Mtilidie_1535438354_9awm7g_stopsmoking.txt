I need help. Is this the right place?

Smoking since I was 16 (24) now. I'm a pack a day electrician who works mostly outside.. I've tried it all. The patch, spray, distractions. Also a serious nail biter for as long as I can remember. Im getting married next year  in July and I need some kind of advice or any suggestions because i promised her I'd quit smoking before the wedding and I  don't know if I'll actually  be able to do it. It's tearing me apart. I know I can't do this by myself. Please help.

Day 3. While cleaning my car, I found a half smoked cigarette in my car that I had put away for another time. I threw it out and I am so proud of myself!

I kept hearing how the third day was the hardest and it was hard. But I was strong enough to resist and throw it out. I couldn't be happier with myself and this is just me patting myself on the back. :)

It’s been two weeks

Hi, I’m not active on this sub but a few months ago I stumbled across it. There’s a lot of inspiration here to quit but if I’m being honest it wasn’t enough to make that leap. I’m not very old but I’ve been smoking since I was 14 and I’ve been smoking about 6-7 years.

I know that’s not the longest but it still doesn’t make it any better.

 I’ve promised a dozen people here and there that I would quit, but I never did. I’ve lied to people I loved, I’ve made promises that I haven’t kept. About two weeks ago I decided I would actually try, not for someone else, not for some greater cause, but for myself. 

I really want a cigarette. I really want a cigarette.

I’ve decided I’m going to see if I can’t try and stop. 

I don’t know what I want or need from this sub. But I haven’t told anyone so I’m telling you. Goodnight

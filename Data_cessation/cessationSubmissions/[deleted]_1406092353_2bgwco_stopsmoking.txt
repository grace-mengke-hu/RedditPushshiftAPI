Do you gain weight when you quit?

Basically I have anorexia, so gaining weight for me is a huge, terrifying thing. I'm in treatment but nowhere near recovered. 

I want to quit. I get no benefits from smoking and it's a massive drain on resources now that I'm smoking more and more.

I've been reading online and people are like 'oh it's no big deal, you'll only gain about 10 pounds'. To me, that is a huge deal and if it happened I would start again immediately. I quit for a month once before and I didn't gain anything.

If my eating/activity levels stayed the same, am I going to gain weight regardless? I'm just wondering if I should hold off quitting till I'm recovered and don't care anymore, but I really do hate smoking.

24 hours!!!

You heard it right.  Its been a full 24 hours without a cigarette.  No NRT.  Cold turkey. My god today is not easy. 

I've made it this far and do not want to go back.  However I am having some pretty bad withdrawal symptoms and i'm considering having a piece of nicotine gum.  Then, part of me says "that's nicotine! You may as well have a cigarette then". 

Ugh.  I really do not want to smoke.  I'm not going to smoke.  But this little stupid voice is pissing me off, telling me just one smoke, its all nicotine anyway.  If I am going to put nicotine into my body, why not let it be the real thing and enjoy it?  Argh, shut up!!

I'm getting agitated at the smallest things.  I feel like punching the wall.  

I am not going to smoke, just shut up voice in my head!

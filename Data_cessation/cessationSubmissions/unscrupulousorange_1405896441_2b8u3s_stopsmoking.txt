Can't make it past a day without a major mental breakdown, help!

I've been a pack a day (sometimes more) smoker for almost 15 years now. I feel like I've used every method around to help, from patches and medication to hypnosis, but the emotional withdrawal is so awful that I always end up relapsing. I know that mood-swings and depression are normal and will pass but I feel like this goes way beyond that. It's been 23 hours and I'm feeling suicidal, violently angry/paranoid, and have even self-harmed. I ended up smoking again just because I feel like it's the only way to stop going insane!
Even when smoking I struggle emotionally but I'm usually able to maintain/function with tools like meditation or yoga. Nothing seems to help right now, though. I sincerely want to quit but I'm not sure how to make it through this. For those of you who have, what advice can you offer?

tl;dr Quitting smoking is literally making me crazy!

A bit paranoid at the moment 

Today is my 3rd day of taking chantix so I'm still in my week of smoking up to my quit date. Tomorrow I move on to taking 2 0.5 mg pills a day.

It took me a long time to work up the nerve to take chantix. Finally I said " to hell with it" I'm just going to do it and not think about it or read all of the craziness on line. However tonight for some reason it's really bugging me. Just read about people having seizures in there sleep etc etc. 

I don't know what I'm digging for here or asking. Guess I just needed to get it out with other people who are trying to quit and or have taken chantix .

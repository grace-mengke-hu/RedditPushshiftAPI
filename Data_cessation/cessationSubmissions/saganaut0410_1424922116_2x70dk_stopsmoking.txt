Day 5 has been my hardest, what was your hardest day?

Today I screamed and yelled and cried and acted horrible to people. I had done so well my first 4 days but today was so hard. I didn't smoke a cigarette. I did roll an herbal cigarette (dried rose petals) and felt horrible about it.

What was your hardest day?

1st time quitter here, living surrounded by smokers.

Hi,
I was looking for a FAQ but couldnt find it..?

I'm 24 years old, french, and have been smoking for close to 5 years. I started for what's considered "late" by my friends.
Most of them are smoking since they are 15 years old...

I'm feel ready to quit, but my main problem is the people and the world I live in. I'm working in the music industry, and everybody in the office is smoking, most of the jobs I got were during a smoke break outside a meeting room. My girlfriend is a smoker, my father it, you name it, everybody's smoking.

In France we're big big smokers, and it cost a TON! (I think it might be even more in the US..)

Would you have any advices on how to deal with the need when everybody around you is smoking?
I wanted to get an app on my phone or something like this, as i've seen a lot of people are using one..

Please let me know, i'm really sorry if this has been posted a thousand time...
Thank you.

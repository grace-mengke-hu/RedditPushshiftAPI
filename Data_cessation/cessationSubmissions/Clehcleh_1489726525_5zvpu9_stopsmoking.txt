Quitting has been on my mind, I think the flu has given me the push I need

I'm a heavy smoker of six years, I average a pack a day. On the lightest days I'll smoke half a pack. On heavy days/days I drink i'll smoke two. Quitting has been on my mind a lot lately, especially in the past several months.

I came down with a gnarly cold/flu yesterday and smoking is almost unbearable. I smoked three cigarettes yesterday and two (and a half) today. So even though I feel like death, it feels amazing! 

I'd love to quit but I'm scared.
I go back to work tomorrow and I'm scared to fall back into my routine (smoke with coffee, smoke before I leave, smoke in the car, smoke on my lunch, smoke on the way home, and smoke a handful of times before I go to bed) breaking that habit seems impossible. 

And don't get me started on my weekends. I'm surrounded by heavy smokers. My family and I will sit around smoking one after another all day long. And I'll admit it, I love it! My favorite thing to do is sit outside all day long talking and chain smoking.

I want to be a non smoker, and I have for a long time. I hate the way I smell when I come in, the health problems, premature aging, etc.

I feel like if I was completely alone I could quit, but I'm nervous to be around my family. I've "quit" with an ecig before but that lasted three months and that's not the route I want to go. Last time I tried to quit cold turkey it lasted 2 days. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Being surrounded by smokers and not wanting to isolate yourself?

I need a little motivation.

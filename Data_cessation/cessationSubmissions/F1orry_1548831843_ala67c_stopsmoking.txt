Thoughts on being a non smoker and about other smokers now on day 18

Seeing other smokers now makes me feel proud and grateful that I'm not slave to this substance anymore. I'm happy not to risk my health anymore. 

I just really have to pay attention to my ego wanting me to put me in a superior place which isn't good for me and others. The smell of smoke is sometimes ok, but most of the time it disgusts me. I'm getting more and more annoyed by people on the street and suddenly lighting up a cig, blowing smoke almost in my face. 

But why?  It's nothing I can change. I think that's exactly the point with the superior thing and why it isn't true. I'm still a smoker. I have the mind for it. The difference is that I'm practicing to live and act differently every single day now. And that's what's making me feel better. It's a gift. I'm regaining self trust. I'll be asking for more compassion and acceptance for active smokers because other thoughts are unfair and they stress me out. And stress leads me back to addiction. Today I choose love and acceptance for others and for myself instead of intolerance. Because that's what we all deserve, right?

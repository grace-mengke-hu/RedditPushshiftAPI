i made it past day 5!

i just need to vent and pad myself on the shoulder publicly. last week i broke at day 5 and restarted, so making it through is definitely good. i'm chewing the gum though, that surely makes things easier while prolonging the addiction i know.

still, yesterday was tough. first time i had a business date outside town and a number of heavy triggers went off. e.g. coming outside after an intense 2.5hr meeting to a very scenic part of the city where i used to smoke and enjoy the scene. warm, the sun out, basically "first day of spring" feeling everywhere. I JUST ABOUT MANAGED NOT TO BUY CIGS but instead just be there and enjoy the sun and the scenery for what it is and - wonder o wonder! - it still was good. in fact maybe it was even better. and thats the first time i actually felt that.

i have the gum here to help me when cravings get bad. but i didnt have any today yet (up since 3hrs, and i used to have about 3 cigs in by now) and actually today i really feel disenchanted with the whole smoking thing. i mean really, viscerally. not just telling myself. thats a breakthru i guess. i know some time my mind will come back telling it wasn't that bad and i might have one just to ... whatever. shut up, mind! its never just one.

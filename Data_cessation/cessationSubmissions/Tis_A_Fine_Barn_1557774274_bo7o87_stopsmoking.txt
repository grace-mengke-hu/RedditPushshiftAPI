I grilled out this weekend. Grilling is another one of those hidden triggers where I was in the middle of it and realized "Hey, I used to smoke while I was doing this." I didn't have an urge or a craving, just a little reminder that I don't do that anymore. Presenting #127 Pinsir. See you tomorrow.

Oct 31st - great time to start again

I've posted multiple times trying to quit. 

Each time I have caved.

I am trying to get away from it so I have tapered myself down and will quit buying packs and bumming stogs.

Day 1: no cravings yet, need to keep my mindset strong and resist the urge.

Will keep you guys updated with my status

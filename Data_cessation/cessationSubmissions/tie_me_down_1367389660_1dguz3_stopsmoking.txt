Just ate half a block of chocolate in favour of smoking... and I'd love some empathy from fellow quitters

Yes you read my flair right, I'm nearly at 500 days and I still think about smoking sometimes.

Not to depress you new-to-the-quit-game people, I know of a lot of quitters who have come here and left because they just *know* they'll never smoke again and never want to.  That isn't me.  I'm not a non-smoker, I'm an ex-smoker, a smoke-a-holic, however you want to look at it.  Most of the time I don't think about smoking.

Lately, for the last few months, I've been gagging for a cigarette and it seems so peculiar.  My biggest trigger is that chesty, gluggy feeling in the throat, that the "cough" is triggered by.  I stopped having this feeling for so long but the last 2-3 months, its come back, in spite of not smoking.

I really don't understand why this is happening and I suppose I should see my GP about it.  (Especially as she's unaware I've quit! Good ol' not smoking stopping me from getting sick!!)

Any ideas guys?  Do any of you other year + people get proper hard cravings anymore?  I'm sure that if I did smoke I probably wouldn't know what to do, its easy enough not to be tempted, it makes my mouth taste awful for weeks and my lung capacity is compromised for days...

The last 4-5 days have been brutal

Did anyone else experience this?  I have been totally caught off guard by the intense cravings I started gettings.  I thought I was done with them.

Thankfully I have remained nic free.

I think I may read Allen Carr again, just as a refresher.  Maybe it will help reset my mentality again...

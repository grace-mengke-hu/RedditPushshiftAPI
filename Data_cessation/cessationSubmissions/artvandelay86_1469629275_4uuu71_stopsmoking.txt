having a hard time with mental health side effects

I quit smoking two weeks ago and it has been a lot of up and downs, my cravings have improved but I still find myself crying or feeling desperate for little or no reason. I also have been (especially in the evening) trying to replace the "high" or pleasure of smoking with other unhealthy crutches (a couple of beers, a hit of weed). Basically I am feeling depressed at times, on the verge of a panic attack at other times or plainly bored. I am wondering if maybe quitting smoking isn't enough and I should take this opportunity to work on myself and "reprogram" my brain. 
Has anyone felt this way? Any articles to recommend? Thanks!

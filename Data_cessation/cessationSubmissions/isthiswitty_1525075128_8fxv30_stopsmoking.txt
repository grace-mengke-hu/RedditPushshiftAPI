Fucked up

My husband and I are separated and I had been doing alright for the week since I said I was quitting, but he visited for the weekend and he and I had a sort of heart to heart/come to Jesus talk about what it is he needs to do in order for us to have a functional relationship and I broke. 
He left an hour ago and the first thing I did after he was clear was hit up the corner store for a pack. 


Now I have a pack minus two and I know I should just throw the rest away but I donâ€™t want to. I want to continue to destroy myself with them. I want to get closer to death by continuing down the same smokey path I used to. 

I guess I need encouragement to keep with my resolve for today/tomorrow. 

Please help

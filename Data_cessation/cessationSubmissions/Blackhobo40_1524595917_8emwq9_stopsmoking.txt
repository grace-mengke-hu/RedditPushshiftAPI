What to expect from withdrawal

Hi,

I’m currently a 20 year old male who started vaping about three years ago. Not huge nicotine concentration (6g/ml) but I was hitting it a lot. I love the sensation of inhaling and exhaling smoke. 

About 6 months ago I switched to a juul. Bad decision. It’s smaller and easier to use, so I can use it more often, and the nicotine concentration is ridiculous. I think I’m basically smoking a pack or a bit more per day worth of nicotine. 

I’m in college studying biochemistry. Finals end and I go home on May 10th. I will be back in my college town however on May 20th for a research assistant internship where I’ll be studying DNA damage and repair for 10 weeks. 

May 10-May 20 is when I planned to quit. I know I couldn’t do it during school, but I need to do it ASAP because I can’t be working in a lab for 8 hours a day and trying to hit my juul here and there. I don’t want to be a slave to nicotine. Another reason is that I plan to take the MCAT and go to medical school. How could I concentrate on a 7 and a half hour test if I’m addicted to nicotine?

Anyway, there’s the background. I want to know what to expect throughout those ten days. Withdrawal symptoms, what days will be the worst, if I’ll be back to functional by May 20th when I start working. I’m especially afraid of the brain fog since I need to be sharp. I’ve tried quitting before and only lasted a couple days, but damn that brain fog was just scary. It’s like I had to think how to piece words together before I could even get a sentence out. 

Lastly, is there anything I should do during those ten days to make it an easier process? I smoke weed here and there, I was thinking that may help. My mother has a xanax prescription for insomnia, maybe I could take some of those for sleep or if the anxiety gets too bad (don’t worry though, I’ll keep it easy, I’m not trying to acquire a xanax addiction in the process”

Thanks in advance for your comments!!

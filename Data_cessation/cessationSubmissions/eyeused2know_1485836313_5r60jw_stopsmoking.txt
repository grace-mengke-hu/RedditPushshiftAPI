For day 2: please remind me why I doing this.

I had quit for 4 weeks a month ago. A life altering event occurred. I wasn't strong enough to care. Than i ended up staying with indoor smokers. 

Now I'm with nonsmokers decided Monday was quit day. as I would finish the res cigarettes I've vowed not to pay $10+ for one pack when the last carton was $28. 

So now it's been over 24 hours since my last cigarette. I won't have one before bed, as they aren't easy to obtain ATM, I need the money to buy a car and I truly want to be a nonsmoker. 

But what was it that I was able to say to myself last time that made it so easy. Or do
I just have to make it thru Wednesday & the right phrases will start coming back?

Allan Carr is not working for me. Are there any other books out there that are inspiring enough to quit smoking?

What the title says. Also, I know for sure that the right book can help me quit this bad habit. When I read 'It starts with food' I was so convinced that I immediately (successfully!) changed my food pattern.

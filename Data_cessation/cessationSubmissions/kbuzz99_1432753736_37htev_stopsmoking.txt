Withdrawing from the Patch...Expectations?

So I tried (and failed) going cold turkey.  I've never gone more than 24 hours or so when I've attempted quitting.  I've tried cold turkey, Zyban, the patch, etc.  Nothing worked because I wasn't ready.  So I started (again) with the patch 6 weeks ago.  It was a rough start but I didn't smoke once.  Cut to six weeks later and I'm down to the 7mg 24 hour patch (I really only wear patches for about 12-14 hours a day).  The hardest part was early on when I wasn't smoking.  Cutting down patches wasn't too terribly difficult.  But going from the 7mg to nothing is driving me batshit crazy.  

For those of you that quit using the patch, how long do the withdrawal symptoms last?  Considering I was wearing a 7mg 24-hour patch for half the day only, I have to imagine the amount of nicotine I was getting was pretty damn low.  But it's pretty intense.  Thanks for the support!

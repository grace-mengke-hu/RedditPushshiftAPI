Should cigarettes be banned?

In many places smoking in buildings and public spaces is increasingly being restricted; tobacco companies can't advertise through regular methods, though there are still alot of cool outsider characters in movies who smoke, and i'm sure someone's getting paid for making that happen. Buying cigarettes is being made harder with packets removed from view in shops. Smoking is slowly being regulated out of existence and it's a good thing too in my view. 

Even smokers hate cigarettes, I know I did. At what point do we just start outright banning them? I generally don't agree with prohibition no maybe not criminalisation of smokers just a ban on retailing them. 

For anyone who still can't take the hint that smoking is killing them I'm sure we could have prescriptions from doctors or something. 

Should we just ban the sale of cigarettes?

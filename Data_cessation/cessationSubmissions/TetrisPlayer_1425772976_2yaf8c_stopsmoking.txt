When can I label myself as someone who "quit smoking"?

My last cigarette (actually half of one) was on February 17 2015. I started smoking in 2009 when I was 14. I feel like a fraud when I tell my friends (who have or still do smoke) that I quit smoking. So, when can I officially say that I quit smoking?

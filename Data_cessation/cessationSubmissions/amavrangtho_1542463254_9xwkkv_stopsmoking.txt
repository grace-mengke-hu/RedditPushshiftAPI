Here’s to hoping!

I’ve become one of those on/off smokers. I quit for a couple months but always end up smoking again. I’ve been thinking about not vaping/smoking for a while now. A couple weeks ago I came down with the flu and it settled in my chest. I’m feeling much better now but had to go a couple days without smoking because it was so painful to inhale the smoke. I saw it as an opportunity. I slept through the worst part of the nicotine fits when I was sick. Now it’s the habit I’m fighting. So far so good though! I live in a house full of smokers and still haven’t broke. I must say it’s nice not worrying about how many cigs I have or how much E-juice I have left. It’s actually motivated me to keep bettering myself. After a month passes of me being smoke free I’m going to taper off caffeine (which is going to be super hard). One vice at a time lol.

Tomorrow is 11 weeks clean.

I never thought I would be able to say that. It's been a rough ride, and most likely will continue to be that way, but I'm okay with that. I've been black out drunk, I've taken LSD, I've survived work, and I've been on road trips. All the things that drove me to smoke no longer hold any power over me. I still want to smoke all the time..... Don't get me wrong. But I know I'm better than that and no longer need it in my life. Every day is a victory and I like that, so thank you /r/stopsmoking you stay awesome.

86 days without smoking, 1 day without nicotine.

I am a mess.  I'm shaking.  Trying not to yell at everybody.  I wish I could find a panic room and get inside for a couple weeks.

But.. not having smoked a cigarette for so long has built up quite a momentum.  And I am able to see this as quitting my Nicotine addiction, vs. quitting my cigarette addiction.
This seems to be valuable.

I need to get this off my chest.

Ok I'm sorry if this is seen as spam but I feel this is the only place I can post. 

I know I'm not the only person who has suffered this but my God I'm finding it tough! I've tried every avenue out there to quit smoking and it's just not working :/ 

Every time I have a cigarette I resent it. I'm terrified of what it's doing to me but I think that fear is what's preventing me from stopping! 

Here's to hoping that at some point I will be off the cigarettes because I want it so bad but I just don't have the strength right now it seems. 

Once again sorry if this is an inappropriate place but I feel I need to say this somewhere!

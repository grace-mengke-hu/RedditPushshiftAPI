Day 11

Cravings are for the most part just passing thoughts,  I had 1 bad craving today but was able to tell it to shut up... if that makes sense.... I went out with my SO for drinks,  no triggers this time,  he quit smoking with me and told me that he doesnt think about it as much as I do,  well I guess I'm obsessed with it because I feel I need to be... hes the type of smoker who can smoke 1 or 2 a day and be fine,  he can take it or leave it, which drives me insane because I can not be like that.  I cant get him to understand how this is for me... I just told him, dont judge, just be glad that I quit.... which he is.  Anyone else have a spouse that doesnt understand what u r going through?  What do u tell them?

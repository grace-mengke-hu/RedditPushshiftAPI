72 Hour Mark!!

Hey everyone. What a great community here thank you everyone for the awesome motivational stuff spread throughout.

12 years a smoker, recently turned 31.

I was smoking around 10 to 12 a day, way more in weekends. This year spending about $80NZD a week to keep up my habit. Im feeling really good. Eating healthy snacks, going for a big walk the last 3 nights. Gonna treat myself to a new guitar amp after a month from some of the savings. So excited!

My mantra has been "1 Day at a time" and it's really working!!

Anyway.. that's my spiel.

Good luck everyone and kia kaha!! (Maori for stay strong)

Day One

Decided to quit again today. I've quit twice before, and lasted about nine months each time. Both times I made the mistake of thinking I could occasionally smoke while drinking. I know better now, plus I don't really drink much anymore. Anyway, just thought I'd post as another way to keep me accountable. I'm going to bed in less than an hour, and I'm feeling fine. I know tomorrow isn't going to be so easy.

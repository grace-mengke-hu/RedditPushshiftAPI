This Friday is 4 weeks.

It feels good knowing I've made it this far. I still have urges, which just makes me really irritable. Yet I have less anxiety. A big reason for quitting was I felt socially guilty. People don't want to be around it, and especially at work get annoyed from smoke breaks. Overall I do feel better about life, I look healthier. Also you start to care about being active rather than sitting around with a cig. It really changes how you see other folks who smoke. Watching them smoke starts to feel like you are in two different worlds, because you question why anyone in this day of age would continue to smoke. 

  For people who struggle with depression or apathy. It does get better the longer you don't smoke. Urges will find any bad memory or feeling to make you think that you want it. This is all temporary. After the first few days you start feeling more motivation from actually having energy.

How long did the irritability last for you?

I consider myself a very chill and friendly guy, but whenever i stop using nicotine i just become kind of an asshole sometimes, and that makes me coming back, expecially when being friendly is needed (social occasions).

If you can relate, how long did it last?

Also, how long until you stopped craving nicotine?

i'm gonna buy a new mod and try vaping 0 nicotine to take the edge off, thanks for the attention ðŸŒž

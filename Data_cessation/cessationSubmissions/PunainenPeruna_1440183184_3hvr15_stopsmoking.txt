Day 11 : hospital

Okay . I'm really down at the moment . Have not smoked but it is all I can think of . 
I will spend some time at the hospital because I'm kinda depressed to the point I can't stand it anymore so this is kinda new for me to not sleep in my own bed.
The situation is not that good at home and that is me sugarcoating it . 

I really would love a smoke right now but I'm kinda sure it won't help me at all .. What should I do ?

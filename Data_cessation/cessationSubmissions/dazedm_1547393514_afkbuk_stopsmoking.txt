Hit day 105 of no real cigarettes

According to my quit app its been 105 days since a real cigarette i am just wondering what type of thing have happened to your body like should my lungs be good and no coughing ect i keep getting sick as hell and im wondering if its just still getting rid of all the gunk i was smoking at least a pack a week usually at certain points probably a pack a day or every 2 days in college

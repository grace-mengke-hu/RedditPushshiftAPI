This sucks.

These patches are itchy and I would love a cigarette, but shit's going to be so cash when I can use all this cash I'm saving for my wedding!


This is my first time trying to quit, I've spoken with my physician and gotten my prescription for patches filled. I'd love some pointers from the pros about cravings after eating, it's been the worst part for me.


I'm so excited, this is going to be great and I'm so glad I'm not going to have to go outside anymore because it's cold as fuck. I hope everyone is having a good day!

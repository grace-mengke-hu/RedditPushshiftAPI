Goals

Hey Quitters!
It seems like all I can think about is the quitting process and how its hard and how i'll probably always miss smoking...
UGH ENOUGH. 
Here are some things I look forward to in my new smoke-free life:
1. $$$$$
2. Free time, no ball and chain
3. Tasty fooood
4. Not stinking to high heavens
5. Hoping my singing will improve, more range maybe!
6. Better time management at work
7. Feeling good
8. Better skin!
9. Not aging more rapidly than I should be

Can I get a number 10?? Keep the list going! :)

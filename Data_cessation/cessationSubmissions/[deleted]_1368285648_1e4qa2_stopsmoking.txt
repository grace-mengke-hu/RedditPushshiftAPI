The stories of people starting again after years have gotten me kinda down. Is it really going to be a struggle for years to come?

So it's been 8 days since I had a cigarette and I'm feeling pretty good. I'm working out and eating healthy and feeling great all around. I'll occasionally get an urge for a cigarette but it's not intense and I can talk myself out of it without much issue. I'm assuming that, over time, the intensity and desire for a cigarette will go away. However, seeing this subreddit and reading about people who have started again after YEARS just seems crazy to me. Is it really going to be a struggle every single day for the rest of my life or something? Or will this eventually get easier?

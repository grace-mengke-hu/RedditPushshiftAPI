Mostly for my own reference, but encouragement welcome

I picked it up at 19 from a college boyfriend. I'm almost 41. Always been sort of a "secret smoker," and certainly so in the last fifteen years. I've quit on and off - for the whole year I tried and then was pregnant, a few months here and there - and I think my average was about 5 - 7 per day. 

My best friend died of a congenital lung ailment, and she never understood why I smoked. That didn't stop me. My uncle died of an ugly cancer after a near lifetime of smoking. That didn't stop me. Another uncle - the same ugly type of cancer, too. Now, both of my parents. My mom? The ugly type. 

My husband threatened that if I didn't stop, he'd make me write a letter explaining myself to our young child. 

I have a stressful job - well, the people who run the place make it so, and that's often why I'm unsuccessful at giving it up. A few days ago I decided that I wasn't going to let them dictate the terms of my life anymore. So this is part of that. 

I'm also sick right now, so I'm feeling really low. The last two times I've tried to quit, I have instantly gotten sick with a nasty cold.

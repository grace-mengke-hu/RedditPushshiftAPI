Ran 3 miles today

Stopped buying packs a few months ago, and I've drastically reduced my smoking (a pack a week, to the very occasional social smoke when out drinking). Today, I went to gym like I usually do and started running on the treadmill. Usually I quit before I hit a mile and a half, but today something just clicked and I ran for 3+ miles. First time in my life that I'm able to do that. I'm proud.

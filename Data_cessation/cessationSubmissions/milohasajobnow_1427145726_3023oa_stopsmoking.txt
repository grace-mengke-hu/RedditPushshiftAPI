Tell me the most disgusting, frightening fact you know about smoking that makes me want to immediately stop.

I'm on the right track, reduced smoking by more than 70% and since a few weeks, I actually manage it to not smoke a single cigarette on some days. 

Main reason for that is my new girlfriend who is a non smoker, and though she didn't ask me to stop I want to because I know she would prefer it. 

So I'm on my way, and I want to know the most disgusting, frightening fact about smoking. Whether it's in text or pictures, I don't care.

Today, I haven't smoked a single cigarette yet. And it's already 10:30 PM here.

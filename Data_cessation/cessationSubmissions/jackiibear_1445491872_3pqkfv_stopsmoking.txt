It takes 21 days to kick a habit...

I got this!! I was tested big time this week... Bad breakup, forced to move out, no job, no money... I've been an emotional mess... But I managed to keep it together and I didn't smoke!!!!! I feel so proud of myself. Thank you to everyone who participates in the subreddit. You guys are life savers. Not another puff no matter what!

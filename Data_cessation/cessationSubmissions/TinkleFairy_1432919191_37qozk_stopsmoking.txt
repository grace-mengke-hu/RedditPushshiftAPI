3 years ago today :)

It's been 3 years ago today since I quit cold turkey. I had my last cigarette with my cup of coffee in the morning and then vowed to never buy another pack. It's also been 3 years today since I took up running to replace smoking. I'd post a picture of how great my legs look now, but it seems kind of gratuitous.

I owe a lot to this subreddit. A huge thank you to this community for years of advice, support, love and for being one of the more positive subs on reddit in general. You guys are all awesome.

If you're just starting out on your smoke-free journey, know that I was exactly where you once were. I know that big milestone announcements on this sub might seem unrealistic to you right now, but it's possible to get here. It's not out of reach. You can do it. Any day that you don't smoke is a good day!

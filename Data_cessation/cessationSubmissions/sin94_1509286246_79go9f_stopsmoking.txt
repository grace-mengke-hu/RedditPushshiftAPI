90 days, who hoo! Never thought 'easy way' was so easy....what was your moment of revelation?

Remember badgebot last time I checked I added and removed that sucker 2 times (5 years ago) once doing cut down method and other trying the patch. 

3rd time the charm this time as per advice / recommendation of Allen Char book "Easy way to stop smoking" and tremendous help from this group. 

I never felt any pangs of leaving cigarettes on the 31st July 2017 (quit date) and not missed one damn thing. 

Question for community, what was your moment of revelation?

For me was when I reached the chapter of when Allen mentioned the cigarette was poison was the moment of revelation for me after that it was more mediocre reading and I had already decided I was going to quit. In fact kept postponing the date with the excuse of needing to complete the book. 

For those who kept starting and stopping (even if reading the book) keep reading for me the combination of reading and the audiobook finally did it for me and I quit forever!!!

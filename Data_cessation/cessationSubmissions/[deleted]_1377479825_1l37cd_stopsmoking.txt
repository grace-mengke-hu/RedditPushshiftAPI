Patch question

My SO is trying to quit smoking. I bought him the generic patches. they work great for him, but the only problem is they will only stick for a couple hours. Any advise on getting them to stay on all day? I read that name brand patches stick better, I will probably spend more on those once these are gone. Any tips would be great!

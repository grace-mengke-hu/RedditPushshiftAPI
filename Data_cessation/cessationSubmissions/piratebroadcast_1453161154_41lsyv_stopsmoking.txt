How do I get past the first few hours of day 1?

I bought a vaporizer thing and everything, but every single day when I plan to quit I see someone on the sidewalk waiting for a bus or something and ask them for a smoke. I want tomorrow to be successful day 1. Any tips? I read EasyWay but it didn't quite stick.

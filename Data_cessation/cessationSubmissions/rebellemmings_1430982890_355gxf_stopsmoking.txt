day 5 and struggling...

Had my last smoke last Saturday and went cold turkey after that. have to tried to quit so many times I've lost count and various methods. this time though, I just had enough of it, the smell, the money, the dependency. 
I think I have had every single withdrawal symptom that is possible to have and that has always been my failing. this time though I will not be defeated. I have had heartburn, problems sleeping, even had a rash on day 3! problems focusing, jumpiness and then yesterday was all of a sudden calm. no bother, nothing... and today the cravings are back!

Let's do it.

Been here before.  Thought I needed smoking to cope with every day issues.  Excercise really showed me how much I'm fuckn up my lungs, yesterday it felt like I got stabbed in the chest.  Terrible experience.
Anyway, former heavy drinker (in recovery for life), should've given up smoking while in rehab but I convinced myself that I needed it to cope.  It did help tho, I guess. 
2 months clean.  Today it's cigarettes turn.
I DON'T KNOW WTF I'm doing, I just know it HAS to go.

Taking the damn trash out. 
Cleaning up. 
Fuck drugs. ✌️

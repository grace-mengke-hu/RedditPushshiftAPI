One Year Anniversary

Today is the one year anniversary of me officially being a non-smoker!  I can honestly say that I'm much happier and obviously healthier.  Although I have gained a little weight this year, I still feel better than i have in years.  

For anyone wondering, I used Chantix.  It helped tremendously, but I had some seriously wicked and realistic dreams.  Sometimes I think I didn't light up again because I didn't want to go through that again, haha.  

The other thing is that, this time, I really and truly wanted to quit.  I was sick and tired of being controlled by a pack of smokes.  

Anyway, if you're thinking about quitting or you quit but thinking about lighting up, please know that you are stronger than the addiction, you CAN beat it.

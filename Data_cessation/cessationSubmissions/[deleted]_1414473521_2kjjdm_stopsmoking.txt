Ran my first 5k today..

and I never would've been able to do it if I hadn't quit smoking. It's been about 2 and a half months cigarette free and it feels great. My life is different and the same in all the right ways. I used to feel like cigarettes were a part of my identity, which made me reluctant to give them up. I hardly even think of smoking these days. Life is more enjoyable without them :) I guess it's time to start training for a 10k!

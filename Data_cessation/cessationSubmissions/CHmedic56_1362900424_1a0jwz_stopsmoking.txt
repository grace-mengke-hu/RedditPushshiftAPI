It has been 68 days today since i have smoked a cigarette. ( I've also lost 35 pounds)

I decided New Years Day I didn't want to smoke anymore. Just didn't buy a pack that day or any day since. I decided that seeing as I was 302 lbs, I would try to make a conscious effort to not gain weight from quitting. I started smoking when i was 15 and for the past 7 years I had been a pack a day smoker. I have psoriasis that has improved drastically, my teeth have gotten so much whiter and most importantly I feel better. If I can do it so can you! You have to believe you can accomplish anything you put your mind to.

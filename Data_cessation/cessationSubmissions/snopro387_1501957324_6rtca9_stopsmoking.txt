How to deal with drinking?

I've been trying to quit smoking for 3 weeks now. In that time I've only smoked two cigarettes. Both 1 week apart and both times I was drinking. It gets a lot harder to say no once I've had a few drinks. Is there anything that people have found helpful for staying away from cigarettes when they drink? It doesn't help that a lot of my friends smoke so I have people that will give me one when I'm drinking. Even if I tell them not to I can usually find someone to give me one.

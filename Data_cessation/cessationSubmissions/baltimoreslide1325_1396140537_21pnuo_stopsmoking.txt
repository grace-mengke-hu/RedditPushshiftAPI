All the lame things cigarettes did to me. Feel free to add your own.

I'm re-quitting today after messing up about once per 24 h over the last few days since I decided to quit. In these tender moments before withdrawal begins again, I thought I'd list some nasty shit that smoking caused for me. In two days the withdrawal will have forced me to forget this, and maybe someone else is going through that, too, so here goes. For the record, I'm 28, female, exercise, eat super healthy, smoked American Spirits and didn't even smoke that much:  


- My hands and feet are always cold.  
- I lose circulation in my hands and legs all the time, and have sore hands, which extra sucks because I play musical instruments  
- I'm a singer and lost a ton of my range; my voice is unreliable; I get sinus infections that put me out for weeks or months at a time  
- Weird jaw/eustachian tube issues  
- Chest pain, heart palpitations  
- Lower endurance in exercise, trouble breathing  
- That "out of it" feeling when you've topped out on caffeine and cigarettes (that were supposed to help you concentrate) and now you can't do anything and feel like shit  
- Cigarette hangovers, lasting entire days, from smoking while drinking  
- Clogged nose for the last 4 months, unable to breathe easily through nose at night  
- Probably not even realizing how tired I feel.  
- I remember that I actually concentrated BETTER on reading, etc. BEFORE I was a smoker because I never had to take breaks.   


I used to tell myself that smoking wasn't really affecting my health ("so-and-so smoked for 900 years and lived a healthy, long life! It's all b.s.!") but it's clear that this is NOT the case and I thought I'd document that before I willfully forget it under the influence of drug withdrawal.



Day one, again. Bring it the f--- on, I'm tired of feeling like crap.

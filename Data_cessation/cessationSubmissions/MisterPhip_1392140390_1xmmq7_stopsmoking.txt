The beginning of a success story

I wanted to share a small personal victory. 

My last cigarette was last Wednesday (6 days ago). Up until that date I was a smoker for 20 years and was smoking at least a pack a day. I have had a terrible time quitting in the past. I tried patches, gum, cold-turkey, you name it. Nothing worked for me, or even came close.

I looked into the idea of a vaporizer with nicotine liquid. I made the initial investment of around $25 for a vape and some juice. I started using the device last Wednesday with little to no expectation of success. As a matter of fact, I kept my last half pack of smokes in my car for the inevitable backslide. That last half pack was my safety net. I knew they were there for when I would need them, and I really thought a time would come very soon that I would.

Today I remembered that last half pack on my way to work. Today I grabbed that last half-pack, closed my fist around it as tight as I could, and threw it in the garbage can outside my office. It felt so good, so liberating. I did not throw it away for fear of temptation, I threw it away because I know, I *know* that I don't need a safety net anymore. This marks the first time in my life I chucked perfectly good, perfectly smoke-able cigarettes in the trash without a second thought.

Thank you /r/stopsmoking for the inspiration. Thank you /r/electronic_cigarette for the idea and the candid information. I've found a plan to become smoke free and I'm on my way. This is the beginning of my success story.

I want a cigarette but I don't want a cigarette.

After a month of not smoking, I decided I wanted to try a cigarette to see if I still enjoyed it. The great feeling of lighting the end up and inhaling was wonderful but the taste...oh my gosh...was horrific. It almost made me sick and gave me a headache for the rest of the day. Since that day I truly knew I wasn't going to smoke again but there is something inside me just wanting the comfort it gave me. I am vaping and I've enjoyed it for a bit but I'm not enjoying it like I did a cigarette. Those stressful times at work, whew what I would do to step out and smoke to relax. I don't do it though. That taste still haunts me and the smell on people is really disgusting. I know cigarettes and I will never be friends again but I miss the company.

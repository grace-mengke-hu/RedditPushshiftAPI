3 weeks doesn't impress when you've quit 100+ times

   In the past I've hidden how much I smoke from my wife. Now that I've quit and haven't had so much as one puff in three weeks, I decided to tell her last night. She wasn't very impressed. I think it's a combination of her not realizing I had started (again) a couple months ago, and because I've gone much longer than three weeks without a cigarette in the last year. 
   Anyhow, she's out of town this weekend and I'm at the neighborhood bar having a couple beers and zero cigarettes. Feels good to be a nonsmoker! I know this time I'm going to stick with it and eventually blow her away when I tell her I haven't had a puff in 6 months, a year, three years, etc. 
   So thankful to have this forum to post and give and receive support!

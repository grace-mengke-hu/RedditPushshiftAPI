Almost.. But let me know what you guys think?

After 10-11 years of smoking I decided to quit 27 days ago I began using the patch and I watched the Allen Carr video on YouTube. It was really helping out until I would go a day without using the patch, either I forgot to or I needed to go to the store to buy more. I decided to stop using the patch after the third week. I was doing fine until now. I couldn't take the stress I was balling my fists and screaming because i was so stressed that I needed a cigarette but I didn't want to give up. So i decided to get an e-cig to calm my nerves. I just bought it an I took a few puffs. It is helping somewhat but I wanted to know your guys option on it. Did I relapse? Or is this just a bother method I can use to quit. I don't want to go back to smoking cigarettes but I don't know how to handle this stress sometimes. I've been very active on this sub since I quit and I appreciate everyone here. But it's really hard for me right now. I had a dream I smoked the other night too and it scared the shit out of me. In my dream I was already thinking of excuses to tell everyone why and I tried to convince myself that it was ok. Luckily it was just a dream and I woke up happy knowing that I didn't smoke. I really want to quit but I feel hopeless sometimes. So is it ok that I smoked an e-cig? How many of you are using one to quit? And how many of you have gone back to smoking after trying to quit with an e-cig? Thanks everyone for your support and I appreciate each and everyone of your opinions.

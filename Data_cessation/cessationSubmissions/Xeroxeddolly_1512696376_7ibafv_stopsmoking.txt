I'm vaping and I feel like a cheater

The good thing is I quit smoking cigs 3 days ago.  The bad thing is, I'm still a slave to nicotine.  I feel like a fraud, especially with people on here going beast mode cod turkey no nicotine replacement (mad mad props).  Be honest in your opinion, am I "cheating" here? Allen Carr's book makes me feel like it. Especially because the reason I wanted to quit was to not be a slave among other things.

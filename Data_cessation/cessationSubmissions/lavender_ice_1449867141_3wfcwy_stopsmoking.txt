What about the people around you? Just a concerned bf trying to support his gf.

When I met my girlfriend she had been on and off trying to quit smoking for years.  Almost everyone around her smoked at that time and when we met I told her I didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who smokes but I wanted to support her in her journey quitting.

A year and a month later today we have had some really bad arguments that only happen when we go out drinking.  I'm very against it, she wants to, alcohol infused emotions, and BAM!  awful stuff gets said, people are hurt and etc.

She says routinely that she needs to quit for herself or otherwise it won't work as well or something.  We just had another conversation today because she's trying these Snus things to take off the edge.  Uses them every weekish.

She doesn't want to hide anything from me and I don't want to be controlling but she tells me I freak out on her over this.  I promise I'm not trying to be an ass or stroke my ego but it is definitely not a one sided issue.

My question is what about the people around her?  I want to support her but we have had some really really really shitty nights over this stuff.  I just don't feel like she's considering how treats people around her.

Am I being selfish/controlling?   Should I back off?

This ain't easy

Today has truly been the hardest day of my life.
I'm so reactive and then I feel so guilty about it.
I realized today that for the last 15 years, every time i've needed to calm down I have had a cigarette. I actually have no concept of calming down without a cigarette.
Time to retrain not only my mind but my body, too.
Hope you are all doing well! Any tips are MORE than welcome.

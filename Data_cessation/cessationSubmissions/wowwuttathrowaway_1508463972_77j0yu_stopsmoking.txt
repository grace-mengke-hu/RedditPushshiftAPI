Question for Female Ex-Smokers

Hormone imbalances. Smoking causes hormone imbalances. Of course it does! I had never thought about it until I was (embarrassingly) struck with the idea to google "female smokers dark hair on face." Apparently smoking also causes fat accumulation on the stomach, spider veins on the face, decreased sensitivity during sex (nipples AND genitals), uneven/oily skin, acne, increased body hair growth, etc. All of which I am dealing with (note the throwaway username).

I am in my late 20's and smoke a pack a day, though I think about quitting **constantly**. After googling the above phrase I noticed that a lot of changes that are hitting my body now could maybe be attributable, at least partially, to my smoking. Other than my addiction, I lead a fairly healthy lifestyle - which I do realize is a lot like saying "Other than the black clouds covering the sky and the obviously impending tornado, it's pretty sunny out."

I know this is incredibly superficial, but I want all the motivation I can get so I have to ask:

Dear Amazing Super-Heroine Ex-Smokers of Reddit, have you noticed any issues akin to the above list clear up since quitting smoking? Did anything get worse? Please tell me your stories.

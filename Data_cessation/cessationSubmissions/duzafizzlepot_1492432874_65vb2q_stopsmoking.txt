Trying to locate an Allan Carr book

I'm trying to find a small pocket sized Allan Carr book on quitting. It was a massive help for me to stop for 2 years once, but I loaned it to a friend and never got it back. 

It's a small square book about 1/2 inch thick, no wider than a regular paperback, but definitely square. One of the reasons it worked for me is that it was small enough to take anywhere and dip into anytime. I've been unable to locate it online. Does anyone have a copy they don't need that I could purchase, or know where I could buy a new one?

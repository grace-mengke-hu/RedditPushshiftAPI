Thoughts a little more than three months in

I'm a little over three months into my second attempt at quitting and I've been reading some things here so I thought I would share some thoughts.

**Dreams:** They were super vivid as I was first quitting and now I still sometimes get these vivid dreams where I start smoking again. Usually it's accompanied by strong feelings of guilt, but some relief as well. 

**Depression &amp; Anxiety:** Believe it or not I didn't have my first ever cigarette until I was 31 years old. I didn't make it a habit until a year later, but what a habit it became. I've previously been diagnosed with depression and I hate to say it, but smoking helped keep a lot of the symptoms at bay. This most recent experience quitting found me with lots of anxiety. I racked up three safety points at work in three months and one more will come with some consequences (no one got hurt and nothing got broken, but safety points were levied regardless). I probably should get in touch with our Employee Assistance Professional to see about some sort of support.

**Previous Relapse:** The last time I tried quitting I made it four months. The first cigarette I tried was stupid. No one offered it to me and it wasn't just laying around. I made a dedicated trip to a gas station and bought a pack. That first one was *awful*. Yet it offered enough of that chemical addiction to get me to try smokes two, three, and four. This time around I don't have cravings too bad, or at least not at this three month point. However, there is still this memory of those deep moments of introspection and smoking alone at home. It 's a meditative ritual that I miss. I haven't found anything that quite replaces it. I thought maybe I'd take up drinking tea. Turns out I don't like tea. Also it takes way longer to boil water than light a cigarette.   

**Increased Drinking:** I've never had a problem with alcohol and before quitting smoking I would get buzzed maybe once every three months. After this most recent attempt I got appreciably drunk six Saturdays in a row. I wasn't drinking during the week or anything, but it was noticeably how much I was chasing some kind of feeling. Since then I have curbed the alcohol intake, but wow, that was not something I was expecting.

**Quitting for the wrong reasons:** Last time I felt I quite for the right reasons: I quit because I wanted to quit. This time around two of my cousins kind of guilted me into it. It's great that I'm saving money and I even joined a gym, but I don't feel like I did it for me and I worry that it's going to be too easy to start again just because I want to.

I don't have kids, I don't have a significant other. My mother is 54, never had a bad habit in her life, and has brain cancer. I hate my job. I'm fairly dissatisfied with every aspect of my life save for the fact that I have a roof over my head and I don't have to worry about where my next meal is coming from. And given all that I often wonder why I shouldn't smoke if it helps take the sting out of life a little bit. And I don't know how to make myself stop thinking that way, but I worry if I don't it will lead to another relapse. All I can say for sure is that I didn't smoke yesterday, I'm not going to smoke today, and I'm not going to smoke tomorrow.

Serious lack of motivation

Okay so I'm having a breakdown. I was doing so well I'm on day 13 and the patches had been keeping intense cravings at bay, I was confident l was this new non smoker and would never smoke again. Today is my first day without a patch and its been horrible I have to wait until after lunch tomorrow until I will have a new box of patches (because I get them for free in work) I could buy some but the only thing stopping me is that I'm seriously poor right now and all my money will go on this packet of patches that I buy if I can't wait until tomorrow. My confidence has been knocked by today I want a smoke so badly!!! Things that I focused on previously to help me quit like my health, the fact that I can breathe, how dizzy i would feel or how sore my chest would be to smoke now after nearly two weeks; they don't scare me anymore I just want a fucking cigarette. 
I'm also going to a wedding next week with friends who are smokers and my gut told me that I wouldn't smoke I believed myself when I said I would stay strong, get drunk and still resist but now I feel like my gut is telling me just wait until the wedding and you can smoke then wtf?! my brain has done a total 360 without giving me any warning and I'm freaked. Sorry if this is all nonsense or seems so moany I just needed to get all of this off my chest ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤

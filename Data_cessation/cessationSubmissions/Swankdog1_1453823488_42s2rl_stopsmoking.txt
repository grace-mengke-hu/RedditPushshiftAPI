Today is day 9

Fuck smoking.

It's very interesting - smoking...I never worried so much can about the health issues, the crazy expense, the awful smell, the association with the other idiots that smoke...and a ton more...none of that shit ever bothered me so much.

It was not having control.  I was not in control of me.

Now I am.

Fuck smoking.

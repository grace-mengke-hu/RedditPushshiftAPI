Keeping a pack/not throwing cigarettes out when quitting?

Does anyone think this is a better way to do it? 

Throwing away your pack when quitting makes things easier for me and I go through a few days of not smoking. 

The problem is that when I go out in the company of a smoker, it's very easy to borrow a cig, or buy a pack from the nearby shop and I am back to smoking again. Almost every week now, I throw away a pack, go through 2-3 days of not smoking, then buy a pack when I go out the weekends.

The idea is that if you have a pack BUT don't smoke it, you have consciously decided to not take that cigarette and light it, which would make it easier to 'resist' when you can easily borrow a cig or buy a pack.

Any thoughts? 

In other words, you'd be making things much harder the first few days, but much easier long-term.

Instead of "I'm not going to buy a pack", you'd be thinking "I won't smoke", which would keep things more 'real'.

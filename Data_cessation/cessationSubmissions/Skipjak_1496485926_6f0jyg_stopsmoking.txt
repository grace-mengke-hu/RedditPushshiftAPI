GF broke up with me in first week of quit

So I'm into my first week of quitting and this quit (my second one) is going alot smoother than the first one. Very little withdrawal, generally only 2 craving episodes a day.

Now, my girlfriend of over a year broke up with me this morning. We were planning to move in together. I'm a bit shook up, but nothing I can't handle. We loved each other, but in all honesty weren't totally compatible.

This is causing some stress, obviously. I am using this post to promise to myself not to try and cope with that stress through smoking. I am now a non-smoker. Smoking will only make me more sad. Instead, I'll cope through excercise and medition. I AM A NON-SMOKER!

Good luck to all of you, especially those of you going through a rough patch like me. Remember that relapsing will only make you feel worse! Embrace your new lifestyle! Run, swim, lift, meditate, drink tea, just don't smoke!

Going CRAZY

So I'm almost through my 3rd week, but I have to say this week has by far been the hardest.  It hasn't been wanting to smoke, but emotionally I've been a wreck. Anxious, low energy, overwhelmed to almost the point of tears... I know some of it is my job (which has always been stressful), but I don't feel like I'm coping well.

TL;DR - Emotional wreck, wondering if this is common in the 3rd week, or if it's just life right now.

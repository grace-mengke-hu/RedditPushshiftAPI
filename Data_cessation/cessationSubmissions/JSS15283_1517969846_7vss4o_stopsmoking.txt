3 d 11 h... Is this the worst it gets?

Last cigarette was 3 days, 11 hours ago. Got down to 3-4 a day on Wellbutrin for about 2 months, reading Allen Carr got me down to zero. I was doing ok, a little uncomfortable but not bad, but now feel like I'm getting every withdrawal symptom at once. Nausea, coughing like crazy, headaches, can't focus, somehow both jittery and so tired I can barely stand up.

Most of what I read suggested that the worst was in the first 3 days because after that the nicotine has cleared out. Being unprepared for how I'm feeling right now has me ready to go buy a pack, which I actually don't want to do. I honestly don't want to smoke, I'm just not sure that my desire to not smoke is stronger than my desire to not feel like this.

Is this the worst it gets, or should I be prepared for this to get worse before it gets better? I just need to know what to expect, I don't know if I can make it through another unpleasant surprise.

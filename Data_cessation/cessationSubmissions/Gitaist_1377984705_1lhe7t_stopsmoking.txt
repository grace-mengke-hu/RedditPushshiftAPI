20/m, just caved, feel terrible

I am 20/m and I hadn't smoked a cigarette for over 40 hours straight. I had given 3/4 of a pack to a friend when I decided to quit. My reasons for quitting were: money, my mom wants me to quit, my little sister just found out that I smoke and said "Have fun dying", a friend of mine's mother almost just lost a second leg to cigarettes causing blood clots, and my girlfriend with bipolar disorder has been cigarette free for 3 months now. I felt like I could do it, but I could not.

I called my girlfriend, 30 minutes before I had to go to work, sweating profusely and crying, thinking that I might kill myself, and told her all of this. She told me to make the best decision for me, and I did - I bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked 2. Now I feel a lot more emotionally level. I feel like I'm disappointing her, but this is something that I needed to do or else it I might have literally died. I have mental issues of my own, this is something I feel like I should do under my psychiatrist's supervision, not gung-ho cold turkey on my own. 

What advice do you all have? She just wants to "change the subject", I scared her to death. As far as my own emotions: I don't want to smoke, it costs me too much money and I consider it a sin, but I can't live without it right now. I feel like I will disappoint a lot of people who were rooting for me to quit, but it's not worth what I felt personally for their approval right now. I feel like a mess, but there are certainly worse things than cigarettes.

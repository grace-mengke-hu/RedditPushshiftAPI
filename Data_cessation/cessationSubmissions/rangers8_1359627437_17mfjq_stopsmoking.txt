Day 1... Nervous

Hi Reddit... Today is the day. I'm going to attempt quitting for the first time in 9 years today. I usually smoke about a pack a day, but I've had it with constantly feeling run down and from this disgusting habit. I have a first date coming up with a girl I've known for quite a while- it would be nice to show up as a non-smoker. To be able to have dinner without awkwardly lighting up before and after.

I bought some nicotine gum to tide me over for a few days before going cold turkey. Has anyone tried that strategy? I live with a smoker, so I will be reminded of it constantly. Any advice/suggestions would be most welcome.

I'm scared that too many changes will bee too much to bare. I want to stop smoking in 3 days.

I'm a sad 25 year old "adult" and I 've been smoking for 8 years now. I have a lot of bad habits, sleep trouble and have gained a significant amount of weight. I know what changes I SHOULD do, but I just can't do them for more than two or three days.

I want to stop smoking. I want to feel better. But I'm scared of failing. I've failed before and I've only thought of me as a bigger loser since failing time and time again. 

Between this and losing weight, money problems, being alone, I'm trying to be a grown up about it and do what's best for me. But it's really hard you guys.

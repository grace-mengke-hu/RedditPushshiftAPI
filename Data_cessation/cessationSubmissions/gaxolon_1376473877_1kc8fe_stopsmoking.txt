Trying to quit smoking cigarettes when I smoke weed everyday also...

First time posting on /r/stopsmoking after lurking for a couple of weeks. 

I seem to be stuck in this constant circle of wanting to quit smoking cigarettes however I feel that whilst I'm still smoking weed I won't notice or gain from any of the health benefits which would usually occur after quitting smoking i.e Breathe easier, no longer wheezy etc etc... but this seems to be the only thing deterring me from taking the step to being smoke free! 

Obviously the sensible way to approach this which I am well aware of is to drop the weed as well - something in which I have considered over the last few months and definitely not something I am against - however I guess I am posting this to see if anyone has faced the same predicament and how they approached resolving this issue or any advice anyone may have on how to do so?

I look forward to hearing the communities opinion on this.

Edit** 
On a side note, something I didn't mention which would probably worth knowing is I'm from the UK so we roll weed with tobacco. So if I'm still smoking weed I'm still smoking tobacco...

Edit 2: 
Thank's for everyone that has posted so far, it's been good to hear other people's opinion and I am really open to all suggestions. Thanks again.

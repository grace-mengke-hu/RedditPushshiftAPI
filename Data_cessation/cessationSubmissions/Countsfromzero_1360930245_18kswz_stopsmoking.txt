I struggle with breaks at work

Every time I finish a chunk of work, I reward myself by going outside for a smoke. This tends to be around every 2 hours or so, sometimes 1 sometimes 4, but generally. This is where I've failed in previous attempts, I truly don't know how to take a break. I'm pretty solid through the rest of the day, but I just can't get past this. Thoughts, ideas, or experiences?

I hope I can quit for last time, starting today. Any advice ?

I use to dip tobacco while I was in the army for about 1.5 years. I quit for about 2 years once I got out and started to focus on working out. Last year I hurt my back in the gym and fell into a deep depression. After a bad break up I started smoking off and on for the last 11 months. I smoked 2 to 4 a day and I cannot stop falling back into smoking them. I quit but if any life stress happens, I end up at the store buying a pack.  I end up smoking one or two then feeling guilty and throwing the pack away. I then end up smoking off and on for next few weeks. I feel like I cannot control it, it’s like an impulse now. I tried the gum, vaping, and going ''Cold Turkey''.  The gum and vaping works for a while, and I able to quit for a few weeks after not using them. I soon relapse afterwards.

 I got into new relationship, and it’s been great for the last 8 months. I want to get my health back, and get back in shape.  I feel like crap all the time when I back into smoking. When I quit I feel a lot better. Any advice on how to quit will be helpful.

3 days with out a cigarette.

So i'm visiting my family for two weeks and it seemed like a good time to try quitting again.  The first two days were not bad at all but today I broke down and got a tin of pouches just so I could get some nicotine in me.  I think for me I'm more addicted to act of smoking than I am to the nicotine because I still have been craving a cigarette all day long even though I have had a few pouches.  Is this normal that I miss the smoke more then the nicotine?

Almost through day 51 and suddenly I'm starting to suffer

I've been using patches for the past 51 days.... Started at 25mg, dropped down to 17mg 21 days in and then to 12mg 5 days after that (so have been on 12mg for the past 25 days. Cravings have been few and far between until 3 days ago!! All I can think about is this sudden constant need to smoke. It's driving me mad. I very nearly picked up a pack today - I didn't and I won't, but this is going my head in! Why now? Why after doing so well for so long? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

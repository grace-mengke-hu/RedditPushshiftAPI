Beat 2 addictions back to back..

Hey guys, had to post here, for myself mainly but to hopefully inspire someone having struggle with quitting.

April 15th and the past four-five years before (I'm only 20), I was smoking weed every day, also in the form of what you would call popper hits (tobacco mixed with the weed, through a bong). I also have an addictive personality, to everything and everyone. 

I knew this was a problem for me. It affected my mental health and physical self. I basically had an eating disorder, and was so dependent I could not sleep, eat or think without having the tobacco and weed together. I tried quitting both at the same time, which was insanely hard for me. 

April 16th, was my last day mixing tobacco and weed, and the first days were very rough. I still didn't have much of an appetite. I instantly felt relief though, through my mental and physical self. I realized the dependency at the end of the day was all in my mind. It was my mind telling me I needed it, and if I trained my mind to tell myself I don't need it, I eventually wouldn't want it. 

I haven't touched tobacco since April 16th. Fast forward to July 1st (Canada Day) and that was my last day smoking weed. 

I knew after quitting tobacco which controlled my life so heavily, I could conquer anything mentally. I quit weed very easy actually. I realized the more you let go of things that control you, the more empowerment you feel. Funny enough, Day 1 for each of these quittings were ridiculously hard. There were also multiple relapses before I quit tobacco April 16th, and weed July 1st. At the end of the day, you know when you're really going to quit, you accept your current state, you plan the process, and then you take action.

It is all for the better people, so start now before it's too late.

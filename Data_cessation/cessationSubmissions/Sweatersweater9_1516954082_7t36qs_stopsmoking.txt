Back on the wagon!

After a week and a half of smoking again (previously 24 days quit) I am back at it again. 24 hours with no smoke in my lungs!! 

Cold turkey and committed to becoming a better version of myself. Yeah, I slipped. But you know what, I didn’t even realize how much better I felt smoke free compared to smoking even just two cigs a day. I wake up WAY easier and that gets my whole day off on a good note. I never have to worry about what I smell like and nothing is controlling me. 

This is just mind over matter. I’ve done it before so I know I can do it again! Thanks for this sub and the support y’all throw around. It makes a huge difference.

Tips for someone unemployed

Hi all,

I am planning on quitting smoking soon. I feel ready but I have a few things running round in my head which is making it difficult to fully 100% commit.

1 - Unemployment. Being unemployed, I tend to be at home most days, basically doing nothing. So what do I do, I smoke whilst watching TV, smoke when job searching online, smoke whilst playing Xbox, basically everything I do at home revolves a cigarette somewhere in the line, I feel it's going to be 2x as hard to quit when you're bored most of the time.

2 - Loneliness. This kinda of ties in with the unemployed. I have friends but they're all busy getting on with their lives so it's very rare we meet up or anything, which goes back to me just being stuck indoors most days bored.

3 - Stress. This also ties in with the other two. I find looking for work stressful, so many companies you never hear back from. Being lonely most of the time, feeling down about yourself etc.

I do have some hobbies, such as I play football 1-2 times a week. I also live near a beach and some great scenery so occasionally I'll head down there for a walk or sunbathing but other than that, there really isn't much to do. I live in a small town. I also don't drive.

Just wondering if anybody has any similar experiences whilst trying to quit or any tips? 

I would much rather go cold turkey but do you think NRT might be more helpful due to circumstances?

Cheers

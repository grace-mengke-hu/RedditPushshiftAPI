18 days going strong cold turkey... how the hell do i stop eating lol

So i've gone 18 days cold turkey from a pack a day. I said in a previous post that i was going to give myself two weeks of not worrying about how ive eaten. I started at 220lbs when i quit. I weigh 235 now that's only 18 days and 15lbs ehh.. How do i slow it down or eat better. I figured there was no way i could quit smoking and go on a diet or eat better at the same time lol... any advice would be great..

Almost 2 months but I feel guilty

I just joined this sub. I have been a real cigarette free for almost 2 months but I have used a vape. I’ve tried before with all the traditional ways via patches, gum, and cold turkey but I did find that using a vape helped. I barely use it now. Mainly when I’m driving cause that was my second fav place to smoke. I’m really proud that I’ve gone almost 2 months. Longest time since I started smoking. I don’t want to brag but I’m so happy I’ve come this far and hope to keep going! I don’t want to spark up with you and no I don’t want a drag!

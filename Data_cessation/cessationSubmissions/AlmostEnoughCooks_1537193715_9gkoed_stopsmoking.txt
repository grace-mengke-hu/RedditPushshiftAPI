I’m really struggling

So I switched from cigarettes to a Juul a couple months ago. It’s been great for a nicotine fix. I lost my Juul on Saturday and decided I wanted to just not buy another. It’s now Monday morning, I’m only an hour into my eight hour shift and I’m already feeling like I’m going to explode. I have the capability of getting away and buying another or bumming a cigarette and could do it easily. How can I convince myself not to?

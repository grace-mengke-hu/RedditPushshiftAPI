3 months!!

Some things I've noticed recently:

1. Cravings are rarer and a fraction of a second long now, it seems. Sometimes I do honestly make the cravings last a little longer (like, 20-30 seconds) where I really think about smoking, then I realize "no, that's fucking stupid" and remind myself how much I like not smoking.

2. A freshly lit cigarette still smells good, ashtrays smell so bad that I can't sit next to them, and the smell of a cigarette on a person is so WEIRD... Not awful, but nowhere near good. The best way I think I can describe it is "really old and bad celery". It's such an odd smell.

3. I have SO much more money, I am spending so much more on everyone this Christmas!! And I'll still finish my shopping next Wednesday.

4. I still feel like it's hard to believe that I don't smoke. It was such a HUGE part of me. And I can't believe how much I like not smoking.

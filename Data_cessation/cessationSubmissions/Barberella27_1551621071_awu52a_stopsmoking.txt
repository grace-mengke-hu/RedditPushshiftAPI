3 weeks

So i made it 3 weeks. The cravings have come back strong the last 2 days but I will not give in. I just keep reminding myself how brainwashed I was thinking I enjoyed inhaling cancerous chemicals into my body everyday. Absolutely delighted to not be smoking. Benefits I have noticed are obviously breathing is easier, teeth much whiter, everything smells better, more money in my pocket. However I definitely do not have more energy, I am exhausted and haven't noticed a great improvement in my skin tone. Hoping these things get better with a bit more time. Best of luck everyone.

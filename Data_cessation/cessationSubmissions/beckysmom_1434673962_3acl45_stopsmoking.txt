27 day check-in

When I was a smoker every night before bed I'd head out to the garage for one last smoke, taking my phone with me to browse Reddit while I stood there.  Then I'd come in and get ready for bed - wash up, brush teeth, pajamas, etc.  

So last night around bedtime I was sitting in my lazy-girl chair Redditing on my phone - and I got a sudden urge to head out to the garage for a smoke.  Took me a second to remind myself:  Wait.  No.  I don't smoke anymore!

That's usually all it takes to get me through a craving.  "Nope, I don't need that - I don't smoke.  I'm doing just fine without a cigarette, thank you very much!"

For the most part, this quit has been pretty uneventful which makes it different from the other times I tried to quit. This time, I'm actually enjoying being a non-smoker. I have more energy, I don't have the constant smoker's cough, I have more time to do stuff (time I used to spend smoking, that is...).  Life is good!

I started the 'Couch to 5k' running program this week. I'm probably going to be on week one for more than a week. I was a smoker for a long time and had a pretty sedentary lifestyle so I'm pretty out of shape. But now that I'm a non-smoker, I want to be healthier!  And I want to run with my daughter (who just signed up for middle school cross-country). 

PLUS - trying to catch my breath while running is a GREAT reminder of why I don't want to smoke any more.  :)  

If you're quitting - think about how much there is to GAIN from quitting smoking.  How much are you missing out on because you spend all that time & energy smoking???  Take your life back!  If I can do it - you can do it. 

You can do it.  :)

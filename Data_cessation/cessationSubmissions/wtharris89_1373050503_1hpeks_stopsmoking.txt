Just Bike 8 Miles!

Just got back from an eight mile bike ride, and I feel great!  

When I was smoking I could hardly do four miles without huffing and puffing.  I'm really surprised to see this kind of improvement so quickly!

Hang in there guys, and keep working at it.  Pushing my excersize limits has helped me smash those cravings into the dirt!

I decided to quit smoking 5 minutes ago.

I was driving home from the gym smoking the last cigarette from a pack. Thought to myself I better stop at the gas station on my way and pick up a pack. Then it suddenly hit me. Why the fuck am I still smoking? I could accomplish so much in my life if I could just stop smoking. So, I took my last drag, put it out in the ashtray, and decided to quit. Telling myself I'll stop after this next pack isn't going to work. I've got a long journey ahead of me.  I hope this community is supportive, because I'll need it.

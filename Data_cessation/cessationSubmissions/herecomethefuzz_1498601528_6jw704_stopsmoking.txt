Alright, here we go.

Long time lurker. I've seen you guys go through your own battles and I'm at the stage where It's my turn to quit to preserve both my health and my relationships. I don't want to do any of the drugs that block your brain from absorbing nicotine because they frankly frighten me, so I've set a date for this Sunday to quit the vape, cigs, everything. I need to do this. Any hints for when the moment happens and I go cold turkey would be greatly appreciated.

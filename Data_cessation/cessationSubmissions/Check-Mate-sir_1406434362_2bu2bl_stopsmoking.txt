Chantix

Hey guys, I've been following this thread for a few weeks now, and I was wanting to pander to anyone out there who has quit smoking using chantix. I've been taking it for a day now for the prescribed one week startup for my quit date next Friday and it's been rough already. My nightmares just in the first night have been more vivid than anything that a nicotine patch has ever given me. I ask if this might start to subside after a few days use or does the uphill battle continue until the end of the medicine's course?

Chantix side effects?

I started taking Chantix 5 days ago and the relief of not wanting to smoke the past few days has been pretty amazing. It's weird to not think about cigarettes at all so the drug definitely work in that regard. 

However, I've been reading about the different side effects people experience, and I was wondering if anyone has the same complaint as I do.  The dreams and depression are annoying, but I can deal with that because I know why it's happening.  But the thing that's harder to cope with is the cognitive effects and just feeling dumber. I feel like every thought process is slowed down, I can't keep 2 thoughts in my head at once, everything is hazy, and just damp.  I forget to answer emails and it takes like 3 seconds to remember what day of the week it is.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Any recs for dealing with it? I don't really want to stop the Chantix, I am so sick of smoking, but I don't know how sustainable this "bad at thinking" thing is going to be.

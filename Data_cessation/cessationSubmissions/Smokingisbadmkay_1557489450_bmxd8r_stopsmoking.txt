I’m writing this to avoid caving in to a super bad craving.

It’s all mental. I don’t need it. 
I’ve scoped out dozens of gas stations on my drive into the city for work. Telling myself just one and throw them away. 
BUT FOR WHAT?!
Waste of time and waste of money. 
But I reeeeaaallllly want one. I don’t need one though. 
I seriously pulled into a gas station and drive around it and back out onto the highway. 
It lasted my whole morning. 
Uugghhhhh. Hshshsuwhwhwususheshsuwuwuakakshshxbxbshwuwiqowoieiruryxbxbxnssnskshqgwusishs. 

I got a coffee instead. And some gum. 

Happy Friday. 

I think it’s done now.

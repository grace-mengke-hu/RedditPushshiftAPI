How NOT to quit smoking (serious/sarcastic)

Day one: Quit smoking
Day two: post about it on r/stopsmoking. Blithely mention Quitters Flu
Days 3-4: suffer like shit assuming you are detoxing.
Day 5: start seeing a strange rash on your body. Take note but ignore.
Day 6: Suffering greatly - sweating, fever, pain, misery. Go to Emergency Room. Leave after four hours with antibiotics and diagnosis of tick bite fever.
Day 7: cannot keep food, water or medicine down
Day 8: return to ER. Get admitted to critical ward. 
Day 9: attending physician tells you it’s not tick bite fever. Orders motherfucking Spinal Tap. Later in day diagnosed with BACTERIAL MENINGITIS- transferred to quarantine
Days 10-12: suffer alone because everyone you know AND S.O. Are out of country. But I was getting better.
Day 13: released and back at home. 

I don’t know what the moral of the story is. The fact that I survived almost the first two weeks of quitting smoking (and YES I had dreams and cravings even though I was sick AF and could’ve died if I had waited a day or two longer to go to hospital) OR surviving Bacterial Meningitis which absolutely SUCKS btw- and I have had some other horrible diseases (Dengue I’m looking at you!) 

I guess my biggest takeaway is that quitting is definitely easier than being in the hospital for 5 days. 

Stay strong y’all and listen to your body!

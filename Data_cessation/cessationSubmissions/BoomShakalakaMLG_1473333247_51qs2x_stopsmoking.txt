Day 4 without smoke.

The cravings come in waves and some are pretty strong but i have a question. I drink alcohol but i keep myself away from cigs and vaping successfully for now, the question is, is it good idea for the mentality to keep doing this? I even have 3 cigs in the drawer that i didn't even opened.

I had a backside and it worries me.

I smoked a cigar today. I've been without a smoke for five days, and I'm not sure what came over me. I haven't even been craving. But after having it, I am now. I feel guilty and disappointed in myself. How can I turn those feelings to something positive and reaffirm my dedication to this quit?

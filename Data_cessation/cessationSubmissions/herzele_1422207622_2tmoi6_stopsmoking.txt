Quitting today

I'm 28, smoked for 10 years and decided to stop for good 4 hours ago. 

I was on my way to work, dumped the cigarettes i had with me and called my girlfriend to ask her to clean the house of all my cigarettes. 

I'm an asthmatic, and got a cold a few weeks ago. Usually the coughing stop a few days after the cold is over, but it's been 3 weeks and i'm still coughing. Not a lot, but it's still here everyday.
I've stopped before, a few years back, and didn't smoke for around 3 month. This time let's hope it's for good !

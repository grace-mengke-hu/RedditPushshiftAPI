What do non smokers do while driving?

I've been a driver since 16 and a smoker since about the same time.  I'm heading into Day 3 using the patches along with Wellbutrin and it's going surprisingly well, but my biggest trigger is driving.  I've smoked and drove for 25+ years.  I don't know what to do with myself.  I also drive for my job so this makes it incredibly hard also.  I don't like gum or candy. Any suggestions?

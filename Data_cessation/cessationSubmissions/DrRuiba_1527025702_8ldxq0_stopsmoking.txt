DAY 4, Im about to relapse.

Hey, it's day 4 without nicotine. for the first time i went out with friends, we're sitting playing monopoly, they've been smoking for ages, I'm fighting myself, one side says - You can't hide forever, you can't run, you gotta stay here and fight this.
- No! just smoke few cigs and say goodbye to your friends for a month or two.
- Oh God, this is so risky, go home dude, sleep n decide tomorrow.

It's like a movie scene, I apologise for that, what do you guys think?

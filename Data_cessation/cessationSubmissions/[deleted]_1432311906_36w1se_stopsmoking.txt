smoking, anxiety, and weaning down to a quit date

hey folks,

so i've been long wanting to quit (smoker for almost fourteen years, especially bad in the last five or so) and tried a few times, only to have it ramp up my anxiety in a debilitating way (even when i quit for an extended period of time, overall my anxiety became so overwhelming that i was non-functional). does anyone else have experience with this? 

i have medical support and i'm going to start weaning down to a quit date in june, but i'd love to hear if anyone out there has dealt with severe anxiety after/while quitting and any insight you've got.

also thank you for this subreddit! reading everyone's thoughts and struggles and commitment is really encouraging.

One year today fellas!

I can't believe I made it! It was definitely a crazy year and so many times I wanted to have a smoke. I even bought a pack at one point and had it in my mouth ready to light it, after nine months of being off of them. 

I don't post much here but reading everything made it possible. Today I put down the vape.

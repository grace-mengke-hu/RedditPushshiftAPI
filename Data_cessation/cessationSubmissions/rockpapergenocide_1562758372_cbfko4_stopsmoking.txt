Five days

I have made it five, count em, FIVE days cold turkey. I can not believe I waited so long to quit. I feel great, sleep better, put in more work at the gym, etc... The upsides to being in non-smoker are too many to list. Good luck to everyone on here taking the journey with me! I'm proud of you guys!

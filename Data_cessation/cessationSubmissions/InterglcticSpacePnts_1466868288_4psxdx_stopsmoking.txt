ðŸ’ªBeginning of day 6...

...Can't believe I've made it this far cold turkey after 14+ years of smoking (crazy!). I went to a gathering full of smokers. Not one puff for me all night! I shocked myself. I felt so accomplished when I left and when I woke up this morning to realize I had made it through that night without giving in. My quit app sent me here and I've read many comments and decided to create an account. This seems like a very positive and supportive community. It's great that things like this exist!

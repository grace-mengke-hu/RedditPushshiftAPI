I'm trying again! and I've got a whole new reason to quit.....

Tuesday, I got a biopsy.  Of my Cervix.  I won't have any results of the tests until next week but....WTF.  Its most likely HPV...and guess what makes my likelihood that my immune system can't fight this shit off and I get cancer from this.  DING DING DING!  Smoking!

I run like 4 days a week.  I eat pretty fucking healthy-like.  I'm a good respectful person to those around me.  But really....smoking kind of goes against all of that.  My boyfriend has to taste it/smell it on me.  I'm not that fast at running (and really not getting any faster).  Sure, I'm pretty happy with how my body looks all naked-like....but if the insides are all ruined and gross what the fuck is the goddamn point?!  A smoker that has completed 2 tough mudders isn't something I should be proud of....it makes me an idiot.  Its like training with an extra 40 lbs on my back.  or with one lung.  How am I going to accomplish my next fitness goals (triathlon, half marathon) smoking?  Answer-I wont.  NO MORE!

Thanks for letting me rant....

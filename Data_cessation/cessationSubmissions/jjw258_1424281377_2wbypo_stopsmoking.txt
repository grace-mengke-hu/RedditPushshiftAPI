36 hours smoke free

I started using Chantix 4 weeks ago, and I was beginning to become very anxious about the "quit date" not "finding me" or that the Chantix wasn't working.  Yesterday morning I woke up and decided I just wasn't going to buy any cigarettes that morning . . . but that if I wanted to later, I could.  Yesterday was a little tough, but I watched the Alan Carr video in the background while I was working which shored up my resolve.  So far, so good!  The Chantix / Carr combo has made these first 36 hours so much easier than other times I've tried to quit or "cut down."  I'm pretty excited!

As an aside, I had the Chantix prescription for probably 2 months before I was brave enough to take it.  I read so many negative and scary stories on the internet that I was convinced I would have a terrible reaction.  I'm so happy I took the plunge.  I know it does have a terrible effect on some people, but I have had no side effects at all, other than mild upset stomach the first few days (and only for 20 or so minutes after taking the pill).  My advice to anyone afraid to start Chantix would be to discuss it with their doctor, but don't let the internet freak them out unnecessarily.

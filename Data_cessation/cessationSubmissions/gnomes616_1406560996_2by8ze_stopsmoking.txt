I'm on day three. I'm feeling pretty alright.

Hello new friends!

I've been smoking for the last 10.5-ish years. I got to marry my favorite guy in April. My aunt died from metastatic colon cancer last year. No one on my mom's side of the family who has smoked has lived past 60, and my father's side has a looong history of cardiovascular problems. 

All that, and I want to be as healthy as possible when we start trying to have kids. I feel like it's easier to do this now than when I'll be harboring a parasitic tennant someday.

I'm feeling alright today. I've only had a couple "Hmm, cigarette...." thoughts today. Today's going to be the first day back at work, so I feel nervous about that. But I think it'll be alright.

I'm really happy to finally subscribe to this sub :D

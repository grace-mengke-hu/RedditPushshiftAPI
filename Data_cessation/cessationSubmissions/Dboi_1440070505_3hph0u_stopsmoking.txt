what do you think of ecigs? I quit.

Long story to short version. I'm addicted to nicotine that I get from ecigs. I stopped yesterday. I've been using 18mg for a long time now. 2.5-5ml a day. I was starting to get weird sickness I'd associate with the flu/cold. Joints would hurt, waking up while sleeping, waking up in a puddle of sweat, feeling tired.

Pretty much all the symptoms I've heard of. What should I expect? As a non-smoker I'm not prepared. I also quit marijuana about 3 weeks ago. Today I woke up at 4:30am and had diarrhea. I don't know if its related or not.

Honestly didn't know nicotine withdrawal had other symptoms besides cravings.

25 days and didn't smoke after a stressfull work day!

This is my first time posting, but my app suggests it so here goes... I'm 25 days into this, hopefully last, quit! Had a project blow up in my face at work this afternoon and although my mind was screaming, "smoke!" I went to a co worker for support. We talked it through, smoking will not make this easier or fix the problem (repeat 900 times.) 
When the solution did come through I wasn't outside, I was there, and handled it :D
I had felt on cruise control for the last week and if I could handle the surprise urge, anyone can. It will not solve problems! Stay strong and smoke free all!

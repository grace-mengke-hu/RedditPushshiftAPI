Anger

Wanted to share my little victory last night in case any of you find yourself  blindsided by anger. Yesterday was my day 13 and it has been pretty easy actually, no major cravings, even got through my car breaking down last week and was so happy I did not reek of smoke when Triple A got there. But yesterday in a phone call with a friend she made me angry. After I hung up that Anger gripped me and squeezed, the craving was so STRONG I could hardly see straight.  Normally, well, for the past 40 years I would chain smoke and stew in my anger and replay the conversation over and over. Somehow I sat down and started writing it out and decided I could choose to find her amusing instead. Then I went outside and attacked yard work with a vengeance. By the time I came inside I felt better and was so PROUD I did not smoke!  

I guess this is a warning to everyone, be prepared for Anger. If you were a smoker chances are it will be a huge trigger. 

 Choose to be amused and don't let ANYONE take your progress away.

Fucked up again, quitting for real today

I quit in January, but fell off the wagon two months ago. Made a decision last night to smoke the rest of my pack and never smoke again. I feel awful today which is to be expected, but I'm determined this time around. I'm only posting this so I can hold myself accountable somehow. I'm looking forward to a smoke free new year and life!

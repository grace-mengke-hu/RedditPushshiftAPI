Trying again.

I’ve been smoking since I was 13. I smoke half a pack a day, even more when I’m not at work. I am a fairly skinny female in her late 20’s and can barely breathe or walk. I have chest pains, no sense of smell or taste, I smell like an ash tray no matter how much perfume I use, and all of my clothing feels covered in a film of filth at all times, clean or not. I just feel disgusting and horrifyingly unhealthy. I am so addicted to smoking. I have to smoke the second I wake up. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night and end up smoking before I fall back asleep. Have to after I eat. After I drink tea. When I’m out at the bar. I even sneak out at work to smoke which could ultimately cost me my job. It’s time to stop. I am so miserable from smoking and don’t want to do it anymore.  I want to go back to the gym and be more healthy but smoking has taken all of my endurance away. This will be my second attempt to quit this year, using my leftover nicotine gum from last time I tried. Some words of encouragement, advice, and how quitting has improved your life would be great! I’ll be using an app to track my progress and will check back on this sub regularly.

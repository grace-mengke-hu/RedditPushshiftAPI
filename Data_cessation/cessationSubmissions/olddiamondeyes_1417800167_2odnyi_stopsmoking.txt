When does sneezing and sinus agony stop!?

Hello friends & Romans,

I am on my 6th day since I stopped smoking...huzzah! This is the longest I've gone on a quit in a long time and I am feeling positive and optimistic. There are no downsides to quitting!

That said, I have painful sinus headaches and near constant sneezing. I know that the quitters flu is common, is that what this is supposed to be? People who one, two or more weeks out, how long does this last?

I'm drinking a ton of water and getting lots of rest, but any other tips to ease into the great new world of normal are appreciated!

ed: I should mention that I smoked something like 10-15 cigs a day for the last 15 years so this is pretty huge for me. So overdue!!

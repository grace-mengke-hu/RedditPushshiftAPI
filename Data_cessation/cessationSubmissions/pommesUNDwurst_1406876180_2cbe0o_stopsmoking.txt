How is it about Concentration and learning while in the first weeks?

In advance: I'm sorry for my poor english. I'm more comfortable with reading and hearing than writing something myself.
But I need some advice from you guys.

I'm a german medstudent and am learning now since several month for a freakishly big exam in 5 weeks. I did fail it ones half a year ago. It was the first time I failed a test whatsoever and it dragged me down quite a bit. But I think it has something to do with my current lifestyle. I smoke since nearly 2 years. Stopped doing any phisical activity. Drink beer and lots of coffee. And while I'm still having a girlfriend, I am not so sure about how long she will hold on to my disgusting self. 

While I wanted to stop smoking in between those huge preparation times, I wasn't able to do so. You know how it is. But now I'm feeling motivated and ready to go. I quit numerous times for several days in the last weeks. The longest period being 3. Always interrupted by one cig. 
What always brings me back is the fact, that I'm noticing a huge downfall in my concentration! And that's a big thing when you are learning most of the time, sometimes up to 15 hours a day.  I know that it comes mostly from the craving, but there is nothing I can do about it.

So tell me please. Is there any possibility to reduce it? 
How did you kept working while in the first weeks? 
How long will it last, till I am able to keep a calm mind while learning?
And will I be able to get set for the big exam I am about to enter?

Thank you all in advance. I love this community! 
To all of you being far ahead of me: You are beasts!

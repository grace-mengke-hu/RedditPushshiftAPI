Today is day .5 and tomorrow is day 1!!

I have not smoked in 7 hours (and no I was not sleeping).

Tomorrow I stop forever!

I have some questions.

I can't chew gum (I am allergic to aspartame and it is 99% of gum) what is an alternative?

Should I go the nicotine gum way (I can chew that b/c it does not have aspartame  and have 5 boxes from work- for free)or does it just prolong a nicotine addiction?

Did any of keep an emergency smoke or 2 around (I feel like I will panic less if it is around for me but I am deciding not to smoke)??

When will my headache from HELL go away??

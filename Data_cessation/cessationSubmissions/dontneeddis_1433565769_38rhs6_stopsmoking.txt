Just want to say, I seriously thought about it

Caving.  New job, now have to deal with traffic, no friends at work yet. Uncertainty.
Stressful times in life.
I don't plan on caving, but ohhh boy do I want to.  Only thing holding me back is my counter and the fact that I don't want to get sucked in again.  I really don't want to get sucked in again.

There's no point to this post, maybe a word of caution to those moving forward, but we are never safe - it is far too easy to light up.  

I'm getting plenty of regular diet and exercise in, sleep has been iffy but manageable - anybody have some tips for these extra edgy times?

Questions about drinking while quitting

Hey guys, so I'm about 4 days in and I'm pretty confident that I'm going to have to stop drinking for at least the first few weeks while I'm not smoking.  I'm curious as to how you guys have handled alcohol while attempting to quit.  

Some of you are posting about resisting urges while drinking, which I'm almost positive I'm not going to be able to do, or at the very least it'll kick off urges so strong that I'm not going to be able to enjoy myself.  Did any of you who have quit for longer feel the same way at first, and if so when did you start to be able to have a beer or two?  Are there any of you that had to quit drinking entirely to successfully quit smoking?  Or have you reached a place where you're okay with having a cigarette or two while drinking but never while sober?

I'm not opposed to being sober for the foreseeable future if that's what it takes, but it'll sure be boring.  Thanks for any thoughts or advice you have!

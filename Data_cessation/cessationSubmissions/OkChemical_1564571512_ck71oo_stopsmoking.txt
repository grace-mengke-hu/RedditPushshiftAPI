I’m not sure it fits the sub, but I present to you some rules I applied to my life, that changed it completely and made me smoke-free, without having to torment yourself. I hope it helps you to.

So this is the “pact” I made to be more responsible about smoking, and now I smoke 8-9 cigarettes a month.
The non-addictive smoking pact.
The act of smoking is a process of one smoking a cigarette or other nicotine induced device that fulfills the purpose of one’s cigarette smoking. 
The following conditions are not a reason to conduct an act of smoking:
1. One’s desire to smoke a cigarette.
2. The condition of one being in an  atmosphere that would usually make one smoke a cigarette. (Chilly evening, a sunny day, a break during a university class, etc)
3. Being surrounded by smokers and wanting to join their smoking process, without any other reason than one being surrounded by smoke-friendly environment.
4. On condition that one is asked to smoke, without a reason. 
The following conditions are a reason to conduct an act of smoking:
1. An event that would not normally take place, and which has a major effect on one’s life. (A car crash, a birth of a child, a win in a lottery, etc)
2. One being in an atmosphere that would normally lead to an act of smoking, which is aimed to make one have fun or relax, in a company of people. (On a party, in mountains near the campfire with friends, after watching a movie with friends, any moments that happen once or twice a month, which are aimed to make you forget about your problems and just have fun)
If one is not able to to keep following the rules, one should just stop smoking at all, as one is weak, and his will is not strong enough to keep one away from cigarettes.
On account of one’s acceptance of the pact above, he or she can smoke a cigarette, as they have just changed their life.

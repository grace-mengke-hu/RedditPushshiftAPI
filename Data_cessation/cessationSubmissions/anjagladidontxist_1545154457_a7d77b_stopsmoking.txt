Day 8

I have finally surpassed a week! Just wanted to check in with you guys because I always love the enthusiasm here and again, I want to hold myself accountable. 

This isn’t the longest I’ve gone without smoking but it IS the longest I’ve gone without smoking INTENTIONALLY. This is no accident and it’s only up from here. 

Wishing everyone else a great journey! I’ll check back in at the one month mark. Much love

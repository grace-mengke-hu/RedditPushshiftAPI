Mental Illness and Cigarettes

Anyone here with mental illness but were still successful in quitting?   I’m already a neurotic and mopey individual by nature, and while I’m working on these things, my baseline remains pretty anxious and sad.  I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression, and O.C.D for my entire life, and for the past decade or so, smoking been my sole coping skill to deal with these issues.  Each time that I attempt to quit, not smoking just amplifies my negative feelings 100% and I always end up throwing in the towel.   I am already a pretty sensitive guy who’s easily-triggered so every little blowout with a loved one leaves me in tears and I really struggle to find the motivation to not fall back on my nicotine crutch.  I desperately want to quit but I just don’t think I’m strong enough mentally to deal with the stressors of everyday life while I do so.  I’m sure smoking just feeds into my anxiety and depression, but I was just curious if there were any tips or success stories from those who have experienced the same.

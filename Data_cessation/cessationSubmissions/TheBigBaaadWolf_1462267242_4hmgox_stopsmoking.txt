Alternative idea

Hi guys, free from smoking for 2 months. I found a great method for helping quit is to carry a pack or two of chewing gum of a flavour you don't like (liquorice blergh) Everytime I got a craving I would pop one in my mouth and chew. 
It's not expensive and it worked for me, might work for one of you! 
Good luck!

Terrified of putting on weight. Any experiences?

So I've been smoking since I was 13 (now 19) about 3 years ago I started losing weight, I do feel like being a smoker helped quite a bit, I was 18 Stone, now I am 11 stone. I still watch what I'm eating and sometimes I do have a cigarette instead of lunch, but I'm smoking maybe 20-30 a day, and my chest is terrible, I really do want to quit and think I am capable of doing so, but I'm just terrified that if I do, I'll go back to my normal eating ways. When I'm without a cigarette for 2 hours I usually end up eating, not realising till afterwards.

Has anyone who has quit for a long time had any experience with gaining weight?

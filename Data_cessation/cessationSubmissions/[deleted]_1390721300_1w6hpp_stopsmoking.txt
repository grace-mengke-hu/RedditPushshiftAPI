My forty-somethingth attempt to stop smoking

So I just smoked a couple of cigarettes, and after 5 minutes of feeling terribly guilty and almost going out to buy a whole pack, I decided I'm gonna forgive myself this time and ignore those 2 cigs, because this is how I always go back to smoking. It starts with one or two cigarettes  and the guilt then follows getting me to the wrong conclusion every time: that I have to restart the clock, so it's ok to smoke a pack and start over when I'm done. Well, I'm not gonna start over this time, I'm just gonna ignore those two damned cigarettes.

How to support quitting boyfriend?

My boyfriend has now gone 48 hours without a cigarette! I am super proud and want to do my best to help him get through this for good.  This is his third attempt this year, and he was seeming very positive and optimistic about his quitting yesterday, but today not so much.  I don't want to nag.  Looking for advice from others who have seen their SO through quitting smoking, or some dos/don'ts from those who have gone through this.

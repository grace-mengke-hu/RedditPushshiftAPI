How much I was spending money?!?

Yep. I have smoking and aspartame addiction. Couple of days ago I realized that I'm using almost 1/3 (over 5000euros) of my yearly incomes to cigs and Pepsi max... I can't afford that. 

Day 2 nearly done without smoking and I'm feeling shitty. I just joined up to this community to get some help. This time I'll make it last. And right after I'm feeling a bit better I'll quit those sugarless sodas. Water tastes better and better.

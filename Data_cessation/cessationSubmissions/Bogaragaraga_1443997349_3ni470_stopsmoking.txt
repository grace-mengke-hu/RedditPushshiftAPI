Day 3!

Hey, so I just want to get this out there... I'm pretty proud of myself, I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days, the last time I quit for even close to this long was almost 6 years ago.

I'm in British Columbia, so I called the smoking cessation program and got some free nicotine patches. I also have an e-cigarette from when I tried to quit 2 years ago, but I ended up smoking a few cigarettes anyways, and I would vape all day, so I think that that just made my addiction worse.

I got diagnosed with strep throat a few days ago, and the fact it hurt to smoke was a good push for me.

I was drinking last night and although I really wanted to smoke several times, the people I was with were good enough not to give me a cigarette so I managed to get through it and I was so much happier for it. 

I'm now on 21 MG Habitrol Patches, and I'm vaping 3 mg juice every few hours to deal with the oral/hand to mouth fixation. ~80 hours smoke free now!

Well, thanks for reading.

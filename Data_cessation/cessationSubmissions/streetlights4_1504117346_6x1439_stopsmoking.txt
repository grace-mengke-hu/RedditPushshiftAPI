I want to stop but I need help.

Well, I've been a regular smoker since beginning of May 2017. I broke up with my boyfriend and I used it an excuse. I used so many excuses , I will stop after my exams,I'm a med-student and feel so stressed out, I'm gonna stop after I lose weight because it decreases my appetite, I am having fun while I'm drinking alcohol,it feels good with coffee,in the morning or after a meal etc. Plus I stopped exercising because it didn't fit into my mentality: how can you be healthy while smoking cigars? And now I feel like I'm 20 years old who has got addicted to smoking with just four months. I feel so vulnerable. My new SO also smokes and this is not also great for me. We decided to stop but I was the one who gave up because I found a new excuse: I'm having bulimic periods sometime and smoking takes my stress away. Now I feel so lost and want to stop.

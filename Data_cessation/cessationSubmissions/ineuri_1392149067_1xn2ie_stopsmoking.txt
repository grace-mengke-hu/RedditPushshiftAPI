Just want to share with you guys

Today I was in the doctors office and I had to fill in some medical form in which I had to state my current and past health condition. 
There also was that question "do you smoke?" It was the first time, for as long as I can remember, that I could tick that box with "NO". 

It made me smile, this silent victory :)

I'm about 40 days in, I guess, but never expected to get this far. Still have some cravings now and then, but they're not different than craving chocolate, french fries, or whatever. :)

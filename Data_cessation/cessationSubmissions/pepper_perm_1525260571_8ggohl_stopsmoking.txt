I want to quit smoking and I think I came up with a plan.

First, I’d like to apologize if this isn’t the appropriate sub to share this idea. However I wanted to share my idea to make it feel more substantial. 

My plan is very simple and personalized for my self but if helps others, fantastic. The basic premise is to reward my self for not smoking. I love tattoos and I think I good strategy would be to use the money saved from not smoking to go towards my next tattoo. The estimate I gave my self was $300 for the tattoo. I currently spend roughly $30 a week on packs. If I stick with this plan starting right now, in two and a half months I will save enough money to get the tattoo. I’ve also set mini rewards, the first being when I get to $100 will share what my tattoo will be with you all and my friends. Any thoughts, tips, and advice would be greatly appreciated!

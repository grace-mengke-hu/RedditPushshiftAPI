Quitting two addictions at once is making things easier

what works for me may work for you.

I have quit fapping and smoking. Whenever I feel like im about to cave in for one of these addictions I just think about how I dont want to declare the other a winner. I somehow trick myself and keep my brain in a constant state of equilibrium in regards to qutting the two addictions, whenever I get close to fixing one, the other side compensates and brings it back to normal.

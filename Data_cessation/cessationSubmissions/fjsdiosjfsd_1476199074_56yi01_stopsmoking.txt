1 week! Harder now than the first three days...

Somehow I managed the first three or four days with no problem. Barely any withdrawal symptoms, just a lot of reminding myself that smoking would make me feel like shit, physically and mentally. Now after a week I'm getting the "just one can't hurt" idea in my head, and I'm a little scared to lose my resolve. I'm not on the verge of going out to buy a pack or anything, but this is harder than the physical withdrawal! (For context, smoked about a pack a day for six years.)

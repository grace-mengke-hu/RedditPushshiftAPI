Polite rant

After having been part of this community for a while now I just have to say that I believe this is the best subreddit and possibly the best online community I've ever see. Everyone's comments are so loving and caring it honestly makes me very happy. Anyways I don't want to sound like you much of a pussy but for those on the outskirts please come join us, and for those who are already involved keep doing what you're doing. Together we are stronger against nicotine and addiction.

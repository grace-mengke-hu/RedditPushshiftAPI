I am determined, I just need some support.

I sincerely want to quit. I have quit before for 6 months and that was cold turkey. I have had bouts of quitting in the past by way of champix, zyban, nicotine-free vape, nicotine vape, patches and gum.

I need some guidance... again. Somewhere to start and starting with confidence. I’m not a big drinker but I know alcohol is one of my triggers as well as work. I have bought a brand new car on the premise that I would quit (a week later, still smoking and very disappointed in myself)

I just want to be free again. I know it’s hard but I am reaching out for some support.

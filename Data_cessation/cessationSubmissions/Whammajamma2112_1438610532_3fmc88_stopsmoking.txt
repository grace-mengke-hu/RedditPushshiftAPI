Support to Quit

Im 21 years old, ive been smoking for 5 years already cause I started at a very young age.

 My family members smoke sometimes and that's not going to cut it for me. I want to quit but every time ive tried, people around me just don't care and keep telling me to shut up when I brag about not smoking. 

If some people want to pull together and start a Support Blog, lets do it. All I have is my girlfriend for support and I don't feel it will be enough based on my surroundings.

 Also, does anyone have any suggestions as to what to do to calm yourself down when experiencing a bad craving? 

I get anxiety really fucking bad when I don't smoke cigs and can easily be the biggest dickhead on the planet to my loved ones. I need some alternatives to give me energy and fulfillment and cover the empty spot that a cig used to fill.

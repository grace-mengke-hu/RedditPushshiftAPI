Adderall and smoking

So, I took 40 mg of Adderall a couple days ago, which since I don't have ADD was enough to give me this "high" feeling. Since then, I've noticed two things in regards to my smoking: I haven't felt a physiological urge to do so, and when I did, I wouldn't get the head buzz that I normally do. Usually I feel the urge to smoke every 2 to 3 hours, but I've been going for 8 or more without having any real desire. I've been continuing to do so out of habit, through. But, even after waiting to do it in 6-hour intervals or more, I haven't been getting the buzz that I usually get after smoking in 5-hour intervals.

So I'm wondering: am I just developing a normal tolerance to nicotine after smoking consistently for several months, or is the Adderall somehow connected to me feeling this reduced urge?

If the Adderall is connected to it, I see how it could potentially be a good coping mechanism until I quit for good, but do I really want to risk starting another addiction, this time to a strictly controlled substance?

Cigarettes taste gross now

I quit smoking when I went home for the break, mainly because I didn't want to deal with hiding the smell from my parents. When I came back, two days ago, I bought a pack, and I smoked one and then another, and then smoked yesterday another, then another one just a few minutes ago (cravings), but with every cigarette, I realize that I *don't* like the taste of cigarettes anymore. It tastes bad in my mouth. The smoke is disgusting.

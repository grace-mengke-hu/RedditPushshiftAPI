Can smoking have affected my voice?

Smoked for about 2 years on and off; at the worst it was a pack a day, at the best it was none or one. Lately my voice has been feeling extremely weak, especially since I quit yesterday. I have so much trouble projecting my voice even in a quiet setting, and my voice sounds a lot less manly than it usually does. I sound like a kid again

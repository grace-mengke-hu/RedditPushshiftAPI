Help trying to get someone who genuinely believes smoking is beneficial to stop smoking

Background: I'm almost 16, Chinese American. Grandpa is Chinese, longtime smoker (60+ years, is almost 80), he is living with us in the US for an extended period amount of time. Has had and is having health/respiratory issues in general â€” it's hard for him to walk a few steps without feeling very tired, he has to take breaks after climbing a few (as in 5) stair steps, always has to carry an oxygen tank any time going out of the house.

I understand that he grew up in a very different society, in one where they didn't know about the negative effects of smoking, so it's hard for him, but with his adamant personality, it's not that he admits that smoking is bad but can't quit, *he genuinely believes that smoking is good for him*.

* He says that smoking helps him to loosen mucus/phlegm, but that's an issue that wouldn't be as severe if he didn't smoke in the first place.
* Any time we try to cite any type of scientific evidence that smoking is bad, he refutes by citing examples of famous authors (all of whom lived in an age where they still thought that smoking wasn't bad) who smoked and said that they didn't see a point to quitting. When I tried to ask him why he didn't cite examples of people whose lives have improved because of quitting, he responded by laughing and saying they don't exist at all, then ignoring when we present him with people who have quit.
* He thinks that just because he is living past the average age, that quitting smoking would do nothing for his health.

What do I do in this situation? We have brought up all of these points and more for many, many years and he's always the same. I want him to quit for his well-being and for the well-being of the rest of the family, but at the same time I have to respect him as an elder (you know, with Asian family ideals and stuff). Does anyone have similar experience?

The only idea that I remotely have is simply throwing away all of his cigarettes, and as he does not have access to any stores, he could not get more. However, I believe that 1) this brute-forced method wouldn't actually change his mindset and he would go back to smoking whenever he had access, 2) he would get mad and 3) in general I don't believe in brute forcing things as they don't often work.

Thanks so much and apologies for the long read.

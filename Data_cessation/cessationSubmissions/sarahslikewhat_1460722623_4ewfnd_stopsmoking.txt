Advice on timing a cold turkey attempt?

I used to smoke and transitioned to ecigs a couple years ago.  I now want to quit them too because they aren’t as gross as cigarettes but still a crutch.

I mainly use it to self-medicate for anxiety, I have klonopin for panic attacks that I take maybe once a week when I feel like I might lose it. I know that stuff is addictive too so I try not to take it more than once every other day at the most. The anxiety pre-dates any smoking but now they’re linked. 

I’m planning it just go cold turkey and not suffer longer than I have to.  I failed before because I let my anxiety get to me after 3 days. So this time I may supplement with the klonopin more than in my previous attempt and more than I usually use it. 
Do you have any advice for timing a cold turkey attempt? I tend to use my ecig less on weekends when I’m busy/distracted/ having fun. But I don’t want to be grumpy around my friends. But I think I might be better at sticking to it if I’m around people.  

I want it most when I’m at work, driving the car or drinking.  I can get Chantix free of charge through work.

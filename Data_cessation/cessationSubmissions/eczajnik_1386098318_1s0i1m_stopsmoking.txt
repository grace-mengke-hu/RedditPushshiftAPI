4 months summary: my reasons, my symptoms (and how I dealt with them), my benefits, what helped

I'm 29, quit cold turkey this summer. Here's my reason for it: I realised that I'd rather have a smoke than spend time with my 3 year old son. Now I can't imagine anything I'd rather do than playing with him! There's also one more secret reason that I cannot disclose but my son is the reason number one.

These were my withdrawal symptoms and how I dealt with them:

* Cravings (chewing gum, drinking water, realising that each craving means I'm winning)
* Constipation (Sriracha Hot Sauce on everything!)
* Sleeplesness (dealt with it, only 4 days)
* Weird dreams (Treated them as good movies and looked foward to them)
* Shaking hands, like really hard - Parkinson's level muscle twitches (made fun of them, realised how awful nicotine is if it caused such withdrawal symptoms; lasted only 3 days)
* Sore throat (more sriracha)
* Headaches (Aspirin! They went away after about 2 months and now I have NO HEADACHES AT ALL! I used to have one every 2 days while I smoked)

Benefits that I noticed:

* I feel that if I beat this addicition, I can do anything!
* Lots of energy
* I feel better
* I lift more at the gym and don't get as tired (serious imprevements - I can go twice as long!)
* I don't bite skin around my fingers anymore since I quit; don't know why but they look awesome!
* White teeth! I always wanted that; I recommend Rembrandt Plus toothpaste, works wonders
* I quit coffe and now drink green tea. turns out it tastes great and helps with teeh whitening
* My tongue got visibly better, no more creepy grey/yellow/ugly stuff on it!
* I have much more money now
* Some things taste much better (mainly vegetables and fancy stuff but also home made burgers) and some worse (fast food, so so SO salty!)
* My smell is back, there are so many smells out there! And my hands and clothes don't rake of smoke anymore.
* Increased sex drive

What helped:

* Water, chewing gum
* This sub
* Allen Carr (read only parts of the book but got the message)
* whyquit.com and Joel's videos
* Realising what is a trigger and why they make me wanna smoke, what is a crave and that it only lasts 3 minutes; basically - KNOWLEDGE about smoking cessation and nicotine
* realising I can't have another puff ever. And turns out I don't want to!
* No going out for the first two weeks, avoided bars for 1.5 months.
* Quiiting app; I use get rich Or Die Smoking on Android
* Rewarding myself
* Badge on this sub
* /r/getmotivated
* Thinking of myself as a non-smoker

Thanks, guys and gals!!!

Trying to quit... Again

I recently started the process of quitting once again. I'm new to reddit and I found this subreddit and I thought this would be a good outlet if I'm having a craving or things are getting hard. I hope this helps in my process. So real quick here's my story. 
I'm 23, I've been smoking and/or dipping since I was 18. I promised I would stop after college and it's been about 3 months since I graduated and finally got the nerve to do it. Last time I quit I was nicotine free for 3-4 months and I don't remember how I started again. This time I want to make it last. 
I'm currently about 36 hours into the process. I'm using the patch, which worked last time, and I'm starting to want my after work smoke. It's nothing I can't handle, but I know it's going to get worse before it gets better. I hate being controlled by something so stupid as cigarettes, and it's not who I want to be. I'll be honest, I'm afraid to fail, I'm afraid to disappoint my family and friends, and I'm afraid to let myself down. 
To everyone starting this journey with me I wish you the best of luck, and to those who are already months, or even years smoke free congratulations. I hope to be there one day.

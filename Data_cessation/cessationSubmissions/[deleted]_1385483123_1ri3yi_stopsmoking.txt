Day 17.... new goal is Day 30

I'm on day 17 of quitting smoking.... Gotta tell you that this feels great and I love seeing my days go up on my badge. Since recovery is taking it one day at a time, I'm setting up a new goal for myself and that's to see it say 30 days after my badge. I can do it... that's about two weeks and it will fly by since thanksgiving is this week and then there's only one week left.

Can't say how excited I am! Thanks everyone on this sub for helping me quit and keeping me on the right track.

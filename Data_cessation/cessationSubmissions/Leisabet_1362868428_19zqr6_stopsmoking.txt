I seem to have accidentally quit smoking.

Hi everyone! 

I appear to have accidentally quit smoking, which is a pleasant surprise. I went out on Friday night and smoked about half a pack, and then woke up Saturday afternoon feeling terrible and really, *really* not wanting a cigarette. It's now Sunday morning and I still don't want one, so I guess I'll carry on and see how I go!

I guess there's a couple of extra factors contributing to the apparent ease of this so far: I'm on Zoloft and that's been known to help some people quit; and this is (I think?) my fifth try at quitting, so I know what I'm in for. Today I have a persistent cough and a sore throat, but I'm otherwise pretty cheerful. 

I'm mostly here in the hopes it'll stick this time - I know from previous experience that the danger period in resuming smoking for me is usually six months after I've quit, when I convince myself I can be a casual smoker. I really can't, it turns out. :)

Lovely to meet you all!

Day 6 the next support level

So this is my third attempt of quitting cigarettes for good. To be honest the first 4 days were easy peasy (luckily) but day 5 and today dayb 6 is a big struggle. I been chewing gun, and doing the pewpew shooting fingers (saw that somebody said that on a previous post snd it was hilariously comforting), but still could use some uplifting reminders, motivation and tips if there are any out there! Thanks!

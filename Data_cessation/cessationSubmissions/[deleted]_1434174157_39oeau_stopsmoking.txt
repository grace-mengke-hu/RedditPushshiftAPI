Words of encouragement welcome!

Hey /r/stopsmoking, I stumbled upon this sub about a month ago and you guys been my main support group while quitting. 
A week ago I woke up and decided that today was the day - I was done. I threw out the rest of my pack and told myself enough was enough. A few days later I went out and had some drinks with friends that regularly smoke. Each time they went out for a smoke, I instead hung out with the non-smokers inside. I felt great about myself the next day.
Throughout the next few days I felt many of the classic symptoms of kicking the habit - irritability, fatigue, restlessness - but I enjoyed those feelings and viewed them as accomplishments, it felt great. 

Tonight I screwed all of that up. 

After work I had a drink with a coworker and bummed two cigarettes off of her. I smoked them just like I used to, and it felt great. Afterwards I stopped to buy a pack without a care in the world about my previous week as a non-smoker. I smoked one on the way home before I realized what I was doing.

I guess I'm just looking for something to keep me going. I know this is not a simple habit to break and I know that you all have been/are in this fight with me.

If anybody has some tips on pushing through when you're struggling they are greatly welcomed!

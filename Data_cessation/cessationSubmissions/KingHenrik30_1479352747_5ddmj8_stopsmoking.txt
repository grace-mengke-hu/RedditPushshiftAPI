Whitesnake

I finished reading the book tonight and took a drive to have my final cigarette. I was listening to the radio and whitesnake came on. The line "an' i've made up my mind, i ain't wasting no more time" was playing as i was finishing up that final cigarette. It was almost symbolic, 7 years I've wasted smoking cigarettes and I've finally made the decision to quit. I am already enjoying being a non-smoker. Here's to night one!

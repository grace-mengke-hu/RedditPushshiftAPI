Bedroom exercises

So the girlfriend comes over last night to congratulate me for quitting, give me my present, yaknow.. she's very pleased and proud of me!

If I needed motivation to stay quit, this is it. Can anyone say increased circulation in the extremities. And lung capacity. Wow. 41-year-old checkin in mates, feeling 22 again, and even that's not quite right because I was smoking by then. More like 18.

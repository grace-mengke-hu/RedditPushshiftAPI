2 months free/eating healthy/working out - gf problems and fights, father dealing with cancer, mother with depression and 320lbs bro, I've fallen once again...

I'm writing about one of my best friends which I helped numerous times to quit smoking and however ... call it bad luck or just personal failure he always ends up buying another packet. A year later ... this guy managed to quit smoking once and for all and I just wanted to wish to all of you to find that inner power, that hidden beast and unleash to anything that's holding you back in life.

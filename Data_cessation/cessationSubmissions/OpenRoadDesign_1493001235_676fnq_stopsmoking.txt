Pondered it and re-set my badge.

This is not my first rodeo. I've tried to quit several times before. After reading everybody's comments and thoughts on my last post I think re-setting the badge will do me the most good. I think I've been too passive about my past quits and need to be more active in the quitting process. Doing the work, saying the mantras, taking notes and doing the challenges on my quit app. Here we go again!!! GIDDY UP!!

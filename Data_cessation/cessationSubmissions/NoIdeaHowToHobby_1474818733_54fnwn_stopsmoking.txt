Went to the place I use to buy cigarettes.

I went to the family owned gas shop for the first time since I quit and where I bought a pack a day for over a  year. The owner/clerk went to go grab a pack of southern cuts, I said" no thanks I quit just the Gatorade." He asked "You sure? I'll give you a good deal." I belly laughed and called him an asshole and left after paying. Business has been $7.16 slower for him each day. I don't count days, but I'd guess it's been 3 or 4 weeks. Each time I hear a friend cough or wheeze it's a reminder how glad I am to have that part of my life is behind me.

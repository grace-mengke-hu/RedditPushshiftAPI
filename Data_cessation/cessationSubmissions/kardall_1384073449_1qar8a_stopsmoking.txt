C25K Marker while Quitting

So, it is the 7th day (technically 8th since it's 1:47am) but I just got finished running in -5 and lightly snowing weather for 20 minutes. I did the whole drinking thing tonight, decided that before I sleep I would do a big huge honkin run to celebrate.

I have never done more than 10 minutes. Tonight I went through 20 minutes of music (ending with the Final Countdown) almost perfectly on time with the road just outside my place. Was a good one :)

Now I am exhausted, but I wanted to post this and say, it's honestly one of the better things I personally have done. When I get a really bad craving, I am going running.

Tonight was a trigger test, and I passed. I feel empowered that I can make it for 30min + driving without giving in now. So I think I will be good.

I will keep you all informed on progress as per normal throughout this. Hopefully someone will get something out of it :)

Btw, anyone in Alberta quitting or doing c25k :) heh

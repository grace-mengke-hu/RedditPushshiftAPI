Quitting American spirits...please help with support, similar experiences, anything!

I suppose the nature of quitting varies in difficulty from person to person, but has anyone found it particularly hard to quit smoking American spirits? Am I just crazy or does it seem like these cravings last literal hours and not "minutes?" And it feels like I'm mentally going off the deep end when I'm talking to people (being very awkward, anxious, laughing too much, etc lol), I'm jumpy all the time, can't breathe right, among many other symptoms. I actually used to dream about cigarettes, and then have to wake up for one in the middle of the night, it was that bad. And I am not/wasn't even a pack a day smoker at my worst - I smoke shorts - which would end up being half a pack a day (20x) per day. Now, during the summer, it has been about 5x a day, or 2.5 cigs and I still feel crazy withdrawals. It could possibly be the result of preexisting acute generalized anxiety which I've been self medicating for years with cigs, but I feel like it is so much easier for some people that I feel crazy mentioning exactly how crazy I feel when I don't smoke...and I'm only at the cutting down stage (tried cold turkey, caved tremendously. Couldn't even get through the day). Haven't smoked in seven hours and I feel like I've taken too much vyvanse or something and am freaking out kind of, but really don't wanna cave.
If this pertains to any of you or you have any tips, please help!

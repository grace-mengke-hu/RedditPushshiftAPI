Quit on 5/20/16

Smoked for 12 years.. turning 30 this year, this will be my 4th attempt (and last). The second time I attempted quitting, I succeeded for only 3 months. The app I am using called "smoke free" on Android has daily missions. Today's mission was to seek the company of quitters, and named this subreddit... I am new to reddit. Greetings all, here's to stopping the madness of smoking.

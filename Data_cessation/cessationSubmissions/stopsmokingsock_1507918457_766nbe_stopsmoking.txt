Day 1

It begins...

I've quit cold turkey about 5 times - all the way out to the 5-6 month mark when it's easy, and then I forget how much it sucked to quit (which really isn't THAT bad, but it certainly ruins a weekend).

I've only been smoking again about 1-2 a day for about a week, and honestly I don't think it's going to be that hard to hit the 72 hour mark when things start to get easier, but I'm posting because I want to make a commitment to make this the last time I have to go through withdrawals - ever.

No need to reply, just posting because writing it down feels like the start of something, and it's all mental gymnastics to quit anyway so everything helps.

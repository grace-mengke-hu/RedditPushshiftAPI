One week - made it!

Hot damn!  :). 

When I reflect back over the past 7 days, the freedom I’ve experienced from not smoking cigarettes, along with the happiness and support of my family, the pains of quitting are small in comparison.  

Thanks to all of you too for your support and well wishes.  It helps with this journey, which is far from over. I’m simply celebrating a tiny milestone along the way.

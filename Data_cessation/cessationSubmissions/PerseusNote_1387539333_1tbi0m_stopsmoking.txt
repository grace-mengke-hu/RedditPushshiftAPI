Ex smokers thoughts

I haven't had a cigarette in 4 years, but a few weeks ago I started smoking weed again after a 2 year pause and let me tell you: if FUCKEDUP my lungs and throat after just 9 days of smoking.

Given how similar the effects are to that of tobacco I figured it might be a nice reminder for you who are trying to quit cigs.

Literally for the first time in years I had to spit and there was *A LOT* of shit stuck in my throat. Had to repeatedly spit over and over for several days. It still hasn't gone back to normal yet.

It was just a very strong reminder of how fast smoking ANYTHING fucks up your throat and lungs. I cannot imagine just how much damage those 10 years of smoking cigs did to my throat when 9 days could cause that much trouble in my throat and lungs.

I'll never smoke weed again, vaporizing from now on.

in short: I AM GODDAMN happy I quit smoking and you will too.

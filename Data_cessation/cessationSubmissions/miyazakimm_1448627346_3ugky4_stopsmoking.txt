Can anyone relate to this?

Hey guys, its my first time posting here. I smoked for 6 years, quit for 6 months altogether, then had a few smokes here and there. 

The title I refer to is this: People that I think are awesome at their craft smoke cigarettes. I'm a jazz musician so many of idols smoke, even in this day and age. I've had the "pleasure" of sharing a cig with one of my idols a few years back. It was such a cool experience to meet this man. Everytime I relapse to smoking I have this image in my mind about this man and how cool it was that he smoked.

I just relapsed yet again because of this and feel like throwing up because of how the cigarette made me feel.

If you can relate or have a similar experience, leave a comment.
I really want to stop smoking. Have even read the Allen Carr's book. I guess I'm still brainwashed... :)

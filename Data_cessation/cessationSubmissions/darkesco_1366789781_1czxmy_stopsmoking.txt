3 weeks smoke-free. Almost done with the Chantix

I’ve been on Chantix for over 4 weeks and smoke-free for about 3 weeks. I started taking half doses yesterday and will continue for another week then I am done with daily Chantix. I do plan to keep some around for that emergency when I think a cigarette is worth starting this horrible cycle all over again. I really hate having to use a crutch, but knowing and preparing for weakness does not necessarily make you a weak person. There are many things I hold strength in, but smoke secession is not one of them. Either way, weak or not, I am going to win this time. With Chantix the easy part is the first month. I have cheated and slain the nicotine beast’s withdrawal attack. I am now suiting up for battle against the psychological side of this drug. Thank you for all your support here at r/stopsmoking.

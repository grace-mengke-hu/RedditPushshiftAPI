There was a post about not having as much fun when you do certain things without cigarettes. It's very unfortunate that it got deleted, but I hope the OP, and who ever else feels that way, gets a chance to read my thoughts on it, because it might help.

Okay, I wrote this in response to someone's post about feeling like something is missing when they were going out on weekends.

The brain is an amazing thing. It helps you remember stuff from when you were a little kid and figure out all sorts of neat things. It's also not a static thing, it changes all the time. 

Right now, your brain might still associate all those fun times with smoking. Even though you've gotten over your physical addiction, you still have all these mental connections with smoking and having fun on the weekends. They make you feel like you are missing something on a Saturday night, when you don't have a cigarette in hand. Here's the "hard work" part: you have to keep going out and having fun, without cigarettes, for your brain to get over that association. That's it. it just takes time to give your brain enough experiences for that association to go away. And it will.

Think about it, why do you have fun when you go out? Is it the booze? If so, why not just stay at home and drink alone? That's no fun. Is it the location? I dare you to go to a club on an off day, pay $7 for a beer in the empty bar and have a good time. No, it's the people you are with. That's why you are having fun. Being with friends, meeting new people, doing fun things.

 The cigarette never helped you have fun. Get it? I'll type it again:

**THE CIGARETTE NEVER HELPED YOU HAVE FUN.**

It was just along for the ride while you were there. Now that it's gone, you notice its absence.  You feel like you are missing something, but in reality, you are not. Your brain just hasn't figured it out yet; it will. Keep going out, keep having fun. With time, you'll be thinking less and less about the cigarettes. Eventually you won't even notice that you aren't smoking. 

Now here's the kicker, this is true for every aspect of your life. Stressful times. Romantic times. Your triumphant moments and your moments of defeat. Every time you don't smoke during one of them, you are physically changing something in your brain. You're re-wiring it. 

That's why cue induced cravings are so great (yes, I said they're great). Every time you don't smoke while having one; every time you don't smoke when you *think* a cigarette will make things better, more fun, easier, whatever; you are winning a small victory. 

That is what quitting smoking is, a long, long series of tiny, miniscule, uncelebrated victories (and also devastating, not so minor, defeats). It's a process, and the victories are hard won, and they go unnoticed by everyone else. You only win the war when you stop noticing the battles; and the battles become less and less frequent, and less and less difficult with time.

**TL;DR** Cigarettes never made things more fun, nor did it ever add to the fun. You need to keep having more fun times, without smoking, for your brain to stop associating fun times with cigarettes. So keep going out, keep having fun, and eventually you will stop thinking that you are missing something, because you aren't.

Extreme depression and anxiety

Hi guys.

I have been thinking about quitting smoking for a couple of years now. The reason I have not been successful this far is that the two times I have tried, I have broken down psychologically. While I can have some issues with self control, it has been easy forcing myself to stay off cigarettes despite the initial cravings, but both times I have decided to go back after about a week due to the severe (death related) anxiety I started having.

I start thinking about death and similar existential themes and it quickly becomes overwhelming. I can't shake it off at all, it is a 24/7 deal. All the time I am awake, I spend staring down the infinite emptiness of being dead for an eternity. Sometimes working out helps a little, but only for the duration of the workout, and I start feeling empty, afraid and anxious almost immediately after I stop running/biking/weightlifting or whatever I try to do. I have tried to exhaust myself to the point where I can't think afterwards, but it just does not help.

It hurts so bad, constantly, and I am afraid of trying to quit again because while I can deal with the physical pain, the emotional pain is so excruciatingly bad that I never want to experience something similar again.

Any advice?

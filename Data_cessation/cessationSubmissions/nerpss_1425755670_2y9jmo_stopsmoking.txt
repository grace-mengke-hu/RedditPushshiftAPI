Has anyone ever tried to make you feel stupid for quitting?

I went to the gas station I used to by smokes from every now and then and when the cute old lady teller asked if I needed any cigarettes, I told her that I quit. She kind of scoffed and looked at me like I was handicapped and went into this bullshit story about how she was diagnosed with lung cancer, told by her doctors to stop smoking, increased her intake from 1 to 2 packs a day, and the next time she went to the doc, her cancer was magically gone. I don't understand. I also have friends who've given me the "YEAH WELL YOU COULD GET HIT BY A BUS, ANYTHING CAN KILL YOU, I NEVER WANT TO QUIT" argument. Anyone else encounter idiotic bullshit like this upon quitting? Like you're an idiot for doing it?

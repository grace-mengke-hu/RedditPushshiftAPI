I quit back in 2016 but having cravings and really thinking about smoking.

I haven’t posted on this before as I didn’t know about this sub, but basically I quit on the 17/04/2016 and recently it seems that I am having so much more cravings than ever, I am having really realistic dreams of me buying a pack of cigs and just smoking them, I’m having crazy day dreams of filling my lungs up with smoke, it seems everyone around me smokes and everything I watch has subliminal messages for me to smoke and I really don’t know what to do, I am thinking of just snooping again, I need help!

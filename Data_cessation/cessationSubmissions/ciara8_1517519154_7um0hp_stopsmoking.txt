I thought cigarettes cause me anxiety and that's why I wanted to quit...but stopped smoking for 4 days and had more anxiety than ever..guess I have to find another reason to quit now :(

So I've been an on and off smoker for years...For the past year I've been convinced that cigarettes have been the sole cause of my anxiety. But it was weird - some days I could chain smoke and be fine..other days only 2 drags and it would start...very bad anxiety, panic, feeling sick, can't breathe..all that "fun" stuff. A few hours without a cigarette and I would be calm again..I found many forum threads and even studies that claimed cigarettes cause anxiety and quitting would stop it.

The days that I didn't smoke at all I would feel very calm and normal, which convinced me that cigarettes were the only cause of my anxiety and quitting would make it vanish. 

So I decided to quit. First day was very good, no anxiety whatsoever. But on the second and third day a weird anxiety appeared that was worse than ever and made me feel like I was loosing it..weird muscle tension and weakness, almost feeling paralyzed at times when lying down..also couldn't sleep..Then had 4 cigarettes and it went away..but of course I regret it and am quitting again now...I went to the doctor and had a battery of blood tests so everything seems fine..just anxiety. But it was such a disappointment - guess I have to accept that I simply have anxiety and that cigarettes are just a trigger and not a cause and look for other reasons to motivate me to quit. This sucks.

Don't know exactly why I'm posting this, I guess I'm just venting and maybe looking for people to share their experience with the connection between smoking (or quitting) and anxiety.

I have a question on the rules of the sub... Specifically about switching to vape and your badges of honor.

I switched to vape about 10 days ago. I had a pack of cigs last me 3 days during my transition, for the past 7 days I've been full vape, no cigs. 

My question is does this warrant a quit badge on here or no? I tried searching this in the sidebar search but couldn't find anything or I wasn't writing in the correct key words. 

I don't want to cheapen what many of you have accomplished by, as my one friend put it, "half quitting" but then again, having a pack or more a day for 10 years and not having any at all for the past 7 days, I'm pretty damn proud of myself. So I leave it to you guys I guess... 

Do those of us who switched deserve a badge or not?

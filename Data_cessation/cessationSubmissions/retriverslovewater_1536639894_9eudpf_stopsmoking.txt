It feels like it's time to take control.

I was working on quitting smoking, until today. Something upset me and I said I'm done. Today is day one for me. I'm a pack a day smoker. I'm going cold turkey. 

Here's to how I'll feel in a few years! I'm tired of this money pit vice. I've quit before, but this is the last time.

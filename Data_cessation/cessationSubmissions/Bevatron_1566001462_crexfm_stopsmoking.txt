160 days in, struggling

100% looking for some one to talk me down here.  Had a day so bad... I don't even know.  And then of course I decided some beer would help.  My resolve is gone.  My biggest reasons for quitting (to simplify, let's say "relationships") has dissolved.  I cannot think of a single reason why NOT to go have a cigarette.  I am even fairly convinced that I could really just smoke tonight and then be done.  This is my last shot in stopping myself.  Anyone?

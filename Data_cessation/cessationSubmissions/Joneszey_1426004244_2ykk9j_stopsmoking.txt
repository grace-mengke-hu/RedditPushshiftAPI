What does a badge mean?

It's an honest question. The community seems confused. Does smoking but feeling like a non-smoker make you a non-smoker? If 1 day of withdrawal feels like 20 are you 20 days quit? What does a badge mean to you and when should you reset a badge? Or maybe a better question: when should you not reset a badge?

Four days: the good, the bad, and the SWEATY

Hey everyone. So I quit again on Sunday after about two years since my previous quit. I basically went to a huge party on Friday night, smoked my brains out, smoked the next day ("hangover day") and then didn't when I woke up on Sunday, and haven't since. Things are actually going really well. It's kind of bizarre that things have happened the way they have, but I remember even at the party thinking about stopping (as we all do, as we sit and smoke, feeling like shit). I re-read Allen Carr's book on Sunday as well. I simultaneously quit smoking pot, at least for now, because I live in a country where the cultural thing to do is to smoke pot in spliffs mixed with tobacco, and if I'm serious about kicking it, then I need to not take half-measures. I am not philosophically against smoking marijuana, but until I get a good foundation of healing for my body, and maybe a vape....anyway. 

Otherwise, things are mostly good for the moment: I'm seeming to re-adjust to my daily motions of life without my little pouch of tobacco and associated supplies.

I've quit smoking beforeâ€”I think three times? But what is striking to me this time is the goddamn night sweats! Every night since Sunday, I have woken up at 4am, wet as if I had thrown myself in a lake, with my sheets and pillows not far behind. In reading around, I see that it's not uncommon, although it is unsettling to me. Possibly it's accentuated because I'm stopped smoking pot as well? In any case, I was wondering if you guys know of any way to curb these humid little bastards: herbs, etc? I sure hope they stop soon...because yeah: here it is, 5am, and I'm just waiting for my bed to dry out.... :)

Day 2 cravings while driving (e-cig helped)

I have been using a an e cig whenever I feel as if I am going to crack.  Driving back and forth from lunch to work was tough today, but I took a few puffs of the e smoke, and my craving subsided.  Are e-cigs kind of cheating?  I really don't use it that often, but it really helped today.  I usually just chew gum or sunflower seeds to get my mind off smoking.

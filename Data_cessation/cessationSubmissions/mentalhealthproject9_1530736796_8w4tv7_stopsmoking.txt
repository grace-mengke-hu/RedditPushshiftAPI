University student working on mental health/addiction/learning disability project

Hi everyone! Do you or a friend/family member struggle with a mental health condition/mental illness such as (but not limited to) depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar disorder, or an eating disorder? What about autism/aspergers, dyslexia, or a learning disability? Addiction? I am a university student currently working on a project to fight the stigma around mental illness and am looking for people willing to share their stories through personal essays, artwork, poems, short stories, song lyrics, photography, etc. Another option would be to share your story through answering questions sent through email. Mental health struggles are heartbreaking and extremely stressful--but there is always a way to heal and/or adapt. More attention needs to be brought to the stories of survival, creativity and achievement in times of adversity—if you would like to submit something, please email me at [mentalhealthproject9@outlook.com](mailto:mentalhealthproject9@outlook.com) for more information! If you don’t feel comfortable using your name, feel free to email me anonymously! I understand that this is a sensitive topic and more of you are willing to share if your name isn’t tied to something.

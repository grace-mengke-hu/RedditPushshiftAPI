Intense smoke dream

So I had this dream, where for some reason I had a surprise trip from work to go the casino town that is 90 minutes from here.  They were taking me out there on the "fun bus" that runs from here to there.  Long story short, in this dream I smoked a bunch of cigarettes (despite missing the bus, but hey, it's a dream).

Here is the strange part.  I woke up with a throat full of phlegm, barely able to breath, just like I was for 3 days when I relapsed 3 months ago.  Now I'm wondering if my body physically reacted to the dream, or if the dream was caused by my physical state.  Let's do some armchair science.  Who thinks the dream was caused by my physical state and who thinks my physical state was triggered by my dream?

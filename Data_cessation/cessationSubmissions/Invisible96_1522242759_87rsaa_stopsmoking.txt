"Smoker's Flu"

Hi guys,

I switched from cigs to nicotine gum about a week ago, and I smoked my last half-cig on Saturday. Yesterday I fell out of bed throwing up with diarrhoea, then was aching and feverish all day. I thought it was probably a bug but it came with feeling depressed and my normal MH symptoms were noticeably worse. I've not been remotely tempted to smoke again, and food is the last thing on earth I even want to think about. I literally feel more like I'm dying now than when the cigarettes were killing me! 

I'm going to keep active and try to eat where I can, as well as keeping hydrated. To be honest I want to quit nicotine altogether and get this over with. Does anyone have any other tips or general kind of moral support? It's cliche but my god, if I'd known then I'd never have started!

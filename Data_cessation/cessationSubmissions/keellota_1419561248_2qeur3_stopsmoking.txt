Yep, so smoking that one cig does not, in fact, help.

In short, had a fucked up xmas with the fam, decided to go buy cigs.

The universe even tried to stop me: two gas stations I went to were closed; when I finally found an open station, the line was atrociously long; it didn't have my usual (AS, cyan pack); got in the car and fucking dropped the lighter under the seat, had to pull over to find it; and of course, in the process, the cig set aside dropped out of the other seat-- had to find it, too.

Over the course of that thirty minutes, I could've decided it was a bad idea-- I'm already five days in, what a waste, right? But, I didn't. So I lit up, finished the cig, then proceeded to drive home, at which point I had another. No buzz, no stress relief. I guess it mellowed me slightly, but it only got rid of some mental withdrawal; the stress from the holidays is still very much there, and I can confirm that having that cig did not help. 

It wasn't worth it. End result: I'm at day 0.

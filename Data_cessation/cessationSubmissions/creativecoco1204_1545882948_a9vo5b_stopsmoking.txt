Thoughts and advice on NRT

I’m on the path to another quit. It’s hard to be here, but cold turkey isn’t working for me anymore. I want to try an NRT, but not sure where to start. Everyone talks a lot about vaping on here, and I want something that I can adjust how much nicotine I’m getting. Any products out there that you recommend?

I consider myself a light smoker, 3-5 cigs a day, more if I’m out drinking.

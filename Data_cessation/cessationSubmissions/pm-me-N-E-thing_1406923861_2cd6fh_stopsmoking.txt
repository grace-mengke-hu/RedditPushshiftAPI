How to quit/fight addiction/stages of addiction

lurked on reddit for quite some time. finally decided to create one. never posted until today. anyhoo.....

I have smoked since I was in 8th grade. now a rising junior in uni/college (whatever the veteran redditors use to refer to college.) smoking became such a regular habit so I smoke often such as after I wake up, after I eat, when driving, when bored, socially, while drinking, etc. I cant seem to shake it because it follows me everywhere. The longest i have ever gone without smoking is about 3 days and that was long ago. yesterday I tried to see how long i could go without smoking and i made it through the whole day. I was easily irritated by stupid customers at work, my girlfriend who spend the rest of the day with, wanted to munch on snacks all day, and other textbook side effects of not having my regular fix. today, something possessed me to go to the back (of where i work) and light a cigarette. how do you fight the urges and how do you stay calm when irritated or when feelign overwhelmed?

Tonight's the night

Hi, 

I moved in my own apartment a week ago and today i unpacked some books and found Allen Car's book that a friend bought for me 2 years ago.

Decided to read it again, and right now i think i'm finally ready to quit.

i've been thinking about it for weeks now but i threw all my cigs this afternoon and starting tomorrow i'll do my best to don't have any cigarettes, wish me luck !

P.S : First post in this subreddit but i've been here a few times to read all the stories, it also gave me hope in trying to quit smoking again ;)

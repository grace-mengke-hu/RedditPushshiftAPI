Feeling minor delirium after quitting??

I'm over a week into my quit. I vape to help with withdrawals.

But I've noticed I'm starting to get what appears to be minor delirium. I'll get scared by like minor changes in things. I'll think weird thought. 

It just feels like I'm kinda going crazy to an extent. My anxiety and panic levels have been through the roof. Even though I still have a vape that has nicotine in it to help.

Any advice for enduring this? It makes me literally want to get Xanax or something to keep me calm until the symptoms go away.

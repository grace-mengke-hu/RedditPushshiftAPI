Feeling In My Chest?

I don't know if I'm unique in this, but every time I try to quick, I'll get a few days to a week in without smoking and I'll start to get this feeling in my chest. It's as if there's a pressure building up in my chest, as if my heart is being squeezed, and the more I try to ignore it, the worst it starts to feel. The only way I can get rid of it is by smoking. I've talked to a few people about this and they'll either tell me this feeling is anxiety or this feeling is withdrawals (this is from non smokers, so I'm not too sure about that). What I wanted to know is, have any of you also had this feeling when you quit and, if you did, how did you deal with it?

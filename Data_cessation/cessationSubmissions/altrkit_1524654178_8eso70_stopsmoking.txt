RELAPSED!!

I feel so ashamed typing this: After quitting for 60+ hours i gave in to a craving and had 1 than 2,3 and 4 cigarettes. Its like i was deceiving myself for the last three days that i can do it. I dont know what to do now. My ******* mind is saying now that you have broken it lets buy a pack. U will never break this habbit. What do i do, i feel like crying. Maybe ill die as a smoker. My mind is saying that you have already ruined it had a few before starting over, but thought of a cigarette is disgusting at this moment.

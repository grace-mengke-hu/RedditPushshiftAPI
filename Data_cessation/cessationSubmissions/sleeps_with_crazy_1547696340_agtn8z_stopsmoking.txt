Stop Smoking App Notifications

Do any of you actually like having those apps notify you about your progress?

I've been completely smoke free for 3 days (after far longer of being pack+ a say than I care to admit) and of course when I stopped I got one of those apps.

Just a few minutes ago, it felt the need to notify me that I had officially gone 72 hours without a cigarette.  Which is great and all, but I'd *finally* hit the point where I was constantly thinking about smoking and the notification basically just made things worse.

Anyway, mostly just wanted to vent a bit, but I am curious if any of you like these notifications or if maybe they become a 'good thing' further into the quitting process.

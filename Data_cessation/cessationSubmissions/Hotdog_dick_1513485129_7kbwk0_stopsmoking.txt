Smoke and dip

I've been wanting to quit for awhile but I'm about as heavily addicted to nicotine as you can get. I dip all day while working/chilling whatever and when I don't have a dip in I'll smoke a cig every half hour. I've been dipping for 7 years every day. Go through about a can every 2 days if not less. I'm so used to it I feel like I can't think properly when I don't have a dip in. Wondering what REALLY works for you guys. Cold turkey is such a daunting task I've tried and failed. 
Maybe I don't have the mindset yet but tobacco seems to be a huge crutch for me. Any advice would be welcomed.

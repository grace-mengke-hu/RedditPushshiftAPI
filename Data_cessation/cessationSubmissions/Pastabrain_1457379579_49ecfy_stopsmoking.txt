I made it here

Im not somebody who has been smoking cigarettes for ages, it was more an on and off thing four the last for years. More off though.
Ive now been working abroad for a few months and will be back in a few days. I smoked on a more regular basis here, usually when I was drinking and if not it would be like 2-3 cigarettes a day to very certain times. Thats due to the rythm I developed here.
I tried to quit here, but the way its part of the daily routine proves to be an obstacle. I also noticed that it is not about the nicotine actually, but all about the ritual of smoking.
Im not really sure how to handle the fact that something is amiss if I dont smoke after working/showering. I thought about replacing it by reading for a bit at exactly these times for example.
Also I will be back home soon where everything is going to be oh ao different, no rythm every day as it was here, so maybe just take that as the point to stop?

Some feedback would be highly appreciated, thanks so much! Also, respects to all you guys and sorry for the terrible formatting Im only mobile at the moment and overall quite shit at that.

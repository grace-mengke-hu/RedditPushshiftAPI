Anyone using Wellbutrin, Chantix or Bupropion to help stop smoking?

I have been a smoker for 26 years and I asked my doctor for Wellbutrin to help me quit smoking although I did not like the side effects when I tried it 10 years ago.  I ended up with the generic "Bupropion HC WL" 150 mg 1x per day.  I have to say that the Bupropion did not have the same effect where I physically could not smoke within the first 2 weeks as it did when taking Wellbutrin.  I don't recall what my Wellbutrin dosage was 10 years ago, but it was really miracolous on how I could not even lift a cigarette to my mouth.  I did not have the same effect with Bupropion but I stuck to my quit date and have been a non-smoker for 6 days now.  I think the bupropion is taking the "edge" off but I'm not sure.  Wanted to see what experiences anyone else was having with these medications.

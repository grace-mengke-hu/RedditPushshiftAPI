I had a puff of a cigarette...

But I won't reset my badge today. If anything, this moment confirmed why I don't smoke anymore. A completely pleasureless and empty experience. And to think, I did it because I was having a GREAT day! Not a stressful day, I wasn't bored, but out of celebration because I was feeling good. 

Another lesson learnt.

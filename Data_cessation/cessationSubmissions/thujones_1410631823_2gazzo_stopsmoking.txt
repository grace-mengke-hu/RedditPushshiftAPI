What have you been doing with the money you have been saving?

I for one have been kind of treating myself :-) I do things now that I would not have 2 months ago!  Buying silly things like WoW pets, double cheese burgers, soy milk, bicycle parts, legos, etc.

One thing I have noticed with the money I have saved is the ability to absorb alot more of the crap things life throws at you speaking financially and mentally.

Case in point, I had to take my cat to the vet last week which wound up in total costing about 1500 bucks.  Its not that I have saved that much money, but its not such a daunting type of thing to pay off anymore.  Good feeling all around!

It is still kind of weird to look in my bank account and see leftover money..makes me feel like I forgot to pay a bill or something.

I am off to the electronic store to see what the stuff on my Amazon wish list looks like in person!

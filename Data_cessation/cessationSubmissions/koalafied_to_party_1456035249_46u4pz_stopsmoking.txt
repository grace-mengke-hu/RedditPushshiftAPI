Day 21 here

Might not seem like a lot but it feels like a lot and to the super newbies, it probably does sound like a lot. Just wanna share what I do when I have a craving: I indulge myself, I think about taking a cigarette out of it's pack and lighting it and holding it between my fingers and it all sounds so satisfying. *Until* I go through the actions of inhaling. It sounds so baaaaaad, dude. Filling my clear ass lungs with smoke and imagining how bad it tastes... It makes want to puke. If you have gotten to the point of having all the nicotine cleared from your body (just a few days on average) and have relapsed, you know what I'm talking about. It hurts and feels like shit to start smoking. Just be honest with yourself. At best, cigarettes make you pretty tired and at their worst, they make you vomit (I mean, at their *worst* they give you fucking cancer and copd.... But we're addicts we don't care about that shit). Nothing good comes of 'em. 

Good luck with all your quits! Love y'all

Quitting Again

I quit on Nov 2, 2013, and then started smoking sometime last year.  I gave up a three year quit, only to find myself suffering through the first week of quitting again.  Nicotine makes us do the craziest things.  NO MORE!  I want my freedom back!  I quit on Sep 14, 2017.  I am hoping and praying that this is my forever quit!

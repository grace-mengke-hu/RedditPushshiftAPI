I'm back for the millionth time

Somehow I managed to quit drinking, but I still can't completely quit cigarettes. My addiction is weird, I can go a week without smoking but come the weekend I'm back on it. 

Somehow I just can't break this cycle! I've read Allen Carr's Easy Way about three times, I've been on here for years. I don't know what keeps drawing me back. 

My bf quit over a year ago, but I somehow clung on. Anyway, I want to done for good. I am at day three, but as I said, I've managed many weeks free, I just fall apart at the weekends. 

I don't even have the excuse of being drunk, because I quit drinking over a year ago! Anyway thought instead of just lurking I'd actually post here, and see if that makes the difference. 

Wish me luck!

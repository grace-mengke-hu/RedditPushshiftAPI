6 days and I put my fate in hands of my favourite sports team.

I stopped smoking last Sunday (3-4 a day, more at the weekends) and was finding today very difficult, drinking, having a meal with friends, watching football (soccer). I nearly broke, so I made the deal with myself that if Manchester United get into the FA cup final, I will soldier on, if not I'll cave.

Anthony Martial scored the winner with 45 seconds to go. United won 2-1.

It's stupid, but I found it helped me when I nearly broke. Onwards and upwards!

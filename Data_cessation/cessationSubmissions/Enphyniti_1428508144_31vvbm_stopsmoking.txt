Why is this suddenly so hard??

I'm about 20 days in with none.  Somewhere around 40 days with less than 10.  I've been doing great and feeling great, but lately (the last few days or so) something feels different.  I'm getting stronger urges to step outside.  I'm using NRT patches and have stepped down to the 14mg patches for the last four weeks or so.

Maybe it's just spring...  I don't know.  I'm just finding it more distracting lately, and needed to share.

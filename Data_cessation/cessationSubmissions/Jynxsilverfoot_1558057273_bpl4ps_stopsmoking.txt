Day 1

Today I broke my last pack and tossed em. 16 year smoker, pack a day. I'm planning on sleeping as much as possible this weekend and just trying to ride out the initial shockwave. Hubba Bubba gum on me at all times. Pushups when I feel weak for too long. The dog is curled up in the blankets trying to get to my pocket full of gum. Day 2 here we come.

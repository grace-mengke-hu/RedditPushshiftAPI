Temptation overcame... and I fell... twice

Quit about 4 months ago, feeling very proud... but in the last couple of weeks IÂ´ve been to a couple of partys (my brother is getting maried), been drinking a lot...
To make it short; I smoked two ciggarets, in two weeks time. Felt bad about it afterwards, nausea and upset stomach. 
I dont think Ill do it again.
Not reseting my badge though...

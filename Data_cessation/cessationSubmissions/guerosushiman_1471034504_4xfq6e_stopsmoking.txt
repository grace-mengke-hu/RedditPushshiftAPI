Finally made it

Hey guys, I don't post here often, but wanted to check in to say thank you for helping me get to my one year mark. I never thought I was going to beat the little nicotine monster.

To those still struggling, stay strong. It sucks ass right now, but it gets so much better. After a few weeks you'll begin to wonder why you waited so long to stop in the first place. You can do it, we can all become non smokers.

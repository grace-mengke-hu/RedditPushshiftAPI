Did not smoke despite being in a smoking area!

I did end up using again a couple hours ago, but I was able to not have cravings while people were blowing smoke in my face. How terrible it smelled, whereas it always made me want to smoke.

I plan to give it a shot again tomorrow. It's a struggle!

No that isn't what drove me to use again. I just had a really long fucking call while I was trying to nap lol

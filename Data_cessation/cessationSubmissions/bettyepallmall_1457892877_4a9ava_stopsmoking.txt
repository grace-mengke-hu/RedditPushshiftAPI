Went to the bar and came home smelling disgusting.

Last night was the first time I went to a bar that allowed smoking indoors since I quit. I was a little worried at first but I did just fine. Even hung out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while who were practically chain smoking. I didn't smoke, didn't even want to. Then when I got home I could smell the smoke on me from the bar and it smelled terrible. It's so crazy that I used to smell like that all the time and never noticed.

Feeling good, and this is my longest quit to date. Just wanted to share my success!

Withdrawal anxiety???

I’ve had anxiety my whole life but the anxiety I’ve been having in the past 4 days (I’m four days quit). Feels different, I don’t really know how to describe it but I think it’s from withdrawal. Does anyone know when this particular anxiety will stop/when the emotional symptoms lessen?

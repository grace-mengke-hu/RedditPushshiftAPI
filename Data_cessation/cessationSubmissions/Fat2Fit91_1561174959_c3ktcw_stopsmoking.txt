Before you continue to smoke, think about how it may affect others.

I'm a non-smoker (have never smoked in my life), however, my father always was. I just wanted to share a story summed up shortly about the time I was hospitalized because of my father's smoking habits. So after years of living with my father on weekends (parents are divorced and had shared custody when I was a minor), I ended up hospitalized with all sorts of symptoms such as skin rash, difficulty breathing, itchy skin, headaches, nausea, etc.

For a long time I thought it was something else undiagnosed but it turns out I was allergic to tobacco after having an allergy test. It made sense considering my symptoms only occurred shortly after inhaling my father's smoke. And before anyone tells me I should have walked away, well first of all, I didn't even know it was the smoke I was allergic to (before getting tested). Secondly, there were many times when my father smoked in the house (especially when raining outside) and car while driving me somewhere so walking far away wasn't really an option.

Fortunately, after the diagnosis he became much more cautious, especially before I moved out for college. Even better is the fact that he's currently doing his best to quit which definitely helps when I visit during breaks to spend time with family. Unfortunately, I still have to deal with people in public who smoke. Yes, I understand we're free to do what we want, but what drives me up the wall is (for example) when I'm sitting at a bench waiting for the bus and there a multiple empty benches that spread far and someone who is smoking heads over and decides to sit right next to me. If I were them (the one smoking), I would at least keep my distance from everyone while smoking and consider the health effects it could have on others as well if I were to literally walk right next to them (when there's tons of space).

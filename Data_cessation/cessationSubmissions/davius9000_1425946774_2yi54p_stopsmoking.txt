I need advice on getting over a hump that I'm stuck on

Hey guys this is my first time posting here so give me all you got! So I'm proud of the fact that I have cut down on smoking pretty well. I am down to 3 or 4 a day.  I go all evening and night without lighting one up. There are urges but I am doing well at getting through them. 

Then I go to work. Without fail I smoke a cig at ten, right after lunch, and then one more at three. This is when it sometimes feels impossible not to smoke. All my coworkers smoke making it even harder. The problem is I have to go out on break with them because at our job that's when we do a lot of planning. Do you guys have any recommendations on what to do out there to try to help me not smoke? 

I feel so close to being able to stop but those urges at work get the best of me more times than not. 

Thanks guys!

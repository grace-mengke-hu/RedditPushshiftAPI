The weekend is upon us.. Prepare for battle!

Every fucking week I attempt to stop smoking on a Sunday. Every fucking week I fail the next Friday. We all know how hard it is to deny a smoke in a bar when we're stumbling to find our footing and the urge is there. This weekend is different though.. BECAUSE I FUCKING QUIT. I will deny any cigarette I possibly come across. Especially from that smoking hot babe who is practically forcing herself on me (mostly because that never happens). This is going to be the beginning of the end! Cheers boys/girls, I see the light!

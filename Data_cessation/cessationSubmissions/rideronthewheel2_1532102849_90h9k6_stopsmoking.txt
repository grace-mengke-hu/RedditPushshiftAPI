How long does withdrawal really last? Can I really quit or am I destined to be a smoker forever?

Maybe the past few months I've tried to quit 30 times or more. I've heard that after 2 or 3 days you still have another 4 or 5 weeks before it gets any better. I'm honestly starting to think I won't be able to kick the habit. I've read Alan Carr (multiple Alan Carr books), I even went to one of their seminars a long time ago, I've tried laser therapy and I've tried cold turkey a lot of times. The first day is fine but then I wake up in a different mind-set and don't care as much anymore about my 'resolve to quit' and can rarely (if ever) go the morning without smoking. I've smoked for 20 years and I smoke about 2 packs a day or so. Less when I'm working but again I have concerns about working and not smoking and how hard that would be. Any help/advice or feedback for my situation would be awesome. Thank you.

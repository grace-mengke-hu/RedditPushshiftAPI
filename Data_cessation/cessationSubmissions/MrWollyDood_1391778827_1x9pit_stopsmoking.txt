Last night I smoked...

I was at a party, I was drunk and I couldn't stand the cravings. I felt a very very deep low and a great disgust, the taste was damn awful too. 
Two months of no smoking went down the drain, what a shame...

...and then I woke UP!
And damn, it was so good to realize I'm so much stronger in reality than inside my dreams! So good to be free!
Cheers!


Edit: 

I see a lot of you guys have these dreams, this is so interesting! 

Brains love patterns and hate change, they'll do anything do get us back to our old habits.

Cravings are used against us, to keep us from changing, but they end up making us stronger. Then we're lured with oneiric figures of our old selves, but instead of relapse, they trigger disgust. In the end, the old self vanishes with its flawed qualities in the depths of our subconscious mind.
And with the rise of our new, better self, the brain learns a valuable lesson: we're still here after we change, there's nothing to fear - change is not death.

When the heart tells you there's time for a change, the battle should begin brothers&sisters, and our greatest strength becomes the enemy!

The brain.

Love you all, never give up!

Nicotine Smell

Obviously when you quit, the smell of nicotine is noticeable.  It's practically imperceptible when you're regularly smoking.  On previous stop attempts I've found the smell to be quite horrible, whilst the actual smell of smoking itself was still appealing and nice (weird, I know).  However, this time around, I'm actually finding that I LIKE the smell of nicotine as well.  It's very odd.  It's not that it's making me want to smoke.  Well, it's not making it any worse, put it that way.  Anyone else found this?  I thought I would just hate the smell again.

Half a year!!

Hey guys!

It has been 6 months since I have quit smoking! The only way I can describe it is by saying that I feel free. My health has majorly improved. It was rough at the beginning but I had family support and encouragement to keep me on the right track.
It is tough to quit but it is worth it in every way. You guys are all strong and have my full support!

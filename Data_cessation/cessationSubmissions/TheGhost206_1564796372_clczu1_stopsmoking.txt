How in the world does anyone quit smoking if they are a regular drinker?

Has anyone who drinks 15-20 units per week been able to quit? I pretty much only smoke when I'm drinking but it seems so impossible to actually quit with alcohol in my life. If I don't drink for a few days cigarettes seem like nothing. Fuck.

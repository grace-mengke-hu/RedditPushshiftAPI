A little update for my 3rd day smoke free!

I posted a couple days ago on my first full day without smoking and said to you guys that my plan was to be without my vape today but my cravings were so bad today I couldn't resist the vape but I'm still completely smoke free and haven't even thought about buying a pack! Today as a little self motivator I'm going to look at a really nice car and the fact that I'm not going to be smoking in it if I buy it I just wanted to thank all of you for being so supportive of me and my quiting plan! Im really happy I found this sub it has honestly changed my whole look on smoking and that I'm not the only one dealing with this! Thanks again!!

Can I really do this?

Hi Friends, I hope it's ok to vent here after 48 hours of no cigs....

About a month ago, I found this sub and decided to quit smoking.  At the time, all these strange coincidences were happening and it felt like the universe was telling me I needed to stop smoking (I know that sounds very woo-woo, insert eye roll here).  But really, over the course of a few days, 2 books I was reading that had nothing to do with quitting smoking made passing references to quitting smoking.  Then I was scrolling through reddit main page and saw that someone posted a screen shot of their quitting smoking app.  So I subscribed to the sub, downloaded the app and only made it one day.   I then deleted the app and continued smoking all while feeling terrible about myself.

I've been smoking on and off for 14 years.  About 7 years ago, I read the Allen Carr book with a boyfriend I had at the time and it really helped us.  Smoking slowly crept back into my life but for years, I would never buy them (I'd only bum off other people while I was drinking).  About 2 years ago, I started smoking more, but it was probably about a pack a week so felt manageable to me.   Now I'm at about half a pack a day and becoming a lot more worried about my health.

I tried to reread the Allen Carr book, I know it's helped me before and people swear by it.  I agree with so much in that book, but guys.... the writing is god awful.  The message is so good, but I find it so painful to read.  I get that it's repetitive to try and reverse our brainwashing about smoking, but there is a way to say the same thing in different words.  I've picked it up a few times over the last few months but I wonder if it's only effective the first time you read it? Are there other books I could try as I really love to read?

In October, I attempted the Whole 30 and didn't smoke or drink for 19 days (I didn't make it to 30 days but going to try again soon!).  I found the restricted diet on Whole 30 pretty easy and was surprised that I didn't miss drinking too much.  But the whole time I wanted to smoke, I knew I was going to go back to smoking once I finished.  I didn't experience any of the benefits of quitting that people talk about on this sub.  It scares me to think that even if I successfully quit, I'm always going to want to smoke.

This past Friday night I was at dinner with my boyfriend's family.  There were about 12 of us and some people were running late, it also took the restaurant a long time to bring our food.  I sat there waiting, crawling out of my skin, wanting a cigarette, it was really embarrassing.  I wasn't enjoying being with this great group of people all because I wanted to go out for a smoke.  I now haven't had a cigarette in 48 hours and reminding myself how I felt that night has been really helpful.  I want to be present with the people around me, not halfheartedly talking to them while I wish I was smoking...

I'm trying to encourage myself that I can really quit smoking, but I don't think I fully believe it.  From the outside looking in, other people seem to think I'm very capable of doing anything I put my mind to.  Though I see how much I struggle with my self esteem.  In everything I've accomplished, I simultaneously believed I could and couldn't do it.  And my lack of self esteem doesn't really allow my to enjoy it when I do accomplish things.  For example, I got out of $30k of debt in 11 months, surpassed the $100k income mark before age 30, took a 2 month sabbatical to walk the Camino (500 mile trek across Spain), moved to Cincinnati from NYC and convinced my company to let me work remotely, bought a house by myself, fulfilled my dream of adopting the perfect dog, found myself a perfect midwestern gentlemen willing to date me.  Just recently I completed a School of Rock program where I practiced for 4 months to sing 7 songs in front of 100 people.  I don't mean to sound like I'm bragging, my point is despite being extremely fortunate, I still find reasons to be disappointed in myself.  It seems like quitting smoking shouldn't be nearly as hard as the other things I've done, and so I use this struggle as evidence that I'm a failure.  I'm currently trying to launch a conference (side hustle/passion project) less then a year from now and need to attract an audience of 700 people.  How the hell am I supposed to do that when I can't even quit smoking?!?!

Sorry for the word salad, to a stranger on the internet, I'm sure I'm coming off as a spoiled ungrateful brat.  I recognize that, and I'm working on it, so please be nice.

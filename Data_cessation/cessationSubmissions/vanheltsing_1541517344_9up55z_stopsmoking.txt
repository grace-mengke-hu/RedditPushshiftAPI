How do you improve your lung capacity?

Hi! 

Sorry if unrelated. First, for all of you quitting, go you!! I was once a slave of my habits and trust me, yes you can!

I think I stopped smoking almost 4 years ago. During this time I had tried on and off to start working out but the one thing I had noticed is that my lungs seem to have less capacity that the rest of my body. A lot of times, when Iâ€™m running, If I stop at the 10/20 minute mark It is usually because I feel my lungs on fire.

Any tips or tricks? I do not want to run the Ny marathon but I would love to be able to run 30 minutes without remembering the 15+ years I smoked.

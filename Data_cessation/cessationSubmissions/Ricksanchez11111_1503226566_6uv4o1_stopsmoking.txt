2 weeks and I feel awesome

Hi fellas!

I've [25M] been a smoker for the last 2 years. I decided to stop 2 weeks ago. Quitting smoking is the best decision I have ever made.


My hands, breath, hair and clothes don't stink anymore. My wallet is no longer empty. I walk to places without feeling exhausted. I can workout in the gym for a long time without getting easily tired. I feel more active and sexually powerful. I don't feel like a weak, addicted piece of shit anymore. I enjoy EVERYTHING as I did before. And that's only 2 weeks... I can't wait to see the improvement when more time passes. I am getting MY LIFE back!!!


In my case, what helped me overcome the cravings of the first days was:


-Willpower (keep thinking how miserable you feel when you smoke).

-Drinking a lot of water.

-Exercising (weightlifting, cardio, swimming... Or any sports you like).


I encourage everybody who smokes to quit as soon as you can. Tobacco is a poison. It fools your brain, making your ability to experimenting pleasure dependent on deadly chemicals. Besides, it's a suicide in terms of both health and your personal finances.


Quit smoking. Enjoy your life again.

Good luck to everyone!

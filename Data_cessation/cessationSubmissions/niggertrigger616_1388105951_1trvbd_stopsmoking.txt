dread day three

Day 3 has been proving quite the challenge. I never have a problem with the physical aspects, like headache, or even the fogginess (sort of felt like being stoned), but holy fuck mentally I keep glamorizing it. I'm hunkered down at home, and several times I've been close to going out to the store.

Fucking fuck shit balls. I would kill for some weed or nitrous oxide right about now.

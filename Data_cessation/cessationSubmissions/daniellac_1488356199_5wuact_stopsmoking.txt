What is your experience with nicotine free e cigs?

I've been smoke free for a month now but i am getting this anxiety attacks now ( did not get them before, the first days i quit) and i was thinking on maybe getting a nicotine free e cigarette just to calm me down a bit. 

What is ur experience with this? Have you tried them?

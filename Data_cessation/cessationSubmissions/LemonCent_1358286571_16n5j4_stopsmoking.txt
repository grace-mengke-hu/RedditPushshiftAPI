I'm picking up my Chantix prescription in a little while. Anything I should know?

I know I could google the side effects but I would rather have some real comments from like minded people that were on it. What's the most bothersome of the SE's while making it through a work day? Any? Should I keep smoking while taking it? I know it says you CAN but should I?

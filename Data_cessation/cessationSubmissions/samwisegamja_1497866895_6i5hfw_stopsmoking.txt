6 days smoke free... well that is if I dont count vaping

Finding myself really agitated and restless all the time. Vaping kinda helps but I am not sure if it is helping. Any quitters that are vaping or used to vape to help quit? I am using 7mg atm. The thing is I feel my chest even heavier and irritated (trapped?) more so with vape than with actual cigarettes. Is this normal for vapes? Or is this a stage with quitting? Thanks for your advice..

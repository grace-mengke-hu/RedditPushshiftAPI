One month down, a lifetime to go!

I've tried to quit maybe 7 or 8 times in the past, but this is the longest I've gone so far. A year ago, I never would have thought I could make it this long. The more you try to quit, the easier it gets! 

My main strategy is to just not think about it. I didn't read any books, or use any nicotine replacements. I pretty much just weaned myself off cigarettes and tried not to even think about them anymore. Over the course of a week, I gradually decreased the number I was smoking per day from a little over half a pack, to three, to one, to a half, and then to zero. I have also started working out, which helps me resist the temptation. 

The first week was the hardest. I had a tough time falling asleep, and almost relapsed when I was hanging out with a friend who smokes. After that the cravings weren't as strong, and only happened sporadically. I still sometimes want a smoke, but I just remind myself that it's not worth it. If I get a really bad craving I look at my phone app, which tells me how much money I've saved, and then go do something to take my mind off it. 

Overall, it's been much easier than I thought it would be. It's like something just clicked in my mind this time. I can't see myself wanting to smoke again, but I know that I will have to continue resisting the odd cravings every now and then. 

Thanks /r/stopsmoking for the inspiration, and good luck to the rest of you former smokers!

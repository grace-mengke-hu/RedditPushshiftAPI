Just an inquiry about how to handle certain aspects, like social image and dealing with stressful situations without the easy fix of a sigaret.

Hi guys!

I've been smoking since I was 14 and am now 30. It's been a daily habbit for 16 years now.

I've quit a few times (and never really had any problems quitting, I don't seem to have fysical discomfort when quitting) :

* When I was 17, for a gf. We broke up, I started smoking again because I only quit for her, not myself. When we got back together she agreed on taking the smoking as part of the package. We broke up again about a year later.

* When I was working for a few years. I quit for a few weeks but one of my coworkers was incredibly dense and I started again just to have an excuse to go outside and avoid him for a few minutes so I could calm down and deal with the frustration he caused. [this frustration was unrelated to me quitting smoking, he was just infuriatingly stubborn and never tought things through, causing problems and more work for everyone else]

* About half a year ago. It went fine for 3 months, but I was attending college again and exams were coming up. During other exams when I got stuck on a practice problem or when I needed a break I'd go outside, smoke and clear my head, get back inside and solve the problem. Now that I had quit smoking I didn't have something that emptied my mind as effectively and after a week I went out and bought a pack of sigarets and started again. The exams went well and even though it might not be true, I believe starting to smoke again had a positive effect on my study method and thus my grades.

The problem I'm facing now is that my fellow students knew I quit, noticed I started again, and were supportive either way. They're like :"hey, quit, it's healthier. But if you can't it's no problem, do what makes you happy."

So I am kind of "scared" to quit for the following reasons:

* I will be having exams for the next 2 years as well, so I fear quitting now will just last untill the next exams.

* I think about what other think and how they perceive me way too much. I am willing to quit again, maybe start again when studying for exams, than quit again. Repeat untill I graduate and don't start anymore once I finish my last exam. I feel like my fellow students would perceive this as weak, stupid or "not enough willpower". Even though they're very supportive and not very judgemental, I feel like it would make me the sad old guy in class who is too weak to quit and stay a non-smoker.

So I'm looking for advice on:

* How to clear my mind, especially in stressfull times.

* How to cope with the image people have.

* How to prove to myself that I can do exams without smoking, without first having to try and possibly fail an entire series of exams just to see wether I can do it without tobacco or not.

* How do you prevent smoking in your car on the way to and back from work/school/etc.

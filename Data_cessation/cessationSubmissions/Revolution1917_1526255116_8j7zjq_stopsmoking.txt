PSA: Avoid “blunts”. I’m a former smoker and I just accidentally dosed myself with nicotine while smoking pot. I’m now painfully aware that cigar paper contains nicotine.

I smoked some pot with my brother and didn’t give a second thought to the method-a cigar that had its original contents emptied. I began to feel all the symptoms of withdrawals, most notably inexplicable anger. After I became aware that something was wrong, a quick google search confirmed my fears-cigar paper is made from tobacco. I had 70 some odd days nicotine free before this happened. I don’t currently have much of desire to smoke a cigarette. My will is still strong but it sucks having to reset the metaphorical clock. This should’ve been obvious in advance. Oh well. This is a painful lesson, and one that won’t soon be forgotten.

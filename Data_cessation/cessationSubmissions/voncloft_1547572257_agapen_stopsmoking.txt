Day 4...i still want a cigarette!!

I have gone cold turkey for 4 days for all nicotine (gum, vape, cig) and I still want the nicotine.

I have the idea in my head from time to time to just go down to the gas station and buy the damn cigarettes, but I know if I do I'll smoke one, feel bad, and throw them out... Only to repeat.

Even the idea of living healthier, the motivation itself does nothing for me, deep down I want the damn things!

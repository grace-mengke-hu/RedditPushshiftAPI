The first 60 hours have passed

Lungs are already healing. Looking forward to not having a painful feeling in my breast and being able to breath easily.

Patience...

That's what I need. Nature will do the work. That's nice about this goal compared many others, where you have to do the work. For example, I am organizing my home, and the more time I spend on it, the faster I am done with it. If I wait, nothing happens.

Though perhaps the "work" that you need to do when quitting smoking is dealing with the cravings when they occur. That usually only takes a few minutes, so it could be worse. Although these minutes can be pretty challenging, but I won't give in, I am really done with this.

I am not wasting my health any longer, instead I am going to BUILD! I will build a good life for myself and the people I love in any way that I can, gradually, patiently, but deliberately. I have been working on this every day already for the past 2 weeks, and it's great to see my vision of a good life is taking shape. It will take me some months before I'd say that I am flourishing, but that's ok, I will to do this for the rest of my life. And I will also ENJOY every day of it!

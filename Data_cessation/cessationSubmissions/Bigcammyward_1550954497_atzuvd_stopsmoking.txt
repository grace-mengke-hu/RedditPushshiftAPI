New journey. My stop smoking date is tomorrow, Monday the 25th of feb. Psych me up!

Hi guys im new to the sub. Im 22m and ive been smoking on for ~8 years. Ive quit before for various lengths of time, with assistance and cold turkey and this time im going cold. Im quitting for a few reasons, mainly my partner of 4 years and my health. I need to be reasonably fit for my job, it involves running but mostly my partner HATES it. She visibly cringes when i kiss or hug her and she smells it on me and that kicks me deepdown in my guts. I live and work in a situation with alot of good friends who smoke so i really need to be strong to not cave to social smoking. Why did you guys quit? How are you going with it and how do you feel? Psych me up guys.
Thanks.

Six days in, no nicotine craving, but the habit is poking me.

I haven't had a cigar (my poison) for six days, but today I bought a packet, and I'm now sitting here talking myself into keeping it sealed. I went for a run today and felt like I was breathing much better. I'm afraid I may have one or two tonight, and have to re-set. This is my first attempt at quitting in a couple years, although I was completely smoke-free for two years and another four before that. I don't think I'm addicted to nicotine, because I can go on vacation and not smoke for weeks at a time and not really miss it, but there are certain situations that can trigger the 'habit' craving. Not sure what I'm looking for in way of response, just thought this was the place to vent a bit about my particular struggle.

The danger is getting used to failures

I've tried quitting multiple times, with varying success - from few hours, up to half a year. Thing is, each time I've ultimately returned to smoking. I think by now I've given myself a permanent excuse, a permission for failure. I no longer feel too much shame whilst returning to smoking, or abandoning my gym routine, or drinking too much few days in a row.

I realize I will never improve in life with this attitude. It's time to put some hard work into becoming a better person. No one will do this for me... I might go through life never taking this commitment, but do I really want to give up like that? What dark place would that path lead to? Maybe there's still some long forgotten sunshine yet to be re-experienced.

Stopped smoking nearly three months ago, but never completly.

I (M/27) stopped smoking nearly 3 months ago, on April 1st, after 10 years of smoking. 

I was never a heavy smoker nor a light one. On a regular day I smoked someting like 5 or 8 cigs. But on week-ends, if I went out, I could easely smoke a pack (20 cigs) during a night. Twice. Once on fridays, once on saturdays. I was something like a social-smoker, I nearly didn’t smoke alone, but when I saw friends and drank it could be wild.

My problem is that I never achieved a real 0 cigs in a week, every friday or saturday night since i stopped I smoke one when I’m at parties.

I smoked like 75 cigs a week before I stopped, now I’m down to 2 or 3. 

Problem is 99% of my friends smoke and they all think that it’s amazing that I stopped like that but I never really stopped completly. I’m afraid that if I don’t achieve the real 0 cigs, I could relapse far more easely. Everytime I smoke one I’m telling myself f*ck it at the moment and regret it the next day because it was useless.

How do I achieve not smoking this cig when I go out and everyone around me smokes? 

I’m proud of what I achieved but I realise that the journey isn’t finished yet.

1 day 8 hours 30 seconds !

Longest I've gone without a cigarette in many many years. I've never really tried quitting (other than when I was younger for 1 year at a time, twice) until I knew I was sure I wanted to. I figured that failing might make me lose hope so I sort of held out.

Now, *I don't know if this counts* , but I picked up one of those Juul devices from the corner store. It's nowhere near the same, but I would be lying if I said it wasn't helping! 

Does it get easier every day? I've been trying to change up my routine as a whole just to retrain my brain in all faculties. I'm pursuing a big lifestyle change by becoming physically active, eating healthy, ending cigs/alcohol/misc

here we go guys! I'm with ya!

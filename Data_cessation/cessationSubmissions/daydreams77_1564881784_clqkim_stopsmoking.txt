Smoked my last cigarette around 12 hours ago!!

I listened to Allen Carr’s audiobook. It really is easy. I’m gonna listen to certain chapters again but I’m feeling good about my decision. My only concern is that my boyfriend smokes around me and he lives with me so there’s not really any avoiding cigarettes. Any advice on that front?

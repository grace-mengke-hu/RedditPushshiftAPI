Lost count

A bit of a rant...sorry.

I have lost count of the times I have posted here full of piss and vinegar that today is the day. 

I have lost count of the times I have let myself down by not ridding myself of this horrible addiction.

I am full of self-loathing and embarrassment. I feel as if I have been an imposter when supporting others in their quits.

I am sorry to everyone for being so weak and a hypocrite. 

It is 11:55 pm and I don't want to wake up a failure in the morning. I want to be a non-smoker. I want to succeed. I hate the nicotine addict in me. 

This just sucks and I have to make it end.

12:00. New day. New hope. Pray for me.

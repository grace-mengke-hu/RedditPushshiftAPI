As of 14:00 today I am done

I am making the commitment to you all here as i have already done to my support group and to myself to no longer continue the slow suicide that is smoking. I don't need it in my life anymore. im tired of feeling out of breath when running up stairs, I'm tired of throwing money down the drain on something that is slowly killing me. Im done smelling like shit and being avoided in public. and most of all I want to live a life where I can say I stuck to my word and I be proud of the choices I am making moving forward, no more will I say, just one more pack, or well it is the weekend, or Im drunk so I can't help it. 
Im taking back control over my life and my choices, and it starts with this one. goodbye cancer sticks, darts, smokes, cigs, smick, drags and all the other nicknames we give our short length of rope tied to a slowly growing tree.

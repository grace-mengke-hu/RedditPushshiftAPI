I'm finally ready to quit

Hey gang,

Long story short - I've been a smoker for the past 15 years, ranging between half a pack and 4 packs a day. Last year, out of the blue, I quit for 3 months and didn't pick up a cigarette until I hurt my back and was going nuts.

Yesterday, I had my last one at around 5PM and didn't light up again until 9AM this morning, out of habit more than anything. I'm a very physically active person (bodyweight fitness and running 5-7km every other day) and I'm just tired of feeling like I can do much better once I stop sucking on poison.

When I wake up tomorrow I intend to start my improved life as a non-smoker and finally work towards reversing the damage I've done. I'm 28 and I've done so much damage with cigarettes and alcohol it's amazing how I haven't suffered a major health issue so far. I think it's time to stop tempting fate.

Thanks for reading, I'll be stopping by in the days to come for sure!

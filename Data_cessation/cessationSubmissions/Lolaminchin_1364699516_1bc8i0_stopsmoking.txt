11 days ago I cut out my 3 addictions: Smoking, fast food & caffeine. I've never felt better.

If I had believed I could completely turn my life around in less than 2 weeks I would have done it sooner. 
Yes, there have been difficult moments but they pass, and you move on with your day.
This subreddit was the reason I started this journey and im so glad i found it! 

I'm proud to say I'm now regularly working out and I've become reacquainted with precious H2O (& honestly don't miss my coffee or soft drink), all because I now identify as a non smoker.

If you're browsing through this sub wondering whether you should quit or not, please know that there will be so many more benefits than the obvious.

You'll get your life back.

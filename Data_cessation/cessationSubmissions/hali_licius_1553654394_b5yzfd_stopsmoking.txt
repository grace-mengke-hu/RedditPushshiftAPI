Almost 3mos... Crappy skin, bleeding gums, low energy WTF!

I quit smoking 2 months 19 days ago and I am so glad!! I don't know what took me so long to ditch that filthy, disgusting habit.

But.

In the past month, I have really bad bleeding gums (when brushing / at night), I had a yeast overgrowth on my chest which is not completely gone after 2 wks, now I've noticed the wrinkles around my eyes seem deeper and the skin on my face seems thinner... And I keep waiting for this surge of energy to hit but mostly I've just been pretty depressed.

This all seems like the opposite of what I was expecting! Has anyone had a similar experience??? So frustrating!

*** If you're still smoking and this post makes you think that quitting isn't worth it, you are wrong! Quit quit quit! It's the best thing I've ever done ***

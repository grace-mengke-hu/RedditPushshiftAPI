Dumb smoker with asthma

Hey guys! I need some tips and a lot of encouragement to help me stop smoking. I've been a smoker for 4 years now and I've had chronic asthma that hospitalizes me every fall for 14 years. I don't know how to think about a day that's smoke free, it's become part of my life almost as important as eating. I keep telling myself this is my last pack, but as it always happens it's definitely not my last pack. I want to stop smoking before side effects become permanent and prevent me from doing things I love. 

Anything will help!
Thank you! - A desperate smoker

How bad does it really get?

Excuse me if I come off as a little rude, just a really bad day >.>

So this is probably a question that I've been asking since I first posted after I put that final smoke out. The first 5 days were filled with nausea and crazy insomnia. But no cravings.

I'm on day 10 and I haven't had a single craving yet. And there seems to be a lot of people that almost get off on telling new quitters that it's only going to keep getting harder. That quitting smoking is an eternity of hell to repay for the chemicals you poisoned your body with for however long you were smoking. 

So if that's true, where are my cravings? I've always thought of myself to have that "addictive personality". And, the first probably 5 or 6 years I smoked a pack a day. The last 4 years was about a half a pack a day. 

What I've been dealing with for the past 4 days as my only issues is nightmares to wake me up and at night a hunger that cannot be quelled. 

Also, in no way am I trying to say that it's easy or that everyone is lying. I NEVER want to relive the first week again. I'm just confused. I've been told so many times so far by people probably upwards of a year that the cravings are still unbearable and that mine will certainly happen. 

Personally, I can only see quitting getting easier from here. And that's the point I'm getting at. I was reading some posts earlier of people in the intro of quitting and there were people who'd quit for 8+ months telling these new quitters that's it's going to be a terrible journey. I'm sorry but you're wrong. Maybe that's the majority of people, but just because your journey was terrible doesn't mean you need to discourage them. You might not even get cravings at all.

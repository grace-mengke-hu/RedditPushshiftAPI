Did you smoke today?

If not -- good for you!

If you did -- why are you on this subreddit? Is it because you want to quit? Do you look at the numbers next to peoples names, and wish you had one too? Good news -- you can! You can quit today. Hell, you can quit this very moment. From right now until the end of time, YOU can be a non-smoker. 

You can never light up again. You never have to smell like cigarettes ever again. You don't need to throw away money anymore. You can be the envy of everyone who still smokes. Why do you want to quit?

Every day is a struggle, but every day is a little easier. I still check this subreddit every day for motivation, and it helps me. What can help you? 

You CAN quit. If I can, anyone can. As a subreddit community, we're here to help. Vent to us when everyone else is tired of hearing it.

Waiting for the other shoe to drop

This is probably my 5th real go at quitting smoking. I'll be damned if it isn't my last. My baseline personality is cynical, sarcastic, frank and abrupt. I'm aware of this and so are those that know and love me. Historically, I have turned into an unbearable asshole when quitting smoking. This time, however, coworkers, friends and my girlfriend have actually been commenting on how much calmer I look and nicer to be around I am. Since quitting I'm still waiting for my inner asshole to come raging out with a vengeance... and it still hasn't happened. 

A coworker told me today that my shoulders look relaxed, my face less severe, and that I have been noticeably kinder to coworkers. This blew my mind. "Kind" is not something I have been called since elementary school. Hearing this left me rather bewildered and on my way to lunch, I pondered this in the car. I think I figured it out, and I like it. 

As long as I can remember I have leaned on some sort of "crutch" when faced with stress, anxiety or any negative emotion. As a kid, when I didn't want to deal with life I would bury myself in a book or multiple books and tune out life and what was bothering me. As I got older I turned to smoking to help smooth over my easily agitated personality. Shitty traffic? Cigarette. Crappy day at work? Cigarette. Everyday life? Cigarette. 

Today as a smoke free dude, for the first time I am unconsciously forcing myself to deal with life as 72% of nonsmoking Americans do. By just dealing with it. What a novel idea! No crutches, no vices, just sheer steely will power. 

Your posts keep me motivated. Thank you for the daily support that you all provide.

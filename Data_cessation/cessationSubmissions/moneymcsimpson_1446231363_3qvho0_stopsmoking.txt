Quick question

Last night I got the bright idea to see how much of a ciggie I could inhale in one breath. Needless to say it wasn't much and threw up almost immediately. I woke up and my throat was killing me. I sound hoarse like I have a cold. It's feeling a bit better now but I was curious if I did any serious damage or it's just me paying the price for a day or so.

Thanks

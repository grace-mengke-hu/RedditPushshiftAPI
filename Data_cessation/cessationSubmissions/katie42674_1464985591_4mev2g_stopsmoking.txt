On day 3 for the 4th time, but something feels different this time. I think this is the last time I'll have to quit!

Hoping this might strike a chord with someone who is considering quitting, but is hesitant to try. 

I've tried quitting three different times before this. Once I lasted a month, had "just one" and then...you know the rest. Two weeks ago, I made it one week cold turkey, and then again had "just one." One week and 40 "just one"s later, I bit the bullet and bought a full treatment's worth of the Nicoderm patch. It was expensive, but not as expensive as continuing to smoke, in dollars or in health.

Today, I'm on day 3, but I feel differently than on any prior day 3. I don't know whether to attribute it more to the NRT itself, or to the fact that the NRT means I can focus completely on the mental part of my addiction first. But whatever the cause, I really think I can do it this time. The idea of going the rest of my life without a cigarette is still scary. I already know I'm going to miss them when I'm at a bar with my friends. But I also know that because I *already* know that, I can plan ahead to avoid giving in. And I hope that eventually, it will be just as normal to say no as it once was to say sure. 

I was afraid to quit because I was afraid to fail, particularly since I had already failed three times before. To anyone in the same position, I just want to say that you can choose to fail forward. Each time I slipped up, I learned another thing that I had to guard against. 

Every failure is one step closer to successfully quitting, because you've identified another method that didn't completely work. Ask yourself what did, make adjustments for what didn't, pick yourself up, forgive yourself, and try again. 

We can do this!

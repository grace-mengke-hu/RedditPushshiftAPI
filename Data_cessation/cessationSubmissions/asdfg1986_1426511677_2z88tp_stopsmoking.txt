Wooo 2 weeks!

Never thought I'd be able to make it this far but I have. 2 whole weeks with no cigarettes. I've even been for an evening in the pub and not caved. I honestly feel like I'm done this time. I'm not always thinking "just one won't hurt." I'm thinking that I'm already noticeably fitter and I feel a thousand times better in myself. Keep going everyone, it is so, SO worth it!

Should I vape? Nicotine and brain health

Good day fellow quitters. 

Today was going to be day 14 since quitting cold turkey, but I was feeling so out of it and anxious that I just gave in and vaped a 6mg solution. I have mixed feelings about what I've done, and would like to hear your opinions on vaping vs quitting nicotine altogether.

My main motivation for quitting was to reduce the harm from tobacco to my brain. Here's a quote that I kept on my laptop desktop as a reminder to abstain :

"Chronic cigarette smoking appears to be associated with deficiencies in executive functions, cognitive flexibility, general intellectual abilities, learning and/or memory processing speed, and working memory. Chronic smoking is related to global brain atrophy\[...\]." [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21139859)

Now, it's pretty obvious that inhaling carcinogens and a bunch of tar would be detrimental to anyone's mental health. In addition to those, there are MAOIs in cigarette smoke that would affect brain chemistry as well. They also reinforce nicotine addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

But what about nicotine in isolation? Specifically, does it negatively affect the reward-circuitry? And since it is a stimulant, could it reduce blood flow to the brain by ways of vasoconstriction? 

I gave in today, but would like to eventually do the best thing for my cognition in the long haul.

TL;DR Vaping is considered a lesser evil. Am I still fucking-up my brain my consuming nicotine?

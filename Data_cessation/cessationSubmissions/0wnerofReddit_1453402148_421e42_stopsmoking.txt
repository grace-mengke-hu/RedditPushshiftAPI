Made this AntiSmoke ad 10 years ago for school project.

Found it on my computer. We made it for the school project then. Non of us were smokeres then, now I am first time tring to quit my habbit of 7 years. I am on my sixth day and so far going strong. I uploaded the video to youtube and also made English subtitles in there so you all can understand. Now both my friend and I quit cold turkey!

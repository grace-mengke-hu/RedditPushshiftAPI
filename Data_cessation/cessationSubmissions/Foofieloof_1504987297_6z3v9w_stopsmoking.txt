Almost 2 weeks smoke free!

I have managed to quit smoking for exactly 11 days and 19 hours as of right now.
However I am experiencing intense cravings, making me almost reach for the cigs. I also have a lot going on right now which I feel is making me weak. I understand we all have those cravings quitting smoking, what do you do to get by? What helps you?? I do NOT want to smoke but the feeling is getting quite overwhelming to smoke.

I finally did it!

Today is my first day quitting and coincidentally, my first post ever. After being a lurker for over a year I decided to celebrate by posting. Thank you for all the motivation as well as recommending Alan Carr's Easyway. You guys are definitely making this easier for me, just wanted to express my gratitude!

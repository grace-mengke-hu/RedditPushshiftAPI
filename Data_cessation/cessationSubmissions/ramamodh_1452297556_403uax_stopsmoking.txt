Coughing up Brown colored sputum

Hello Folks !!

I quit smoking on Christmas eve and I haven't smoked a single cigarette so far. This is my second attempt at quitting smoking. I started smoking 9 years back when I was 18 and it was March 2014 when I realized I am completely addicted to nicotine/cigarettes and I was smoking close to 12 cigarettes a day. One of my friend suggested Allen Carr's book and it worked like a charm and I quit smoking on the Match 30th 2014. Everything was going great except that I was smoking hookah constantly which now I know I shouldn't have done. Exactly on the 49th day, I was travelling to visit my out-of-town friend who is a smoker and my mind played games with me saying I can just smoke for the weekend and stop smoking when I return. There was no looking back from that and it took me a year and a half to quit again.

I have not smoked a cigarette after I quit and from the experiences I learnt during my first attempt, I have faced pretty much every trigger of mine. ***The main concern for me is everyday after I wake up, I cough up brown colored sputum in the morning and whenever I try to cough up forcefully.*** I looked up online and as usual the articles induce more anxiety than a solution. Has anyone in our sub experienced this ? Is this normal or should I go to a doctor ?

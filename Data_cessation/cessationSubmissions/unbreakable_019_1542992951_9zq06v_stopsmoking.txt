Quite Smoking

Hey long story short alot of stuff has happened in my life. Figured out that drinking and smoking pot will prevent me from getting alot of stuff figured out in my life. Smoke a shit ton (daily on a regular basis) and want some advice to help stay sober. Exorcise pretty regularly have anxiety and it helps but, prevents me from being as productive and being more involved in other aspects of my life.

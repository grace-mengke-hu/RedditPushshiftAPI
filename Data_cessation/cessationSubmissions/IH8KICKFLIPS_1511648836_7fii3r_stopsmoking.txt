Those of you who have made it, when did you guys feel 98% “healed” from smoking?

I say 98% because I know it can take years or even decades to be 100% if you ever reach it. And when I say “healed” I mean mentally/emotionally healed.

I just crossed 90 days nicotine free and still feel depressed, anxious, moody, fatigued and a low drive for life. I mean I’m getting better but I really thought I’d be a lot further along than I am. I get a serious craving maybe every other day or every 3rd day, and they are pretty easy to manage now. It’s the mental/emotional side I’m struggling with.

I smoked a cig a day for 3 years, pack a day for 8 months, heavy vaped for 1 year.

Love to hear responses from those of you on the other side, thank you.

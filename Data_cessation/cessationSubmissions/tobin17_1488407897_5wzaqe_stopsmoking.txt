How can I deal with the stress of the next 2 months??

Hello everyone! 
As it's the first of March and the beginning of lent and I'm one of those people who likes doing things on "firsts", I really want to quit smoking
Been smoking up to a pack a day since I was 15, I'm now nearly 22. I'm just finishing my degree over the next 8 weeks, so I'm under a TON of stress atm, but I've had some health problems (hormonal - I'm a woman) that the Dr says could be exacerbated by smoking. 

I wrote out 50 reasons to quit smoking in my diary, which I'm re reading constantly. I just finished my last pack and I REALLY cannot express how much I want this to be the last, I have started to absolutely hate it and lose the romanticism I had for smoking, but the moment I get stressed writing my thesis or working to deadlines, BOOM there comes the terrible craving and I can't concentrate.

TL:DR: ANY TIPS TO HELP OUT WITH STRESS WHEN FINISHING UNIVERSITY UNDER AN INSANE WORKLOAD?
Thanks!

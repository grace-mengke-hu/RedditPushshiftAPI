30 days nicotine-free & good luck to you all

Thanks all for your support and useful information. I have made it to 30 days, and I feel that I don't need to be here anymore. It would have been hell without you guys & gals. You all made it seem so easy, and you didn't lie, it was. If you're lurking and thinking about quitting, just do it today. Get it over with, and in 30 days from now you'll feel as good as I feel today.

Here are my thoughts on quitting. I know there are other thoughts, but these are mine.


**How / when to quit:**

* Quitting is easy, just stop smoking. Getting the nicotine out of your body only takes three days.
* Cold turkey is the best way to quit. Gum, patches, ecigs, just prolong the suffering and keep you addicted to, and thinking about, nicotine for a long time.  They also increase the chance of relapse. I failed many times to quit using NRT.
* However, everything is better than smoking, so if NRT does help you to stop, or if it shows you that you'll be fine without smoking, or if it will help you get rid of the mental addiction to cigarettes, you should do it. Just remember that if you fail to quit that way, cold turkey is always an option
* Don't be afraid if you quit. The panic is just the addict inside of you going without the nicotine. It will go away very soon once you realize the freedom you just gained.
* Remember that nicotine is just a poison, not a nutrient. You'll be fine without it.
* Don't make a ritual out of your quit. Don't set a date to quit, just do it today. Setting a date will only give you time to come up with reasons to not do it. 
* There's no such thing as a bad time to quit. It doesn't exist. Now is the best time. Anything else is just the nicotine junkie talking. Don't let it come up with a real good reason to not quit, or not quit right now. See the junkie for who he/she is.
* Have that last smoke if you want to, but realize you're not giving something up of value. You're just no longer systematically choking yourself.

**Get support and track your progress**

* Get support, and burn all bridges. Get a badge here, tell your story. Tell family, friends, colleagues and ask for their support. Hang a X days smoke-free paper on your work desk. Bring cake to work after being nicotine free for two weeks / one month. Tattoo your quit date on your forehead.
* Tell the people where you buy your smokes that you have quit, and that under no circumstance should they sell you any more.
* Download an app to see how many days, hours, mins, and secs have passed since your last smoke. Track the number of cigarettes not smoked, and money saved.
* Read up on health benefits of not smoking, so you understand what to expect and when.
* I made a wager with everyone that wanted one. I will pay 10 to 1 if I smoke again within a year. If I do, I will loose approximately 5000 dollars. If I don't I will win 500 dollars (for charity).
* I mean you're serious about quitting, right? You're not just "trying to quit", but you will be a non-smoker. Decide how serious you are, and burn those bridges, and then nuke them to make sure.

**The detox phase** 

* If you go cold turkey, it should only last a couple of days. First couple of days can be a little annoying, but it will get easier very soon.
* Cravings, should you have them (I didn't this time), only last 3 mins max. Watch a timer on your phone if you have to. Every craving is a reminder of how awesome you are to have stopped.
* Drink lots of fruit juice the first couple of days, breathe. You may feel down a little. Don't let it get to you.
* Don't keep cigarettes around, and avoid smokers and strong triggers like alcohol until you know you'll be fine around them.
* Don't listen to yourself talking you into smoking again. This includes: "now is not a good time to stop", "it's too difficult for me", "I can't stop this way", "I can just cut back slowly", "I should have just one to make me feel better", "I will quit another time". etc. Junkie alarm, typical addict behavior to think like that!
* Stop being a wuss, and just get it over with. Stay in bed eating ice cream if you want to, but don't smoke.

**The battle inside your head**

* The biggest battle is in the mind, not in the detox. Make sure you really want to quit before you do it. Make sure you're ready to fight the addict inside of you.
* Know that smoking is an addiction and not a habit. Realize that your own brain is trying to trick you into believing you need to, or you can, smoke again.
* All people that smoke on a regular basis are nicotine junkies. Even those that say they can go for days without. There's no so thing as casual smoking, social smoking, not buying your own smokes, or just smoking when you drink beer. That's just the junkie talking. These things aren't real, they're just excuses for smoking.
* Understand that smoking brings nothing of value to you. It doesn't relax you, it doesn't help with concentration, it doesn't smell or taste good, it doesn't even give you a high. It just fills the hole left by the last cigarette. Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP1ykPUTk_Q
* Realize fully that you're not giving something up, you're not sacrificing something by not smoking. This is important. Don't romanticize the smokes, don't become sentimental about your nicotine addiction. That's all just typical junkie talk.
* Read up on all benefits of being a non-smoker.
* Be a non-smoker, and do and feel all the things non-smokers do and feel. Non-smokers would never reach for a smoke if they feel bad, stressed, good, bored.
* You're a non smoker. You have really stopped. Never have that first cigarette. Now that you're a non-smoker, don't start smoking. Nicotine is highly addictive (more so than crack and heroin), and one cigarette can/will get you hooked again. Don't make the same mistake you made when you first started.
* Three options: (1) smoke just one more and be a smoker for the rest of your live, (2) smoke just one more and go through detox / cravings again, and (3) don't have even just one. You chose which one you want.
* When you're feeling good, don't become arrogant and think you've got this or that quitting is easy for you. You can't just have one, not even when you're feeling you're in control, because you never are with something as addictive as nicotine. Remember what it was like to be a junkie.

Thanks all , goodbye and I hope that you all succeed and lead long, happy, and healthy lives.

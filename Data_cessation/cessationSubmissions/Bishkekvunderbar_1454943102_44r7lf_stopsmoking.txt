Gotta be honest

8 days ago, after a fight with the gf, I found myself buying a pack of cigs. I smoked three puffs of one and threw it away in disgust. Ripped up the pack as well. I wanted to wait at least a week before acknowledging it here to ensure I didn't have a full-blown relapse. I think I would have if I reset then and watched the previous month of success circling the bowl.

Now, the question is, is it time for a badge reset? Does NOPE mandate this? I'm choosing to view this as part of the same quit, and as part of the quitting process, but I also want to be honest with myself and this group. Thanks for reading.

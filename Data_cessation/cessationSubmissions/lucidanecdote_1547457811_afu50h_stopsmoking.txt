Now is the time!

I've posted a couple times in here that I was going to quit. I just recently posted about how I tried and got sick, picking cigarette butts out of a work ashtray, (I know, disgusting.) It's time to break up with my cigarettes! I made a video about it a year ago. I only bring that up because I just came across it and it's what made me realize that I keep putting this off. I have one setback and start back up again. No more setbacks. The video is \[here\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKz4KnopYU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwKz4KnopYU)) if you want to watch it. Anyway, today is the day! Wish me luck and good luck to all of you!

Day 79: No brain fog. No cravings. Running still getting faster. Feel a lot healthier overall.

I just thought I would post a short update, hoping to encourage some of those people still in their first month.  

I quit cold turkey after 13 years of half-a-pack a day. The first month was hell; I could barely motivate myself to tie my shoes; I had the worst brain fog; I hated things deeply.  

Anyway, that's really all behind me. Sometimes I want a cigarette in a kind of abstract way, but I don't really crave them. My severe brain fog is gone which was very stressful for me at the time. 

There were a few milestones during the first month where I noticed rapid improvement. Around day 14, I believe, I noticed an uptick in my motivation. At around day 25, I noticed my brain fog was started to fade.  

YMMV, but if you're in bad shape, hold out a little longer to see if you don't turn the corner soon.

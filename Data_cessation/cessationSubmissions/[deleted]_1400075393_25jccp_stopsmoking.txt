I need help dealing with my brother

I've known my brother has been smoking on and off for the past seven years, but for the last 4 months he seems to have gotten much worse. Whereas it used to be that he'd only have a cig or two while out now he seems to need one at least once a day if not more. I know that in the context of many addictions this seems a small amount but it still worries me. I know he has a problem but I am not sure how to approach him about it. 

WHat makes it worse is that I do on occasion smoke, but at much more infrequent intervals. For instance, tonight I bought a pack and made the mistake of mentioning it to him. He suddenly became much more willing to do the washing up which we normally share, and was bargaining with me for an extra cig. This is very different from how he normally acts and concerns me most of all. I geuss that's what worries me, while 1 or 2 a day doesn't seem much it's the fact he changed his behaviour as soon as I mentioned buying cigarettes. 

I've tried talking to him about it before but he always brushes me off either assuring me it isn't a problem or saying it isn't my problem. I don't believe this to be the case, whilst he's doing his best to help me with my own shit. He has his own addiction and I want to help him with this.

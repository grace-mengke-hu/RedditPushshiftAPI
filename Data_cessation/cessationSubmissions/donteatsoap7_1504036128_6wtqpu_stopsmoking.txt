I'm always making excuses (please help)

I've quit well over 200 times. Yeah, probably more. Anyways, I'll quit for about 3 or 4 days and pick up a black &amp; mild again here and there, then I buy a whole pack again. I've decided that I'm going to get *just one more* pack today and be done with it and smoking in general by the end of the month. I really need advice on how to not give into the temptation of bumming a smoke of off someone or getting a black &amp; mild again. PLEASE HELP. thanks. 

Also, I seem to always be stressed out for money and I get depressed quite easily. I'm usually stressed out when I need to pay rent because I always need to take out loans. I'm loving back home at the end of September, that's why I feel this is the time time I'm "allowed" to be stressed out.

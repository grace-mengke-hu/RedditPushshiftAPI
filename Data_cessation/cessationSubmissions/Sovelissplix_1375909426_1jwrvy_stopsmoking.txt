see you later space cowboy

I was at the 95 day mark when I broke down and had a cig while I was out with several friends. 

I would like to blame it on watching all of Cowboy Bebop for the first time last week. The jazz and smoking was too much to handle.

Good news though!
After not smoking for so long, that cigarette was disgusting. It's just not as cool as I used to think it was. Time to get back on the wagon.

Pro-tip: Good TV shows that have a lot of smoking are traps! Watch at your own risk!

EDIT: got the thing wrong
SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY

General consensus on cross addiction and complete cessation.

So, i just quit being a lowlife degenerate junkie and have almost 30 days.
During treatment I recieved ample information on how the limbic system tends to recover much much faster if you quit caffeine and nicotine.  I am compelled and, to a degree, motivated.

Anectdotally, I have heard others say that in early recovery of things like cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, the added stress can lead to ... Well cravings that go haywire.  It is a scary proposition in a sense.

Are any of you out there both cross addicted and completely kicked nicotine?

Can i has encouragement and advices?

Decided to quit.

I've been having heart palpitations for about a year now, and in the last few months they've been increasing. Today specifically, they were pretty intense. I've also started some new medication in the last 2 weeks which smoking while taking it greatly increases the risks of heart attack or stroke. Paired with the heart palpitations, I'm a bit paranoid. I'm a mother and I'm only 24.

I've been smoking since I was 13. I've spent too long letting this addiction run my life, and I'm trying to cling to the curiosity of how much better my body will feel after not being a slave to nicotine to get me through. Also picked up Allen Carr's book, courtesy of Reddit's recommendation. Wish me luck!

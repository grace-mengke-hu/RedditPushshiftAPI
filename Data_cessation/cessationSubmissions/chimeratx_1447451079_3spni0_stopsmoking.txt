A little over 100 days, came here to tell everyone to keep going!

Hey guys. Whenever I saw people who were at 30 days already I kept telling myself I wouldn't be able to get there, that time wouldn't pass and that I would get nervous, but look at me now! Eventually the cravings went away completely and I can easily call myself a non-smoker now. Keep going everyone, you'll get there!!!

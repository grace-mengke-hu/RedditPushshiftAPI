Back Again..

Hey there guys..

Last year I made the decision to stop smoking , I had read Allen Carr's book "The Easy Way" and I was sooo excited to give up , it was too easy ! 

1 Month goes by, and i diddn't even realise it !! 
So, stupidly, I thought I could do anything , and I thought :
"Hey ! Why not celebrate with a smoke!"
BAD IDEA !!!!

Long story short , I slowly dug myself back into being a full-time smoker.

I've tried many times to just quit , but it always gets to me! 
The "Waiting" Game , always sets me off , I try to find something else to do in the meantime, but i find myself just craving a couple puffs ! 

I was wondering what you guys think, should i give "The Easy Way" another shot ? Or perhaps find another method ? 

Sorry if I wasted your time.. But thanks for reading :) 
Any feedback would be great :D

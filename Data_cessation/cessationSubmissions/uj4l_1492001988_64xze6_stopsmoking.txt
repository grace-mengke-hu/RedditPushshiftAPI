Yogi not Stogie

Day 16 woohoo!!

As part of my well being, part of my reason to quit was to increase lung capacity and increase out my workout regime. 

The confidence is 2 fold - you feel better that you aren't committing a shameful act and you look better if you seek that dopamine release via working out.

I've been doing hot yoga for about 4 months now. It helps tons to get all the nicotine and other toxins out of your body. Similarly, the other workout days, sauna and steam room are great for relaxation and ridding of toxins.

Keep on keepin on fellow non-smokers!

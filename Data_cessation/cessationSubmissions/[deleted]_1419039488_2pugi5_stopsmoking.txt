Thinking of quitting, but not because I want to.

Okay, so. 

My wife has as of recently, thanks to an r/askreddit thread of course, to quit smoking. I've been smoking for a few years now and had never really thought about quitting. I've enjoyed smoking. Yeah I know it's not good for you, but it's always helped with stress/depression/etc. I was smoking when her and I first got together. I've been on a steady pack a day for a while. 

She asked me if I could quit, because "she doesn't want me to die first", which sounds weird but she's a weird lady. She really is the most important person in my life, but as awful as it is I just really didn't want to quit. 

So I'm trying, for her. Yesterday I smoked my last morning cigarette before work, and went all day without another. Today, out of some absurd muscle memory I just went out and bought a pack. I feel like an asshole. I've smoked two and what sucks more than giving in is having an important person in your life be disappointed in you. 

Any help? Tips? Should I ween myself off, or is cold turkey the best option? What the hell do I do with my hands from now on?

Day Three, not sure if I can make it.

I decided to quit vaping on December 31, 2016. I took my last puff before midnight and haven't touched it since. I used to smoke over a pack of cigarettes a day and within three years I have gone from 20+ cigs a day to absolutely nothing, just vaping on juice with 3 mg of nicotine. I understand that a large part of my addiction is the nicotine, but I long to satisfy my oral fixation...if there is anything...someone please help. I have done nothing but be insufferable to my child, my boyfriend, my family. I'm a total bitch. Please help! I feel so alone, I see everyone on here is quitting actual cigarettes, and I feel like vaping should just be a breeze, and it's NOT.

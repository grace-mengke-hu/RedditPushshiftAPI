Is physical withdrawal real or imagination?

I know this question is very strange, but please hear me out. I've been reading a lot of books on how to quit smoking. I've been watching a lot of videos. I've listened to podcasts. They all had one thing in common:

"When you quit you might feel a slight emptiness in your chest, but it's so minor that you might not even notice it"

So yesterday I didn't smoke all day. I didn't really crave one. I wasn't anxious, sad or depressed. I was hyped for my new life and happy to get rid of cigarettes. But my body was **FUCKED UP**. I was restless, my heart was racing and I could barely focus. It was like someone put my brain into a blender. I tried to quit numerous times and those symptoms might occur even after 2 hours of not having a cigarette, but **only** if I decided to quit. Whenver I'm in a plane, train or after 8 hours of sleep I don't even come close to those symptoms.  

Am I imagining this? Is it a physical response to a psychological issue or is this simply how the body reacts? 

I simply don't understand how some people can claim that they had no withdrawal symptoms other than slight emptiness if it's not purely psychological.

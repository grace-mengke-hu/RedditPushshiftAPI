This time might work!

Hi I'm new to reddit and this sub but I started smoking at 18 \~Octoberish of 2013 (18 years old) and have tried to quit sooo many times since. I'm 23 and it's been about exactly 5 years since I started. I have chronic bronchitis (NOT copd just recurrent chronic viral bronchitis my dr said?) and adult onset athsma from it. I'm so excited to try to stop. Last year I made it 10 months and then during a break up this year took it back up and here I am.

Thanks for any and all support. Any tips?

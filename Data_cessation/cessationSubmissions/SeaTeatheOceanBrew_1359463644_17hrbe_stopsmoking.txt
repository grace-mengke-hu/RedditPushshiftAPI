Words of encouragement for those Day 1-ers out there.

This is going to be one of the toughest things you will ever have to do, but you can do it.  You have to want it.  I'm on day 153 and counting, and you know what?  It's still hard.  My roommate smokes and the smell of his morning cigarette wakes me up with a craving.  Not a massive, tear my eyes out of my head craving, but a craving nonetheless.  I fight it still, to this day, because I don't want to smoke.  I would encourage you to find that want.  Find a way to hold onto determination and free yourself.  I know it's easier for some, but if you want it bad enough, you will succeed.  I had to sit down in a chair and convince myself that what I was feeling wasn't "real".  The cravings were just a chemical side-effect and eventually they will go away and they did.  I still struggle, but I choose not to smoke because I don't want to.  Sweat it out, grit your teeth, clench your fists, be irritable...it passes and it's totally worth it.  Be strong and if you need a swift kick in the pants, feel free to PM me.  It gets easier, I swear.

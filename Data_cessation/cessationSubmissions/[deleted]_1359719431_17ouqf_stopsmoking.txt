That's it. I'm not finishing this pack.

I've been trying to quit for a few weeks now.  I've been cutting back and trying to get myself ready for this. I'm down to 5 times a day, half a cigarette or less each time. I can't cut back any more though, I hit a brick wall.  If I try to smoke less or monitor myself any more its just torture. I need to break the habbit now and cut it out of my life once and for all.

I don't want to do the bargaining thing: "after this pack I'm done". I'm just going to put an end to this.  In the morning I'm going to fill my half pack with old butts and a little water to get them smelling good and nasty so if I get a craving I can pull one out and think if I really want that on my lips after all.

I'm going to keep this thread updated with my progress.

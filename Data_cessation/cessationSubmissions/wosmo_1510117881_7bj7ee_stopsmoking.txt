Flu season

Well, it's that time of the year again.  What the rest of the world considers "sniffles season", smokers consider "bronchitis season".  The two seem to go hand in hand.

Feels like every year or two I get a cold, and every single time, a cold means having to blow your nose while you deal with bronchitis.  2-3 weeks of coughing, waiting for the day when the coughs actually start coughing up mucus - because you know nothing changes until they become "productive".

Hopefully this is the last.  I'm actually looking forward to a perfectly normal flu next year.

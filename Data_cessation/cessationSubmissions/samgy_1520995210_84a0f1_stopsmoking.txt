Would like to quit but don’t know how

So I have been wanting to quit for awhile but have no idea how. I quit once for about two years but this time is really hard for some reason. It’s hard with co workers who smoke and smoking in the car it’s just something I do when driving. I tried Chantix but that didn’t really work for me I didn’t take it more than a week or so maybe it wasn’t long enough but I didn’t have reduced cravings. For me it’s like an oral fixation. Before I did it cold turkey but chewed a lot of gum but I wasn’t around smokers as much as I am now and it’s just way harder. I literally just don’t know how. I told my co workers I was thinking about quitting and they sort of made fun of me and I do like smoking I admit. It’s just a really hard habit to break. I’m 36 and in decent shape overall but I get winded sometimes and I don’t like being addicted. I got a vape pen but that didn’t work either I thought it would help but I didn’t like the sensation compared to regular smoking and I would still want to smoke instead of vape. Is there hope for me? I think it’s in the genes too tons of family members smoked and still do. I’m going for my regular doctor checkup tomorrow maybe I’ll ask him for suggestions. I don’t know maybe a support group would help? Not really big into those type of things but at this point who knows. I’m not into gimmicky expensive shit I just want something inexpensive that might actually work. Don’t know what else to do at this point. Maybe try Chantix again and try taking it longer and seeing if it works.

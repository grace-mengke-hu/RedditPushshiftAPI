Day 5

I quit at 5 pm last Friday. I've felt great, until today I was stressed and angry and just wanted a smoke. Not because of need or addiction, but because I liked to smoke. It was quiet time. It helped me think. I made it theough, though, without succumbing to the craving.  

Do those "want" cravings go away?

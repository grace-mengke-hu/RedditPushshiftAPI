Upcoming Tequila Bingo....

Well, I'm smoke-free since 4 days (in 1 h) and feeling great. I can handle the cravings pretty easy thanks to Mr. Allen Carr. But there is this event coming up on Friday and I am ALREADY nervous that something might go wrong.

It's called Tequila Bingo and some friends come to my city to visit the event and they are looking forward to see me. I told them I stopped smoking and I won't be drinking due to the fact that alcohol fucked up my quitting plans the last times I tried to quit. But I just don't know why, I am really scared I get cravings that I might not handle or drink alcohol and then searching for excuses to smoke. 
I'm feeling so great without and are feared to fuck it up. It's only fear I won't smoke but do you guys have any tips for me so I don't need to be feared?

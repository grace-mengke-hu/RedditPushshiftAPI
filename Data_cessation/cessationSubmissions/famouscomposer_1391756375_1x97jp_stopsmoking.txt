I need a goddamn cigarette.

Today was incredibly stressful. I'm exhausted.  I have a torn off piece of paper and rolled it up and I'm just pretending to smoke it.  It... kind of helps actually.

I just want to smoke a fucking cigarette right now.  I just want to feel the hot smoke going into my lungs, and then watch it come out.  That's what I want right now at this moment.

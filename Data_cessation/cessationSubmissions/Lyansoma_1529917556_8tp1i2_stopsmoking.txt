I am not sure wether to quit waterpipe, too, or not. What do you think?

Tonight it's going to be one week without smoking and I am quiet proud, as the previous attempts barely lasted a day. I am determined to never touch cigarettes again. But not smoking shisha the next time i go out will be something i really miss (I am in Jordan, so it's very common). As at home (in Germany) I barely smoke shisha I am thinking that its ok to keep this habit while being abroad. What do you think?

500 Days

I found this sub and wanted to give you guys some encouragement! It's been 500 days since I've smoked a cigarette and I wanted to share that with someone. I used to think I wouldn't be able to quit because the stress would kill me, but over a year later I've never been happier with my decision. Fuck cigarettes and fuck tobacco companies.

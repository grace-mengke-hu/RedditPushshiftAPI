I just want to STOP!

Hi. I am new to this reddit. I'm 25 and have been smoking for ~10 years. And I just want to quit already. I'm starting to really feel the affect of smoking on my breathing. Half my day is spent trying to catch that one good breath. I've tried to quit countless times and every time I do I go right back to it because I experience so much anxiety and insanity. I need help.

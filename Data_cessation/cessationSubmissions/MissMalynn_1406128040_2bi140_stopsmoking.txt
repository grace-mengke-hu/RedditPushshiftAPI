50+ hrs in... bad attitude setting in... How do I not snap out?!

Well, I am currently about 53 hrs in, and everything was fine until about 2 hours ago. 
Now I am just REALLY angry, and I want to either punch people (at work, can't really be doing that) or smoke a cig (I've come SO far!)
I can tell its the addiction talking, trying to get me to succumb to it, but HOW do I get over this?!

Please - someone give me wisdom on how to control this feeling! I don't want to snap out, get fired and / or smoke a cigarette! I have 6 hours left of work!

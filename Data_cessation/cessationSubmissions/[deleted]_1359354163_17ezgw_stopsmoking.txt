This is crazy...

Stumbled across this subreddit after seeing an "actual advice mallard" meme on the front page regarding smoking, decided to google "reddit quit smoking" knowing there had to be one, found this little gem of a place, found out about Allen Carr's book, downloaded it, and now I'm halfway through and I literally have like no desire to smoke at all. I have one cigarette left in my pack, I will probably smoke it to commemorate the final one or something, but overall, the more I keep reading the more it makes sense. It's a lot of things I knew deep down, in the back of my mind, but did not want to bring to the surface. A lot of acknowledgement, and a number of points I hadn't even considered. HIGHLY recommend. To think this all happened this evening, with no real planning, just a spur of the moment chance.

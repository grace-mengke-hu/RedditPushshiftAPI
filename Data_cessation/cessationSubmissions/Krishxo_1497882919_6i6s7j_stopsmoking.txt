I quit smoking and I have no idea how.

Hey guys, I'm Dave. And I quit smoking and I have absolutely no idea how I did it. 2 and a half weeks ago I was a pack a day smoker. Sometimes a little less but around that. One morning I just woke up and I felt absolutely nothing towards cigarettes. After 2 years of intense smoking, I have no idea how I felt/feel that way. 
I have absolutely no cravings. No urges. And I have no idea how. I literally have half and unsmoked carton because I genuinely don't feel like smoking.
And again, I don't know why. It's been 2 weeks. I tried smoking a couple cigs but I don't know why I haven't gotten back to it or don't like it.. why is this?

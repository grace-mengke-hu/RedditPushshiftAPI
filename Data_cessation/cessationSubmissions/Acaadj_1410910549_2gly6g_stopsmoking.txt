Day 3. Headache.

I've kicked a lot of things... one of them being Heroin. I've been through a lot of pain.. two 9 lb babies naturally, no epidural. This restlessness and headache? Ugh.

I can do this. I am doing this. I will do this... I just wanted to complain. I know a lot of you are in the same boat, but needed to vent.

Changing my routine when I gave up smoking was the biggest helping factor - What was the biggest help to you?

That first 2 weeks breaking the routine of smoking at the same time, with the same people, in the same place - it made all the difference.

I'm sure some of you will know the thing. Arrive at work, chat with friends, go have a coffee and cigarette with them. Have a tea break, go to the same place, smoke with the same people.... etc

If I ever had to go through it all again, and I'm hoping I don't, I'd do something like go on holiday, or visit friends/family and break that routine. 

What was/is your biggest help when giving up?

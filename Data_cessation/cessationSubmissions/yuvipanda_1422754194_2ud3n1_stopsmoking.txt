Goodbye!

Hello!

I've been nicotine free for 2 months now, and have felt no urges to go back - even when hanging around almost all of my triggers. It took me a year of slowly weaning myself off using progressively smaller strength nicotine e-liquid, but after demoralizingly failing several times to quit cold turkey, I'm happy I pulled it off at all!

The turning point was me 'slipping' and trying a real cigarette after 4 months on the e-cig, and not being able to take more than a few drags - it felt like I was burning plastic and paper in my mouth. It's been uphill since :) I was smoking 0nic e-liquid for a while, and then just stopped at some point. Have been giving away my kit to people now.

r/stopsmoking was very helpful, even though I was only a lurker here. I feel like an ex-smoker now, and hopefully I'll feel like a non-smoker at some point in the future.

Thank you everyone!

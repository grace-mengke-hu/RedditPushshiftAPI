Stopped smoking.. AGAIN.. weird head sensitivity/tingling

Stopped smoking two days ago, but the tingling/sensitivty started yesterday.. gums are also in a little bit of pain as well. Head is sensitive to the touch, it doesnt hurt but definitely uncomfortable and there are some sharp pains that come and go, should i be worried or is this a side effect of quitting smoking? im 6'3 260 pounds

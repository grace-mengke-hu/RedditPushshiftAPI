Stopping tomorrow, should I avoid drinking social situations?

Hello stop smoking community!

First time poster! Let me start by saying that after reading all your posts, it gives me courage for the dreadfull task ahead of me.

A little background on me, I a man, 30, and I have been smoking since I was 17. I am currently smoking between 12 and 20 cigs a day, but when I go to social drinking event, i can smoke a pack in a single night.

1 month ago  I bought 3 cartons of cigs duty free, and I told myself I would quit when I finish them. Well that day has come for me and tonight I will have finished the last of my pack, so  I AM GOING TO QUIT TOMORROW!!!

It is not the first time trying to stop for me, last year I held 2 months cold turkeys, I have smoked e-cigarettes for months and went back to normal cigs. This time, I will be quitting cold turkey, no patch, no ecigs, no help.

Thankfully I am leaving tomorrow for work in a remote part of France for 10 consecutive days, so I will have less  temptations than in my current environment. The problem that I foresee is when I come back. I have social events planned, drinking will be involved, and based on my past experiences, my urges to smoke when I drink go through the roof!

Hence the question in my title: based on all your past experiences, should I avoid social situations for a while to avoid smoking again?

Thank you all for your help! And good luck to all of you reading my post currently trying to stop smoking!

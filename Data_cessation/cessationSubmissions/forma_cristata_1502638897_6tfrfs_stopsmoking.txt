Quitting with Cyclothymia

Hey all. I have had such a hard time quitting. I had quit during a bout of pneumonia in march. It was very easy because I felt like death and didn't want to leave my bed for a week.  Then in June, I drove 1500 miles to EDCLV, and stayed in a smoker friendly casino. I had bought a pack on the road because the drive was stressful, but I completely lost control in Vegas. I have been trying to quit again since I got back, but I have rapid-cycling bipolar. This means that large changes in my schedule, eating, or sleeping habits can put me into a down state. It makes quitting very hard because it makes me suicidal (no joke).

Finally though, I got angry at myself for smoking and I started to hate the cigarettes. THIS IS WHEN TO QUIT. This is because I like smoking more than I like the buzz. It is all the action. If you start to dislike smoking, then if you quit it is easy. 


I ran out at 6 pm and went to sleep at 9. After sleeping, and not smoking when you wake, I feel it is easier to quit than if you just drop it in the middle of the day.

 I am currently at hour 42, going strong with no cravings large enough to hurt me. And I am happier and breathing better by the minute. 

I just wanted to let you all know, if you struggle with a mental illness, or just no self control, that we all can quit. It is just about timing and persistence.

24 days smoke-free

I haven't smoked in over three weeks! I kept quitting and going two weeks and then starting again, and I feel like I've finally quit for good. It's so nice not panicking when I can't find a cig or e-cig, and working out without hyperventilating. Not going through withdrawal is the best part. I was smoking those nasty Vuse e-cigs, too, thinking they were better than cigarettes, but they hurt my lungs even worse. The SmokeFree app really helped. I think I'm through the worst part!

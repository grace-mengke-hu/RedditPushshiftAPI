Vaping and Sinus Problems

I quit smoking because cigarettes were causing major sinus problems. I’d get such bad sinus headaches and there was more than one instance where I had to call in sick to work.

My doctor prescribed me nasal sprays and antihistamines, but it came down to if I don’t quit smoking, I’ll be struggling with this forever.

Because of a really bad reaction to smoking a lot on Friday after cutting down for a while (got an instant headache and running nose), I’ve decided once and for all to quit... But I am vaping.

I don’t think I can quit without vaping, but does anyone know how vaping affects sinuses?

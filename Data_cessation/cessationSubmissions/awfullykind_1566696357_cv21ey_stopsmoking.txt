The last time

This is the last time I blatantly ignore
The health warnings on the pack
As I grab just one more

This is the last time I light one on fire
And inhale it's fumes to my lungs
Despite my strongest desire 

This is the last time I say to myself
That this is my last cigarette
I will now choose health

This is the last time I reset my app
Only to start smoking again
After a sleep or a nap

This is the last time I take a shower,
And brush my teeth clean
As if that gives me power.

This is the last time that this is the last time.

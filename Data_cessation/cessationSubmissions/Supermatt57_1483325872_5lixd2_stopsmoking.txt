Update: made it to 30 days without a cigarette

My next goal is to quit vaping. this coincides with new years resolutions, so that works. My goal is to go 30 days without vaping at all and see what's there. Day 1 and it's pretty rough already, I'm craving some nicotine and can't seem to focus on anything.

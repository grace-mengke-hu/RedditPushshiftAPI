Eating cheerios and chocolate to get through these first three days. Got a favorite pick-me-up food?

I admit I am no stranger to quitting smoking. I have gone through the hoops before and know the ropes. It's always the same. Don't like it but it can and must be done.

Day 2 here. Eating Honey Nut Cheerios and chocolate to get me through the emotional downs of the first three days. Tonight I will bake chocolate chip cookies. It works. I don't worry about the calories. I can deal with that later.

Got a favorite pick-me-up food?

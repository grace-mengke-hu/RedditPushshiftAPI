Giving a genuine effort to quit smoking this Lent.

I have never really tried to quit smoking before, but this year I am making a genuine effort for Lent.  I am Catholic, and I have finally decided to give myself over to my higher power and stop poisoning my body. Tomorrow will be day one and I'm super freaked out about it. Since I have never really tried before, I'm not sure what to expect.  I've only ever gone a few hours and then broken down and bought a pack. I'm 31, with a family history of medical problems a mile long, and I think if not now, then when.  I do have an electronic cigarette to use...not the refillable liquid kind, but the replaceable cartridge kind. I don't really know why I'm posting this on here, I guess I just needed to get it out. All I've heard so far is the extremely negative side of quitting and the extremely positive side, from people in my real life, and I have to believe there is a middle ground out there.

Update: I haven't actually quit yet.  I started listening to Allen Carr's audio book last night before bed, and he said not to quit until you've finished the program, so I didn't.  I listened to the rest of the audio book today, I set a time to quit tonight, and I feel so much more prepared.  Thanks to everyone for the encouragements! I can't believe how incorrectly I had been viewing this whole thing.  I'm actually so excited to quit now, and will use the extra time during the day to devote to my faith life and my Lenten journey. I couldn't have done this without you guys, and I can't wait to update you on my progress. Grabbing my badge!

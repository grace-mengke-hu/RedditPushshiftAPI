Really hard right now... I'm two days in. I almost gave in to a craving about an hour ago...

Title pretty much says it all. I've been battling quitting for about three or so weeks now. Never really able to throw away my pack, or stop bumming of my little brother and his friends. After last Tuesday I decided I was going to stop. So Wednesday came, and it was okay. But today was down right absolute torture. I've been sitting around all day wanting to smoke. Needing to smoke. I've been reading Carr's book, and it really isn't helping me out that much. I get it, cigarettes suck. That is why I want to quit in the first place. I. feel. like. shit. when. i. smoke. The whole time I'm reading it I feel like it is a big ass pros-cons list that is completely stupid because I know the pros outweigh the cons by a metric shit ton. Then I sit here and stare at the computer with this fucking feeling that won't go away while I am trying to do my homework. I can't fucking concentrate, I can't think, I am all over the damn map. I can't relax. 

I've been smoking since the middle of October in 2004. I was sixteen. I started smoking roughly a pack a day. At my worst (freshman year of college) I was up to two and  a half packs a day for about a solid year. After that I cut back down to about a half a pack a day. 

I know why I should stop. I just don't think I can. 

As of today, I haven't smoked yet.

TL;DR: Cigarettes fucking sucks. Quitting fucking sucks. Why the fuck did I start smoking? Why the fuck can't I stop? I haven't had a fucking cigarette yet.

EDIT: and I must have entered the wrong damn date for my damn badge. GRRRR!  

EDIT: Fixed my badge.

Quitting while being put on ssris. Should I wait?

I'm on day 4 of taking prozac. It'll be 3-4 weeks before this medication has run its course and my body adjusts entirely. I have also decided to quit smoking. 

Has anyone in the odd chance quit smoking while being put on medication that alters the brains chemistry? Should I wait? 

The reason why I ask is because in the past attempts to quit my depression turns into mania around day 3. It's extremely hard to quit and it's very taxing of my body. I'm worried that while quitting during the intake of an ssri I could potentially throw myself into a deep manic episode due to the withdrawals paired up with the altering medication. 

But I need to quit. I'm sick of feeling like shit over something so mediocre.

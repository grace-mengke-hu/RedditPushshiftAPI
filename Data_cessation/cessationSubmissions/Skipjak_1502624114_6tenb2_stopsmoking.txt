Got drunk, had fun, didn't smoke

Spent the night out drinking and dancing, people were smoking inside, but I didn't smoke. This is a major victory for me!

I wanted to bum a smoke on more than one occasion throughout the night, but I didn't. I remembered how shit I felt when I caved during my previous quits, I never want to feel that again.
I also figured out that you don't need cigarettes to have fun while out. I focussed my attention on the music, dancing and on conversation. I still need to get used to doing nothing with my mouth and hands besides drinking, though.

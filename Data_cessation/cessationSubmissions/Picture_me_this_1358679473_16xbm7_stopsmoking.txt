I dun goofed

Need some help here guys, at a bit of a loss of what to do. I smoked for ten years straight, managed to quit for about a year, felt great everything was going good. Then a friend offered a smoke, I said "ehh it's just one"... gahh started again. Then i quit AGAIN for about 3 months. Then one night on my birthday I smoked AGAIN and lo and behold here I am smoking a pack a day AGAIN... Anyone been through theese quit and start cycles? How do you guys deal with them?

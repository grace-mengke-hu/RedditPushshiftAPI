A teen needs your help, please!

Hello Guys

I am a 16 year old male, I started smoking socially from the age of about 13-14 and I became a constant smoker at age 15 and a heavy smoker at age 16. I was using smoking as a way to escape my depressions, anger, sadness etc. 

I started getting dry coughs that irritated my chest, I knew I had to stop smoking and I did. In the last 4 days I smoked 3 cigarettes compared to smoking a pack a day I would say that is big progress.

Right now I cough quite hard but I dont cough up an blood, I breathe fine and I don't have chest pain, does this mean I have acute bronchitis? or are my lungs just cleaning them selves out?

Thanks!

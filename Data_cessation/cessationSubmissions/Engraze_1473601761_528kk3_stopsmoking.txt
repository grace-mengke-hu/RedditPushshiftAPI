Can't handle the anxiety

backstory: Have been a 10-20 cig smoker for ~3.5 years and have tried to quit countless times. Reason for quitting is always money. I'm going to be honest, I really enjoy tobacco but I can't stand the fact that I have to spend so much money every single day just to feel ok.

I am not really an anxious person and I don't really get stressed out, but if I haven't smoked for a long period of time (let's say about 12 hours) I get crazy anxious: my chest gets that weird feeling that I hate and can't handle. Always ends up in a trip to the local tobacco shop.

Is there anything I can do to fight the withdrawal anxiety or am I just going to have to handle it?

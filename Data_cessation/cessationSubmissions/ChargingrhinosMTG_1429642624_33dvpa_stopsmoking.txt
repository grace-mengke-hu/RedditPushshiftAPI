1 Year anniversary

I'd always been a self-loathing smoker, I always hated being a smoker but had no self control when it came to not smoking.  I hadn't even looked for this subreddit then, but today being my 1 year anniversary I wanted to post about it somewhere.

It was hard to quit, some days are much harder than others (I just spent 5-6 days in Pakistan and EVERYONE smokes there, that was really tough).  I still have moments when I think things like "Just one, who'd know", the point is I'd know and I don't want to fail now.

Cheers, apologies if I've broken all this subs rules, feel free to blast me or whatever, just wanted to talk about a year milestone.

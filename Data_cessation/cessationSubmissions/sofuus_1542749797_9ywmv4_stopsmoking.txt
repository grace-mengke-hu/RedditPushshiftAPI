i passed day 1!

i did it :) i didnt go outside so i didnt get the chance to buy a pack, but still. i didnt even crave it that much! 
im glad, and i talked to my mother who has been smoking for about 30 years. a pack a day.
shes wanted to stop many times, but failed.
then when i turned 18 last year i started smoking too. i hid it but as i became more addicted i couldnt hide it and we smoked together alot. 
i texted her and asked if we should quit together. she said yes.

i cant join her until next week, but thankfully i did day 1!

im scared for tomorrow though.
i usually have one cig on my way out the house, one at the bus stop, one waiting for my train, one or two after i get off my train, and 3-6 through my school day. and usually 2-3 more. sooo roughly almost a 20pack of camel blues every day.

it really does keep me motivated, i look forward to it. when i do smoke i feel gross, the taste and smell is horrible. but its an addiction reward. 
so i wonder what it will be like tomorrow morning.. ill be alone too and no one around me at school knows i want to quit.. hmph. 

wish me luck.

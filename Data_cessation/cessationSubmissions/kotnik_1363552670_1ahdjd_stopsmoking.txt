How I did it

A friend decided to quit, and I sent this list to him. So, this is how I quit smoking:

* I did it cold turkey, and see it as the best way. Other methods are longer and more painful. If it doesn't work for you, by all means try something else.
* I visited /r/stopsmoking subreddit often and read what other people experience - seeing others and their struggle made me stronger in the decision.
* I googled a lot (smoking kills, and similar terms) and read what tobacco companies do to their customers.
* I installed a phone app that showed time since last cigarette, health benefits so far, and the money I saved - it was really important for me.
* And also, believe it or not, [this wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/cKz7kvq.jpg) helped a lot.

Two months after, I am very happy I finally did it, and I can tell you that it really isn't that hard. You learn a lot about yourself, and your personality in the process as a bonus :)

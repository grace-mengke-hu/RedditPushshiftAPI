379 days...

A year and two weeks ago I had my last drop of nicotine. I've not smoked 7300 cigarettes since then. I've saved $2550 not buying them. And I've spent 851 hours (35 DAYS!) doing something more productive than poisoning myself. My longest streak before that was 9 months. Now I know you're never immune. But I actually forgot it'd been a year already.

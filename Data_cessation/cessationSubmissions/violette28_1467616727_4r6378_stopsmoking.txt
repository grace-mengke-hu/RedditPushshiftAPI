Feeling extremely tired after quitting sugar, caffeine and nicotine

Please help me. I have one by one quit all my unhealthy vices and feel worse than ever. I have low blood pressure, zero energy and keep sleeping. If I lie down, I drift off to sleep. I am not kidding, I can sleep infinitely. I dont know what to do with myself. I also feel hungry almost all the time. Does anyone have similar experiences? What is wrong? Sadly, I feel worse living a healthy lifestyle, than of ugar, cigarettes and coffee.

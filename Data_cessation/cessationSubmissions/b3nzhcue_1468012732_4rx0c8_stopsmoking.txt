Day 2: Good Vibes

So i read the Allen Carr book.  First time I read it was about 5/6 years ago and I didn't "get" it.  I actually had a decent quit after reading it, but I thought some of the messaging was weird.  I was resistant.  I smoked again a few months later.

This time, I read it again but with a more open mind.  I feel like I am less resistant.  I feel great here on the 2nd 24hr stretch and am looking forward to the weekend!

I have had a few intense cravings.  Taken a bunch of walks (without having to hide in the shadows while smoking!).  Done some meditating.  

thank you all for being here.

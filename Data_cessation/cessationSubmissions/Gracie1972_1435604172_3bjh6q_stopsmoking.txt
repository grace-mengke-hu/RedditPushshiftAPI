Advice for newbies or smokers thinking of quitting

Come to this subreddit daily or multiple times a day.  Post for support or questions you may have about quitting.  Read Allen Carrs book because it has lots of helpful tips on quitting.  Remember there is no such thing as just one cigarette when you have already quit.  All it does is make you a smoker again.  When you have a craving tell yourself that it will be gone in five minutes...if you smoke it will be back every thirty minutes.  As time goes by it does get easier.  Now I look back at smoking as if it happened in another life.  At the time of smoking I thought I loved it.  But all it did was add stress to my life and do damage to my lungs stressing me even further.  Good luck to all of you new quitting and I hope those still smoking get motivated to give them up.

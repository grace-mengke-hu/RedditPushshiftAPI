Cravings, years later...

Hello all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at 9.5 years since I've quit but I have a very strong urge to smoke today. It happens time to time. (I personally think it is because my dopamine is low and nicotime would boost that).

&amp;#x200B;

Annoying, yes. Anyone else? I personally know that if I have even one ever again, I'll likely smoke until it kills me. I am very much addicted, that never changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Occassionally I'll meet someone who quit for 10 years but started up again. I do so hope I never "lose my mind" and follow suit.

&amp;#x200B;

Best wishes to you all on your journies.

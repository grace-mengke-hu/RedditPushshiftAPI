Been 48 hours since i made the decision to quit, just need a little positivity :)

Hi guys! I had been trying for far too long to stop smoking completely, but each time I tried,I couldn't even go past 2 hours.

 2 days back, I decided to really make a change, because I couldn't take this burning sensation in my chest anymore. I HATE IT I JUST WANT TO REMEMBER WHAT BREATHING FELT LIKE BEFORE I STARTED WITH THIS TERRIBLE HABIT.
I'm 23 and I've been smoking for the past 5 years (anything between 6-15 a day). As if knowing about the adverse effects of smoking was not enough to stop me from doing it, I have been unable to kick the habit even after I started feeling  the harm that I had inflicted upon myself. I feel out of breath after 2 flights of stairs, I can hardly play football for 10 minutes before it feels like my lungs are going to explode. 

Every single person that I usually hang out with, smokes as much as I did or more, and every time I have tried to quit and failed, I have been on the receiving end of snide remarks/condescension. So this time, I have not mentioned my attempt at quitting at all among my social circle, I'm really hoping to kick the habit for good this time. 

Which brings me to the reason for making this post: I just wanted to thank all you guys on this subreddit, I wish the kind of encouragement and positivity that goes around here could be as abundant IRL. The sole reason I was able to break my previous record of 1 smoke-free day (15 hrs) and somehow get through TWO WHOLE DAYS was because I saw so many folks here who have managed to be clean for 2-3 years and shared their motivational experiences!

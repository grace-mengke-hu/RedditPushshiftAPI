3 weeks, I'm feeling good.

Last night I was thinking about all the other times I "quit" smoking.  I put quit in quotes because if I think back honestly I never really quit any of those times, I would go drinking with my friends and bum a smoke, I would get stressed at work and bum a smoke so while in my head and memories I quit smoking for 3 months I never really did.  I may have not smoked for a week or maybe two weeks but I always cheated myself and smoked.

So today at the three week mark of being a non-smoker I am proud of myself.  I can honestly say this is the longest amount of time in 13 years that I have not had a cigarette.  And while my body still tells me sometimes that I want a cigarette, my mind is in the right place and says no, one cigarette starts the addiction all over again.

Thanks everyone for the support.

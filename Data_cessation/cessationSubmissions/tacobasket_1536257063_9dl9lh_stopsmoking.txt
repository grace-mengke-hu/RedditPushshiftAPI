How long until you felt like a non-smoker?

I am doing great this quit, and really am not feeling very tortured, or like I want to smoke at all, which is wonderful.

However... I still \_feel\_ like a smoker. I feel like a smoker who hasn't smoked for 10 days for some unknown reason. 

When did you start to not feel like a smoker who was trying to quit, and feel like an actual non-smoker?

4 months, I never thought I'd make it this far

I'm really proud of myself, basically everyone in my family is a smoker, my parents, my brother, everyone. It makes you feel stronger than them, it's a strange feeling. This is my 3rd attempt ever to quit, the first two I made it to two months.

Read Allen Carr's book, like everyone else tells you to do in this subreddit. The only thing that is going to make you quit is your attitude, nothing else will help you.

Thank you guys for your support, seeing other people quit motivated me even more.

Here's a little [motivational video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) from me too :)

Have a nice day!

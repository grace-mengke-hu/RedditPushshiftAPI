7th Day, i hope this is useful.

Hello, i wanted to share my story hoping it would help new quitters or someone who's planning to quit. This is my 7th day and i know there's a long way yet. but here's what happened.

I smoke a pack a day, and when i decided to stop smoking i knew i couldn't go cold turkey since when i'm fasting during the month of Ramadan i get very nervous, light headed etc...so i got 2 mg of Nicotine Gum. 

First day i used 9, second day i used 9, third day 7, fourth day 7, fifth day 5, sixth day 0.

I read on the internet how people got addicted to nicotine gum and went on chewing it for 8 or 10 years, so i panicked and i stopped chewing it the next day, the reason why i'm quitting is to take back control and kick all bad habits. although it did help me get passed the first few days.

So the next morning i said, i'm going to see how long i can make it without using the nicotine gum. they taste awful, so i kept reminding myself how awful they are and that i'll wait a bit more before taking one. and now it's been 24 hours since my last gum and i'm not feeling nervous or lightheaded etc, and the great thing was that for the past 24 hours, i wasn't thinking about Smoking! i was thinking not to chew the gum! :D   

So for now i'll keep my mind focused on the gum if i feel weak and succumb to a craving i'll chew a gum instead of smoking. hopefully i had my last Cigarette and my last piece of Nicotine Gum forever!

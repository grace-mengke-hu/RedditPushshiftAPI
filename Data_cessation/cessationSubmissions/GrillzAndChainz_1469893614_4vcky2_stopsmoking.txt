Severe mood swings and depression in the last week I've been clean

After not having nicotine for the last week, I've almost got into two fist fights with my friends. I've lashed out at people, and in hindsight all of this was a little out of line. Usually I can take criticism and shit in a laughing manner, but this past week I have just got into the biggest arguments over pretty minor things. I've also fucking cried on two separate occasions, and I feel like a pussy for being that sad. My life certainly isn't going to well rn but before I quit nicotine, I've been able to be rational about my woes. Right now though, I just feel like I'm at absolute rock bottom, and I feel like everyone has a problem with me. Ive been drinking a lot of alcohol and drinking caffeine to get a buzz lately to keep my mind off of nicotine.

I dont know, Im just wondering if this is normal and what the prognosis is based off of other peoples experiences with withdrawals

So I keep gagging when i wake up...

So I have thrown up several times now on three seperate occasions to be exact.  Today was especially significant though.  
I woke up and gagged until I vomited up phlegm three times and the third time I was outside my apt and the sun baked it right away.  The film was silver...  I have a picture it kinda scares the hell outta me.  I have quit cold turkey for thirty nine days now.  I will post the pic prolly just wanted to get the info out first.  These things are poison!!  The fuck was inside me mercury?!?

32 days not smoking.Money well spent.

After 7 years of smoking almost a box a day now I am enjoying my 32nd smoke-free days. I had never tried quitting before only tried smoking less..well with not much success. 

Finally, I made a decision that if I want to change my habits and life why not do it at the same time? I decided that I would save up the money that otherwise I would spend on smoking (I'm living in Denmark so I would spend 190-200$ on smoking in a month) and go travel every month from that amount.
When I dropped the cigarette I had some carvings in the first some days, not that harsh ones though and also realized that it is just a mindgame. I became totally determined about not smoking when I was checking all the achivements I made daily in the apps(about health) and bought my flight ticket to Porto(Portugal) to do my first ever solo-trip. Even going out with smoking buddies and drinking on weekend couldnt derail me from my goals.

I only brought 200$ to Porto and those 5 days of solo-travel gave me experiences that a month of smoking never would! I'd rather chase these experiences in every month than smoke!

Well, I just wanted to share it and hopefully can motivate someone who is thinking about quitting. The money thing and just to save up wouldnt be a good motivator...but saving up for something that you have been dreaming of, probably would.

Tl;dr: quit smoking, went travelling.

In 30 minutes, I will be smoke free for 24 hours!

I haven't been able to go 24 hours without a smoke in forever and I am really excited about this! I don't ever have to smell like an ashtray again! But my brain is trying to play tricks in me. I am so irritable and am feeling sorry for myself. Typing this out helps me to see how silly my mood is. Thank for reading. Not one puff ever!

For realsies this time

This time it's real. My husband and I are going through marriage counseling (it's own ordeal) and he shared that one of his big gripes is that I'm still a smoker. I said I would do this for him. 

I've smoke since I was just over 18 and am now 27. I'm just a few months shy of a decade. I don't smoke all that much, considering, but I still do. 

Tonight is it. I came to the end of my pack at the end of the day and I'm starting tomorrow fresh. It's going to be good for me. I need to do this. I want to do this. 

Fingers crossed.

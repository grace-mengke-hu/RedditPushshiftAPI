I think I just, no I DID just smoke my last cigarette.

I've been lurking in here for months thinking about it every day but never actually saying those words, making that commitment. I'm 25 years old and have been smoking for 10 year. Well, not anymore. I've lost too many close to me to smoking related illness. So today, I'm committing to the cause and have requested my badge. Here's to a healthier life. Thank you in advance for all your support /r/stopsmoking. I'm going to need it!

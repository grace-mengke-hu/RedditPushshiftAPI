Quit about 2 weeks ago, still craving

I haven't had a smoke in about 2 weeks now. I went from about 3/4 a pack a day to only 3 a day for a week to one a day for a week. 

The cravings are terrible. I thought that I would be over the craving part by now, but I'm not. It's frustrating that I can light one up right now and start back up just like that.

Any advice on how to keep it up? What were things you did when you were craving? I drive for my job, and ALWAYS had a smoke when I was behind the wheel. That's when I most wanted them... and after sexy times lol.

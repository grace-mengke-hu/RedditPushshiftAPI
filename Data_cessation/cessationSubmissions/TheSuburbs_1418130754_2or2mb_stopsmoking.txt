3 Weeks!

Thanks for the help, guys. Feels great to finally be able to smell, breathe, etc. I think it's just about time to start the diet/workout phase of my new lifestyle. 

For those who are just starting their journey, keep it up! I know you're in a bad mood, we all have been there, but you will smile once you realize how well you are doing!

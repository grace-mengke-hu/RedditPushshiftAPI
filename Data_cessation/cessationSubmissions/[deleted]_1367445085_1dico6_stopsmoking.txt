Worst timing ever?

I'm quitting smoking.  Again.  This is day 4.  The first few days were easy because I got (yet another) Upper Respiratory Infection and was practically bedridden through yesterday morning.  I get them about three times a year... For as long as I've been smoking, anyway.  So, I guess I'm more or less here to rant.  

My sister is halfway across the country being discharged from a mental hospital today, and she can't figure out where she's going.  My mother (lives near me) seems to not want anything for sis besides things that would be nearly impossible for her to handle right now.  Mom won't take her in -- though she has no problem with me doing it -- which I'll do if I have to, but I am in the midst of a major career move that is likely to take me out of state.  Mom doesn't want my aunt take her in -- they don't get along for a lot of reasons.  Whatever.  It's such a long story that I can't even type it all out right now.  I'm just so overwhelmed by everything.

My love life is a mess, my work life is a mess, my financial situation is barely scraping by, my friends aren't really my friends anymore...  And I can't stop worrying about my sister.  I know smoking a cigarette isn't going to fix any of these things, but goddamn if I don't want one just to calm down.

GAH.

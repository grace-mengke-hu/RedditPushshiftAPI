Wanderlust for the Journey Ahead

Hello all from a long time lurker, first time poster to this sub.

I have been a smoker for 13 years, averaging around a pack a day. Wow... That was a shocking sentence to type. I think that's the first time I have honestly looked at how long I have been at this habit.

I have only tried to genuinely quit smoking once before--I went 2.5 months without a cigarette.  While I have half-heartedly tried to stop 20 or so times since then, this is the first time that I'm recognizing my desire not to stop smoking; but, to become a non-smoker.

This post is to simply document publicly, in words, that here and now I am looking forward to this journey.

Goal for tomorrow: Write up why I want to become a non-smoker and why I do not like smoking.

Any advice or constructive criticism is welcomed (as is encouragement). Hopefully I will get over my shyness and reach out to others in this community as well.

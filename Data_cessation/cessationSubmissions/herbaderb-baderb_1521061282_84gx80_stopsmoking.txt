I need help.

I honestly didn’t think I was addicted until I decided to actually stop smoking a few months ago. My habit shot up to almost a pack a day and it’s ridiculous. I don’t even really like it anymore but I just keep going. I know cold turkey is the way to go but I’ve quit that way before in the past and always go back.
I’m wondering if anyone has any experience with the nicotine gum or patches. I tried the gum a few days ago but apparently got a pack that was too strong because it only made me sick. Up until that point though, it seemed like it really helped curb the cravings.

I got rid of one of my triggers so far, which will hopefully help but I need to figure out what to do in the car. It’s so hard to separate smoking from driving, because for so long I’d squeeze in one or sometimes two cigarettes into my 15 minute drive to work. It’s disgusting, I know. I don’t even know why.

I think a major problem is that I’m not sure I *want* to quit. It’s so gross and dumb but in my brain I still romanticize this stupid habit. It’s like I know it’s wrong and I always have but I have to fight with my own brain to start even trying to be healthy. I *want* to quit and I *need* to quit but I also just want to keep going. 
Has anyone had any success with quitline or any of those stop smoking books?

I don’t know, I just feel like I’m going to be miserable no matter what, but I want to be able to breathe again. So this *will* happen. I just need something to help it go along :/

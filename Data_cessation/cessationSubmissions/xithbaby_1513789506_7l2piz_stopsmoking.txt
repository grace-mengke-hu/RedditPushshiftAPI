Question for quitters.

Last May I got bronchitis. It took me 3 months to beat it. Couple weeks later I got another and another. Now I have a constant cough and junk in my lungs that won’t go away. My quit date is 1201am on the 1st of January. I’m ready. My question is if you’ve had lung issues like I have did it finally stop ever? I’m so sick of coughing. Thanks in advance.

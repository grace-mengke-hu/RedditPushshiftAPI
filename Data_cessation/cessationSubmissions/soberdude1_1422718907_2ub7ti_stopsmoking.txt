800

Never thought this would be possible. I was resigned to being a smoker of the rest of my life. Thanks to Mr. Allen Carr and learning the truth about my nicotine addiction, quitting was easy this time. My wife has her birthday today, 800 days smoke free for me, what a great present for the both of us. 

Any one can quit. No one ever died from a nicotine craving, even though our brains tell us we're going too. Cravings pass if we smoke, cravings also pass if we don't.

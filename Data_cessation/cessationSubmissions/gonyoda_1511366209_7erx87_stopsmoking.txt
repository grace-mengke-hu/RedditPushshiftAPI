Recent stopper, need some help

Hey guys - I've smoked about a pack every day or so since I was 18(cough cough 16) and I'm now 28. I've tried quitting in the past, but it's never stuck. This past weekend, I decided that I would give it an actual effort.

Now, on day three, the urges are INSANE. I've actually never gotten past a whole day or so, so please, anyone, what can I do to get these urges to go away? I don't want to smoke anymore, vape or otherwise. Please, any help. Thanks.

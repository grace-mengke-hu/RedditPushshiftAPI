Day one and I'm absolutely terrified

Hi everyone! I'm on my first day of quitting and it's hard for me to stop thinking of the withdrawal period as endless. I've tried to quit at least four times before this over the 10+ years I've smoked. This time I'm trying lozenges. Wish me determination and courage--I'm going to need both.

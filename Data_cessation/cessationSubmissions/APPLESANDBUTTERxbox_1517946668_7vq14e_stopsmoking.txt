Drinking and Smoking.

Hello! First time poster here in a bit of a doozy. 

I'm a 23 year old male, aiming to be completely smoke free by my 24th birthday, in August. 
 Well last night I slipped up. I was 4 beers and one margarita deep, and lit up. And then another, and another. 
I smoked 3 cigarettes after not smoking for 11 days.
 
Those 11 days ago I was only 1 beer deep, and also smoked 3 cigarettes with the same friend. I was 7 days smoke free. 

THOSE 7 days ago I was 6 shots deep and 2 beers and smoked 6 cigarettes. Before that I was also 7 days smoke free, rather I should say DIP free. 

I feel like I'm making progress but I'm guilting myself over smoking last night. I don't feel like doing anything or talking to anyone about it. But I don't want to give up on my goal. I'm leaving for Spain in a month and a half, and I do want to drink when I'm over there, but I want to be able to not smoke. I feel like I'm running out of time to get my addiction under control and that I'm not making progress fast enough... Just needed to vent.

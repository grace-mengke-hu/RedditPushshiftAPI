33 days cold turkey femur break

Basically it's been 33 days since my last cig. I went from 20 a day to 0 following a rather traumatic femur break and the doc told me I could either risk my femur not healing properly or at all or continue to smoke till my hearts content. I value my femur recovering hence the abrupt quit. Wish me luck.

40 hours without smoking

It's been 40 hours now since the last time I smoked weed. I've been an active smoker for 2 years, 3-4g/day.

I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping for the first night, anxiety, sweating like a m*fo, waking up in the middle of the night. But god it feels good to not being high for once. 

Feels great to just type it out as well.

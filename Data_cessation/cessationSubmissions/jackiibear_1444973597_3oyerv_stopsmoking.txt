Bloody noses anyone?

2 weeks in and I'm noticing lots of phlegm and congestion, normal I know. The past couple days however, I've been having bloody boogers. Today when I blew my nose in the shower, it was a big bloody mess (sorry to be graphic) and it scared the shit out of me. Talk about your anxiety skyrocketing. Anyone else experience bloody noses in their first stages of quitting?? Is this normal?

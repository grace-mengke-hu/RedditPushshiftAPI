I cheated the /r/stopsmoking system. And I'm glad I did.

I relapsed and smoked half a cig while drunk around day 15. I went to reset my badge but i didn't. And you know what? I'm glad i didn't. Instead I kept the momentum going and didn't look back. Now I'm at day 69 and I'm not looking back. Don't get too into the numbers. All numbers  aside, all that matters is that we quit this awful habit. By any means necessary.

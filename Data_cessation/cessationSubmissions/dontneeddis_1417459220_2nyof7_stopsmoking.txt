Need help guys...

I have tried to quit two times, both times I was resolute in 'not smoking again'.

I picked up the habit again, and now after 6 months or so, smoking is causing me anxiety - I am constantly overstimulated.

Problem is, I don't really want to quit.  Don't get me wrong, I 'want' to, but after a month, I will just come to conclusion that life on cigarettes is better.
I also become tired of 'hating myself' for smoking, and inevitably fall into the trap of letting me act on my impulses.

I would like to quit, but I'm not really sure how, I don't have faith that I will stick to it.

Comments/Suggestions are appreciated, hoping somebody dug themself out of where I am.

Thanks

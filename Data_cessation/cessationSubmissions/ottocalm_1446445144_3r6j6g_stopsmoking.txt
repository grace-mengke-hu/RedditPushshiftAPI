smoke free life is full of traps!

Today is the 23rd day of smoke free life. Weekend was very tough! We had a party at our home full of friends, wine and delicious food. But all of our friends were smoking! My wife likes to light up a cigarette along a glass of wine every now and then but she is very successful in doing it only once or twice in a week. Anyway I was close to getting drunk around late night and when I saw her out smoking, at one moment I found myself out in the garden, with a cigarette and a lighter in my hand. I was so close to lighting it up but luckily my life did not let me. She took it away from my hand and threw it away with hers.

First time posting here, I've been smoking about 4 packs a week for 3 years and I've tried to quit about 5 times. Electronic cigarette did not help me. Hopefully this will be my last try.

I've been lurking on this sub for quite some time and I'm impressed to see how well many of you are doing. Care to offer any tips?

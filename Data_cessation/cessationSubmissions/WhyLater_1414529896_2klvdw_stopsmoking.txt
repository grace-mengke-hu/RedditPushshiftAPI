I can't believe it's been a year! Some encouragement to help you join me at the smiley star.

Yet I have a sinus infection today. That's some fun irony.

For those of you in the early stages: you will be amazed at how fast it flies by. After the first week or so, you think about cigarettes less and less, and you start thinking about life more and more, until suddenly - whoa, it's been a year. You'll have the occasional craving out of nowhere - I still do - but they become laughably easy to manage.

So don't feel discouraged because your badge says 7 days, or 3 days, or even 1 day. The only difference between you and me is one little breakthrough and a year of just living life!

Stay strong, brothers and sisters. :)

**Edit:** I'll share the tidbit reddit shared with me:

>Did you know: In the Aztec language, the name for gold is "teocuitlatl", which means "excrement of the gods".

Thanks for the divine poop. :D

**Edit^2:** Apparently it is also now my cakeday, so here's the story behind that. I had been lurking on reddit for a month or so at work, never really going far beyond the default subs. It was around then that I discovered /r/stopsmoking. After lurking there for another couple weeks, I decided to take the plunge and, well, stop smoking. To help me out, I remember now, I decided to finally make a username on reddit and start frequenting and posting to this sub. I never looked back.

Guys, if you're not sure about this sub, let me assure you - this is an amazing community. They *will* support you, help you, and inform you. Knowledge is power, and this sub is an armory. So, with that, I say cheers on my cakeday to everyone here at /r/stopsmoking!

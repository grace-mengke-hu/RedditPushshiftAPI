48 Hours In - From a Vaper

I've spent the past year of my life vaping *(still counts as smoking, I know)* 27 mg/ml cartridges almost daily. I buy them in 2 packs and smoke one each day, it has become a bad habit. Think of a Juul, but less nicotine content. Monday morning, I decided that I was going to quit. I threw away all of the batteries, chargers, and cartridges that I own.

It has been 48 hours since I quit and I am miserable. Between the weird sleeping, being either really hungry / not hungry at all, anxiety, depression, shaking, it has been hard. I am determined to quit and I **promise** that I will not go buy another battery or cartridge. I'm wondering when it will get better. I feel like minutes have become hours and time is at a crawl. I've been running daily and smoking pot at night to help the time pass. Your support is greatly appreciated. I just want my life back without relying on a cartridge day and night.

Holding your breath

this is something ive been doing, along with deep breating when ever i get a craving... i  will hold my breath for a minute... not sure if its the lack of oxygen, or the practice of dicipline.. but i find it helps.. i even get a little euphoria from it... and ive been reading around.. it seems like theres not much danger in holding your breath for a minute or less... longer amounts of time yes... but im just talking about a minute every once in a while

Not sure how but I'm at 2 weeks and I feel done, I am just done smoking

I get the occasional craving but I always know it will pass and it isn't worth it. I will probably have to always remind myself I can not have just one but for several days now I've been feeling like I finally succeeded and am done. I wish I could say what to do to make it as easy to quit as it has been for me this time but I'm not sure what did it. I do know it will never be this easy to quit again so I absolutely can not fuck this up. Thanks to everyone here and especially those that post after giving in to a craving, reading your stories has been a huge help. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have, I'd love to try to help anyone.

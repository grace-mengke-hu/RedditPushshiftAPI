Today is the last day I will be a smoker, for good.

I have quit a few times with years in between. Ended up going to a music festival this summer and picked the habit back up, and oh boy do I regret that decision.

I am quitting tomorrow, cold turkey as I have done before. I'm super excited not to have to spend 10 bucks a day, or smell like shit anymore. The time has come, I'm going to kick it.

E: yep, I need to update my flair to 0 (done!).

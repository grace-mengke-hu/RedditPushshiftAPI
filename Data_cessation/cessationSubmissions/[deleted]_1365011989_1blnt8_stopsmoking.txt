journey towards quitting - wish me luck

i'v been a weed smoker since i was 16 (im 25 now) and  a cigg smoker for 4 years. Funny thing is ciggs are something that have been fairly easy for me to quit, i dont seem to get addicted to them as much as weed. Il smoke for couple months, stop for couple months. Smoke not more than 3-5 a day and after 5 i feel sick so i get done. Weed is something that has been the greatest impact in my life and i would like for it to go away forever. Its really hard but i know i can do it if i give it all i got. Lets see how it goes. BTW in the past 6 years since 07 the longest iv been without smoking weed is 10 days and that was once. Please wish me luck i need it.
Some personal stories would help. i love to see people that bounce back from there addictions and make a better person out of them selfs. I hope to be that one day

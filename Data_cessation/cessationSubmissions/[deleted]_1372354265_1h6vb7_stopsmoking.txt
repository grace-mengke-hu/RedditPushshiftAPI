9 Days strong, anticipating an obstacle and I could use some advice.

Heyo,

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 9 days, which is awesome.  Congratulations to everyone else who has quit, is in the process of quitting, or plans to quit.

This weekend, I will smoke weed.  During my entire cigarette smoking career, I would smoke weed, smoke a cigarette, and then play videogames during my free time (in that order).  I have gone through this routine countless times.  I already want to buy pack this weekend so I can resume this routine, and I know that once I buy a pack I am a smoker again and will have thrown away my hard work.  

My brain keeps telling me that the cigarettes give me some sort of "extra boost," and I can't seem to convince myself otherwise.  I'm hoping someone can help me overcome this.  I really think that this is the last major hurdle for me.

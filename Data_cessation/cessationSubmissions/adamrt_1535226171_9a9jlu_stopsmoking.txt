Starting over after nearly a decade

My flair says 2966 days today. Last month would have been 8 years no smoking for me. I smoked a pack a day for 15 years prior to that. Unfortunately I started again through some random circumstances. I watched myself doing it and I couldn't believe it while I watched it happen. Took about a week to go from having a drag, to a pack a day again. That was in April. Mostly related to drinking alcohol ruining my will power once I started.  While the first couple were nice, the reset have sucked and have just been addiction driven. 

You stink, you aren't healthy, you are spending dumb money, are you wasting time, you aren't eating properly, you are constantly nagged by it. And by you, I mean me.  Get your shit together.

I had one big last vacation with smokes and beers and planned to quit after. That time is now.

Can someone please reset my badge to Thursday. Thank you.

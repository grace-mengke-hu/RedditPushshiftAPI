The start of my journey

Hi guys, this morning I decided I’m going to quit smoking. I’ve been smoking a pack a day for over 3 years but current circumstances are making it less comfortable for me to smoke. I downloaded the smoke free app and have been looking around on this subreddit a lot, which is already helping!

I plan on stopping at a gas station on the way home from work today and picking up some sugar free gum. Any other cheap suggestions I could try to maybe distract me from cravings?

I think my biggest hurdles will be stepping outside during slow days at work, and being bored at home. I’d love some ideas on what I could do instead of smoking (I calculated it and I could save over two hours a day if I quit).

I’m most excited about being able to breathe and smell and taste normally again. I’m also tired of smelling like smoke lol.

So congrats to all of you guys who quit and keep going to everyone that’s still working on it! Any support for my journey would be more than welcome.

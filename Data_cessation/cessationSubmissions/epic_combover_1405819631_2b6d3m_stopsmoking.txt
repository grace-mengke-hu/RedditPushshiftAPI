I really miss it, a lot

Hi guys, and gals I assume, sorry. I come from a daily life that is pretty rich in tobacco products, whether dip, chew or smoke. I understand the health risks of tobacco, and even can feel their negative effects on my fitness but I honestly feel terrible, I miss them when I quit. I quit smoking for several years and began again a few months ago. I quit dip and chew this past December and am still going strong without them. But smoking, man I love smoking. Last Sunday I finished the pack and decided I was done, I could really feel it in my lungs, and of course I was getting pressure from the family to quit as well. I know I'm right around the week mark where things get especially tough quitting an addiction, but even when I was off smoking for years I would sit around people smoking just to get that smell, that second hand smoke. What habit can I start to fill that feeling I'm missing out on, I miss that feeling of relaxation, of calm while I smoked a cigarette a couple times a day.

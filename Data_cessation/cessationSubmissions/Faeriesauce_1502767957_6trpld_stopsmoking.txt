One month smoke free!

I've been a 2-pack smoker for 35 years. Using the patch and gum. So many benefits to doing this, and it's starting to get easier. Better late than never. I used my cig $ to join a gym. I read a book called The Power of Habit that's been really helpful. Haven't been afraid to lean on my support people, and have the Smokefree app as well. If I can quit, I'm pretty sure anyone can.

13 Days! But not feeling very proud :/

Hello! I´m new here and not writting on my native language so, sorry for any typo!I´m 34 and and I´ve been smoking for 20 years now. Stoped a few times for a couple months and tried to stop the rest of the time :p It´s been years since I went almost two weeks without a cigar and I really want and belive that this time is for good, but..I can´t feel proud of my achievement! It´s like I´m on auto pilot mode...

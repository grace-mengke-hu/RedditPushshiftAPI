Didn't crave once today

I'm just finished day 15. As I was going to bed, I realized that today is the first day that I didn't think about smoking even once. I only remembered it when I went to check this subreddit, as has been my routine for the past two weeks.

I didn't crave even once today! I love being a nonsmoker!

How it really feels after 150 days.

**Beware anyone who just stopped smoking or looking forward to stop smoking, the following text could be discouraging.**

So it's been 150 days. How I feel? No more cravings. Occasional vaping is what's left of 5-6 years of smoking a pack/day. Cigarettes smell bad, I prefer staying away from anyone who's smoking, even though I respect and understand their choice of lifestyle.

As for how it really feels... The only thing that was indeed noticeable is shortness of breath, it just vanished. I regularly commute to my university and I have to get past two escalators going up. I've always ran through them and when I did it I felt like dying. Now though, it became really easy, I barely sweat.

Other stuff people talk about - I never experienced it. Everything smells and tastes the same, I always feel the same, my sleep is the same. I think it's like some kind of placebo for everyone who's praising magical effects of non-smoking life.

Stopping smoking didn't put me in the world full of rainbows and unicorns. I just don't smell like shit anymore and now I have beer money. Otherwise it's all the same.

**EDIT:** Despite all that I'm grateful for what I have achieved. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2h403a/i_always_thought_that_i_could_quit_anytime_i_want/) is how it all started and this subreddit did really help.

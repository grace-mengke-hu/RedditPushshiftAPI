Second day

Hi,

The day before yesterday I read Allen Carr his book in one day. Quit smoking that evening/yesterday morning.
Been smoking for almost ten years, 20 a day I think. It's been fairly easy so far actually. Only feel a little tired during the day, my eyes are burning. (I dont even know if this is a common withdrawl syndrom? 
Anyway, I was thinking about downloading an app for quiting, since it gives my insight on my quitting. On the other hand it makes me focus on quitting (or focus on smoking) everytime I look on my phone. 
How are your experiences?

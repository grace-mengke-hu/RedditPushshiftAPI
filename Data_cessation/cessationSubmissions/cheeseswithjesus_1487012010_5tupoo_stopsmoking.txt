Was smoking only a habit and not an addiction for me?

I'm on my 8th day smoke free. The most I've smoked is 10/day and more recently before I decided to quit only 1-4/day. Since I've been smoke free I didn't experience any headaches or physical symptoms. If anything, maybe I was a little irritable. I've avoided people who smoke so as not to tempt myself and I haven't found it to be that difficult to not smoke (thankfully, and I think even my runs are easier now which is awesome).

I assumed it would be harder though. I'm glad it hasn't been, of course, and when I see friends who smoke in the future I'm sure there might be some temptations there. Still , does this mean I wasn't physically addicted? Only by habit? I love gum and constantly like to have a minty taste in my mouth while I chew something but I doubt you can say that some has a true addiction to gum, just a habit? I usually go through a pack or two of gum a day lmao.

So what do you think? Is it possible to have only a habit with cigarettes?

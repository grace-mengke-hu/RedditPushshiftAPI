On behalf of your loved ones, thank you.

My grandmother was a smoker until near the end of her days. The only time she was successful in quitting was when she was literally on deaths door. She was too late, and died thanks to cancer, likely caused by her habit

It's getting close the the anniversary of her death again. While I will always hate that she couldn't kick the habit, I am so grateful for every time she tried to. Every cigarette she chose not to light gave me more time with her.

So I thought I'd come and say to all of you trying to keep your lungs clean, thank you so much for all your efforts. Whether you haven't touched one in three years or routinely give up after day or two, your loved ones are grateful for every single time you choose not to smoke.

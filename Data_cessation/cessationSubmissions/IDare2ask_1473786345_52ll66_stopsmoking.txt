How to successively quit? Questions and some advice.

Since 3 years ago, I had significantly (>80%) reduced smoking but my quitting attempts so far have failed. So, I am in a zombie situation with both smoking and need for more smoke. I used to be a heavy coffee drinker but I recently reduced it greatly. I only drinked a beer or two as adolescent, I am 35 now and drink perhaps 3 drinks a year. No other substances.

I know from experience that quitting cold turkey is not for me. I am planning to try vaping for reducing nicotine intake and peak concentrations and then graddually reduce to zero. Still, I am afraid of relapsing so I want to be best prepared for a total war against nicotine.

I will consider bupropion and chantix in the future, if the oncoming attempt fails, although chantix sounds a bit scary. Nicotine patches is not a option because in my region the only provider failed to support the market for a prolonged time some 3 years ago, which raises question about its credibility: imagine you are dependent on patches and suddenly you cannot find them in the market. You start smoking again and it takes at least a year or two before you try again. Bonus: you feel awful for failing, like it was your fault. This is why NO people in my area (Greece) use patches anymore. Gums are also not good since they produce unpleasant feelings in the throat.

I discovered one reason why my previous attempts failed: caffeine. Caffeine metabolism is doubled in heavy smokers' livers and thus if you quit or greatly reduce nicotine without making sure to reduce caffeine by at least 50%, you experience irritability, insomnia, jitterness and in general the usual caffeine-related anxiety symptoms. And what do you do to relieve them if you can't find the cause? A cigarette or a drink looks like a good idea...

So, this time I reduced caffeine gradually till the point of almost getting rid of it (I drink some green tea, even that limited). A fellow redditor made a post somewhere with his advice revolving around the following:

- Reduce daily caffeine intake by 25mg per 3 days to avoid headaches and other withdrawal symptoms.

- If you go below 75mg daily, tolerance does not develop. This means that if your average intake is below this limit and you suddenly need some coffee, that one (or half) coffee will do exactly what it is supposed to do.

I followed his advice and it worked wonders for me, a heavy coffee drinker who used to drink coffee since... 10 years old. No headaches, it took perhaps a month to taper down but I had no side effects at all, while if I tried cold-turkey statistics say I would suffer for 40 days from headaches.

Unfortunately, reducing coffee resulted in an almost 2-fold increase of smoking for me, so now I am at around 40% of my glorious days. Still, I feel stronger and more able to succeed this time, but I want to be better prepared for side effects. My messy plan so far includes the following secondary goals:

- Before switching to vaping, reduce smoking by extending the time without a cigarette. My experience tells that this should succeed in making me able to endure more than 2 hours without cigarette, and then have just one, for a total of around 8 per day.

- Keep caffeine limited as I am doing in the past 8 months with perfect success.

- Start using music for inducing desired mental state, instead of substances.

- Physical exercise, especially aerobic (running, swimming, cycling).

- Make sure I get enough of everything in my diet.

- Try to find solutions for constipation (legumes and fruit sound good, but perhaps I need to consult a doctor for something stronger in case I need it)

- Try to find solution for stimulating, beyond the above. Cocoa is an idea, but I am scared of trying strong substances and even caffeine has to be limited in my case. So I try to find ideas. Some people say tryptophan-rich foods or some b-class vitamin supplements could help. Until I know more, I am limited to the above mentioned.

A memorable attempt was cold turkey but resulted in persistent constipation after 2 weeks. I was not prepared for it and could not think clearly and chose the worst anti-constipation drug in the market: a cigarette or two.

Another memorable attempt was with vaping (with nicotine) but my pen was stolen and I was in a camping far from vaping stores. I persisted with vaping with excellent results regarding reducing smoking and good results regarding reduction of nicotine intake but those batteries fail all the time when forgotten in a warm place, like my car. This time I will choose a more advanced vaping device, with extra pen(s) just in case, and avoid placing it in hot places. I will have 2 of everything: 2 pens, 2 chargers and so on.

Does anyone here have any insight about how nicotine and its metabolites work? Don't be shy, I can understand a lot of chemistry and biology. I am particularly interested in the following phenomenon that I noticed anecdotally: after 7 months, smokers tend to relapse. Similar phenomena occur with cocaine, but I am interested in nicotine specifically.

Does anyone here have any extra tricks that might be of use for me?

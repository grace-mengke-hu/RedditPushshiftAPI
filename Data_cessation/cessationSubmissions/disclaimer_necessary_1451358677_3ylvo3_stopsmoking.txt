3 week check in, having great success with Black Pepper essential oil

21 days in. Getting easier every day. I posted at day 3 that everything was falling apart and I was struggling-- all the issues passed and I haven't caved. I haven't really come close to caving either, which is surprising to myself even. Im doing well with the vapor pen (just when Ive been drinking or when I'm driving) which is only at 2mg of nicotine for the whole bottle, so barely anything of note. I stopped using the patches after 4 days, they were way too strong and made me jittery.  Ive been surrounded by chain smokers for the holidays and smelling the second hand smoke on them is disgusting, so that has definitely curbed any desire to smoke. it smells awful and it gives me a headache. 

One thing that really helps is black pepper essential oil. My mom had recommended it to me as its a general addiction aid, and theres been studies on it for quitting smoking. Any time I have a craving (which is far less often at this point) I would sniff on a DIY inhaler-- a pill bottle with cotton balls that I had dropped about 10 drops of oil on. It takes care of the craving almost immediately.  I was skeptical when my mom mentioned to try it, but its really been a huge help.

I didn't think I could get past day 3 and here I am on week 3. We've got this, guys.

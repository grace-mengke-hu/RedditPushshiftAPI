Today is the day.

Today is what I consider day one of me stopping cigarettes. I’m 26 and Iv been smoking cigarettes on and off for about 4 years. In the past few months iv noticed the habit getting increasingly worse and worse. I currently have a grandmother who’s now had cancer twice... Breast cancer once and now she has bone cancer. She’s been smoking cigarettes since she was about 15 years old(now 79) and I can’t help but feel as if cigarettes are mostly to blame for her deteriorating health. The last cigarette I smoked was last night and about halfway through I just randomly thought “man, my grandma would kick my ass if she knew I was smoking a cig right now.” I know this won’t be an easy journey because the craving will always be there but I guess my main question for everyone is what do you do after eating, or driving down the road, or halfway through a beer instead of smoking a cigarette now? What is your go to substitute for the craving of a cigarette?

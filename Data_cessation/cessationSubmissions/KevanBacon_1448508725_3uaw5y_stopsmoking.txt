I made it a week this time. Caved after realizing a scary change in my mood.

So I'm about to hit day 9 without a cigarette. Or was. I smoked. 

I've noticed a decline in my mood about 3 days in. At first I was very upbeat, happy, and ecstatic that I was quitting. I said "I'm not a smoker" each time I was asked for a cigarette. I drank my coffee slowly and enjoyed my unknowingly good taste in coffee beans because when I smoked I was tasting all of it. Everything was perfect. 

Then on the third day I noticed my depression was closing in on me. That disembodied feeling hit me, and it hit hard. The clock pretty much stopped up until now. Everything was in slow motion. The loneliness started creeping up on me, along with it was sleeplessness, irritation, and just a despairing sadness. 

I haven't gotten much sleep this past week, which only makes things worse. In my opinion what's making the mental side so hard is that I'm clinically diagnosed with PTSD after a string of events a year ago. 

What pushed me to smoke was this feeling of sudden doom. I started getting extremely suicidal. When that happens I no longer think for myself and I'm at the whim of my mental problems. So I caved. 

I really want to quit. But with what I just experienced, I'm concerned that I'll go completely manic if I didn't already. 

Has anyone experienced this? It wasn't just sadness. It was plotting a way to go out.

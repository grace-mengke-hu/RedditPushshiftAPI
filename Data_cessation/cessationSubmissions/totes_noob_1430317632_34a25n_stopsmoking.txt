Wisdom Tooth Removal, Optimal time to quit?

I've been a smoker for 10 years, and in the last year have felt significant cognitive dissonance toward smoking. Two years ago I quit drinking and smoking pot, this is the last bad habit.
I'm 29, and really don't want to take this habit into my 30s. In my 10 year goals, I set this one for next year.

Tomorrow I get a wisdom tooth pulled, so I've cleared my schedule for the next 3 days. I've read that I shouldn't smoke for 3 days following the procedure. 
Has anyone else quit using an extraction as a catalyst for quitting? Any tips, advice, best practices?

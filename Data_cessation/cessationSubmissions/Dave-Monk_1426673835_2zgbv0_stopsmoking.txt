Champix/Chantix

Has anyone else tried it? 

I'm currently on my 3rd set of tablets and I find it a massive help. Although I find it helps with the Nicotine cravings and not kicking the habit of smoking (Which I'm sure we all know is half the battle)

How do others find it? And have you had any weird side-effects?

Edit: Also, well done everyone for quitting! With or Without Champic/Chantix. Everyone loves a quitter :)

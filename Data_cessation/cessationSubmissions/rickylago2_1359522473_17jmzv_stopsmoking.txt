Something that could work for people trying to quit.

This may have already been said in here. But something that I've definitely noticed to help quit smoking. 
Roll your own cigarettes. I mean you buy tobacco, rolling papers, and filters.
This makes it easier to wind down, because it is a pain in the ass to roll them. It's also a healthier alternative when you're trying to quit. 
I noticed when I tried to quit without rolling them, I would go a few days, need a smoke, and buy a pack. This is obviously not a great idea, because then you have 19 more just sitting there, begging to be smoked. 

Thought I'd share my own experience.

I caved.

I did the New Years quitting thing. I felt so good, and every time another New Years quitting post came up I felt so good that I was a part of that club. And then it happened. January 17th I went out to brunch with friends and then drunkenly followed them to bars...it was all over when we got to a place with an open patio with EVERYONE smoking. If I hadn't smoked then I would have later on when we went back to my friend's place with beer and a bonfire. No excuses, but I have a pack now and I want it to be my last pack again. Any advice for someone that has relapsed?

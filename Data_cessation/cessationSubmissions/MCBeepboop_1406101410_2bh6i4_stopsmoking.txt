Day 1. AGAIN. Tales of an arduous (but worthwhile) journey.

Well, I made a mistake. I smoked. Not one cigarette, but three. I feel awful about it. 

However, I realized that I get in this emotional state around day three, not devoid of physical symptoms of withdrawal, (Like a burning from my ear canals to my intestines. Most likely it's anxiety. Also sweat. Lots and lots of sweat.) where I feel completely amped up. It's most definitely anxiety. I think I'm going to try to find a mental health professional to talk to, on the cheap, because I don't have insurance. Anyway, I thought I'd let everyone know that I smoked, because I feel terrible about it. All of you have been so supportive, but clearly, I'm weak and addicted. Back on the horse I go. 

I'll have to wait four more days to see that awesome little 4 next to my username.

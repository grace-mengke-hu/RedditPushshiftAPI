Day 106. This is officially the longest I have ever gone without a cigarette.

So, I quit cold turkey, but this is my 5th or 6th time quitting. Many times before I ended up having "just one cigarette" and started smoking again. Usually this happened around the 3 month mark sometimes down to the day. This time I ran out of money and decided it was time to try again. So far so good. Wish me luck! I feel like the hardest parts are behind me, but these are uncharted waters for me.  Any advice/warnings/words of encouragement accepted.

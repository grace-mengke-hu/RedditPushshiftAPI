I never realized how much nicotine was messing with my body.

I smoked for a little over 4 years and finally decided to quit about a month or so ago. I haven't smoked in about 3 weeks, but I was using snus as a replacement to get me over the hack hack, cough cough part of quitting. 

Today's my first day without any nicotine at all, and the difference is amazing. I can actually feel my muscles. My feelings of attraction for women are way more pronounced. Everything just feels better. I don't know if this is typical, but I think nicotine was really screwing with my body in a pretty major way. Note: I dialed down the nicotine over a few weeks, so I think the worst of withdrawal is over for me here. 

Anyway, I don't think I'm going back to nicotine, I like this feeling of energy and increased sex drive. No buzz is worth this sacrifice. It's funny how quickly you can forget what things used to be like before smoking. 

Edit: Oh yeah, I'm not trying to advertise snus here as a replacement, that stuff has its own big issues you gotta watch out for, and it's sorta like out of the frying pan, into the fire.

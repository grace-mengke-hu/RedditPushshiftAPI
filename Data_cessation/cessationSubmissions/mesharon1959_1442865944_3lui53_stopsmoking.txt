Closet Smoker Quit - Cold Turkey (no aids) 9/4/15 at 3:30 p.m.

After twelve years of nearly a pack a day at the end (started 3-6 per day initially, hovered at half a pack for 8 years, and up to a pack this past two years). Decided I wanted to live healthier. I went away over Labor Day with non smoking friends, in a place where I'd never smoked ever. Got me through the first 72 hours. After that it's been super easy! Had I known how easy this would be I would've quit years ago. 

I have now stopped smoking for 2 weeks, 2 days, 21 hours, 31 minutes, 22 seconds. That translates into 337 cigarettes NOT smoked, for a savings of $88.71! At 5 minutes per cigarette I have increased my life expectancy by 1 day, 4 hours, 9 minutes, 40 seconds.

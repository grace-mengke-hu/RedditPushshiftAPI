In case you need some extra motivation!

I’m 29, I’ve smoked on and off for 10 years, I quit 3 days ago because I got taken to hospital. 

I’ve had so many blood tests and xrays and nebulisers and IVs and they’re making me measure my piss - cannot believe I ever took breathing for granted!

If you’re wondering if it’s time to stop, it definitely is. 

(They think it’s a bad chest infection and I’m going to be fine)

Confession time

I was getting ready to type out a bunch of excuses, but that's all they would be..."excuses"

After 7 weeks and 1 day of not smoking, I had a cigarette. Very disappointed in myself. The only positive thing that came out of it was, it made me so nauseous and horrible feeling that I won't be having another one. It didn't even taste good. I used to love how it tasted, not so much anymore.

I guess tomorrow I start my day count all over again.

I fell off the wagon but I'm getting back on...

I stopped smoking for almost 5 months, and then last friday I had a few drinks and well... one thing led to another and I've been smoking since. Today after work I'm going to go buy some patches and refill my eCigs (which helped me before, not at the same time, but each when needed).

I'm not letting it get me down, I'm just going to pick myself back up, dust myself off and understand that it's a battle. Sometimes you get knocked down, but wallowing in self pitty about it will only keep me from stopping. I've done it once, and damnit I can do it again. I think that's what's different this time around. Before I quit last time, I was scared. "What will life be like without these?" I often wondered. 

Now I know that I made it 5 solid months without them, and I DON'T need them. I can quit again. I just needed to open up about this. I considered this a road block, not a failure.

But damn... how quickly we can fall back into our old habits is scary.

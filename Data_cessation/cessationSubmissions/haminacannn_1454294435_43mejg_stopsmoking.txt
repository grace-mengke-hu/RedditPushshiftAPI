I've been craving cigarettes like crazy lately

The craving for cigarettes or vaping has intensified a lot lately. I guess I need to find healthier alternatives to dealing with stress and depression but in my twisted mind getting some nicotine is always a sign of relief. However, I hate the idea of being a slave to it. Of needing to rely on the nicotine to be motivated or deal with whatever emotions I'm going through. The nicest thing is, is that since it's been over a month the cravings are a lot easier to deal with. It's just so damn annoying I can become so fixated on getting that one puff even though I know I will only feel like shit if I get it. 

Edit: Thank you guys! Reading the comments definitely helps reaffirm the fact I don't as actually neef a cigarette!

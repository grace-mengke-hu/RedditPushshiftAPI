Had just one on Day 4...

Dip not smokes, but hey... So, I'm back to Day 1. Made a badge and joined the subreddit. It's time to lay the nicotine down for good.        
      
Kicked heroin over 3 years ago. Being slave to a chemical gives me an especially ugly feeling...and lately, it's been that way with the nicotine.       
          
If a drug might kill you, it should at least be getting you *really fucking high,* right? Nicotine is ridiculous. Wish me luck!

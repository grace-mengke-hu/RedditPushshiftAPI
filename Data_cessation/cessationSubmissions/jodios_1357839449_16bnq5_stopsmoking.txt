Hour 40. 

Had my last cigarette Tuesday night. Spent all of Wednesday motivated and working on various tasks/projects and feeling strong. After a very restless night of sleep, I woke up this morning angry and unmotivated. Certainly in need of advice and encouragement, if you should have any to spare. 

My partner is also quitting, although he has been less sucessful than I...his counter just reset to zero.

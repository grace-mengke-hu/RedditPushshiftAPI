I let myself down

Last night, out of devastation, I smoked half a cigarette. If there’s ever a situation to relapse, this was it. But, I know, there’s never a good enough reason, or situation bad enough to smoke.  So I’m pissed. I’m pissed at myself, I’m pissed at my husband for what he did. I’m devastated. Now, I start all over, again.

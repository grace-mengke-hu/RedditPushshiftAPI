Ready for my mind to play me tricks on day 4..

After struggling on day 3 that to me is the worst of all of them, if you don't smoke on that day you think that you are super strong and that you can do everything in life. I think that's what happened last Friday when I was on day 4, and then I did it and felt horrible and now I'm struggling again a lot on day 3. But have learnt the lesson of the tricks of my mind, read all your support comments and ready to look from and spectator point of view what my mind can do on day 4 (today from5pm). Stay strong everybody! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

People who are quitting WITHOUT the help from Allen Carr

How are you coping? Are you really feeling full of rage and hostile to everyone? Are the cravings really making you wanna rip your hair out?

I want to quit. Everyone here seems to be praising Allen Carr. I've read it before and still smoked afterwards. I was probably missing a point or two. Either that or the book just isn't for everyone.

There must be some of you who have quit without even knowing about Allen Carr. How did you do it?

9 days in

and I'm feeling better than ever. No patch or gum, just some niccotine e-cigging on the weekend. I've had way more many cravings around friends in social environments. It's something I'm gonna have to think about all day every day but its worth it. Reading these forums proves to be quite helpful. And feedback/responses/questions/insight/support greatly apprecited :)

Headaches?

This is my first legit attempt at quitting. I'm on day four. Sure, the cravings suck and I'm a moody son of a bitch, but the worst part for me is that I woke up on day 2 with a headache that has not gone away. It feels very much like a tension headache that goes from temple to temple across my forehead. I've taken Advil and Excedrin and smoked weed (which typically helps) and nothing has gotten rid of this headache. Did anyone else experience this? When does it stop!? I have to work and talk to people all day and this headache is just making it unbearable.

Smoker for 23 years / Wellbutrin?

I quit both times that I was pregnant by tapering down on cigs, and it worked amazingly well. I had no withdrawal symptoms, and I didn't even think about them anymore. Yet both times, as soon as I had the baby, I went back to smoking again. I have to stop this! So many of my friends' parents have died of lung cancer lately; heavy smokers...lung and throat cancer are in my family...I look at my two children and feel horrible; why can't I stop for them???

I just started Wellbutrin. I used it when I was 20 as an antidepressant and liked it for that purpose. Has anyone else used it (Zyban is its other name) successfully to quit smoking? How long did it take before you quit? Already cigs are starting to taste bad to me -- metallic and strange. It's the habit now that I need to deal with...it's a habit to go and take a smoke break for me. 

I'm planning on attempting to taper down again and see what the Wellbutrin does to help. Wish me luck! I long to be cigarette free. I want to live for my children and future grandchildren.

Proposal: Shisha / Hookah as a method of quitting

In past experiences, I've found quitting to be easier when tapering out slowly, and replacing my habit with exercise and other hobbies. 

Shisha / Hookah (water pipes) use special tobacco that contains anything between 0 - 0.5% nicotine. Even the weakest of cigarettes contain a significantly higher percentage of nicotine.

Not only have I found Shisha a great way taper out due to it actually satisfying the urge to smoke, the nature of it forces you to only have one or two sessions a day as it takes ages to set up and is not the sort of thing you put out then come back to later. I've personally found that by then end of sessions, which can last a long while, I actually feel sick of smoking and psychologically put off it for hours, even days.

I'm not saying this method works for everyone but it might be worth looking into. Has anyone else had any success with this method?

Day 2 - second time around

I smoked for almost twenty years before quitting in 2001. That lasted 7 (yeah, SEVEN) years with zero cheats. Still can't believe I did it back then. 


Then I was a big moron and started again. Now I'm at the point where I feel terrible all the time. I'm in the worst shape of my life and it's going to kill me if I don't quit. My dad died at 52 from this shit and I am NOT GOING TO DO THAT!


So wish me luck. Last one was yesterday morning.

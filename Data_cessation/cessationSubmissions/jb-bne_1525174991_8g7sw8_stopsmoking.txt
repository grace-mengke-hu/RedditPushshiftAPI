A week today :-)

Officially knocked over my first week. Itâ€™s been ok for the most part, have been finding my mind trying to convince me that a cigarette would be a good idea a few times - but it soon passed.

Just need to start tapering off the NRT now. It works for sure, but seems kinda like cheating.

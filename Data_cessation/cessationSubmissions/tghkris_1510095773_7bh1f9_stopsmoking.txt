Today was a hard day

So I have been on Chantix for almost two months now and overall things have been going well. My quit date was 10/12 but I stumbled shortly after and gave in to the craving a couple days after. I have not had a smoke since. 

Every day the craving has been there and I have been able to take my mind off it by popping a mint and putting my energy into something else. 

Today was a different story. It started right away this morning with the overwhelming urge to have a cigarette. It was the most powerful urge I've had in the past three weeks! I felt like I was going to go crazy, lose my mind, and bum a smoke from someone at work. 

It took all my will power to not give in! It was a long morning but I got through it. Hopefully there aren't many that are at this level in these future!

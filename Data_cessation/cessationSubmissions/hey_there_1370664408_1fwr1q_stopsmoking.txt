So I quit...and have cheated a bit...then I bought a pack

I quit three weeks ago cold turkey after smoking more than a pack a day for five years. All the while I absolutely loved smoking yet utterly despised it. I went completely clean for a week and then for the past two weeks have only had a small few, bumming one or so when I was drunk. My first cig after cold turkey legitimately tasted disgusted and I felt both physically and emotionally awful the next da. Tonight though I bought a pack. I enjoyed having quit but feel like that because I just bought this pack I'm destined to full relapse. Any thoughts, advice, or helping to get my dumbass to actually quit are all appreciated.

I almost passed out yesterday

So, as I admitted before I failed and started smoking again.

I was smoking a cig on my way to the train and then again while waiting because metra fucking sucks. The train starts coming up and my vision goes out and I couldn't see shit and my head started pounding and really felt like I was about to pass out so I sat down and of course the train came at that fucking moment so I had to suck it up and use my arms to find my way. Like WHAT THE FUCK! Maybe that's my sign to try it again... Whatever happened was fucking terrifying. Has this happened to any of you?

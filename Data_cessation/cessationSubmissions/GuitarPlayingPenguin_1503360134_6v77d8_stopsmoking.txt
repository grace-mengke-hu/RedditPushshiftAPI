Help me, I'm breaking

Hi, I'm 17 (nearly 18) I quit smoking last year, got into it when I was 12-13 (started my
Addiction from padding zutes out with baccy) and it's been a rough 12 months a-levels are hard, been lonely and experienced lots of changes I suppose and I'm constantly needing a cigarette, I've started to replace it with drinking a lot because I don't feel the need for one once I'm drunk (ironically being drunk use to make me crave them like mad) and I've started a new job at McDoanld's and everyone smokes witch has given me an even stronger lust for a roll up and I also really miss that social side of it as well.

I don't really know what I'm asking for from this sub tbh, just help, advice, encouragement anything. I just feel because I poisoned by young mind with nicotine so badly it's almost ingrained in there and will never fully enjoy life free of it.

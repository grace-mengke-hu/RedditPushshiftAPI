Anyone who quit successfully using Zyban?

Hi y'all,

It's been a while since I posted anything here. So, I'm still trying to quit smoking. After numerous failed attempts I decided to talk to my doc about using Zyban. I got a perscription for it, and have been taking it for five days now. I still really don't feel different, so I was wondering if there is anyone on here who quit successfully using Zyban. I really don't know what to expect when I quit this time. What was it like for you? How was quitting with Zyban different from your other attempts? 

I'm really hoping that there are people here who are willing to share their experiences with Zyban.

Thanks!!

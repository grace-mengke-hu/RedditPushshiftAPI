Day 1 and deliberating

Haven't had a cigarette today, first time I've done that in a while. Had a cashflow issue, and have only been having around 3 a day for the past week. Longest a pack has ever lasted me, haha. 

I was with my father earlier today, and mentioned how much I was enjoying playing basketball again (surgery), and being the passive-aggressive person he is, the response I get is: "I'm sure you'd love it more if you quit smoking,"

I hadn't had a boge that morning for I'm not sure what reason, but something made me say, "I actually quit today,"

I haven't had one since then, and I've got two left in the pack. I want one. I know I don't need one. It's not a soul-crushing craving. I'd just like a cigarette. I could just as easily keep lying here, watching Netflix. It's a strange feeling.

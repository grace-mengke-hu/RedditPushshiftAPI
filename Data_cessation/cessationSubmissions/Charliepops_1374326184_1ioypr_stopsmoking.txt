Day five and feeling great!

Today is my fifth day of not smoking! It's been surprisingly easy even though I smoked 20 a day easily for two years! Using nicotine patches as advised by my doctor however they are very low in nicotine! I bought an electronic cigarette and a vaporiser as I thought I would need them but I've only used each once! My boyfriend smokes in his flat and I thought this would make it more difficult for me as I sit and watch him smoke, in a way I just look at him and feel sorry for him that he is still damaging his lungs with the toxins! About to go to work on a bar for a ten hour shift so I'm hoping it will go quick as I'm used to having a fag break every hour or so!

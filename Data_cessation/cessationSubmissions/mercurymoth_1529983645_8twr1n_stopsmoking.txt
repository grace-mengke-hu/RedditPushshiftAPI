I’m struggling.

I haven’t smoked since May 30th. Today I’m basically gritting my teeth after a couple of weeks finally being happy smoke free. I know it’s mental at this point but i just want one so bad. Things have been stressful. I relied on smoking a lot since i quit drinking last October. And now i feel like I’m grasping at straws. I cant say it any other way without sounding deranged but i just miss the taste, the taboo and the quiet moments surrounding it.

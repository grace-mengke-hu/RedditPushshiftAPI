Just made up my mind that I've got to stop

A little info about myself, I'm 22 this year, in university, and been a smoker for more than 3 years now. I picked it up when i was serving in the army. At my...I guess you could say peak, I'd smoke a pack of reds a day. Its now down to a pack of lights a week or so. But what spurred me to quit? I had to climb up the stairs to the 5th floor of my school library cos the lifts were broken, and I hit the top floor COMPLETELY out of breath. And it was frankly humiliating considering I used to be able to run 10k in under 40 mins. Now a flight of stairs defeats me. 

I realise that its not just the smoking. I've neglected exercise in recent months, and I'm starting again this week. But I thought to myself, there's no point exercising to keep fit when you're filling your lungs with all that poison several times a day. So here's to a new, smoke free life. 

If anyone has any advice, please, feel free to give it. God knows I'll need all the help I can get.

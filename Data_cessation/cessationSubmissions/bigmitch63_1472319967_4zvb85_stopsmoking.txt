Day 6 into my life without the sticks.

Hello my fellow addicts. Today is day 6 off of the sticks. I've been a smoker on and off for the last 35 years and have quit numerous times. I think the longest I've ever quit for is about 2 years but have always found a reason to go back to smoking. My inspiration for quitting this time is the two beautiful granddaughters the Lord has blessed me with. With the help of the Lord 8/22/16 will be the last day that a cigarette crosses these lips. I've never used any type of support group before but came across this one off of one of the Apps I'm using. I figured there's no better group to get support from then a group of addicts who have or are going through the same thing I am. Anyway I'm glad I'm here and hope to finally kick this addictive habit once and for all.

Can't sleep and have no desire to have sex.

I'm a 32 yr old male, haven't smoked in about a week. Quit cold turkey after a pack a day. But I haven't been able to sleep at all, like I mean can't sleep until 5am but then I have to get up at 7am for work. Also I just have no desire to have sex, like I just don't want too at all. Its kinda starting to piss off my wife. Anyone else have these problems.

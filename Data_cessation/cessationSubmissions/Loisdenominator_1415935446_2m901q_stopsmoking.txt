What's a craving?

I mentioned I have been reading [this book : The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It](http://www.amazon.ca/The-Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Matters/dp/1583335080).

TIL the dopamine release is not due to the reward per se, but due to the expectation of the reward (i.e. in the case of cigarettes, the relief of withdrawal symptoms, not so much the effects of nicotine on the body).

The dopamine release is what spurs us into action, and is the 'craving'. So long as we keep the cycle going, we keep the addiction alive. In essence, once the peak withdrawal symptoms end in 3 days or so, it becomes much easier. The more you practice abstention, the easier it becomes.

I think the trick is to become convinced that smoking does nothing for you. It does not make you happy, it does not relax you, it does not help you focus, it does not cure boredom. This is why Allen Carr has worked for so many of us. We were so caught up in the never ending cycle that it never occurred to us that it was all a big lie we were telling ourselves.

Just thinking out loud. Almost a year and a half in and I'm still trying to figure out how I smoked for 21 years of my life.

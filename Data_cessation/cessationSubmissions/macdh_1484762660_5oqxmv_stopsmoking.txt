It's time for me to be a nonsmoker

I've been smoking ever since I was 16. I'm 20 now and I've seen what smoking can do to people. For the first time in a long time, I'm ready to be a nonsmoker! I'm tired of my word meaning nothing to myself. I'm tired of feeling ashamed every time I pull out a cigarette and realizing I have no reason for why I am doing this to myself. My health has been declining for years now and I'm watching myself slowly die. I've seen what hiding my addiction has done to my relationships. I've seen my best friend constantly and every day ponder his life due to cigarettes. I seen cigs eating up my bank account week after week and have even counted 600 pennies on days my account is 0.

Now, I'm ready to move forward in my life. I'm ready to make my word count when I say, I quit cigarettes. I will never look back. My life, relationships, money and time is not worth the draw of a cigarette that will just POISON me day after day.

I smoked my last cigarette telling myself how happy I am being a nonsmoker. How I will never look back. How great my life is now that I will have better health, more money, better relationships and how I will never have to walk outside on a porch on a cold or hot day and suffer as I suffocate.

I am thankful for this subreddit, even though a long time lurker. I know I have quit and that I can post here with a peaceful conscious.

Thank you for your time.

I hate this

I have to get this off my chest.  I haven't spent much (or any) time on this subreddit so I apologize if I'm breaking any rules or whatever.  I just need a place to talk about this and some people who understand it.

I fucking hate quitting, in this moment.  Right now I'm having a craving...again.  I haven't smoked for about 19 days now and I'm still getting ridiculous cravings.  There are some days when I basically just bargain with myself all day to get through it, and even then I feel like sometimes I barely scrape by.  I would say I've had three really insanely difficult days.  The rest of them I've just been variations on depressed and pissed, but not struggling each moment.

The worst thing about all this is that nobody gets it.  Nobody I know really smokes, with one exception and he isn't quitting any time soon.  I'm a talker - I like to talk through my problems and occasionally bitch a moan about them.  

So yeah, just had to get this out somewhere.  If you need to rant too, hit reply and let it rip.

Edit* Just got my badge, looks like I was slightly over in my count for days, though I counted the first day as a day as well so *shrug*

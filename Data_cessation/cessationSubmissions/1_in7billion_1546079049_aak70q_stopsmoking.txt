5 months 7 days 0 hours

It’s not often I check the app these days but I’ve kept it running in the background.  So far I’ve regained 40 days of life + 11 spent not smoking and saved over £1,500!

Yes, I still have the odd stray thought about buying and smoking one. They are rare and fleeing at this point.  The way people smell when they’ve been smoking is terrible where as before I couldn’t smell it.  I’m a lot healthier than I used to be and too. 

I spied the diet in January thinking I should concentrate on one thing at a time.  A few false starts last year but finally got my act together. I’ve put on around 7lbs this inch in the grand scheme of things is nothing and will be easily shifted when I restart my January diet.

For those of you looking to stop in January but doubt you can do this here are my tips.

1) Don’t be too hard on yourself. It probably took you a while to start smoking properly after those first cough wrenching days. It may take you a while to stop.  

2) Not down or use an app to see where the money you used to spend on them is now going. If it’s trying to make some memories along the way or just getting that credit card or Christmas paid for without worrying. It all counts 

3) Be proud when you tell people you don’t smoke anymore. It’s an achievement, own it.

Best of luck to you all xx

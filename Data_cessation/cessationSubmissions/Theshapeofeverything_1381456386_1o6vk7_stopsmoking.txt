I have wanted to quit smoking for over a year now...

This is my first post and I know that it is going to sound like many others. I just want a place to talk about this freely and I know this is the place. I have been smoking since I was 18. I'm now 24 and I absolutely hate it. I hate the way I smell, I hate the way I feel after a cigarette, but I keep on smoking. The amount I can smoke now without being phased worries me all the time. I feel like I have really lost control of it. It's one after the other from when I get off of work until I got to bed. 
I don't smoke all day at work so I binge smoke when I get home and when I go out. 
I want to be the person I was before I smoked. 
The problem is I don't DO it. I don't take the first step, which is just saying no to that next cigarette. How can I train myself to take the first step? How can I teach myself to just say no?
I eat really well, exercise at least 6 days a week. But the first thing I do when I get out of the gym or back from a run is smoke. I know that I am killing myself and I know why I want to quit. But I keep on smoking. I feel helpless.
I welcome your comments and insight because I know that most of you have been where I am right now and have overcome it. What were your circumstances?

5 year smoker

I’ve been wanting to quit for this past month. Just recently i’ve been trying to take it more serious. I’ve read that i need to be in a good mindset, try occupying my time when i’d usually be smoking, and drink plenty of water. I’ve also looked into buying Allen Carr’s book if i can’t just do it myself. (though i honestly believe i can do it myself by just putting my mind to) I tried yesterday and went 10 hours without smoking but literally starting feeling a physical need for one, but this friday i know it’ll be an easy day at work then saturday and sunday i have off to i want to start on friday since i also read the first 3 days are the hardest. I was wondering if there was anymore advice from you guys that may help. Thank you again I’ve been lurking here for awhile and you guys are inspiring!

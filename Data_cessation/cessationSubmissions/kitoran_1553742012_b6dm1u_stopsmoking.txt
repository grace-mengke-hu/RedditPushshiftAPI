Are there ways to prevent getting cold?

I smoke a pack per two days. Last november i tried to reduce smoking to one cigarette a day after my chest got really itchy for a couple of days. When i did, my tonsillitis had resurfaced and tonsil stones appeared and i had to wash them at doctor's office during several sessions. I read somewhere on the internet that it's super easy to get cold when quitting because the immune system is weakened or something. Now i want to quit smoking but i'm afraid something like this could happen again. Is it safer to quit gradually rather than cold turkey? What can i do to not weaken my immune system?

Anger, tears, etc

Hello stop smoking! I'm new :) I was wondering if anyone else has this problem of becoming sooooo angry with nicotine withdrawals that they go just put of their minds. I've always been a passionate person.... Wear my heart on their sleeves kind of gal and anytime I quit I do nothing but be mean to those around me without even thinking about it. Its like I can't control it. Just anger and I cry. I cry a lot! I honestly feel i lose my mind. I guess some might say I quit smoking because I've been on an ecig for months. Ecig just gave me a whole other addiction to deal with and it has made quitting even worse. I'm working on cutting that out. So sick of nicotine. If anyone wants to know,  i do not recommend quitting via ecig. So many more problems. Does anyone else bawl their eyes out when they quit? How do you handle the emotions? Sorry if there are a ton of typos as I am writing on an iPad. Thanks in advance!

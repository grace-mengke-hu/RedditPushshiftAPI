How do you guys deal with triggers?

I was a mild smoker during my (short) time in college. Now that I've dropped out I'm back in my parents house so i have to quit. And I get really nostalgic  when I listen to the songs I used to chainsmoke to, start crying for unrelated reasons or watch one of those vintage films that glamorize cigarettes 

TL;DR: I want to smoke when I feel the blues/ listen to Lana del Rey or the frattelis

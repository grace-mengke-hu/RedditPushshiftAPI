Impossible weight gain, please help

Last Friday was the first day I took the plunge into quitting. In six days, I have went from 155 pounds to 167 pounds at 5'10. Can somebody explain how this is even possible? I have been overeating, but not a ridiculous amount. Have also been exercising daily. I would have to be eating like 10,000 calories every day in order to gain this kind of weight. Has this ever happened to you guys? Is it temporary? Getting very discouraged.

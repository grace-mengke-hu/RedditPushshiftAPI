I couldn't even make it one day

All weekend I told myself I was quitting on Monday. Monday Came along and within the first two hours of the day I found myself at the tobacco store buying a pack. I'm back at it. Smoking 7-10 cigs the last few days. I feel depressed when I think about it. Why can't I commit to this? It's really frustrating knowing that I continually do something that is so fucking bad for me. I feel like my life is too stressful to quit smoking right now. The last thing I want is more stress, anxiety, and depression. I'm sure this reasoning doesn't make any sense seeing as how cigs increase stress and whatnot. Need some advice...

I Quit!

I'm 41 and started at 35.  Both my parents smoked my whole life, sister started at 16.  Me the dumbass who always was,against it started at 35.  Yah...I know.  Well...I always said I wasn't addicted and I'm not a smoker.  Hid it from my kids and my mother.  I am officially done.  It's been one week...not as easy as I thought....but feel incredible. Glad to find this site and read others journeys.  My decision to quit was final after I lost a friend from lung cancer.  My father died when I was young from heart disease.  Definitely the smoking eggsasperated it.  Wish me luck! And good luck to all of you! We can do this!

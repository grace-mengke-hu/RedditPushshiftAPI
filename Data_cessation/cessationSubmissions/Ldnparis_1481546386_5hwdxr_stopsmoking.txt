I've stopped smoking and want my boyfriend to stop too, to help me not go back to it but he won't even try. Is he being unreasonable or am I?

Let me just say I feel like a massive hypocrite, because I know how hard of an addiction it is to kick. 

I smoked for 10 years and stopped the day I found out I was pregnant. I really wanted to stop anyway and the night before I discovered I was pregnant I was crying my eyes out and googling how to stop because it was affecting my health but I just couldn't stop. I feel amazing now- I can breath deeply and the circles under my eyes have gone. I never want to smoke again!

My boyfriend doesn't seem to even want to try and stop. He won't smoke around me anymore but the second we are apart I know he chain smokes because it reeks on his breath and clothes. We see his dad often and he is a heavy smoker who is half dead because of it, hes just had a stroke and is always coughing. It makes me cry because I see my boyfriend ending up the same way. We fight about it al the time because I just want us to stop together and live healthily for the baby. He promised he'd stop with me when pregnant but the baby will be here soon and all he seems to care about is sneaking off for cigarettes. 

I'm sick of all the arguing and the stress is not good for the baby. How can I encourage him to stop without causing rows? Or do I just wait for him to do it on his own? The problem is I cant imagine he will ever want to stop.

Quitting smoking cigars today, need some advice!

I have an idea of the timeline involving quitting cigarettes but I have no idea about the difference in recovery involving cigars. I should note, however, that I have been smoking SwisherSweets and I do inhale the smoke.

Any advice on what to expect in the coming weeks? Thanks!

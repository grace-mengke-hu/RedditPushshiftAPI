Feeling Great, Not looking forward to today.

My quit is going great, still time to time cravings but overall they are very easy to squish. However, I'm taking a trip to the city today with a friend who basically chain smokes. We will be in the car for 6 hours round trip. This is the first time I've spent a significant amount of time with this guy and I have no idea how its going to go down. I guess I'm not worried about smoking but the idea of hanging out with a smoker for 12 hours is pretty irksome. I'm sure he smokes in his car. I'm really looking forward to the purpose of this trip but not the driving.

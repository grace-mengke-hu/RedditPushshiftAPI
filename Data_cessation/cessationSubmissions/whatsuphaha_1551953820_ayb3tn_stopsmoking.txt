relapsed after 4 months

was making dumb decision after dumb decision and was so angry and the cravings were really high that yesterday I bought a pack and started smoking.

felt like shit the entire day. anxious, shameful, angry, disgusted, sad. 

but i threw away my cigarettes and have to continue. can't let all the progress go to waste.

I'm also giving away the rest of my vapes today.

I don't see the point in vaping anymore. it mimics smoking too much and being addicted to nicotine to get me through the day.. I'm tired of it. 

so will be giving away my vapes today as well. was vaping 3mg nicotine for the past 4 months. just tired of addiction in general. being addicted to anything just sucks. there is no benefit, no matter what excuses we give ourselves that we need this or that.

I don't really consider this cheating, but some may and I'm not sure what to make of it?

I don't smoke anymore, I quit last December and have never smoked a cig or bought a pack since. However, we had a dinner for my fraternity and afterwards everyone had cigars. I see it as more of bonding with brothers. Also, one night when I was studying and everyone was drinking I went to go say hi and then they were having blacks. I also don't count that as we split 2 between me and 5 other people. I also tried to smoke a black and mild the other night while drinking and I quit after about a minute as it was really harsh. I don't count these as I am not doing it on a regular basis in the slightest and I don't smoke cigs or buy packs or even anything else. I didn't care until someone brought it up. What do you think?

Almost a month smoke free and just finished my first 5k. Thank you all, it feels so good!

I had smoked a pack a day for about 4 years when I decided at the end of August to end it. This morning, I completed a 5k without slowing down to a walk or stopping to catch my wheezing breath.

I just wanted to post this as encouragement to those who might be considering quitting. For me, running was a crucial part of my quitting strategy. It gave me that rush of energy in the morning and was a constant reminder not to smoke because I knew how much harder meeting my running goals would be if I caved. It's also given me a new group of people to hang out with besides the bar-crawler/smoker crowd I would have spent time with before.

I still have cravings, dreams about smoking, and shitty days like so many people describe in this thread mention, but having a bigger goal than smoking has made all the difference for me. I'm now going to start training for a half marathon in the spring, and hopefully a full marathon in a year or so. My life is more important than cigarettes.

Good luck to everyone else, because you can do it, and provided you're healthy enough for jogging, I'd encourage you to make the switch from something that will kill you to something that will make you feel better than ever!

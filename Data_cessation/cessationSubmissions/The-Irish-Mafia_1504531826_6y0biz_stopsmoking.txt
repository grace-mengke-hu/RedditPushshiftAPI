Seeking some advice

So I just turned 25 on Saturday, haven't smoked since and I usually am a ten a day kinda guy, mainly in work and when out drinking, not so much when I'm just at home. Making a solid commitment to myself to stop for good this time for cost and health benefits but I actually enjoy the smoking sensation. Any tips, advice, guidance would be really appreciated.

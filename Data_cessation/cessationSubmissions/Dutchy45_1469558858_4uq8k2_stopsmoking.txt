third time lucky

So I'm back. Trying again. 3rd try in 4 months, all with Champix. First time I caved after 23 days. Second time after 11. Yesterday I got a flair, again. It's evening over here and earlier I was debating getting smokes. Until tonite I was ok, no cravings. I hope posting here will help.

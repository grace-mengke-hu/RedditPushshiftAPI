time too sort my shit out

So i'm 24 i have been smoking 20 cigarettes sometimes more a day..

I have had enough of the habit i am finally going too give it my all tomorrow. I've just smoked my last cigarette about 10 mins ago. 

I've been saying too myself every night that "this will be my last cigarette and i'll quit tomorrow" always end up failing due to being bored.

I've recently been through a very savage break up with my first love and since we have broke up i have been wallowing in misery.. Not taking care of myself properly, smoking more than ever. But i've had enough i need too take control of my life.. I need too better myself from this, i quit weed easy as piss, was a heavy weed smoker for about 5 - 6 years. Had a week of withdrawls and that's it. 

I quit smoking bud 3 months ago.. i know is probably the wrong sub for taking about my ex haha, but tonight hit the nail on the head. i poured my heart out too her and she totally ignored me / rejected me so fuck her.. It's time too sort my shit out and better myself as a person. mentally / physically / healthier. 

Thanks guys wish me luck!

I need some advice, /r/stopsmoking

So I've been wanting to quit for a while and I keep running into the same problem. I resolve to quit, my spirits are high and I make it till the next morning when it becomes extremely difficult. I've read Allen Carr's book and it gets me pumped but then when I wake up in the morning it's all gone to shit. Should I focus on breaking habits first, like smoking in my car or first thing in the morning, or should I go cold turkey? Do you guys have any strategies to help me get through the morning and the tough times?

Bought myself a disposable e-cig after going cold turkey for 6 days. Feeling guilty,tremendously.

The withdrawals got worse in the last two days(dizziness after waking up, fatigue, headaches) and the depression which I have been battling for the past two years overpowered my will to continue going cold turkey. I also quit smoking cannabis which was a habit of smoking daily for 5 years,because of pot triggering my preexisting anxiety problems. Right now I am vexed by the pros and cons of both quitting cold turkey and NRT and can't really  decide whether to continue with the e-cig or to give it up and just go cold turkey again.

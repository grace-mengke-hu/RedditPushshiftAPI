Looking for tapering schedule suggestions for someone who started with 28 mg patch (Step 1 + 3)?

I quit with the help of the Lung Association's Freedom From Smoking program, which is basically a class that gives you education for three weeks, quit on the fourth, and supplies you with NRT for 1 month after that.

I had to discontinue the program after quit week because of a job opportunity, but I stayed long enough for them to give me a CO test and an initial supply of NRT - patches and lozenges.

Because my CO test was fairly high, they started me on 21 *and* 7 mg patches at the same time, with 2 mg lozenges in case of acute cravings.

I know that the basic schedule is 2 weeks on 21, 2 weeks on 14, and then 2 weeks on 7.  Has anyone started at a higher level? Could you recommend a tapering schedule for me?  I'm already 12 days in on 28 mg and 2 mg lozenges.

Thanks in advance!

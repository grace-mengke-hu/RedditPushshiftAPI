Does anyone here have any thoughts on quitting with the help of hypnotism?

I'm thinking of quitting the filthy cancer sticks, and a friend mentioned hypnotism as one means of quitting. Tbh, I'd never really considered it before, so I'm just curious if anyone here has any experience with it, or thoughts on it? Cheers!

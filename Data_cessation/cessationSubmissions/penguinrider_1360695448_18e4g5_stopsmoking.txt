I've been smoking for about 3 years, the last year about a pack a day. I quit cold turkey for four days, had one on day five, four on day six, and none one day seven. How am I doing?

I have been slipping a bit, but it was only with the remaining pack I still had. And all things considered, 5 cigarettes in the last week is a huge reduction from the 140 a week I've been smoking for the last year. At this point I have no cigarettes and have not bought a pack in a week. Do you think that at this point I should be in some way addicted to nicotine? I don't notice anything physical like headaches or shakiness, but I do feel like having a cigarette once or twice each day. Is reducing my smoking before quitting a better plan than cold turkey? What advice do you have for someone who is trying to stay off for good? Do nicotine patches or gum help? Is going to dip or chewing tobacco a good plan if I can't stay off cold turkey? What do you think?

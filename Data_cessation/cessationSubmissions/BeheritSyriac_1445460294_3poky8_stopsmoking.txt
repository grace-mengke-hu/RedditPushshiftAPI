Health defects from sudden cessation

So I stopped smoking abruptly a few weeks ago and have been having, what I thought was anxiety problems but instead found that I require smoking cessation products. I became very sick and anxious feeling about five days in and tried to shrug it off. After a lengthy wait my doctor approached the conclusion that for me personally suddenly quitting wasn't a good idea and to top that off its believed that the sudden shock of quitting killed my already Ill grandfather, some such as myself literally don't have the heart to "suddenly quit". After going through cessation products I have found that quitting is easier this way(for me personally) and I would suggest possibly speaking to your doctor about abruptly quitting ANY addictive substance. Your suggestions to quit suddenly led me to learn about my body and now I'm fully confident that I won't be picking that shit up again. Thanks guys! P.S. Doctors fucken' rule!

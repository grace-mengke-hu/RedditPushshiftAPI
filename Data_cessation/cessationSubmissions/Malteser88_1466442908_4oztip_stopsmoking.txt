Documenting my Physical withdrawal

Background: Age 28; Smoked since I was 17 with a 2 year break using Allen Carr method (book), broken last year. 

Recently I tried to give up smoking and didn't manage. So I booked myself into an Allen Carr session, failed and went back for a booster session. Most of the people there said that they'd just go back to smoking, because <insert random/stupid reason>. (e.g. because I'd go to the newsagent and buy a packet)

Anyways, the organizer turned to me and asked me why I smoked and I told him, because my head hurts. And he was completely dismissive, passing sarcastic comments and telling me that physical withdrawals are all in my head, and that maybe I should go to a doctor.

So I thought to document some of the physical withdrawals I'm going through. Perhaps in hope that someone else shared these symptoms and found ways to alleviate the pain.


* chronic temple headache - moderate to intense clamping pressure around temples, at times very painful spreading around the head (pain 3-5).  [planning to treat with ibuprofen as paracetamol has no effect]. The headache is chronic for about a week and stops with sleep, chocolate (for about 5-10 seconds) and going for long runs (30 - 60 minutes).
* chronic forehead headache - stiffness (pain 2-3)
* chronic salivation (wet mouth)
* jawache - slight pressure on chin-area as if someone is constantly grabbing it and holding it up (pain 4-5)
* teeth - sensation of teeth under nose being pushed inwards (pain 1-8 but lasts 1-10 seconds)
* neckache - constriction on back of neck (pain 3 - 6)
* sweating

edit: Physical withdrawals stopped on the 22nd day

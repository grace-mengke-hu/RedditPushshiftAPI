I'm starting to see a pattern. 

I've been trying to quit since last August, and the most I've made it is a week and some change. I always do really well for the first three days, then start to get anxious and depressed by day four. Then I start eating more than I normally would, and the idea pops into my head that I could suppress my appetite with a cig. I brush it off, then the weekend rolls around and my friends want to meet up for drinks. I think, "I can handle it this time!". But sure enough after the second or third, I'm heading to the gas station to pick up a pack. I don't want to gain weight and I want to be able to go out with my friends. Ugghh this is so hard. Sorry for the rant with no real purpose.

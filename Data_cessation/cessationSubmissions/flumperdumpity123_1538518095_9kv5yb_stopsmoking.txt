I want to quit vaping and I'm frustrated by the lack of support I have

I quit smoking a while back and have been vaping every day for a while. I have a lot of reasons for wanting to quit. Just a few are:

1) Based off of internet research I've done, its healthier than smoking cigarettes, but still has health risks. I don't want to subject myself to unnecessary risks, especially because someone close to me has recently been diagnosed with lung cancer.

2) I have cravings to vape at inconvenient times, such as while in class or at work. 

3) I don't want to keep spending money on it.

4) I feel like I have to vape while in between classes at school, but I see people on campus judging me for it, which makes me feel anxious

5) I have an anxiety disorder, there's no way putting a stimulant in my body constantly is helping with that. I definitely experience mood swings based off of how much nicotine is in my body,

But both my boyfriend and my roommate vape a lot, so that's going to be a challenge. Also, even when I try to search the web regarding the topic of quitting vaping, it seems like its not extremely common to quit. So many people just say "its so much healthier than smoking, so who cares!" or "nicotine isn't the bad thing about smoking, its all the other chemicals, so you can't really be that addicted to just nicotine!". That frustrates me because I know I have good reasons for wanting to quit. This is somewhat a vent and somewhat asking if anyone has any resources for me. I'm 24 hours into not vaping and its really difficult. I know that tapering off of nicotine until i got to 0mg juice before quitting vaping may have been easier instead of quitting cold turkey off of chain vaping 6mg juice all day, but i'm already 24 hours in so I don't know if its worth going back to it just to taper down at this point.

I survived the weekend and couldnâ€™t wait to get to work today.

The weekend is when I typically used to smoke a lot and I was able to go through a 3 day weekend without giving in. I feel safe from the cravings at work because I never smoked cigarettes on the job. 

I was looking forward to today because I know my cravings at work will be very minimal. Feeling good so far. 3.5 days done!!!!

Merry Christmas...

Quiet day home alone with the kitty, holidays are interesting. Doing good so far, I keep looking at the app and see the health benefits and how long it’s been since I’ve smoked. Using that to help keep me motivated. Being home alone on the holidays is hard. At least I have my cat, not completely alone! Just gotta keep telling myself it’s worth it!!! Starting some 30 day challenges as well looking to stay busy and help keep warm!! 6 days and 14 hours since I quit...

A brighter future

Here is my story. I was once on anti-depressants and anxiety medication and decided that I no longer wanted to feel like a zombie and let life pass me by. I took myself off all medications and started to enjoy my life and my boys. When I felt over-whelmed I picked up a cigarette. Here I am 6 yrs later, I smoke 5-7 times a day and I just cant do it anymore. My husband and I are house hunting and we came across a home that I thought was going to be the one for us. As soon as we opened the door, we were hit with a smell that gave me a headache on the spot. as we were going through the house you could tell it was owned by someone who chain smoked for years. I could smell it for a couple days after. I remember my oldest son telling me a few days before that GOD was going to show me that I needed to stop smoking. I think that was it. I have started a quit plan and today is day two. I have reduced myself to one a day and have a set quit date of Monday the 24th. My motivation is my children and husband. They are my reason for breathing and wanting a brighter future.

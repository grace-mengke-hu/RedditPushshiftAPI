One week today!!! I can't believe it!!

It had been seven years since I made it one week without smoking. I'm over the moon with happiness. I've also noticed small and big improvements in this short time. 

- My breathing!! I had forgotten what it was like to be able to breath so fully, it's amazing. 
- Energy: These last two days I've had a lot of energy. Something I hadn't experienced since I was in my early twenties. 
- My skin is not dry anymore. I use to rub lotion on my face four times a day because it would get so dry. Now, just once and I'm good for the rest of the day. 
- Sleeping. When I was smoker I use to wake up every day at 8am, regardless if it was a weekend and I had gone to bed at 4am. I NEEDED to wake up to smoke. Not anymore. 

I didn't know quitting smoking would bring some of these benefits.

I was diagnosed with chronic bronchitis over a week ago. That's why I quit smoking. Doctor said it was irreversible, but I keep hoping there's a way that I can reverse it. I still have a lot of guilt for causing myself this ilness. 

I still do know that once an addict, always an addict. So i keep telling myself that I'm a recovering addict, and I take it one day at a time.

I really hope I can make it this time. My health can't afford to go back to smoking.  

But yeah, this place has helped greatly. 

Thank you

Tips to avoid smoking when drinking

Hey guys.

I stopped smoking regularly in February 2012. When I drink I lose my ability to not smoke, not always, but most of the time. Can you guys give me some tips on how to cross this final barrier of cessation. 

I'm 23 and I only really drink around once a month with friends many of whom are smokers. I'd like to reduce my risk of relapse without having it interfere in my social life. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

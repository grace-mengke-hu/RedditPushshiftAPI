Art of the draw -- how vaping differs from your death stick

One of the questions I get asked by people trying to quit smoking via switching to vaping is the difference in how to use the product. I was a bit in disbelief at first, but after sitting down with several ex-smokers to talk it through, it would seem as though the draw on an ecig is materially different. Here's a collection of those thoughts and considerations into a post I hope at least someone here finds helpful.

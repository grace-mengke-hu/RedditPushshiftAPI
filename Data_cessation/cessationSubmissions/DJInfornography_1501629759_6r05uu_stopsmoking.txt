First Day

Good afternoon, I have been a lurker on here for quite a while, had a unsuccessful quit for about two months, and after reading easyway again for maybe the fifth time, something had started to click, up until now i could never get in the right mindset, and still felt teh doom and gloom, and feel like i was waiting, or sacrificing. 

This go around I am free so far for six hours. The constant rejection and reaction to my smokers smell and breath by my fiance finally meant more to me than staying a smoker.

Right now I feel free, relieved, and happy, and excited, for the first time during a quit. I have quit cold turkey in the past as well, and didn't feel this optimistic and enthusiastic about it.

I understand teh dangers of taking it for granted, or blieivng any of the lies that i might try to justify to myself.

These all shall pass, and day by day it is on;y going to get easier. Being a non-smoker to begin Feeling better than I am now, and continuously improving without the hinderance, cost, mess of cigarettes. yes please

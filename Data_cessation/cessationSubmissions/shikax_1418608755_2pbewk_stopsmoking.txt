New here. 3 days in... Hoping to do this

I started a few days later than I should have, but I'm 3 days in so far and hoping I can really quit this time. Currently 26 and dealing with a lot of health issues so I figured smoking wasn't going to do me worse than I already am. First I would smoke maybe a pack a week, would really only smoke on the drive to and from work, but then it become a few on the way to and from, and on break and to the store, and trips to 711.
My gf has hated the fact that I smoked and I promised her many times that I would quit, but we would get into a fight and I would start again because of the stress. Not looking for an excuse but it's just what I did and looking back I regret it. 

The final nail in the coffin was when I brought her lunch a few days back, so she got in my car, and she gave me a disappointed look when she noticed the smell. Just seeing her face and her disappointment... The fact that she couldn't even just sit there with me any longer... I knew then I had to stop. It was something small in some peoples eyes, and I've been craving a cigarette like no other, but I think I will do it this time. I want to believe I had my last cigarette

The Coin Realisation (and a wall of text that got me to it)

Hi there.

*I was thinking of flipping a coin to see if I was going to buy a pack. Came here and reasoned with myself. Reviewed my reasons for quitting.*

*Decided my reason not to 'flip the coin' for a pack was what the coin represented, namely:*

* The gamble with my health.
* The throwing away of money.
* The weak person I would be, unable to control myself, relying on chance to stop me doing the one thing I am putting my effort towards.

*So if it comes to it again, I hope the coin will remind me.*
*Take care, take control, stay strong.*


[Begin wall'o'text]
I'm writing this mainly to take my mind off the absolute desire I have to go buy a pack. It is going to be a wall of text. I wouldn't really recommend reading it, or care if you do. I haven't read the rules/sidebar and only recently came to this sub, so delete away. This is me reasoning to myself.

*Here are the informative bits:*  

* **a/s/l:** 30/m/New Zealand  
* **smoker for:** 13-ish years  
* **longest time smokefree during that time:** 3-4 months  
* **current time smokefree:** 13ish days  
* **method:** cold turkey  
* **motivations:** health, money, social pressures. (Aka 'the usual')  
* **currently:** considering tossing a coin to buy a pack. Trying to distract self

(I've decided on a coin flip as my final measure so if I do get to the point that I flip it, there may be that extra push against buying them.)

So I started smoking .... about 13 years ago, when I was almost 18. I first (tried) smoking one of my mom's cigarettes left in the car ashtray when I was ...7?
Grew up occasionally 'pretend' smoking twigs. Haha.

Since then I've 'given up' smoking once or twice. Longest time would be about 3 or 4 months. Can't remember why I started again, but I think it was because I visited a friend..

So anyway. Fast forward to now. Cold turkeying it. Decided to quit a wee bit before new years here (New Zealand).
The app on my phone says I have not smoked for 12 days. By the time it was downloaded I may have backdated it wrong. But irrelevant anyway. It hasn't been amazingly difficult. Not to say it's been a lark either.

I've enjoyed reading the occasional post in this sub and the encouragement everyone gives.

Being honest I feel like if I had a lot of spare money and no fiance, I might still be smoking. Or maybe vaping. Probably smoking though.

But I don't have a lot of spare money. In fact the state of my bank account makes me wonder how the hell I managed to afford a pack of cigarettes every day, maybe every other day (if tailormades) or 4-5 days (for tobacco pouches)
Which makes me wonder where all the money I managed to find is now going.

Every year in NZ tobacco products prices rise by ... Some percentage. Currently a 21-pack costs $NZD22 (about 14USD?). I would expect to have an extra $200 at this stage in my quit... But I don't. Not obviously anyway. But man, the amount I've spent over the years could have got me a small house. So I accept that my savings are still there, somewhere.

That alone makes me feel better about not flipping that coin to buy a pack.

I can't say I've noticed any health benefits. I may not have been the fittest person, but I was way fitter (or just less lazy, maybe?) than a lot of people I know, smokers and non smokers.
But I believe what is claimed. By now my senses of smell and taste have improved (cant really say I've noticed..). I can breath easier (apparently)..
I guess the only real benefit I am doing this for, healthwise, is the lower risks. Lower risks of things that may not happen anyway.

I love the natural flora/fauna/geography of this world. I would love to see most of it before I no longer exist. So I'm improving my odds.

Socially. Eh. I don't give many fucks about people generally. All I care about are my very small group. Almost all non smokers. Most never have been.
I'm conscious and courteous. I don't .. Didn't smoke upwind of people, around children or ex smokers. Didn't litter with my butts.. Caused very little impact, I think, on those around me.

Now.. The benefit of this one? ..
So I can stop being looked down on, I guess. People are very anti smoking, and smoker. So that is that.

I have been wondering these past few days, just how have I put up with my fianc√©. I know I must be feeling short because of withdrawal.. 
But man. I try to follow some of her actions and reactions in my head, see how she isn't being irrational..
I can't.

But as much as that makes me want to flip that coin, I will continue my quest to be someone who can say they quit. To have the money and lifespan and fitness to travel.
To no longer have to write walls of text to stop myself from doing something I don't really want to do, something I will regret.

I'm glad to post this. I don't really talk this freely IRL. Not that it was for anyone but me.

Take care, stay strong.  
Prove you have control of yourself.

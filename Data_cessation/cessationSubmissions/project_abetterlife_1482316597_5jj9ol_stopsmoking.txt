Day 5 done! Continuous cravings last night but did not give in :)

So tired right now. 

Last night I had idiot thoughts ("you could go buy some, you could smoke one") for hours. I distracted myself with some videos and ended up going to bed late (again).

I did not smoke and I am happy. Now to see if I can go to sleep earlier today (and not smoke, of course). 

Thanks for the company and keep going! You can do this.

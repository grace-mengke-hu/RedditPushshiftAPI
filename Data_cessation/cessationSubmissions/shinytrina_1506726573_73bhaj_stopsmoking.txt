Slipped today but back at it

A friend of mine came over for coffee.  We were sitting around chatting and she said "I'm going out for a cigarette, care to join me?" and without even really thinking about it I said yes.  I felt so gross afterwards.  I have reset my badge due to this and here I go again :)

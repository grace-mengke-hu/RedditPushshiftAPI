Help! 5m smoke free, fearing giving in

Ok. So this huge craving hit me. I'm going to a party and had a glass of wine before leaving home and omg I'm really ready to ask next person if they can throw me a ciggy. What do I do? Go back home? 

Just repeating to myself not another puff no matter what... any other tips, guys?

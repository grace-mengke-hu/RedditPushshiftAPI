3 months Done

Well I am 3 months nicotine free 
Actually was not as hard as I expected although still get the odd craving 
Had my first argument with my wife that was normally a key for me to go outside calm down by smoking this time managed to just accept it and all was ok after a few hours and no cigarette 

I think you have to overcome all those situations you used to smoke in and once you have done it you move forward a step stronger 

Here is to another 3 months :)

Did I really smell that bad?

My daughter and I went shopping yesterday. As we walked in and out of different stores, we passed the smokers. At one point, I looked at my daughter, my face a bit green, and asked "Did I really smell like that??" She nodded. My sense of smell is returning more and more and I had absolutely NO idea how badly I smelled. I almost want to email the non-smokers I dated and apologize, LOL. The smell of cigarette smoke was so nauseating to me. That made me happy because I did wonder if the smell would be a trigger for me. I'm happy to know it's not. 

One more reason to remain a non-smoker.

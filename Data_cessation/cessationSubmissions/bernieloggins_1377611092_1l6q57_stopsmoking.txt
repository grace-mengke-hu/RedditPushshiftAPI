Tomorrow will be a week.

I'm tryin to quit cigs again. I couldn't even tell you how many times this is. Probably 12-15. I'm 35. I've been smoking since I was 18. I finally really want to quit for good. My mind is made up. I just have to not smoke. No more complex than that.

I'm currently using nico-derm and having an easier go of it with every day that passes. Actually one of the upsides is the crazy dreams from the patch. 

What are some things you guys did to modify your habits and behavior? So far I've just been sleeping a lot. I'm also avoiding drinking for a while. I don't have a booze problem other than beer goes great with a smoke. 

Would you recommend any iPhone apps?

Thanks for any and all help!

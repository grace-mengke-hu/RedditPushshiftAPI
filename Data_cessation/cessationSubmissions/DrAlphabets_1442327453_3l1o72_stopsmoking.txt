Broke down today.

Had a cigarette today. Feel terrible. Best thing to do is get right back on the horse but I feel like I should be honest with all of you and reset my badge. 

I'm  sorry everyone I let you guys down. 

Will a mod reset my badge after seeing this or do I have to do something to reset it myself?

Let's do this! Day 6

So i somehow survived the weekend which is good, I am also relying less on the nicotine spray. My mind still plays tricks on me reminding me whenever it should have been time to smoke, but i feel like it is getting easier to resist. Until last night that is. 

My 16 month old son had a vaccination shot last week, usually his temperature is a bit elevated but that's about it. Well not this time because obviously quitting smoking without staying up all night isn't hard enough. So this is basically how my night went, my son throws up every 60-90 minutes and spends the meantime crying. This goes on until about 4 am, at which point he falls asleep for 2 hours. I am having the worst cravings since i stopped smoking and feel like i could murder someone, i somehow managed not to yell at my son for being sick. 

Well since i got through last night, i think it can only get better from here, right?

Thanks for reading. Let's not smoke today

Coffee and the quit

I smoked about a pack a day for 10 years and enjoyed my coffee along with that. Every morning I would make a pot of coffee and smoke and head off to work and get a coffee from the shop up the block. So about 1 1/2 pots of coffee a day...

Something I realized and had read about but didn't completely understand was how much smoking effects the power of coffee. Maybe this is common knowledge, but I wasn't fully aware.

The first few days I would feel like I was dizzy and something was VERY off, very panicked, almost confused. I cut back on coffee and boom! Amazing. The best part is that I actually have more energy than I did even when I was drinking lots of coffee!


Even better! The coffee I do have in the mornings tastes even better now, which is a major score.

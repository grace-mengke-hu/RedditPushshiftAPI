Kick starting better habits?

Has anyone else started leading a much healthier lifestyle all round since quitting smoking? I stopped smoking a month ago. 

Since then I have stopped drinking alcohol and fizzy drinks. I've also massively improved my eating habits and feel so much better physically and mentally.

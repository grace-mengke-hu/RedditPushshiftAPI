Social interaction, drinking, and smoking

Hey y'all. After 2.5 years of casual to not-so-casual smoking (usually half a pack a night when I went out 3-4 times a week, which turned into smoking around 6 cigarettes a day) I've decided to quit. I'm wondering how you handle(d) changing your habits. I don't work with people who smoke, and my current girlfriend doesn't either. However, a couple of my friends do, and we go to bars all the time with big open summer patios. I started smoking when I started going to bars so they're completely linked in my head. How do you cut that connection? So far I've just been fiddling with things at the table, kind of avoiding people smoking outside. Tips, tricks? I really want to stop this time.

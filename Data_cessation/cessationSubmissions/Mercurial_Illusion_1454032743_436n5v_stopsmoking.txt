Introduction - This is day 1

Hi. I've been lurking around here for a little bit now, reading stories, advice, and the like. I've been cleaning up my life since I turned 30 and quitting the tobacco is my next step. I've decided to go with NRT (a vape) and I haven't touched a cigarette for the entire day. I stopped by a gas station on my way to school for some water and it was really tempting to pick up a pack but I abstained, which actually makes me very happy as I've attempted this many times before but as I'm a creature of habit I kept falling back into it. Routines are important to me and while that aspect has hurt me in the past it's also helped me clean my life up.

I'm assuming the cravings I've been feeling today are due to the OTHER things they put in cigarettes to aid in the addictiveness because it's been a 'different' feeling than when I tried cold-turkey. That and the want to actually have a cigarette in my hand. I feel like if I can break the habit of holding a cigarette (the reason I went with a big box mod, it feels 'wrong' in my hands which is good) then the physical addiction to the actual drug won't be too terrible. 

I've read Carr's book and he is correct that the physical addiction to the nicotine isn't that bad. I'm 315 days sober from alcohol today and that physical addiction was hell to break. If I managed to break that one which woke up in the middle of the night sweating and putting me on autopilot to the liquor store before I regained control of myself, then I'm just going to assume that once my habit of cigarette to mouth is broken with this big ugly box, losing the nicotine won't be as bad. I'm going to keep assuming this because it makes me feel stronger and that I can pull this off.

Thank you to all who read this. The community seems great.

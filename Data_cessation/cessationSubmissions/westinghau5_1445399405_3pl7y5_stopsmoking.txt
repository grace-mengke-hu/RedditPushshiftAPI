7 Days

I didn't even noticed since I haven't logged in since a few days ago, but I'm a whole week behind me. I still think of cigarettes on a daily basis, but with a mindset that has been re-framed. Instead of having that feeling of loss, I just think of how it used to taste, how my fingers used to smell, how I used to have shadows of concern about my health every day. While smoking can feel like it brings people together, stimulates your mind, or generally makes you feel more confident - it really doesn't. It's like putting a band-aid on a wound that needs to air out (literally). The insecurities you are covering up are only going to fester underneath. Also its very easy to just turn your brain off and go, screw it - I want a cigarette now... Successful and more intelligent people that way often because they are able to think in long term. Instead of making a big deal out of their analysis, they analyze the situation and simply leave it at that. No extra drama, just reality!

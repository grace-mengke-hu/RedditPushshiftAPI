A relapse after 3 years

Hello fellow ex-smokers &amp; soon-to-be ex-smokers !

I stopped smoking on the 4th of July 2016 and until the 8th of June 2019 I didn't smoke a single cigarette.  I was so confident that I had stopped smoking for good this time as I crossed 1000 days without a single smoke. But unfortunately, I had a re-union with some old friends after 5 years during the weekend of 8th June and I honestly don't know why I picked up a cigarette when offered(it still horrifies me to know how easy it was to pick up,light and smoke one). I assumed it would just be a weekend thing but here I am still smoking. I have decided it's finally high-time to put this to bed again and not to flirt with this dangerous habit.

This post is to say that 'never let your guard down, even if you feel like like you have stopped for good'. I feel terrible for picking up that cigarette again. Also, I really don't want to reset my counter as I don't feel that all the progress I have made has gone in vain. I'm gonna consider this as a minor slip up from my track and gonna keep moving forward.

I'm officially stopping smoking this weekend. I'm again making a list of things to why I need to stop smoking again and revisit the times when I was a horrible pack-a-day smoker. Wish me luck. Not One Puff Ever again.

A week without a fag and feeling like complete crap.

I don't want to smoke anymore. I have recently moved city and I am not hanging around with anybody who smokes currently, this has made it quite easy to not smoke for a bit over a week now. But I am really feeling like crap. I have a sore throat, I can't stop farting, bloated stomach and really low energy levels. Just getting through the day at work is proving to be quite difficult. I am finding it difficult to get warm even though I am sweating and having a hard time falling asleep. How long can I expect this to persist for? I am 42 and have been smoking since I was about 15.

How do I do it?

I'm young (20), but I have been consistently smoking (just hit the pack a day point this year) for about 3 years. With encouragement from friends and family I have tried many ways to stop; gum, ecigs, patches and cold turkey. 

When I do finally ditch the Turkish royals for a week, I feel like I can resist the temptation. But my biggest roadblock has constantly been drinking. Some of me going back to smoking while drinking ties into the social aspect, like when I started. For the most part though it is that I can't resist the temptations and cravings for one like I can sober.

I've read from some of you guys it just requires taking some time off of drinking, or not drinking to the point of being easily tempted, but I'm in somewhat of a unique situation as I live in a fraternity house, and subsequently there is a shitload of drinking going on, and trying to be low key on my Friday and Saturday nights off is difficult. 

Is there a way to still enjoy myself drinking with friends (some of whom are regular smokers), but resist the urge?

Sorry for the long post, but I'm really shooting for a "now until always" flair on this sub and in my life.

TL;DR Drinking always makes me want to smoke, living in a house where almost all weekends are dominated by drinking.

I quit...again...This time for the last time

I'm three weeks and two days into quitting smoking. This is my fourth serious attempt to quit. 

In the past, each time I quit, I eventually fooled myself into thinking made the mistake of telling myself into thinking that I could have the occasional social cigarette, and then fell back into the habit very quickly. 

I managed to quit smoking for a year and a half the first time around. During this point I started running marathons, which only reinforced my naive conviction that I wouldn't start smoking on a regular basis again, since I was running so much, but I got to the point where I was sneaking off the race courses to have a cigarette.

The second and third attempts lasted about six months each. I was so disappointed and ashamed of myself each time I realized I was totally reliant on cigarettes again.

This time, I'm committed to not making the same mistake again. I have had some really stressful and sad things happen lately in quick succession. I'm getting through it by telling myself that no matter what bad thing might happen, I have this one positive, healthy thing in my life that no one can take away from me. I'm really looking forward to being able to run again.

I lost count

I’m quitting again. My record is 5 months, but man cigarettes have been an emotional crutch for nearly 10 years. I’m 24 now though, and I have to kick this habit. Funny enough when I got on Wellbutrin for depression, my smoke cravings skyrocketed. I know some would disagree but I have been relying on an ecig and a juul to get through, which always work until I get myself into a smoking situation. 

This sub has been great for fueling motivation! Last smoke was yesterday evening. I have to stay away from the devil’s brew too, I could probably kill a pack in a night out if I drink;; 

Anyway, after lurking a while I’m here to hold myself accountable

Day 1 of from now until forever.

I have been smoking for close to seven years now, started late and never stopped. My wife is under the idea that I quit, rather that I did not even really start. I am able to refrain when she is around, just because I do not want to deceive her when I am near. But when I am away, I light up like a chimmney. My longest stint away from the sixth finger is six straight months and that went down the drain in December. She gave me a surprise visit over the weekend and found my pack. She walked away and now we are not talking, rather she is not picking my calls, and it was over the stupid cigarette. I want to show her that I can quit for real. 

Today is day 1.

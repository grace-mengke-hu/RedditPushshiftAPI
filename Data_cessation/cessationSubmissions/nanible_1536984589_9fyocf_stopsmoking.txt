Grief and smoking

I woke up on Wednesday and had my morning cig as per usual, then I started gagging from the smoke like I was going to throw up and feeling super anxious, racing thoughts. It was the last smoke in the pack and I thought frig this, I'm done with feeling this way, this is my last smoke. I had been postponing quitting for a while  and felt confident when I put it out.

Turns out I had caught the flu, so I spent Wednesday and yesterday mostly asleep and in bed, conveniently avoiding all the cravings and triggers.

I thought, hey this isn't so hard. I've quit 3 times before this, with varying degrees of difficulty. So far this time had been the easiest.  

This summer I witnessed my grandma dying of lung cancer. You know those photos on the pack that say "This is what dying of lung cancer looks like"? Well, my grandma looked worse than that. When its your own grandmothers face you're looking down on and she looks like a living corpse.. words cannot describe. The horrible sound of her struggling to breathe from the fluid filling her lungs. It was unbarable.

The irony is that my mom and aunt and uncle and cousin all smoke too, so on my grandmas last day on earth we were all chainsmoking away from the stress.

Isn't that f'd up? I'm so sick of this disease in my family. I don't want anyone to ever see me like that. 

 My grandma was super active, independent, and cheerful up until 6 months before she got really sick. And I'll never forget her telling me that this isnt was she ever expected for herself, that she was always so active.. and then that was it. She spent her final months unable to sit up, let alone walk. Depressed when she was always so cheerful. Her final days, unable to eat, drink, hardly able to breathe. 

Fuck smoking.

Anyways, my point is that day three has been much more difficult than day one or two. Lol. 

Just needed to get this off my chest.

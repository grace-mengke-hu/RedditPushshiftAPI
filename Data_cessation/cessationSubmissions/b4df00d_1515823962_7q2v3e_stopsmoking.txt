One week, feeling positive!

I had to battle through some dark moments earlier this week, but all indicates I'm past the first test! 

All that remains to be done is to keep up the spirits. I am feeling so overwhelmingly positive right now, it's almost unreal. Why would anyone smoke at all if you can feel this good whitout it? 

I know tougher moments will come, but nothing can be as bad as picking up a cig again!

25 days, 23 hours and 13 minutes...

This is the longest I have ever gone without a cigarette.  I feel really good about it.  I know it's still early but I don't crave them like I did in the first week.  I no longer stink and I have saved like 150 bucks.  It is amazing. I lurk on here quite a bit and you guys really are a great support group.  Thanks!

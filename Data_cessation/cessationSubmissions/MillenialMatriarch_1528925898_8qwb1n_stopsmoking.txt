Opted for psychologist over smokes

Day 22 and having trouble with mood, motivation, and energy. Cried for hours in the lay couple days. Have questioned my worth, life choices, and future through a pessimistic lens. 

  I know this has a lot to do with the readjustment period, but I also know that I've neglected to seriously treat my mental health in the past. So I went today through a  stressful and uncomfortable intake with appointments pending for next week.  At this rate at least if I start feeling insane I know that I'm doing something productive about it. 

No more nicotine, no matter what.

I have thrown away my cigarettes in the park and started drinking coffee

I am 17 (almost, only 2 days left) now and got caught with a pack of cigarettes a little while back by my parents. After I got caught I started again but felt terrible and guilty. Today after smoking alot and showering right after I decided I didn't want this anymore. Not for me, for my girlfriend, my health, my family and my friends. So when I reach age 17 I am a new person. A new year has been reached and I'm going to stop. I'm not a smoker anymore. 
I threw the cigarettes away in the trashcan in the park together with my sister, she joked that I could better get "addicted" to coffee. So I just drank my first cup.
Let's never ever smoke again.

PS: Does anyone have any tips for me, please tell me ;)

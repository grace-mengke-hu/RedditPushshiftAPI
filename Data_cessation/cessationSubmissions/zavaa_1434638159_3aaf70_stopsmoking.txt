[day 11] I hardly think about it!

Smoking seems stupid to me now.
Like getting addicted to a drug again now that I made it?
I'm really proud of myself for stopping because there have been 3 occasions where even a little alcohol was involved and yet I did not smoke.

I smoked about 25-30 cigarettes a day for 12 years.

On top of that my depression is treated with wellbutrin now after trying out 2 ssri's who didnt do shit.

I feel like it is doing a little of its magic already.

Right now I'm really sick though so I'm really looking forward to tomorrow when I'll hopefully feel better.

Because tomorrow it's vacation time!

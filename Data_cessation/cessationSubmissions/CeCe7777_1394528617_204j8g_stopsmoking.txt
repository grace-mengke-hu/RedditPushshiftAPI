Thinking about relapsing

I know that that's so stupid. But more than 2 months after quitting cold turkey, I'm starting to think my life was better when I smoked.

Background: I smoked about half to a full pack a day for 10 years. The first week of quitting cold turkey was very hard but it got easier and now most side effects are gone.

But 69 days in, I now want to smoke again....my husband and I used to never fight but we've had several nasty fights since I quit, just about stupid stuff. My mood swings are much worse.

Also, my weight. I was always "naturally skinny" and would eat anything and everything while keeping a very low BMI. So when I quit I knew gaining was a danger so  I decided to take charge and start a whole new "healthy lifestyle". I started doing cardio, strength training, and HIIT (I HATE exercise!) I started counting calories, something I NEVER would have done before. I started by limiting my net calorie intake to 1350 a day, but now my goal is 1200. I've still gained almost 1 lb a week, on average (and counting). (To be fair, I gained much more weight the first month and it's now coming on slower.) I'm still thin and fine with my size now, but what scares me is that it keeps coming on, regardless of what I do. Shit, I don't know if my mood swings are because I'm hungry, in withdrawal, or because I no longer have control over my weight.

Anyway, sorry to burden you guys with this, but I don't know anyone else in this situation and need to get it off my chest. Does it get better? Do your moods and weight eventually stabilize, and WHEN?

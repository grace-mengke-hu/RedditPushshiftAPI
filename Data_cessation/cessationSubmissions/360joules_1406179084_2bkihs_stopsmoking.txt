An update...

Well, it's now Thursday night/early Friday morning, and I still haven't smoked. I am a non-smoker! I went through a lot of liquids to find something I can vape day in and day out. Previously, I smoked Camel Crush menthol, and it was difficult to find anything that had the crazyintense menthol/mint hit of that particular cigarette. 

What I settled on was one I found (unfortunately) in the discontinued basket at my local vape shop. It's called Green Apple Menthol. I bought all they had, at $3/10ml.

Next task is to switch from 24mg to 18mg.

Also, I noticed today that my clothes don't stink!

I want to quit

I really do, but each time I think about a plan it makes me nervous and I want to smoke. Additionally, when I come on this SubReddit I find myself reading the posting and thinking how lots of people sound so miserable after quitting. Like their struggles are so difficult. I'm totally taking a positive thing and turning it negative inside my head. How do I fix this? I know I need to stop, but I'm a slave to it. Help me...

Not a good day....

stress at work, followed by major appliance stress at home, followed by emotional stress in phone call from my daughter... it has been quite a day!  But I have not smoked.  For the first time since I quit, today I thought about giving in, but know from experience they would not help in any way, only make me even more tense and instantly a smoker wanting to quit.  Ready for the day to be over, after repairman leaves think I am going to curl up with a movie or book and congratulate myself for staying away from it.

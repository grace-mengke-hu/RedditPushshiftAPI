My 'quitting for real this time' plan.

I always say, "I've been quitting since I started." It's time for me to really do it. I feel like crying right now thinking about the hold this addiction has on me. My worse trigger is alcohol, so I've got to kick that too, or I WILL fail. Haven't had a drink since Sept. 5th. My last cigarette was yesterday (7th). I'm ready.

I got the nicotine gum just in case a craving hits, and weeks worth of Altoids and chewing gum for the dreaded car rides.

I have a *semi* plan:

Triggers:

* Alcohol
* Cigarette ads/plugs

I don't have many hobbies, so If I get a craving I will:

* Draw. I'm not very good at it, but I can get lost in focusing on drawing for hours and forget about anything else.

* Go for a run. *(note to self: please do this)*

* Reddit/read a comic book with some nicotine gum.

* ANY DISTRACTIONS. I'll pick a fight with my cat if I have to. Cinnamon Altoids help because they burn like shit, and focusing on pain causes me to forget about my craving.

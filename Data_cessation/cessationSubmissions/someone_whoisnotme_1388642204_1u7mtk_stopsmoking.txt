On the fence

Hey all. I don't know why I'm posting this but I feel like I need to get this down. 

I started smoking around 3 years ago, never have been a really heavy smoker but smoked maybe 2-3 packs a week until recently. I've been thinking of quitting for awhile. I've been staying with family the past 11 days and haven't smoked since 12/21 because my family is really against it and most of them don't know that I smoke. It wasn't as hard as I thought to go cold turkey because I ended up getting a chest cold right after I got here so I didn't feel like doing anything that would make breathing even harder than it was. I didn't even have any cravings or anything until 2-3 days ago. Also, I noticed that when I worked out my chest felt clearer than it has in forever. ALL good things. 

So anyway. The problem is I'm going home tomorrow. And the past 2 days I've been really craving a cigarette. I've been wanting to quit for awhile and I KNOW that the fact that I was forced to go cold turkey for the past couple weeks gives me a great head start on that. I'm just afraid I won't be able to resist the temptation to buy a pack once I'm home and back in my regular routine. I keep reminding myself that it's going to be so much better for me in the long run if I just get over this hump but a big part of me is just saying fuck it and already imagining myself smoking.

I don't know what kind of replies I'm looking for but I wanted to write this out. Thanks for reading, if you made it this far.

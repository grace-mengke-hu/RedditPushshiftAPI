Things just don't seem enjoyable.

Hi everyone, so I am coming up on 4 weeks smoke free and for the past 4 or 5 days things that I normally enjoy such as playing a PC game or coming up with new D and D ideas or even the thought of having sex with my missus have just seemed dull. I don't know how to better explain it really, I know these things are enjoyable but I just can't get excited over them and just end up feeling meh.

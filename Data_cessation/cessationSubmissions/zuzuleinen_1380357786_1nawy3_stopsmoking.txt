Yesterday I was about to relapse

So we went out, had a couple of beers, and we started talking something really passionate.

I felt in this kind of discussion I should grab a cigar to be more philosophical :) So I asked for one, a friend gave it to me, I put it on my lips but didn't light it.

I asked myself: Does it really worth it? The answer was no, so I gave it back. This morning I woke up so glad I didn't do it :)

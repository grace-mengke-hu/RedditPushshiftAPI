It is time.

So I have decided that it is time to quit smoking, I am almost 25, smoking since I was 13, pack a day since I was around 18.


Smoking along with other lifestyle options, pop, junk food etc is destroying me.

I have a 1 and a half year old daughter as well and I don't want her to have my current habits someday if I don't make the right choices now.

My girlfriend also smokes and I think she will be trying to quit as well, I don't want to force anything on anyone so I'm leaving it up to her.

 I'm glad reddit has a thing for everything, it hasn't been very long , I figure if I can avoid the morning smoke I can avoid them all.

Just needed to write this out for myself and figured I might get some words of wisdom, advice or anything.

Thank you all =)

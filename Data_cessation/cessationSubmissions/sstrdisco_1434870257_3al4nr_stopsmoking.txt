My badge won't change until much later this evening...

But as of one minute ago, I have two months smoke free.

I am just beginning to feel that I am a non smoker. I don't feel ready to say I'm in maintenance, as of yet. But, I am most certainly on my way.

Most of all? I am truly surprised, happy, and excited at how this really does get easier every day. A beautiful feeling.

Yay for all us quitters!!

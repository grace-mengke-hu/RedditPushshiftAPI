To Chantix or not to Chantix...

I've tried it before. It worked pretty well at removing the craving. I still have some. Found I could sleep better using half the dose.  I just stopped drinking three days ago.  I have been job hunting for three months.  Depressed the majority of the time these days.  Should I quit? or should I wait a bit? I want to be hire-able!

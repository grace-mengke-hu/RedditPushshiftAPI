5 weeks today and 6lb down in weight :)

Quit 5 weeks today, saved so much money, feel better, feel brighter, and so proud of myself. I started off using a nicotine pen, but no longer need it, i keep it for emergencies now. I am 47, and smoked 30 a day for 27 years. Now i no longer smoke, and have also lost 6 lb in weight, which is highly unusual. I have IBS and my stomach spasms have stopped, and no longer in agony after i eat.

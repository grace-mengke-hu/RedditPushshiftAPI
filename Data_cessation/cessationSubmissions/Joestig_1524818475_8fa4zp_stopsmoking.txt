One week!!

 
I have quit one week! Planning to continue going! This is just one change in my life that I know I have to make, but an important one, but I look forward to checking this one off my list.

My strategies include:

Using an app: Quit Tracker (Android). The app tracks how long I have quit and tells me what benefits I have gained so far. One of these is the money that you've saved. It estimates this based on how many cigarettes you used to smoke and the price per package in your area. The app allows you to set rewards and then to get these. I plan to spend all this money on things that I want. These will mainly be exercise equipment, things to beautify my home, books, computer equipment, etc. In this way I incentivize myself to keep going by spending the money on things that are more valuable to me.

Exercising a lot: I do climbing and triathlon. So, I can spend a lot of time active outside. Smoking does not fit with this lifestyle, and as I increase my exercise routine, my desire to smoke should also reduce. Exercise is also a great way to manage my stress levels, and so it is a great substitution for smoking (which actually creates more stress than it relieves).

I look forward to witnessing my lungs cleaning themselves up over the next months. I hear that it can take a while for this process to complete, but I am patient, because I know that the process is going in the right direction now! :)

My dream from last night

I had a dream last night! I was sitting in a newish bar that someone opened up for the summer.. I was bonding with the owner why he opened it and whatnot and we got along pretty nice.. he took out a cigarette and gave me one too, I stopped to think that I couldn’t do this.. I gave it back to him and said that I’m not allowed to as I quit earlier in the year.. point is my subconscious mind now knows I’m a non smoker.. it’s been 32 days!

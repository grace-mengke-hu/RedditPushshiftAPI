About two weeks now with chantix, getting sinus trouble

Hi /r/stopsmoking,
I recently quit smoking with help from Chantix, going from a pack a day to one or two cigarettes a week. I have to recommend it. Though, I just take one dose a day because of the nausea, YMMV. However, since I quit smoking I've been noticing a bit of sinus pain and congestion. I worry that I might have a genetic predisposition to it, but I wanted to read others' experiences. Have you had sinus pain/congestion after quitting smoking? What remedies for it have worked for you?

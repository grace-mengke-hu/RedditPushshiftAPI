Quit vaping on monday this week, and already feeling better!

Hi all,

I started cigarettes in college and was on them for 1 year. I switched to vaping because i thought it was healthy, but in reality it was just another way to get the same buzz and space out. 

I quit on monday, and damn those first 3 days were so hard. I kept reaching for my vape after my many triggers (food, exercise, videogame, tv). Breaking that habit was really hard, but ive heard it generally only takes 3 days to break a habit or form one. 

Im still getting slight cravings during the day, and more intense ones at night, but honestly it feels doable now. And it's a great feeling knowing that i have support from all of you beautiful humans.

I really like this community, and just wanted to share my experience. Lets stay strong ya'll.

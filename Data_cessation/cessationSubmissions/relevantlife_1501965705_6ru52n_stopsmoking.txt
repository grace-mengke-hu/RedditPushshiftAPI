Sinusitis and smoking...

Currently a few days smoke free thanks to the excruciating pain of a sinus infection. 

I've read that smokers experience sinus infections at a much greater frequency than non smokers... 

Have you noticed this to be true now that you folks don't smoke? 

Today I shan't smoke with you!

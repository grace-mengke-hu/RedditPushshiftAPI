Around 3 weeks ago I made a decision to quit smoking after reading this subreddit.

Before I quit, I was smoking a pack a day off a minimum wage job running out of money frequently by payday always asking myself "Why am I doing this? I should quit" but never having the motivation to do it.

I caved in my first two days while hanging out with my friends and smoking the devils lettuce, that was always my weak point when it came to attempting to quit. After avoiding hanging out with them for two weeks, I went over to my friends and resisted smoking cigarettes for two entire days while being in a smoke filled room which was a big stepping stone for me.

I'm proud to say I'm no longer a smoker, and I no longer have any urges. And I'm already starting to feel a bit better physically. Thank you /r/stopsmoking for the support, and helping me find the motivation to finally quit.

Good luck on all your quitting journeys friends!

Feeling pretty pathetic about not being able to quit

I've been smoking socially for a few years now. I had a brief phase where I would smoke the weekend's left-over cigarettes throughout the week, but I don't even do that anymore.

For the past year or more, I only smoke when I'm with others that smoke (usually drinking). If I go out to the bar, I'll end up smoking an entire pack that night. If I don't go out, I don't smoke. I've had a pack of cigarettes sitting on my desk for a week now that I haven't had a desire to touch, simply because I haven't been around other smokers.

Since I can go a week+ without cigarettes crossing my mind, I feel like quitting should be easy for me... But that's not the case. When I'm around other smokers, I start feinding for one.

Did anyone else have a similar experience? How did you move past it?

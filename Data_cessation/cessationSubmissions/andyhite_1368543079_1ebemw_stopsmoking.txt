Nicotine patch and nausea

Has anyone else had problems with nausea when they're using the nicotine patch? I know that it's a known side-effect, but it's always made it difficult for me to use the patch (and part of the reason why I usually give up).

I smoked a ton on Saturday, and didn't want any on Sunday since I was nursing a cigarette and beer hangover. Yesterday I decided that I would just try and keep this up, so I managed to avoid cigarettes (without a patch), but when I woke up this morning I was having some bad cravings. I decided to pick up some patches, and within about an hour and a half of putting it on I started feeling pretty nauseous. I'm trying to fight taking the patch off, but it's hard.

Does anyone have any advice on how to combat the nausea? Does it eventually go away if I tough it out? Should I be using a lower-dose patch (I usually smoke over 10 cigarettes a day, so I went with "step 1")? Is there somewhere else I should be applying it (it's on my arm right now)?

I just submitted a request to reset my badge, since I failed the last time I tried to quit, but I'm determined to stick it out this time.

Thanks!

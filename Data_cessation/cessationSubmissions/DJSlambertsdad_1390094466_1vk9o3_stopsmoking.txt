Not the first time, but it has been a long time since I have been this long without any nickotine.

About 47 hours without a smoke or any nicotine of any kind. Feeling strong but I have been here many times. I pray this is the last time,. I feel good because it has been a while since I have gone this long without a smoke.
Wish me luck!!!

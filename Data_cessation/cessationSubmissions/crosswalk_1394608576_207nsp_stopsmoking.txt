I was smoke free, relapsed, and found this subreddit.

It was only half of a cigarette, but that doesn't nullify the fact that it was still the act of smoking. I don't know why I haven't tried to find a community on reddit like this one before. I've sent the message for my badge starting today and I'm ready to tackle the challenge again with a stronger mindset. I'm looking up to the ones who are still going strong and I'm going to join the ones who have quit indefinitely. This time *will* be different. My mind is now made up.

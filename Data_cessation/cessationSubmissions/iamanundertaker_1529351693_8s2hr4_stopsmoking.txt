I've made it over 3 weeks without a smoke, and it's been easy! But somehow it's getting harder again.

For some reasons the cravings are a lot stronger the past few days. Even yesterday when I was finishing up some cooking I thought to myself, "Alright, now I'll just go have a smok--." *what* I thought. It must be habitual but it's strange because I havent had those habitual smoke thoughts for a while.

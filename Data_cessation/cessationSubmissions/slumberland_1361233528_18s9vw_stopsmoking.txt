So its been more than a year

Since I combusted tobacco (also known in some circles as 'smoking'). Its been 6 months since I inhaled any combusted matter intentionally.

Which leads to an interesting question - Have I  stopped smoking?

The clear answer is yes. Some people in this sub would disagree. 

Why would you quit smoking? For me, its avoiding hundreds of chemicals, many of them carcinogenic, damaging my lungs, and because my health was beggining to suffer - couldn't climb stairs, etc.

I've chosen to do this (and i've tried the gum, the patch, the gum, the inhaler, no chantix because it doesn't mix with my other more important medications and its an abomination that the FDA let it onto the market the way they did) with e-cigarettes, and its worked.

**So my real question -**

What is the point of this sub? Is it harm reduction (SNUS would count towards that as well, its markably less harmful than combustion)?

Is it total abstinence from nicotine (and apparently all drugs) as some on this sub would have it?

Is it to support people who want to do any of the above, and keep them from smoking?

I notice a lot of 'cold turkey' pride, my way or the highway, and its a bit of a turnoff. Not only did what worked for you not work for everyone, you're dismissing countless valid methods of quitting combusting tobacco, an incredibly harmful habit. I've quit cold turkey, lasted about 6 months, but I never felt the need to lord what I was able to do over others. 

Which is good, because it didn't stick. I'd been smoking a PAD for over 10 years before I found e-cigs, and you know what?

I'm not going to quit nicotine. Its not my intent. Much like caffiene, it is a fairly harmless chemical that I enjoy imbibing. But I'm not going to smoke again.

So why are you here, and where do you fall?

Thanks for reading. I will probably be linking this post to the electronic cigarette sub at some point, if theres an influx of fresh faces you don't recognize.

Cheers!

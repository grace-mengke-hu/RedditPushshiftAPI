Coughing randomly? Help.

First if, let me say that I'm 9 days nicotine-free, no vaping or patches. So I noticed I've been having this horrible cough for a month now and sometimes I would have this horrible experience that right when I wake up, I start coughing uncontrollably. It's only recently that if I caught too hard without a break in the middle, I run out of breath and can't take a normal breath for a moment. I've tried taking coughing medicine, but it doesn't look like any progress has been made. I read online about something similar that it passes after a month.

Anyone who has experienced this, please let me know.

Yesterday I watched someone buy my brand

I smoked JPS menthol superkings. If you don't know what they are, they're really long girly ones. Yesterday I had to change some cash at the supermarket help desk, which is where the smokes are. I'm behind this girl and she asks for my brand. Only one pack, and I wondered if a) she was like I was, always pretending it would be the last one, or b) not able to afford any more than one. Because SMOKES ARE FUCKING EXPENSIVE YO. I wondered if she had to give up some groceries to afford them. I really wanted to say something, but didn't because she was all chatty with the cashier, and I also wondered whether I should or not.

She turned around to leave after she'd been served, and I saw she had fucking shit awful skin (the smokers kind, not the genetic kind). She was also just a bit overweight, so I know what her life looks like...exactly the same as mine just a few months ago. Now I'm carving out a hot ass bod, and I just registered for an 8km road race. I felt sorry for her...she has nothing I want, fuck those superkings...I hope one day she will find her way here, and celebrate with us!!!

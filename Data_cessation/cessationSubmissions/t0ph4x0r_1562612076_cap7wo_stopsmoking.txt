Day 7 - Think I'm done smoking for good

I'm 19 years old (20 in October), have been smoking since I was 14 year old brat, I liked the combination of smoking and listening to Megadeth, still do to be honest.

It so happened that me quitting was unplanned, for some reason I had to go without a cigarette for an entire week - no money, no store nearby, no opportunity to bum one. At one moment I tought - "wait, I'm actually fine" and so I quit... I do want it a little bit now that there are passive smokers nearby but it's like a little itch, nothing too hard to resist. I'm most vulnerable to relapsing when I'm drunk, one of these days I'll go for a drink and that will be my final test, I hate thinking of myself as a quitter (In this case quitting to quit smoking) so I'll be my darndest not to be one.

In Kung Fu Panda there's some scroll which is supposed to contain some super secret, reader of which will attain "limitless power" but when Po finally opened it he saw nothing, at first he was confused thinking why the hell the thing that's been kept protected for thousands of years and just waiting to be opened and read is emtpy. It was supposed to have some secret that would give the user unimaginable power â€“ so many have longed for it. But what Po realized after is that power is in one who believes in themselves. And then he kicks Tai Lung's ass.

What I'm trying to say that you have to believe that you can quit smoking, you have to believe that in yourself. After all, why not? Why can't you quit smoking? Believing in yourself is not like believing in a fairy tail or santa. Those things don't exist, never have. You do.

I hope this helps someone

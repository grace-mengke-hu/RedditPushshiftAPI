I quit smoking about 2 months ago (question)

Using champix, just recently stopped the tablets.

The only problem is I still have a cough. It's entirely non-productive and mostly just sounds stupid, but I was reading online that a continuing cough after quitting smoking can be a sign of lung cancer and of course started freaking out. They gave no more information.

My question is, when did everyone else stop coughing? I smoked about 15-35 a day for six years.

Day 1. Decided to quit nicotine after breakup

So my ex-girlfriend left me 3 weeks ago. I decided to grow stronger from this breakup and change myself. 

Quitting nicotine(snus) is one of those things. Finally yesterday I threw my last can out the window and now I'm suffering from nicotine withdrawals AND breakup pain.

I feel like crap but in 2-3 weeks I will look back at this day with pride. Stay strong brothers and sisters :-)

Day 5, but am I cheating with vape

It has been 5 days since my last smoke.  I have been smoking for 34 years, and at least a pack a day from the beginning.  While the first day was nicotine free, I have turned to my ecig more and more.  I really want to completely quit, am I ruining my chance of quitting for good?

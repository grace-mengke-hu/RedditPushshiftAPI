4 weeks... not much craving, but depressed as fuck! What to do?

Title says it all: 4 weeks and I really don't have any more cravings, but depression is absolutely destroying me!

One day I felt so utterly depressed that  I started walking, and now I usually walk 10 km a day just for that endorphine kick, but that's it: I feel really miserable aside those minutes walking.

Anyone have gone through this? 

And have any tips on how to fight this sadness?

ps: I've done the cold turkey method. 10 year 1 pack a day ex-smoker(hopefully) here.

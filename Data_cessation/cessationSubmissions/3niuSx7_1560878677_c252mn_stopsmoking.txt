After 1 day of not smoking, i tried to smoke mindfull and write down what it feels like. Here is my result.

I focused on my body, how it will react to it.

1st puff : the taste is awful, it stinks. Even after the first puff, i noticed difficult breathing.

2nd puff : a little burning sensation in the throat and the upper part of the lungs, and i had to cough. I felt a little bit dizzy.

3rd puff : i felt an unpleasant feeling in my stomach (some sort of pain).

4th puff : my head started to hurt a little.

5th puff : i felt that my metabolism (bowel) accelerated, some sort like i had to take a forced bowel movement. Difficulty breathing and the unpleasant feeling in the stomach has increased.

2 puffs were left and i did them, still a bad feeling tho.
After i smoked the whole cigarette, i got up from sitting, and i felt dizzy again and i got some pain in my head. My whole body felt worse than before smoking this ONE cigarette.

After that, my body tried to make me smoke one more, even after i felt so uncomfortable doing the first one. 

Believe it or not, the addiction is real. If we smoke mindful, we see, that the smoking is doing nothing but an uncomfortable feeling in our body. It is our body that wants us to smoke more.  So before you smoke, remember that it will make you feel worse than the actual craving.

JUST DON'T DO IT. 

A quote from Viktor Frankl ;

"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."

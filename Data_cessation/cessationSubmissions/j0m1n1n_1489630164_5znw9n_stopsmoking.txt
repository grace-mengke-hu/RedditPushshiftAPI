I'm a bartender and I've been smoke free since Sunday...

...but tomorrow will be my first shift since quitting.

Getting through a whole shift without smoking is always a challenge. I work days, so I get the privilege of cleaning the patio before opening. There are cigarette butts everywhere. Always a trigger. Sometimes I find whole cigs or even partial packs while cleaning.

Then I have hours with few customers, when there is little to do but clean and restock. It can get boring. I'm so used to taking five minutes for a smoke every hour on the slow days. I haven't found anything to replace it with.

My job isn't stressful very often, but when it is, it is *very* stressful. Like, calling the police because a knife-wielding maniac is refusing to leave stressful. When that happens, I always have a smoke to calm my nerves.

So, mainly I'm just asking you all to keep me in your thoughts tomorrow. I'd be happy to hear any suggestions you might have for staying smoke-free when I'm surrounded by work-related triggers, too.

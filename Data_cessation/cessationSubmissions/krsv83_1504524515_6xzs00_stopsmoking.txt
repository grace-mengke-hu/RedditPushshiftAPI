9 days and counting.

So I just passed 9 days as a former smoker and today was the worst day so far. 
I decided to quit last Saturday on the start of my vacation. Spent a week in Italy and it was no problem what so ever, had no problem to kill the urge with chewing-gum. But today is a completely other story. 
I got headache, no motivation and my temper is extremely short. I have been eating a box of chewing-gum but nothing is scratching my itch. 

I was hoping that it would get easier after a week but today I feel like crap and just want to go home at sleep and never wake up again.

But I will not give up, if I can manage a week without cigarettes I can manage today.

Sorry for the rant but I needed to write of how I feel, nobody in my surroundings are smokers so they don't understand how it feels to quit.

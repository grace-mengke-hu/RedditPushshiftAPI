It's 4:00 AM, and I want to quit smoking. Now.

Hi all. 25 F here. I have been smoking for 7 years now. Fuck. 7 years. 

I started out smoking because of a boyfriend I had when I was 18. I am currently a nurse, furthering my nursing education. I know better than to smoke. 

My mom died at 52 years old....from smoking. I know better than to smoke.

I am overweight and since school has started, I have become sedentary. My breathing has gotten worse, and I am afraid I am going to develop emphysema, COPD, and the like. I know better than to smoke.

I come here hoping to gain support for quitting. My life is super high stress, so I have always relapsed after just a few days. I am looking for someone who might help keep me accountable. I am stopping today. It's 4:00 AM here, and I am hoping to never smoke another cigarette. I plan on visiting this sub several times a day, and checking out some other subs as well. If anyone has recommendations, they would be appreciate. If anyone would like to exchange kik names, we can help keep each other accountable that way as well. 

I thought of applying for a badge on this sub, but I am afraid of relapsing and having to reset time and time again. So I thought about waiting to see how I do. As you can see, I don't have very much confidence in myself regarding quitting smoking. 

Congrats to all of you who have done so well. I hope to some day be able to help motivate others, as some of your posts have helped to motivate me tonight.

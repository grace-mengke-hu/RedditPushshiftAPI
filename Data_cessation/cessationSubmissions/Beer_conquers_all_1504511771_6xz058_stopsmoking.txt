Second attempt

I have posted here some time ago. Alas, I failed in between. But today, after my last retake, I threw out my cigarettes. I had spent my time reading allen carr's easyway earlier. And I am happy to say I feel the effects. That last cigarette disgusted me. I realised smoking is not your little friend you have to give up and I am looking forward to all I will gain now :)

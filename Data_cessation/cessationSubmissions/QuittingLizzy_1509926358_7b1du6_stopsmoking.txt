It's the small things...

I've recently been cutting down my smoking, and one of the cigarettes I am no longer routinely having is the 'breakfast cigarette.' I usually make my kids breakfast, then pop outside to smoke while they are eating which helps me relax, or catch up on emails before work, whatever.


In England it is *freezing* at the moment, so I decided against going outside and sat with my children while they ate instead, and my daughter said "it's nice for you to be eating breakfast with us, Mummy" and gave me a hug when she was done. (I usually slightly kept my distance from them until I no longer smelled of cigarette smoke.)


*Reallyyy* soppy post I know, but it just made me smile and made the cravings subside somewhat. 


Here's to one day being smoke free! Keep going everyone! x

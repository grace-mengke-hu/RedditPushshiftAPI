I've smoked for five years, my roommate still smokes

I've been smoking for 6 years and I'm trying to quit. I used to always smoke with my roommate, and whenever he goes out for one it's a trigger for me to say yes. 

Does that feeling go away? I mean I haven't smoked in 5 days and I feel better physically, but it's so hard to break the normal cycle of going out to smoke one with him. He's one of my only friends so I can't just break ties. What have you folks done to quit when you can't change your day to day routine?

Just came back from a relatives

And I am fucking craving a cigarette right now. I'm on day 13 of no smoking and it's the first day without my vape. I feared quitting vaping would lead to craving a cigarette instead of going back to vaping but Id rather not give in to either just yet. I was planning on quitting the ecig the day I start the gym. It was meant to be Friday but with my new medication and it being a busy day I thought best not so I'm going tomorrow. Idk maybe I'll go for a drive or just eat something

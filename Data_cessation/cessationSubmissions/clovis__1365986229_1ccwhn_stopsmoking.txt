At 223 days and I suddenly feel like it's DAY 2 again...WTF?

I think I'm struggling with the change in weather. I miss going out on my deck after everyone's gone to sleep and drinking, smoking, looking at the stars and letting my thoughts wander. It feels like something essential about me has been eliminated. Every good idea I've ever had came from that ritual. I've been doing it since I was 15. It's not the same without the cigs. I can't sit still. What do I do? It feels like I'm not going to make it. I've been in a foul mood for 3 weeks. Maybe I should just go to sleep?

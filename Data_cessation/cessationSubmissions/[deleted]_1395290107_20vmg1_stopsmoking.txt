On my way to work this morning a song came on pandora that I've always associated with smoking

And I spent all day thinking about smoking.  In the morning.  At lunch.  After I got off.  On my way to the gym (I took an extra half hour driving around before I went in trying to decide whether to buy a pack or to go to the gym.  Thankfully I made the right choice.)  After I made dinner.  When I went to the store and bought a 6 pack of beer.  And now.  Now that my nightly film is over.  The cravings have got me by the balls.  I always make it 2, 3, 4 weeks or a bit longer and cave.  I've done it 10 or so times.  

I've read the carr.  I quit cold turkey.  I get 5 texts a day from the quit line.  I have an app. I have a huge fucking pros and cons list.  The cons list is massive.  The only thing on the pro's list is 'I love smoking.  It's my favorite hobby.'  I know that I'm gaining rather than losing.  I'm a better person without smoking.  More confident.  More focused.  My nerves don't itch.  I've even sacrificed my social life to a major degree to avoid temptation.   But I have such an addictive personality.  I'm in a new state, new city and have a new job for christ's sake.  It should be a new me.  Smoking is heavily frowned upon in my new (and may I add) awesome work environment.

It should be easy right?   There's really nothing else I can do.  It's do or die time.  But I have such a fucking addictive personality.  I finally gave up the drugs 4 or 5 years ago.  And that was a struggle.  I cut WAY back on the drinking in recent years.  I landed my fucking dream job and can earn over 6 figures easy in the next year.  Fuck. 1/4 of a million in my first year if I do it well.  As a fucking 26 year old.  Without a college degree.  And there's only one other person in the company who smokes (out of 60 or so).  And he's the god damned black sheep.

And all I can think about all day today is how much I want a cigarette.

Jesus.  Fucking.  Christ.   FUCK.   FUCK.   FUCK!

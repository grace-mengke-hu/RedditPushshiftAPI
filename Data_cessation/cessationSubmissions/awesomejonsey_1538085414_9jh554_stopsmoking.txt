Bad Dreams

I stopped smoking about 11 months ago and I’m starting to have dreams that I casually start again and then I feel like I’ve failed. Anyone having these types of dreams?  I’m constantly waking up feeling like it was real and it takes some time for me to realize it was just a dream. I am not taking any meds (Chantix) or anything.

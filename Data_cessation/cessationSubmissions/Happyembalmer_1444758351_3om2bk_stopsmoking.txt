My husband quit smoking, now what?

A bit of background...my husband is a stay at home brother who has been taking care of his sister (an adult with Down Syndrome) for almost a decade.  While I'm at work and she's doing her thing, my husband has found respite in going outside and smoking.  He's 40 and has been smoking since he was 14.  He quit cold turkey about five weeks ago, and though bumpy, has done remarkably well.  The biggest hurdle so far is his respite time.  He's struggling now to find a reason to go outside for 10 minutes for a little "me time".  We live in an apartment, gardening and other basic outdoor activities are kind of out, and since he can't leave his sister alone, being outside for a few minutes is all he gets.  Any advice on what he can do to fill that time, just to make the day go by a little faster?  Be as honest as possible.

Edit:  Thank you guys for the advice!  I will share it all with him and see how it goes.

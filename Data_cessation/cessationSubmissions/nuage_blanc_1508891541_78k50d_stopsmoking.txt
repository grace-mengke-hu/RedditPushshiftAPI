Any serial quitters here ?

Hey all. So I often read about people quitting several times before they actually pull it off for good. They quit, relapse, quit again, etc...

But in my case I often think about quitting, I think about it all the time. I like to smoke but at the same time I hate it. So I constantly think about quitting, like everyday. Sometimes I throw my pack away but I'll buy one the next day. The longest I've been smokefree in 15 years is 1 month. 

I've read lots of things on whyquit, I've read Allen Carr twice, but to know avail. Honestly I've lost confidence in my ability to quit for good. That's why I post here. Cigarettes make me feel miserable, I'm constantly lying to myself with these half hearted attempts. Nicotine is such a stupid addiction...

14 days and feeling great!

After 35 years of pack-a-day smoking, I had enough. Two weeks today, with the patch. 

I'm not sure why, and I don't care to know, but the past two weeks have been easier than I ever thought they would be. I think perhaps I've just had enough -- it was time. 

I know I am getting nicotine with the patch, so the urges to smoke are my Scumbag Lizard Brain trying to cling to its behaviours that will kill me. Separating the real Me, who doesn't ever want to smoke, ever, from the Scumbag Lizard Brain [SLB] that wants to kill me, has been really helpful.

I noticed how SLB works while I was highway driving. It knows it won't get me to put a cigarette it my mouth, so instead it goes fishing for an unpleasant thought. Like a resentment or some memory of anguish, and tries to get me to stew there as long as it can. 

I find if I am in a meditative mindset, as fully present as I can be, then SLB runs out of tricks that work. It still grasps on stuff and tries to shift my mind into negativity, but it's not as powerful.

But I think the patch is great. Over the past two weeks, I've been working on actions, behaviours, feelings, and thinking that are tied to smoking addiction, not having to endure nicotine withdrawal. Over the next few weeks, I can develop and nurture new connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviours -- those of the real me, the non-smoker. Then once they are in place, I am ready to give up nicotime without that automatic reach-for-a-smoke impulse. It just makes so much sense now!

**tl;dr** The patch allows me to re-program my thoughts, feelings, and actions as a non-smoker *before* dealing with complete nicotine withdrawal. Makes a lot of sense and is working great!

For the past 4 nights in a row

I have tore apart my remaining cigarettes and threw them away and swore I will quit this time. Then in the morning either picking the pieces up and smoking them or going to the store to get a new pack that costs 7â‚¬. WOW!

I have that craving going right now. But I will keep reminding myself it is just the nicotine addiction.

Quitting

Just smoked my last one in 18 been smoking since I was about 15 or 16 can't really remember promised myself I would quit before I hit 19 and its right around the corner. I get really bad chest pains and im almost certain its from the damage the cigarettes are causing to my system, I don't want those horrible health effects and I hope I've escaped them thus far.

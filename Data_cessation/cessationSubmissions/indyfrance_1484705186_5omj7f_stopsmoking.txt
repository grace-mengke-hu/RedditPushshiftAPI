Weather-based Triggers

I'm at 62 days nicotine-free now. I woke up one morning after going out and didn't have any cigarettes, so I decided that was the day. Most of my cravings have subsided now, but the one that lingers is when it's raining outside. Somehow I have a very strong association between heavy rain and smoking. 

It has been pouring down here in Austin. It's a particularly strong craving as well. Does anyone else have weird weather-associated triggers like this?

I really miss smoking but have no interest in smoking.

I think “Man, a cigarette would be nice right now,” but then I flash to the quickened pulse, the anxiety, the breath, the smell, and actively do not want to smoke. Just a straight up “Ugh, blech, no” feeling. 

It’s frustrating and liberating. Smoking used to organize my day. What am I supposed to do with all this freedom?

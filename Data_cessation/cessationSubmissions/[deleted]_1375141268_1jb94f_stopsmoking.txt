Has anyone tried electronic cigarettes to ween themselves down from Nicotine? If so, what brand did you use and do you recommend it?

EDIT: I should have phrased this question better... I apologize. Right now, I am just trying to help conserve my lungs. I am a weird smoker, and can go 2 weeks without smoking... But, after that 2 weeks, I would much prefer to puff on an ecig than on an actual cigarette.

Smoked 6 cigarettes in my life. I just bought my first pack. Help.

I didn't know the cravings would be this intense. Every time I see a person smoking or anything I have to force myself not to ask if I can bum one off of them.  I thought maybe buying my own pack would help me not give in to the cravings all day and just focus on fighting the one craving when I get home at night.

Just what the title says. Anything beyond the normal cliche stop smoking one liners would be very appreciated. Maybe a strategy to stop the cravings. 

EDIT: Thank you for all the support and tough love/advice. I threw the pack away. Hearing how some of you talk about your addiction and cravings really hit me. I almost feel like I haven't earned the right to post here, but still, you all have helped me with this. If I ever get cravings all I have to do is come back here and reread the thread.  Thank you.

87 Days Smoke Free

Not sure if I've posted or read much here since I actually quit. Was supposed to quit (my self-appointed deadline) on July 31. Actually quit on August 20.  

Days 2-4 were the hardest. Then it wasn't really so bad. I did the patches, but found by the end that I didn't even use them.   

I still get cravings at weird times. I ignore them and move on for the most part. The absolute worst one was last Saturday. I had an accident at work and dumped two pallets of stuff in an aisle. No one was hurt and nothing was broken, but my nerves were rattled and I was frustrated and it was really tempting to bum one from someone.  But I knew I'd have to start over at zero days and I've got a good streak going.  

A guy offered one to me a few weeks back. I had to decline several times, but he finally took it back. I don't know why, but I don't count days (until today) so much as weeks because I can remember that I quit on a Saturday morning so every Saturday it's another week I can add to the list.

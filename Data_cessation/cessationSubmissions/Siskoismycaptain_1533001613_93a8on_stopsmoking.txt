Four days without a cigarette.

Quit drugs and alcohol through NA five months and 6 days ago. Last Thursday morning I smoked my last cigarette. Quitting drinking and drugs was hard but this is on a whole other level. But applying first step principle to smoking and so far it's working. I know one is too many &amp; a thousand never enough.

day 8 - so far so good

just some random thoughts on this whole quitting thing


had my last smoke last monday, then went cold turkey. first few days i would occasionally get this weird dizzy feeling for a minute or two, but not any more, im guessing that was the physical part of nicotine withdrawal. 


the mental withdrawal seems to be harder to fight


every evening i have to move my father's car which has fresh smokes lying around on the passenger seat, plus more smokes where he keeps the keys. not too hard to resist the temptation, but its still in the back of my mind.

Not sure if this is the place, but I'd like to ask about an old myth I see a lot on old shows/from my parents.

So, I've been smoking for about a year and a half now, about a pack a day. And I'm ready to quit. I started as a cigar smoker, hence the username, but work just took it out of me and I took the plunge into the world of cigarettes. But, I'm ready to quit. 

I'm trying the vape thing, slowly weaning myself off the nicotine, but even then, it doesn't help. I still get the craving for a smooth Camel Crush. 

So, I'm curious, how many of you have tried the old myth of "Oh, you're smoking? Well, here, you're going to smoke this whole pack/carton in front of me, and you're not getting up until it's done"? And if so, has it worked? Again, if this isn't the place, I apologize, but I am genuinely curious as to whether or not this could make me so sick of them, I won't want to pick one up again. Thanks for any tips!

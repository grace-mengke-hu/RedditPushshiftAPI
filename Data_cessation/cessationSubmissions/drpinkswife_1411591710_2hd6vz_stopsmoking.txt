Skin Issues

So I read somewhere, and I can't remember where, that your skin starts to regenerate faster after you quit? Something like this? Anywho, for those of us who have skin issues i.e. rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis this can be a real *pardon my French* fU)k3r. Most people don't notice anything wrong with my skin. Goodie for me. But I'm having a 'flare' like I've haven't had in years and feel like a monster. So if anyone out there is dealing with skin issues (other than quit zits) and can direct me towards info on this, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

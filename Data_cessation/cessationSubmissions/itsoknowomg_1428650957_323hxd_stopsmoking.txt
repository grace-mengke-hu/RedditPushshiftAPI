i have slight problem

hello guys, so its almost 4 months in, it really passed quickly as hell, but the thing is, last month was really bad, cravings returned, "wanting" returned and i dont know why the hell it happened.
I watched alen carrs, i read free from nicotine addiction, i read readdit alot, helped others, i know so much about what is nicotine and how it works in my brain, but i still struggle now to rezist it. It just keeps returning, feeling of "wanting"... its still easy to fight it but its annoying as fuck, its like voice in your head talking to you mesmerizing you... like some kind of light form of OCD i would say

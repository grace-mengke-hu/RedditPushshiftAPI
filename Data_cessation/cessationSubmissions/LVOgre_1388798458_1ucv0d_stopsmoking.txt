I Just Kind of Forgot

I smoked my last cigarette on August 1st 2013.

I was a half a pack to one pack a day smoker. I had been considering trying out ecigs for quite some time, probably since the beginning of the year. I did a lot of research before hand, found a brand that had a good reputation, and looked and felt similar to a cigarette. It was my intention to buy 2 weeks worth of ecig supplies using the lowest nicotine level available. It would cost me about as much as 2 weeks worth of cigarettes, and if it wasn't working for me I'd just pick up a carton of smokes after that 2 weeks and not be out any money for this experiment. So, that's what I did.

The day they arrived I had 1 pack of cigarettes left. I decided to leave it and get on my way with the ecig first thing in the morning. I put the battery on the charger, and I went to bed.

I have to say, it was as if I'd never quit smoking. No withdraw, no cravings, it felt as if nothing changed. After a week I started to have some skin problems, acne, some skin drying. I expected this from the research I'd done, it's part of the detox. It cleared up after 2 weeks, and I never looked back. I ordered more supplies.

Over the next month I found local sources for the e-liquids, and better equipment. Even though I was constantly upgrading I still only spent half of what I did smoking. All the while I was cutting down my nicotine. Every time I bought more juice, I would cut the nicotine just a little more. By the beginning of November I had eliminated nicotine all together. I continued to use the ecig with no nicotine.

Then, sometime before Thanksgiving I forgot my ecig. I left it on my keyboard and went out for the night. I never picked it up again. I just put it away in a box, it was still right there on top of my keyboard. I just kind of forgot to keep using it.

Albert Camus / The Outsider

I have attempted to quit smoking dozens of times during my 10 year habit. I have been smoke free for 11 days now.

There is a passage in The Outsider/The Stranger by Albert Camus that has resonated with me when I have been smoking and smoke free. 

‘Another thing was cigarettes. When I went to prison, they took away my belt, my shoe-laces, my tie and everything I had in my pockets, particularly my cigarettes. As soon as I got my cell, I ask for them back. But they told me that wasn’t allowed. The first few days were really bad. It was possibly this that shook me up the most. I used to break bits of wood off my bed-plank and suck them. I’d feel permanently sick all day long. I couldn’t understand why I was being deprived of something that didn’t do anyone any harm. Later on I realised it was all part of the punishment. But by that time I’d got used to not smoking, so for me it was no longer a punishment.’

Later;

‘One of my policemen told me the judges hadn’t arrived yet, and offered me a cigarette, which I declined.’

Once the withdrawal passes, he does not need cigarettes anymore. He is no longer deprived of them. He can refuse them as they are no longer necessary to him; they have lost their function. 

This idea is very helpful to me. I fill my life with functional things; when something has no use, I do not need it.

Almost relapsed today due to sudden and extreme craving, strongest I've ever had.

What could have caused this all of a sudden. i was at my grandmas house, and she smokes inside. For some reason I could almost not control myself, my hand grabbed her pack and took out a cigarette. in that moment, my mind rationalized with a hundred thoughts a second. Every great person who's smoked, the idea that most quitters take one ever "once in a while", I convinced myself that one smoke is no big deal after making it so far. Right before I lighted up I just put it back in the pack and said I had to go, and I left.

I'm fine now, but damn. I haven't thought about cigs for ages, so what suddenly triggered it that intensely?

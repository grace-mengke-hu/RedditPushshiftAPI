Haven’t smoked since new years eve, but recently I’ve been having dreams where I smoke. Is this normal?

So the weird thing is that I rarely ever get urges when I’m awake and conscious, and when I do, they pass in like 2 seconds. Basically, not smoking has been a really smooth ride so far, which is why these dreams seem out of place.

In these dreams the theme is always that I end up giving in to ‘just one’ cigarette and end up being extremely dissapointed in myself. Have any of you experienced this?

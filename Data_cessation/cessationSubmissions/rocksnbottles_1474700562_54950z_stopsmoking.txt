It's really hard to quit smoking

I've only made it two days since my last smoke. I had told someone I was trying to quit and their response was "I bet you're gonna go home and smoke one!" I was upset by the comment, but I got home and ended up doing exactly what they expected. I felt pretty ashamed that I couldn't prove them wrong, but it makes me determined to try again and try harder. I will believe in myself and i will get over this shitty addiction.

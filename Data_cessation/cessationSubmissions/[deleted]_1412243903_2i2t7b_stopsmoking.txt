I took my last drag yesterday. I already feel 1000 times better.

I woke up this morning without being unable to breathe or having any pain in my lungs, I have more energy and actually got out of bed without going back to sleep until mid day. I am already breathing deeper and have been able to yawn without pain for the first time in I don't know how long!!!

My lungs are sore and I'm coughing up a whole manner of ungodly substances, but thats a good thing. And although I'm cheating in a way by having purchased an e-cig I don't care, I got so used to feeling like shit that I forgot how it felt to feel good.

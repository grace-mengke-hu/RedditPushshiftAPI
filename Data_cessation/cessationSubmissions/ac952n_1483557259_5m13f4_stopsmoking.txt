51 days clean!!!

Smoking is cool, that's something what I used to think. I smoked for 5 and half years; Initially I used to smoke a lot for first 2 years, then I came down to half a pack (per day), then before quitting I was able to come down to 1 or max 2 a day. Though I was scared of getting my life shorter with every puff going into my lungs, but it was so relaxing that all thoughts of quitting used to pop up in my head after I finish smoking. So I decided to take one step at a time, first of all I told all my friends to support me into this, both smokers and non-smokers. So writing down my experience day wise:
Day 1-4: I could easily manage without smoking. It was fresh experience going out without a cigarette.
Day 5-15: I used to feel like smoking every now and then. While sleeping, I smoked packs and packs in dreams. And I used to get up wanting them even more. 
After Day 15: Things went pretty well, in my favour. I did not feel anything like smoking, not even under stress.
Though in the last week, I got this strange feeling inside that when I see people smoking in movies, I end up in a "want to smoke" situation, though cigarettes did not attract me when I saw people smoking in real. Strange!!! But everything went well.

Just to tell you, I can feel my breathe now, I feel fresh everyday, I can sprint without running out of air :D

Aiming for 100 days now.

Bought some gum and giving it a try.

Now I know that cold turkey is the best way, but the gum has been successful in the past. I just got 20 pieces anyway. Woo this is going to suck and be great. I've lost 25 lbs and am more than half way to my goal. Quitting smoking is the next big thing I have to undertake for my transformation.

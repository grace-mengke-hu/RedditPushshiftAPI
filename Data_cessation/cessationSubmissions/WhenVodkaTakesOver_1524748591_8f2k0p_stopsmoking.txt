Things to do around smoker friends?

I rarely smoke, but the problem is most of my friends smoke so when i hang out with them and during main breaks, i smoke too to avoid boredom and looking awkward just standing there. I want to quit, even though itâ€™s infrequent, but as ridiculous as it sounds, this social aspect is more addictive than any sort of nicotine cravings. 

What can i do to keep myself and my hands busy while hanging out with smokers?

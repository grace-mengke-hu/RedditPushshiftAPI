Quitting Today. How or what do you replace it with?

I think I'm finally gonna do it after a year of trying. Never made it past a week before, but recent health problems, such as increased anxiety and panic attacks have been plaguing me. I'm shaking just typing this. I'm assuming its the cigs.

I do have a question though. I'm a foodie, and if I don't smoke, I eat. How do you replace both of those an keep yourself occupied?

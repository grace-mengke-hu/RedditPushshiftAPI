Launched my Vape out the Sun Roof. Day 1

I've been smoking Hookah heavy and was attached to my vape very bad for the past three four years. I finally decided enough was enough after smoking my vape and having a discomfort in your chest and insomnia! The insomnia is real, and my day would drag so bad because I would just be tired as shit all the time. So, on my way home I launched that little shit out the sunroof in a March to a new lifestyle. 

I'm brand new to this sub, so sorry if I broke some rules.

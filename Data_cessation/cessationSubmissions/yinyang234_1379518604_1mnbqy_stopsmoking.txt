Cold Turkey Day 3: I see the light.

Here are my observations for today thus far. I think I'm over the worst of the cravings and the urges. Yesterday was really bad but I pulled through it and today I was bracing myself for another battle of will and determination but it's not the case at all. I haven't had any urges at all...maybe a minor "crave" when I had my morning coffee but it was nothing I couldn't easily dismiss. I feel much better. I can smell things better. I can taste things better. I don't get winded from climbing a couple of flights of stairs. I even think I look better and my face has more color to it. Thiis isn't my first quitting attempt but it's my first "cold turkey" quitting attempt without the use of any nicotine replacement bull crap. So it's safe to say that I am nicotine free for the first time in 12 years since I started smoking and it feels AWESOME!!!!

Random 68 days milestone.

I expected this journey of quitting to be more tough tbh. 

Don't feel any addiction anymore, and today when i was at a mall, guy in front of me bought 3 packs of cig.

Use to be, ill do the same, but today i looked at the price he paid for it and like "dafuq? am i really paid that much for this crap? good luck pal, you need it"

I think i started to pity them now.

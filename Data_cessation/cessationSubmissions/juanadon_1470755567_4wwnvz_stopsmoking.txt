Another check in -- 8 days!

Halfway through day 9. Very happy and proud! Some things that have helped me:

- Having a quit buddy (my boyfriend, in this case)

- An app called Smoke Free - I only use the free version to track some general health stats (that might not be totally accurate, but they're motivating), money saved, and to track cravings. They also send you a little notification at the end of each day, which is always a nice surprise.

- sugar free gum

- Setting a quit date a couple of months out was really useful for me because it gave me time to think about my reasons for quitting and not beat myself up for smoking while I prepared mentally.

- Telling a few key people, but not announcing it to "everyone" (yet). I think maybe I'll post something on facebook if I make it to 6 months. For now, my parents know, a few of my best friends, and a couple of coworkers.

The last couple of days have been an emotional rollercoaster, but I'm trying to remember that a lot of my smoking was a coping mechanism. When I feel overwhelmed, I'm telling myself, "Hey, you're 8 days in. You're showing up for your obligations, and you're learning new ways to cope. Take a deep breath. You rule."

I said this in my last post, but I'm still in awe of my increased energy levels! I spent some time by the pool this weekend (which started out as a trigger), and had more fun swimming and running around than I have in so long. The last year, I couldn't bring myself to do more than lounge in the sun.

Still having a little trouble going to sleep, but the quality of sleep is much better. I can tell because I'm waking up a lot more refreshed. It's been easier to get out of bed.

Anyway -- that's all for now. Good luck to everyone.

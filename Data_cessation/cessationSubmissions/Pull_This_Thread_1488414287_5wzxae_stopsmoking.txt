Monday, Monday

I smoked off and on during grad school, and back then when I chose to stop it was easy. Years later my marriage imploded, and I found an old pack...it was such a stressful time, and I figured I'd quit before, so why not smoke to ease the stress of the situation.

Three years later I'm now a heavy smoker, and though I've tried quitting it's remained a goal out of reach. After seeing the real effects of smoking on my health (coughing, teeth showing stains, constantly out of breath) and my social life (missing important events and moments) I've decided to quit - not halfway, not making excuses for my own failings. 

My quit day is Monday, and I'm going to use NRT to help. I'm determined but also scared. Does anyone have any advice about getting through those first few days? 

Also, would anyone like to be my "quit partner?" 

I welcome any words of wisdom or guidance. Thank you for reading, and best of luck to anyone who is in the process of quitting.

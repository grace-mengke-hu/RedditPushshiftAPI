Long time Quitting

I am a long time trier of the art of quitting. The longest I went without cigarette is 6 months in 2017. Then I went back with a vengeance. Now my consumption of cigarette is all time high. About 20 a day. I feel my body creaking slowly and fear that it may give up eventually if I don't stop now.

I am 37, been smoking for last 15 years. Addiction is a word that doesn't describe what I have. I cannot function without cigarette. It's 9.51 am where I am and I have already had 4.

How to start convincing my mind? I need a few days to first get convinced. I know it sounds stupid right. Its as simple as quit or die. But mind is a curious thing. Every time I have tried quitting, it convinces me to start again.

Also, which is a good app to assist in quitting?

Thanks in advance.

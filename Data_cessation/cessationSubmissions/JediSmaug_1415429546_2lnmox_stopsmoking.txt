I'm 30 days smoke free

I haven't had any cravings since the first 72 hours of smoking my last cigarette. Within the last week, I've started to smell more - such as how gross the interior of my car smells. I walked past someone smoking the other day and the smell made me nauseated. Anyone else have a reaction similar?
Great to see the $200+ dollars I've saved from not smoking sitting in my savings account too :)

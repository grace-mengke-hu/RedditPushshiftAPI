Thank you r/stopsmoking for opening my eyes(and lungs)

14 days without a smoke and i'm not looking back. The most important thing i learned here is the proper mindset. Quitting is easy. I have my weak moments but i just remind myself that it is easy and that i wanna have a number in the hundreds on my badge.

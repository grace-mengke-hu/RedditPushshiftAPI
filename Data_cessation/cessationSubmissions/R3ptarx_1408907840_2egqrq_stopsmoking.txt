Today is my last day

Today is my last day of smoking. I've been smoking for the past 5 years (18-23). I'm currently on my 4th beer, because I know in order to quit smoking, I'm going to have to quit drinking for a while. I'm extremely nervous, knowing that in about 8 or so hours, I will smoke my last cigeratte, and honestly, I think that scares me the most. Knowing that it'll be my last. Tomorrow I'll get my day 1 badge, and it'll be a struggle for months. 

I've always lurked on this sub for a while, slowly building the courage and self motivation to quit. Keep posting those success stories, they motivate us all

11 cigeratttes left, cheers to a better future.

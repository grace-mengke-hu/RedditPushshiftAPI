What to do on smoke breaks?

I never really smoked cigarettes much but use to do some a pipe and a cigar from time to time. I haven't smoked anything in a year and half and really don't need to or get any cravings.. But it's getting nicer out and one thing I miss is going outside on a summer night and having a smoke. I still go out on my deck for a few minutes and get air... But without having a smoke I seem to feel like I don't have as much reason and get kind of bored. Sometimes I'll have a drink outside or something.. I think it's kind of an oral fixation. Does anyone else have a similar thing?

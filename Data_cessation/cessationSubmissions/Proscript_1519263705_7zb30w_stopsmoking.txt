9 years smoke free or not?

we've all seen the "timetable of quitting smoke" such as http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html - but  does it all "reset" after a relapse? 

I quit 9 years ago... but during these 9 years, there were a few relapses when I was drunk. I never became a smoker again. It was just a few cigarettes when drunk.

Now it's been 2 years since the last incident, so  I have that under control - I learned to drink more responsibly. Still I wonder, when I look at that timetable or when someone asks me, should I think I quit 9 years ago, or 2 years ago? 

These were isolated incidents... I wasn't a repeating 'social smoker' even when drinking.

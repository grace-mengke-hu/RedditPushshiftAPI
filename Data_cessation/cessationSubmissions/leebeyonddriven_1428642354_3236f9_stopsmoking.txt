Resubscribed after 10 months. Here we go again!

Hi guys,

I quit 10 months ago thanks to the help of Alan Carr's book and this wonderful community. It sucked, but my life was infinitely better afterwards. A few months ago i thought i could get away a couple of sneaky ones while drinking every couple of weeks, which worked for a while. Well, that became every couple of nights, Which became every night and now I'm back to smoking in the car which i haven't done since 10 months ago. Back came the anxiety, self doubt, withdrawal aggression and waking up feeling like butt. Would appreciate your encouragement and advice! I won't let these things rule me again.

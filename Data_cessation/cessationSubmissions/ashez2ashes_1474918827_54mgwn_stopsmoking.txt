My boyfriend started smoking again after quitting for over 2 years...

His professor told him he had quit for 15 years and the cravings never went away.  He was so demoralized that he went and bought a carton.  He said he thought he could out wait them but that he couldn't take it if the desire to smoke never went away... 

Is this true? Does it never go away? I don't smoke and never have so I have no frame of reference...

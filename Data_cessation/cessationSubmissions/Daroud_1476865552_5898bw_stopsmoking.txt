I understand myself better now

Hello everyone, I just quit.
I was more than a year smoke free, I thought I could handle a cigarette once in a while. It slowly crept up until reaching a daily habit again 5 weeks ago. I understand myself better now, I know I am easily subject to addictive behavior and I cannot be trusted with tobacco ever again. Today I reset the counter and quit again. I hope that 5 weeks were not enough to make smoking too much of a habit and that I am just a non-smoker that slipped rather than a smoker again.

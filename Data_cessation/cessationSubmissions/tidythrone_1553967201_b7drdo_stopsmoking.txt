Some reflections after 1000 days

I'm now into quadruple digit days smoke free! It will be 3 years this summer. If you want to see some of the struggles I had at the beginning, it's all there in chronological order in my post history. It doesn't come easy.

I almost never think about cigarettes anymore. It sounds weird to say that. I thought I'd never say that. However, I do not consider myself "out of the woods." Honestly, I don't think I ever will. Every time I drink and I'm around smokers, the though crosses my mind to ask for one. Every time.

So what do I do? I limit the number of times I put myself in that situation (sometimes that can suck). And I tell myself **before** I go out for the night that if I get a craving, I will respond to it by being stronger than the craving. I will not smoke another cigarette in my life.

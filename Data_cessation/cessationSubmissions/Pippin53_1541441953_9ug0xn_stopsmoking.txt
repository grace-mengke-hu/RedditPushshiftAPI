Quit for 7 years, just started again. Need some motivation :(

As I said, I was smoke free for 7 years. Things started getting really stressful at work and bam. I just sort of picked it up again.

I'm only a week in but I'm already smoking like 1/2 to 3/4 of a pack a day. I woke up this morning just feeling like crap. Headache, sore throat etc. My friend said it's from smoking again?

To quit the first time I had to use Champix. I don't know where to start now. Should I get a patch? Gum? I've never tried any of that stuff.

Help avoiding relapse

I quit smoking over 3 years ago. But for the past month or so I’ve found myself craving a cigarette relentlessly. Every time I’m at a check out counter I have to make serious effort to not buy a pack of cigarettes. I know I shouldn’t because I’ve come so far, but the cravings are not letting up. Has anyone here experienced this? I’ve come here for any support or advice you may have.

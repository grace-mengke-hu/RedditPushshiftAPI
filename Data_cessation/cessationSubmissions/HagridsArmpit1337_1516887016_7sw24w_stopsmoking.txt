The anger is killing me heeeeelp

So I quit smoking and I cant be around any other humans because of this anger, I’ve already lost half my mates because of this, my family hates me, my boss at work wants to fire me, I got banned from the gym, fuck was this even worth it ? If there is a light at the end of the tunnel I’ll already have lost everything when I reach it, I’m just staying in my room now and watching movies and stuff but I feel like this is making me insane, What should I do please help, I hear people don’t get better for 3 months if that’s the case I might as well smoke again No way I can live like that for that long

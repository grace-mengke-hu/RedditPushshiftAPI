How about a better name for the first 3 days?

I'm in my first 3 days of being quit.  
  
I'm mostly posting to commiserate about the first 3 days, but didn't feel like typing that I was "in the hump." Uh? Anyone want to suggest other names for this productive hell that is the gateway to non-fatigued, happy lives?  
  
I can tell my body's officially withdrawing because I went to sleep at 3 am last night and woke up naturally at 5 am. Wahoo! Feels good, actually. Beats not being able to get out of bed in the morning.  
  
Good luck, everyone; stay strong!

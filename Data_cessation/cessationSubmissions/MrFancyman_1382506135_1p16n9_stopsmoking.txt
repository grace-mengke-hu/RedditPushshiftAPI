LSD cured my nicotine addiction

First of all I'm not necessarily  suggesting this.

I didn't have any profound experience, I wasn't planning on quitting, I simply woke up the next day and had no desire to smoke. Granted, a few days later the habitually driven aspect of the addiction began to set in. However, I have maintained my nicotine sobriety and I really have to owe it to acid. 

Just felt like sharing

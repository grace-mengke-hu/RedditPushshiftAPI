Day 4 of the rest of my life (Cold turkey)

First off I'd like to thank this sub. I've been doing a ton of reading, I got the Easyway book and it helped me like no other. So thank you all. Before that I've been smoking for about 10 years almost. Tried so many times to quit and I finally have. 

Two weeks ago I tried to use that Nicotine gum from 7-11, Zonnic, it helped but after a week of that I went back to smoking. Finally fed up I decided to quit. I read the book and for some reason stuff clicked. I started to excercise better, I'm drinking over 150oz of water a day. All in all I feel way better.

I don't feel like I have any withdrawal like symptoms. I have a bit of coughing but its not bad. I'm constantly thinking of cigarettes but not in the way I used to, how my life is better now, and I'm surprised at how easy this all seems. 

Taking it one day at a time but for now it looks like I am not going back at all. So thank you all for helping me make and keep the best decision I ever made about smoking. 

Edit: Is there anything I can do about gums being black/purple?

4 weeks no smoking

I don’t post on here much but I do reply/comment some.  I made it today 4 weeks not smoking.  Last couple days have been hard but I’m a nonsmoker And just keep reminding myself that...  I’m not as up as normal today but who cares I’m taking the time to recognize a milestone.  Happy for this community.  One of the tools I’ve used to quit.  Thanks to all you all.

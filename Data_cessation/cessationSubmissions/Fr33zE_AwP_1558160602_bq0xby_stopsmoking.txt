Update #2 - quit smoking may 16.

I am fucking feeling like I have lost something. I can’t even express it in words it’s just painful. That’s the best way I can type it. 

I am angry I am annoyed I am feeling like stabbing my couch. I honestly don’t fucking know. My fingers are tingly. My head feels light I can’t sleep. It’s too much. I don’t wanna eat or drink. 

What the fuck is happening to me ? It’s like I’m not my usual self. Something or most things aren’t right. I need help. I feel conflicted. My brain is going haywire crazy like gf during her time. 

I’m just angry for no reason. I thought I could wait for another 24 hours but fuck this is crazy what I’m going through. I just need to vent. I don’t know why and I don’t know what I’m angry about. 

Fucking cigarettes ruined me. No way I’d feel what I’m feeling right now if I wasn’t an smoker before I decided to quit. I have immense respect now for ex-smokers. This shit is fucking insanely difficult.

Respect dudes and dames. I don’t know if I’m gonna pull through. Pray that I do. I don’t wanna be feeling so down for the rest of my life. Please pray all of this goes away from me. It’s the hardest thing I’ve experienced. One minute I’m fine the next I’m sad like suddenly all the happiness in my life has gone away forever. 

If none of that made any coherence or sense that’s exactly me right now. No logic just acting out on pure feel.

Day 31 and my craving walks have become serious walks

Today is day 31 and up until day 14 or so, I was going for a walk around the block at least a few times a day. Between then and now, I have had days when I forgot about smoking for an entire day. I haven't missed it, at all, but I understand that my body has been used to having it's fix at least once every waking hour for 35+ years.

This week I started serious walking. I'm lucky to live in a port town and we have some gorgeous walking tracks along the river banks, through marsh and mangrove swamps and with man-made hills woven throughout. 

A month ago, I would not have made an hours walk, because I would have been thinking about that 'reward' ciggie. Yesterday I walked for two and a half hours, including the hill climbs (which I would have skirted around before)

I've been putting away 2/7ths of the money I am saving from not smoking and I am on my way to buy some deadset right proper walking shoes!

Having quit for good, my next challenge is to get fit before I turn 50 in a month. For my birthday, I am giving myself the gift of life :)

A good start...16 Days.

Came on here for some strength.. This quit has been cold turkey. 

Today and yesterday the monster has been particularly boisterous and arrogant. Going through some emotional/mental strife and he keeps saying: "Have just one, we'll get back on the quit after. You'll feel better, it'll help make your weary soul feel better."

I'm amazed i havn't folded to his words yet. Surely it is a bad idea. Surely it wont help with anything to do with the emotional/mental stuff.

 I'm thinking that the 5 seconds of pleasure will be nothing compared to the shame from throwing away 16days.

 White knuckling it today...sigh.

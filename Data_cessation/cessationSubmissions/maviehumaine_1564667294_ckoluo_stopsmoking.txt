Does anyone else have issues sleeping or staying asleep after quitting?

I’m 18 days in, and I’ve never had trouble sleeping or staying asleep my whole life. It seems now that I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I’ll get up in the middle of the night now and fight for an hour to fall back asleep. Does anyone else have this issue?

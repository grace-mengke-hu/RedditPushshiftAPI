2019: 28 days smoke/alcohol free but not all sunshine

Tonight was 28days for me cold turkey. I've managed a few quits over 3 months before but always messed up on nights out drinking so cutting out the booze this time too. I've had lots of great moments where I feel much better physically but it also been a real struggle at times. 

Lots of anxiety issues I now get to face head-on rather than numb them out with smoking and drinking. That's why I'm awake at 3 am writing this, I've had a lot of disrupted sleep the past few weeks. 

Anyhow its great to come on here and have a resource like this and read other peoples stories. My advice as much for others as much as for myself is to keep on going and don't get frustrated if you reach a milestone and think I still don't feel great just because other people mention its been life changing. Everyone quit is different and just know that if you still with it good things will come in their own time. Peace

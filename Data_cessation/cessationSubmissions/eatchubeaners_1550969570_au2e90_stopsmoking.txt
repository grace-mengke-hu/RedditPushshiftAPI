Ill never smoke again

I'm 26 years old, and it's been 7 months now smoke free.

I started when I was about 15 and after almost 200 attempts at quitting I finally said I'm done. I figured, the only way to do it was making a promise to myself:

"If I ever have another cigarette, I'll never attempt to quit again. I'm in it for life, no questions asked."

This seems ridiculous, but I was so damn tired with quitting I just can't bother trying it anymore. One last try, one first promise. The thought of smoking a cigarette every single hour, every single day, every week, I just can't do that. I'd give up everything by taking that one puff, my whole life down the drain. 

Here's to the rest of my life smoke free.

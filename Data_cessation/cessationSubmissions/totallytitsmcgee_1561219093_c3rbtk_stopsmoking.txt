Almost 2 months in and cravings have returned with a vengeance, WTF

I have been so close these past few days to the point that I’ve almost asked a stranger for a smoke a few times and thought ‘it’ll just be one’. After the first week up until now it didn’t bother me at all now I’m back to thinking about it pretty often. The only thing that I think may have triggered it is that I’ve been focusing on healthy eating so currently I literally have no vices or addictions on the go. Anyway I’m sure I’ll be fine but felt like getting it off my chest and wondering if anyone else has had random cravings?

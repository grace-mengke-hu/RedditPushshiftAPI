3 days in but ...

I've been using the patch for the last two months i would wear the patch all day at work until 5pm then come home take it off and have 2 or 3 cigs as my partner smokes ..now i'm really  determined to fully quit i told she needs to quit or least not smoke around me or have them lying around which she has agreed to in order to help me achieve my goal .. last night i took off the patch around 9pm had a shower then had a bowl of cereal and after the cravings staring to kick in bad ...i dont know if i can quit without wearing the patches everyday but as long as i wear them im still putting nicotine into my body what should i do

Looking to quit my snus use and need some tips

Had a cold sore pop up on my cheek today where I usually put my pouch that's a bit painful as i have rarely had this happen if ever and just said to myself..I don't want this anymore and risk anything. Been using Snus now for about 2.5 years. I go through maybe 3-4 tins a week of it ( This is the past year..before that was maybe 1 tin a week) and not sure if that's a lot or not but lately as in the last 6 months i've been constantly using it.

When I don't have it for a day or two i get very moody and just feel like crap. Would a patch be the best bet? I don't want to just go cold turkey because at least based on the days I don't do it...i get ancy, headaches, dizzy ect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I notice the patches range in MGs from my research and the #1 step of 21MG seems like a lot and was thinking with using #2 or #3 with just 7 mgs.

Thoughts?

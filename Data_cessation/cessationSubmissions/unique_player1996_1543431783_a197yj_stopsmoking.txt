Did any quitter notice change in height after quitting cigarettes ?

I am 22m Have been smoking on an average 3 cigs per day since i was 19. I started pretty late so i thought i have reached my full height so i would not loose anything. However i have grown around 1 cm taller since 2015. I am really worried if i was not a smoker i would have been much taller ? I have quit ciggarettes since 3 weeks now. Will i reach my potential height ?

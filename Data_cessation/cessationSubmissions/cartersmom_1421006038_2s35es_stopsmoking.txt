Preparing to give in after 11 days and feeling shitty

after some marital arguments im feeling pretty worn down,ive done amazing to get this far and at my suggestion too, hubby finding it easy but I'm not and now he's accusing me of wanting to smoke now all I can think of is smoking 
ive not even come close to a ciggie ive stayed away from temptation but now I feel like he's setting the ball rolling treating me like a child making me want to be defiant to show him he doesn't make my decisions for me, even as im writing this I feel silly as smoking is not the answer and im not even feeling tempted in all honesty but his words have hurt me and the only thing to hurt him would be also hurting me gosh I just can't win 
feeling a little lost and alone right now 
maybe I need to stay an ex smoker and just re think the marriage and my life :( sorry for the rant guys ive been doing so well and this has just ruined my logical thinking tonight

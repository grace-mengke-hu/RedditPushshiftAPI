Decided to quit an hour ago

After smoking since I was 17, I've decided to finally quit. I'm excited to prove to myself that I'm able to follow through with something like this for once, I've told all of my friends, family, and my girlfriend so they can hold me accountable, plus I've decided to use my savings from not buying cigarettes to buy a PS4 so I can play Arkham Knight when it comes out. If there's anything in the world that would get me to quit smoking, it's Batman.

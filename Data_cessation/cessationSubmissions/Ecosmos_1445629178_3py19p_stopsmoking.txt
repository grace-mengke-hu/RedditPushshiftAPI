Anyone having experience with nicotine gum related salivation problem...please help

Hi
     I'm happily completing day five without a puff...first two days used nicotine patch...for last three days using nicotine gum once a while. But as before, this time too I'm having problem with nicotine gum. I salivate a lot right from the start while using gum. I know this is its side effect but for me it is too much to hold in mouth and I've to go to washroom to get rid of saliva every 3-5 minutes. Anyone having some knowledge how to reduce this thing. It happens even if I chew the gum slowly. In these 5 days whenever, I thought of having fag (all old cues from my brain for having just one), I remembered someone (thanks to him/her as I forgot the name) who said no matter what this voice tells you, ITS ALWAYS WRONG. I totally believed that and forget the voice next moment. 
Thank you all

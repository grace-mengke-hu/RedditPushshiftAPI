100 DAYS BABY!! WOOOOOO!!

A little over 100 days since I quit cold turkey. Suffered a lot of pain through the beginning but made it through. I've reached a healthy weight. I can smell things now. Everything's great!  
I even convinced a work colleague to quit smoking since he recently had a kid. Guy has been clean for 10 days now.  
Anytime someone asks me how I quote [this](https://youtu.be/R2_Mn-qRKjA) from Bojack Horseman  
TL;DW "It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you got to do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier."

The break room stunk of cigarettes so bad today from someoneâ€™s jacket..

And it WASNT  mine!! ðŸ¤™ Iâ€™m closing in on 4 months here and found myself so proud today that I donâ€™t smoke anymore. I used to keep febreeze in my car just so I could spray my jackets. Iâ€™ve hit some milestones and Iâ€™ve pat myself on the back plenty but today could have been a trophy. 

If youâ€™re in your early hours/days/weeks and so on.. stick with it youâ€™re already doing so great. Take every single milestone with pride. Get through your discouraging moments in stride because they will pass just like the cravings do. Be patient with yourself, and be kind to yourself because your body and mind are going to heal.

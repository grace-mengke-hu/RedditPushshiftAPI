Here we go again.

So since I started smoking trees I sparked up my ciggs. The two are hand in hand for me. I tried quitting 4 times in the past two months, the longest I went was about six hours. But don't get me wrong, I have been able to go long stretches. I went 150 days cold turkey, as well as ninety something, and then 50 something once too. iOS8 comes out Wednesday, and I want to use that health app. I want to distract myself with it and focus on going to the gym again, jogging, and I'm just going to totally quit cold turkey.

Any advice?

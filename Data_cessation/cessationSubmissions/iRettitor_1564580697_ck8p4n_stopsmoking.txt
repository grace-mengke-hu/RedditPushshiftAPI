Has anyone successfully stopped smoking through just not "having any access" to cigarettes?

In the past ive often really struggled with quitting just because it was "so easy" to just get some. Like within even the first few days my brain/addiction would make me go to the nearest place where i could buy/get a pack. Now i was thinking, has anyone successfully quit just by not being "able" to buy/get any? Like i was thinking of e.g. i used to do long multi-day hikes back when i wasnt smoking. Like sometimes 6-7 days through the mountains. If i did a hike like that,and just didnt pack any cigarettes, and obvsly wouldnt have any possibility to obtain any cigarettes while being in the nature, would you think it would be easier to get away from smoking that way? Like just imagine being stranded on an island for a month where theres no cigarettes. Do you think it would help you quit?

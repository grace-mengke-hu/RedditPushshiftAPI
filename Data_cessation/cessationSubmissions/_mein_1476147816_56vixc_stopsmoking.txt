I've been smoking since I was eleven

Genuinely I've been smoking since I was 11, and my parents bought me cigarettes since I was 13. I quit when I was 15 and began having panic attacks but started again when I was 16, so I've been smoking longer than I've been alive.

I quit on Thursday and haven't smoked since then for the longest time in a decade (I'm 25 now), but today it's gotten incredibly hard. Today is the best I've felt in a long time and I think my mind is "you feel good, you can have one it's fiiiiiiiiiine!". I even smelled an old tobacco packet and it smelt so good. I don't plan on smoking now, even though I desperately want to, I just had to write my own desperation out. I'm used to smoking and this is harder than I remember.

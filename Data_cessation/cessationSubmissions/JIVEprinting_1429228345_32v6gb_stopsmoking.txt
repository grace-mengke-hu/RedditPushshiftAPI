Saw an old friend today who'd quit.

well, "friend" is a stretch.  He was my boss at my first job.  Owns a transmission shop, and I worked there when I was 15.



Now, it's fifteen years later.  He looks younger than he did then!  I knew right away.  "You quit smoking!" I said, not even having to ask.  He did!  He quit five years ago, and wishes he never started.

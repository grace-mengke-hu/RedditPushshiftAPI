So easy and so difficult

Free since Oct 2nd (2 weeks), I am surprisingly ok even after 25 years of 1 p/day smoking.... using the Headspace App, Smoke Free App, Allan Carr (no NRTs). Can't wait for all cravings to leave (now just short ones, 2-3/day).... it's weird, somehow it feels like the easiest AND the hardest thing to do. You all are awesome, yay to no more cigarettes ever!

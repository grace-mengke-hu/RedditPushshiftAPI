One Month and Moving Forward

Well, somehow I did it. I made my way through a month without tobacco.
For myself, I credit my continued success with properly preparing myself mentally, having not only this sub to lean on, but a good support system of friends and loved ones.

Further strengthened by watching my stats on my apps, an understanding why I want my slavery to tobacco to end, how it will improve my life and health, save me money and change my self confidence and presentation to others.

It is still not easy, but it is easier than I ever imagined it would be. Easier than any other time I attempted to quit. I still wake up most mornings with an expectation that my first move will be having a cigarette. A few deep breaths reminds me of how much progress I still need to make and not having cigarettes is the only way my breathing can improve. 

It is hard, but it can only be impossible is you believe it is. Keep up the good work of trying and return here to get support and support others!

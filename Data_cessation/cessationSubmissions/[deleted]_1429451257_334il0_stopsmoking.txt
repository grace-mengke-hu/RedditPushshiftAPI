2 days in - no withdrawal signs.

I've been wanting to quit for a while now but I've never found the will to do it until 2 days ago when I decided that I was done. I've been smoking for over 7-8 years, and never gone one day without My 11-13 red Marlboro cigarettes (on normal days). The strange thing is that I am two days in, and it's so much easier than I expected. No withdrawal signs so far, no craving, nothing, just the occasional cues that remind me of smoking followed by the realisation that I've quit since, which I find really strange. Will my withdrawal signs peak out of the blue in the next days or am I so convinced that my body just agrees with my mind? I do chew a couple of nicotine gums a day just to make the process easier, but again, no cravings, no headaches or anxiety. Has anyone of you experienced something similar?

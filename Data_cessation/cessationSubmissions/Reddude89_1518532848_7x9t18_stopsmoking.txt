3 weeks in

So I haven't been smoking for about 3 weeks and some change, but right now I'm feeling my weakest. I was listening to some music, then my heart started pounding and I think it was an anxiety attack. I don't really know. I have depression, and cigarettes have always been a great way to keep me motivated and slightly happy. Now it seems like there's really nothing, I've been chasing a high from super foods, exercise, anything really. Nothing is working. Is it just a bad day? I know it will pass, but my mind says smoke, because it's really all the same no matter what you do. How can I out logic myself?

Proud of myself

Today for the first time i felt what real craving is since i stopped. Today was the first stressful exam in recent past. It was 3hrs long and as soon as i left the hall all of a sudden the urge hits me hard. It was a long way to my home from the exam center. So enough opportunity for taking a drag. What made it worse was i was getting anxious waiting for transport as it is festive season transports were filled up and were not stopping for us. The addict in me who was long gone, started to become increasingly active. I dont know why but it was the worst case in these 2months. All along the way it made me very anxious and crave for just a little drag but somehow magically i resisted it. The reason why this is important for me is that it was too easy for me to relapse. In those days i would definitely have smoked a cigarette and i cant think of not smoking one. But this time i was succesful to resist. Guys out there who are trying to stop please learn from this, that anyone can get rid of this habit. A long way to go before i forget what craving is. Wish me luck.

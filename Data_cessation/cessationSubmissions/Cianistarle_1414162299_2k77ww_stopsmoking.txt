Six days. Where has my motivation gone?

For some reason, today has been the hardest day. I don't know if I am going to make it guys.

I'm really enjoying being able to breathe and stuff. I am really proud and really happy about how I feel.

I just feel like if I could just have a few today, then somehow everything will be ok. WHY? This makes no sense. Nothing will be better if i smoke.

I can't do this for months on end, i really can't.

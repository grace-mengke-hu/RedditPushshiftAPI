Tried it a couple of times before, but now I am determined.

Hi Guys, 

Reset my badge today, for the last time. I want to be able to smell and taste things again, to be able to spend a day without constant coughing and to be in good health for my family. I tried it once with the lozenges, but decided this time it's cold turkey for me! Thanks for all the support and encouragement that I am sure I will be looking to you guys for in the coming weeks!

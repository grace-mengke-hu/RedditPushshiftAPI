Day 3. Didn't want anything to do with my gf

Usually I'm the one making the initiative for sex, but today my girl started making moves. Laying next to me naked, kissing me... Normally that would be great, but now I felt disgusted. Simply...disgusted. I didn't have an ounce of desire. She is quite hot, but at this moment she looked like a pile of dead meat. I tried to gain some interest but nothing helped.

Does anyone get the same when quitting? Life seems pretty pointless now, even without this sexual dysfunction thing, all though I know it will be just as pointless if I keep smoking.

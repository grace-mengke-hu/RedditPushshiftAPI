Why I'm quitting

There is one big reason that I'm quitting smoking.

My mood. I find my moods to be extremely different when I'm smoking than when I'm not. Not just my moods but my actions, my words.

I will lose the love of my life.

I will lose my relationship with my mother.

I will smell so damn bad that people won't want to talk to me.

I recently read a study that proved smokers have worse moods between cigarettes than non-smokers. I started testing it myself and definitely believe it.

Day one. Here we go again. I went all of January without one, I can do it again. This time, for good.

*It is worth it. Smoking is a waste of money. Smoking will likely kill you. You smell like shit to non-smokers after having one. Your teeth will get brighter. Your moods will improve. You do not need cigarettes to survive. You'll survive longer without them.*

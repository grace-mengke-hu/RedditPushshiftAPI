[Help] I'm at 9 days and i have extreme throat pain and coughing up brown/yellow cough like a vending machine.

Brown/Yellow mucus i mean. Should i seek medical help or is that normal ? I have also bought a pack of nicotine gums today and haven't opened that yet. I wonder if using it will make my progress worse ?

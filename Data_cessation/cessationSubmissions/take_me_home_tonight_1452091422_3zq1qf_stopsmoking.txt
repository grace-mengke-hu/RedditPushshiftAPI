Apparently I'm more addicted than I thought.

I always said that I'm not physically addicted to smoking, because I can go several days without it. I don't smoke in the mornings or all day at work so I figured this would be super easy. 

Last night was HARD. The feeling did eventually pass thank goodness. I think the hardest part was actually wanting to smoke and not being able to (versus going several days where I just don't think about it but it's still an option). I think for me this is going to be a big challenge mentally before it gets easier.

BUT! I made it, and now on to day two!!

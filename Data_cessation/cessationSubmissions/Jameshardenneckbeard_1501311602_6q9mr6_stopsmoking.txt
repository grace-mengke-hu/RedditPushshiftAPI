What's the best way to quit using nicotine patches?

So I've been smoking cigarettes pretty much everyday day for 7 years. I've stopped several times for like a month or two but during that time I would continue to smoke tobacco mixed with weed (spliffs, mole bowls, blunts, etc.) I want to kick the tobacco habit while I'm sill young, but Im still going to smoke weed. How should I go about the nicotine patches i.e. what dosage should I start out on, when should I lower the dosage, and how long do I wear them for?

Question regarding long-term lung cancer risk

So, obviously, one of the biggest benefits to quitting is lowering risk of cancer. My question is:


Almost anywhere you read info on the subject they say it takes 10 years to get your lung cancer risk to half that of a smoker. But, to me, that seems extreme and unlikely in all cases...


i was a smoker for 5 years, I started when I was 18 and I'm now 23 and a month off the stuff. I smoked anywhere from 10-20 cigarettes a day, seldom ever going over 1-pack/day. Am I really looking at 10 years to only get down to half odds? Or are there different odds for me since i quit young?

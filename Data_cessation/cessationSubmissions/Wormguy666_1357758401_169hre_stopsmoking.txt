1 MONTH-3 MONTHS (COMING SOON)

**NOTE:** This is the 2nd installment of my NUSU Guide to Quitting Smoking. If you’re still within the first 2 weeks of your journey, please refer to my first guide located [HERE]( http://redd.it/167yfh). 
Now, where were we? Oh yes, the 2nd installment. Well guys & gals congratulations! You’ve officially been smoke free for at least 7 days (That’s 168 hours, 10,080 minutes, um…you get the idea)! How do you feel, awesome? Probably not, I mean maybe a little, but who are you kidding?  You still have cravings, you’re still edgy, and life isn’t fantastic…yet. Here’s the good news though, it’s about to get better, and soon. I’m not going to lie though; it’s going to take some extra work on your part in order to overcome some of the next obstacles you’ll be facing. But don’t fret; the things you’re going to want to do won’t be hard to do, just make sure you do them without fail.

**Part III – Purgatory in Week 2-4**

*Yawn* So, you bored yet? If you did what I said in the previous guide and started changing around your daily habits (i.e. avoiding smoking areas on lunch breaks, keeping yourself busy on your downtime, etc), then you probably are. However, if you didn’t follow my advice (Many of you won’t, it’s ok, I didn’t either), you’re probably not too bored, but you’re on the cusp cracking. **LISTEN PEOPLE**, you need to do what I said and remove yourself from the source of your addiction. It’s bad enough that you have to battle this stuff mentally, and having it shoved in your face by your peers, smelling it, even the 2nd hand will make you lose your mind. RUN AWAY! Your friends will understand. Don’t worry though; it’s only temporary (like 1 month). Anyways, assuming you listened to me then this is what you should expect/do during Week 2-4:

1. Coughing up green/black goblins – I know, it’s gross, but hey it’s a reality check. This is about the time you start coughing up all the mucus/tar that’s been hanging out in your lungs since you started smoking. Water/Exercise will speed up this process

2. Return of the Libido – Oh yeah buddy! Sex drive starts to come back because your blood flow has improved.   If it hasn’t yet, it will soon. 

3. Boredom /Still depressed–I said earlier, if you did what I suggested then you probably will be bored, but hey this is normal. Remember, you didn’t change your daily routines because it seemed like fun; you changed it to better your life. This is where you should really consider a hobby (i.e. video games, knitting, exercise, etc). Distraction truly is the key here, do not allow yourself to linger or you’ll relapse. 

4. Mixed Signals – This one is tricky because it’s sneakier then you think. The thought of smoking will still seem appealing to you, but if you’re unlucky enough to smell someone who just had a cigarette, you might think to yourself “Holy crap, did I really smell like that?” If you really need some motivation, just ask for them to breathe on you and see how long it takes for you to vomit . The biggest eye opener for me was when I went to the casino. When I first walked in I went “Oh shit…” everyone and their mom was smoking! I felt like I was screwed, until I closed my eyes. Once my eyes were closed, I started smelling the wretched funk of cigarettes and realized how gross it was, especially once I walked back outside and got fresh air. 

**My Part III Secret Weapon? Gum (Not nicorette) and Exercise.** I know the “gum” thing is overplayed, but the oral cravings for me were difficult to break. The gum definitely didn’t “satisfy” me, but it helped me cope and kept me busy in between mealtimes and during work. Besides, having minty breath is kind of nice after a while, and you may even get addicted to having a clean mouth which…isn’t so bad.
 
**Part IV – It’s a trap! Week 4-1 Month**

You all still with me? Really? Wow, you must really want to quit. Like Randy Jackson I have to say you must be “In it to win it!” (Ok, that was cheese). You’re confidence is even probably starting to grow, which is awesome. **BUT BEWARE!** These next 2 weeks are what I call the **“Tiger Traps”**. This is really going to be the point where you show yourself what you’re made of.  Luckily, I’ve compiled a few things you can expect and also want to do in order to make this phase easier:

1. Out of sight, out of mind – Like getting over an ex, one of the most effective ways to get over it is to get rid of anything that reminds you of the painful memory. This means, throwing away your ashtrays (I don’t care if your kid made it for you in sculpture class, it’s disgusting), lighters (Yes, even the damn Zippos/Torches that you probably never refilled), empty packs, etc. The quicker you get it out of your house/car the easier it will be to forget you were ever a smoker. 

2. Start a savings account – This is the time where any extra encouragement/motivation is going to be incredibly beneficial for you. You might as well start putting away money that you normally spend on cigarettes. Let’s not kid ourselves, smokes these days cost money (Where I live packs are up to about $7). You’ll be blown away by how much money you’ve saved in as little as one month.  Use that money to buy something awesome for yourself maybe at your 6 month or 1 year mark. 

3. No **”Victory”** cigarettes! – Really? You’ve made it all the way to one whole month and you’re ready to screw it all up? Having a “victory” cigarette to celebrate the fact that you quit smoking, makes about as much sense as  a happy couple divorcing on their anniversary. Look, I made this mistake, so allow me to spoil you with the how the event went down: 

**I grabbed the smoke out of my buddy’s hand, it was unlit, and man was I amped. The unlit cig in my mouth felt like heaven, it felt like I was hugging an old friend; it almost brought me to tears. Then I lit it, ‘oh sweet jebus let me feel the sweet embrace of the inhale’. Then….*COUGH* *COUGH* (chest pain) *COUGH*! ‘Fuck, it burns! Holy crap, why doesn’t this feel as good as it used to?’ Well news flash Matt (Yes, that’s my name), for the past month your lungs have been cleaning themselves out, and are now sensitive to all the crap you just tried to shove back down there. Also, my taste buds had returned in full force so now I taste the truth, and I can smell what everyone else does. The only result from this mistake was physical anguish and a whole lot of mental guilt knowing that I essentially destroyed everything that I worked for. Don’t be stupid guys. Victory cigarettes don’t exist.**

**My part IV secret weapon? I cleaned my house and car.** Seriously, after getting rid of all the crap that reminded me of smoking, and then also getting a detail in my car, my confidence level started growing big time. You’ll actually start feeling more like one of those “normal” people who don’t smoke. It’ll also put the pressure on you to not screw up what you worked so hard to clean up. 
I hope you all enjoyed the 2nd installment. I appreciate any feedback and suggestions you can provide. Assuming this also receives a good response, I’ll be happy to write the 3rd installment. Keep fighting on!

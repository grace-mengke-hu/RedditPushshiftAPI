e-cigs and flying

I recently came back from a trip. On the way to my destination, towards the end of the 4 hour flight, I saw out of the corner of my eye a small cloud of what seemed to be smoke. When I turned to the woman on my left, I see her look down and saw the e-cig in her hand. She noticed that I noticed the vapour - I didn't say anything, and she didn't take another puff.

She did keep the e-cig in her hand, probably desperate for the moment she could get some nicotine in her. One of the flight attendants saw it when we landed and were waiting for the doors to open to deplane and I heard her tell the woman that it's strictly prohibited and that she even shouldn't have been allowed to pass security with it.

It surprised me and made me thankful (again!) for not being dependent on nicotine any longer. I ran across this article just now in my investigating whether this was common practice: http://www.businessinsider.com/you-cant-smoke-e-cigarettes-in-planes-2013-2

It also struck me to see an e-cig user outside and office building in sub zero weather. It is really not as socially acceptable as it's made out to be.

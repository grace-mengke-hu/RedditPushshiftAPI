Just over 4 months and I feel like I've hit a wall

I have been doing so well with this non-smoking journey... Up until recently. I have found myself feeling this super wave of depression and frustration out of nowhere. I have lost damned near all of my patience.... I'm angry... I'm feeling lost. I still don't miss the act of smoking and I still don't regret my quit.  I just can't seem to get ahold of my emotions and My mind keeps trying to trick me into thinking that a smoke would fix it. I KNOW it won't. If anything it would make my heart race even more, increase my anxiety, and even make me feel more depressed because I would feel like a failure. I do not want to fail. I am fighting within myself to prevent it. I will not buy or bum cigarettes. I will not smoke. 
Has anyone else hit 4 months and felt anything like this?

Does laser treatment work..?

I fuckin hate smoking. I hate that this stupid thing controls me. I wanna really commit to quitting and I'm gonna need other shit than cold turkey. I know that chantix (dunno how it's spelt) can have nightmares as a side effect and I'm not interested in that haha. I know it's my own fault for quitting but I'm wondering about other options such as laser treatment. Any thoughts on what would be a good course of action?

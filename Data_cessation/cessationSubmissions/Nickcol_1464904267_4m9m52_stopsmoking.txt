Hello everyone, just wanted to meet other quitters and help someone who wants to be one.

Hey everyone. This is the first time I write something on this subreddit. The name's Nick. I've been a quitter for a little more than a year, and being a very heavy smoker (50+ cigarettes a day) and very young, I just wanted to help someone who, like I used to, doesn't really think it's possible to quit. So... just wanted to say hi!

P.S. Sorry if my English is not perfect. I'm Italian.

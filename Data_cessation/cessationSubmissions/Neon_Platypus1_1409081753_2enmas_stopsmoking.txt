I relapsed today... But it was a good experience

So I was in between classes and, being the apparent fiend I am, asked a friend for a cigarette. We smoked together, and I realized that, even after 3 days smoke-free, it didn't appeal to me as much. And the guilt of relapsing made me enjoy it less. It wasn't like I didn't like it, but it didn't make me buy a pack or want another. 

Just thought I should share that with you guys, especially the newly initiated. After the first several days, it gets easier, even when you give in.

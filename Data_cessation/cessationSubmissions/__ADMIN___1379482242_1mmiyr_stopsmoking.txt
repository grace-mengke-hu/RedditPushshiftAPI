I hope this works out, 06:00 18/09/2013 BST quitting smoking.

I have this thing on my tonsil which appeared yesterday, 

not sure what it is and whilst doing an online diagnosis i noticed it could be anything between cancer and tonsillitis, i am hoping the latter and took some anti biotics. 

I haven't really had a health problem in months, if not over a year now and had me thinking, Smoking over a pack a day sometimes while i couldn't even stand to be near smokers before.


Still young (birthday coming up next month and will be 22), 

i want to quit, always said later. But i'v been more of a "i'l do it later" person for the past year and this has to end now.


i run out of breath while i speak, confidence drop after i smoke and try to speak face to face with someone, having anxiety when my cravings kick in I just can't really smoke this anymore. 


**TLDR; i'm blabbering about my thoughts right now and just decided to quit smoking, not really worth much a read i'm tired going to bed goodnight/morning**

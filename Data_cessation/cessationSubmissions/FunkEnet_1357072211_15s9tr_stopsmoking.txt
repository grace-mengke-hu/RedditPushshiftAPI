5k Run! *#$% Yeah!

Actually over a mile over a 5k, 4.25 miles. Last year I was running as a smoker because I thought it might counter some of the damage I was doing to my body, and I couldn't get past 2 miles and that was at 11 min/mile.

After only a month of not smoking I have doubled my distance and did it at 9:30 min/mile. I could have gone longer but it is only 9F outside and my beard was frozen.

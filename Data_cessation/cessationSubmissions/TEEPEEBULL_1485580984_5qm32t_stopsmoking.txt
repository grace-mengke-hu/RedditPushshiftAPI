Reasons to Quit have nothing to do with your reasons to smoke (link to Carr video)

Think about it:
Smoking decreases your risk of cancer: Oh , thanks- because I was smoking in order to prevent cancer, so now I'll stop.

Smoking causes heart disease: Didn't realize that, but, knowing that will now certainly result in my quitting.

Etc....

Allen Carr's book made me see the light! The reasons we want to quit aren't effective at helping us, it's only when we realize that the ONLY reason we smoke- is because we're smokers! 
Watch it, and see what that means, because it's not easy to wrap your head around it at first.

We smoke due to addiction to nicotine. We only "need" a cigarette because we had one previously. Get it.?

Please watch the vid all the way- a 100 times, as I have and it all makes sense!

And then you can see it- nicotine is not the "friend" or "crutch" or "tool" or "support" we thought it was after all. 

It's a freaking PARASITE that exists at our expense and has fooled us into that supporting it, is to our benefit! Crazy - but- take- a- look- any-way.

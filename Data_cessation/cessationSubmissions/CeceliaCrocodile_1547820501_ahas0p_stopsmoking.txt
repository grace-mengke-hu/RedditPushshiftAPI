4000 cigarettes not smoked

I've just realized how huge this number is. And it's only 4000 out of the 10000 I would have smoked during a whole year. Don't count money or packs because it's easy to lose track. Do a simple calculation of how many times you'd poison yourself during a year, I'm sure you'll be freaked out. 

I haven't looked back a single time. My coughing has stopped, my voice is back, I don't run out of breath while climbing the stairs, I no longer feel disgusted by my smelly hands, breath, and clothes. But most importantly, I'm fully in control of myself.

Am I the only one who didn't feel the "little things" change after stopping smoking?

Hey there, just curious here.

Smoke for 15 years, 1-2 packs a day. Managed to stop for 2 years cold turkey, then relapsed, then after a few months switched to personal vaporisers and I haven't had a cigarette in 20 months.

The things that confuse me is that ex-smokers always talk about how they'd cough up mucus and tar in the mornings which stop after quitting, how better foods taste, how better their sense of smell is. I never experienced any of those. During my time smoking, I didn't have problems with coughing or mucus, quitting didn't change anything in that sense. The food tasted the same it always tasted (delicious) and my sense of smell didn't change one bit. Most of the stuff ex-smokers are talking about feels very alien to me.

Anyone on the same boat?

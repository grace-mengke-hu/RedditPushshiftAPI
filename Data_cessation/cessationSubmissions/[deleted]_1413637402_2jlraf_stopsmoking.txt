incredible, i can't believe i'm winning!

finally.

quitting is making me realize i have some serious anger issues to deal with. i need to start exercising and meditating more, which is fine, because i'm already meditating and doing breathing exercises a lot.

i cut off going to my favorite bar but am still enjoying beers in private / small group scenarios where i know i won't be tempted to overdrink (like at parties, etc.)

any tips from the long-term winners for remaining vigilant?

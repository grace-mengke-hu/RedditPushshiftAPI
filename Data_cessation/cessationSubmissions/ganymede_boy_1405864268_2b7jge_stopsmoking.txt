900 days :)

Repeating my 300 day post below since many of those tips were so helpful to me. Stay strong, fellow freedom fighters!

My top tips:

Set a quit date 4 weeks out, and reduce smoking till that date (I halved my smoking each week leading to the quit date).

Tell friends & family.

Have a quit buddy (someone who has quit around the time you will)

First month or 2: keep finger foods around (healthy ones are best) like carrot sticks or pretzel sticks. For bad cravings, try brushing your teeth or using mouthwash.

Pick up a new hobby or expand on one you've been neglecting.

Use an App. "QuitNow" and others are good options.

Lastly - accept that the process is not an easy one, and that it often takes more than one try to get quitting "right". Challenge yourself to be stronger than most by quitting and setting an example for others to follow.

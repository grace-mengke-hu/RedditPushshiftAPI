Relating everything to smoking

So, I’m just starting to quit, but I am having trouble with the cravings. I relate some of the most beloved things in my life to smoking. For instance, I love love love jazz music. However, I’m afraid I’ll never be able to listen to a single song without desperately craving a cigarette. Same goes for coffee, traveling, alcohol, reading, and anxiety. It’s like smoking had become a part of my personality. Has anyone had this trouble? If so, how do you get through it? And for the love of goodness, please tell me it gets better. 

This whole thread has really helped. Thanks everyone!

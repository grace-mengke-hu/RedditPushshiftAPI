Please help me cut out all my rationalisations for continuing

Every time I want to stop, one or more of these arguments kicks in and makes me convince myself to keep going. Can you please tell me why these are stupid? Sorry if I repeat myself sometimes.


* Because I'm using spray instead of smoking, studies (?) show there's nothing bad that's going to happen and that NRT is safe
* If there are no negatives to continue using but negatives in stopping (like withdrawal) it means you should continue using
* Doesn't nicotine sometimes have a neuroprotective effect? Don't some studies say that nicotine protects against things like dementia? I don't really want to have dementia and have basically convinced myself I'll get dementia if I quit
* Doesn't nicotine help with the immune system? I'm sick all the time so what if it's actually helping some way? I've got Lyme disease and I have convinced myself that nicotine is helping me get better, that it's fixing my nerves and bloodflow and immune system
* I have chronic anxiety but nicotine helps with that. What if I become an anxious wreck unable to function and nobody likes me anymore?
* It feels really good to use and not using feels really bad (????) so I guess please remind me why nicotine is the worst and how you can be better without it.


Thanks guys, this is really hard and I'm at the end of my tether so I appreciate any answers at all.

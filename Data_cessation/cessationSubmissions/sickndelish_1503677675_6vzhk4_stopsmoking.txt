Day 8, feeling GREAT!

I'm 29 now and started smoking when I was 14. I've tried to quit many, many times. I usually give it a serious go once or twice a year. The longest I've ever made it was 8 months back in 2008. I can't believe that was almost 10 years ago!

About three months ago, I started a daily meditation practice, missing only two days in that time. The benefits have definitely been noticeable: I'm happier, calmer, and less stressed. I believe my concentration has improved as well. 

As I've become a bit more mindful in my daily life, my desire to live smoke-free has increased. Last Thursday, I decided to give quitting another go. There have been a few difficult moments in the first week, but overall it hasn't been THAT hard.

Mindfulness techniques have allowed me to deal with the cravings without getting too worked up about them. I believe that attitude is truly everything. It has helped enormously to accept cravings when they arrive and explore them with a sense of curiosity. 

It has also helped to think of the adjustment phase of quitting in terms of neural activity in the brain. Instead of getting bummed that a craving has arrived after an easy hour or two, I just acknowledge that I need to work on rewiring some connections in my brain. 

After just a week of abstinence, I'm beginning to feel very positive, almost euphoric, even. I know that I have more work to do, but I believe that I will prevail if I keep my attitude in check and keep doing what I'm doing!

If you're in the first few days and are still feeling like shit, please understand that with the right attitude, this temporary discomfort will soon be replaced by feelings of pride, empowerment, freedom, and even joy!

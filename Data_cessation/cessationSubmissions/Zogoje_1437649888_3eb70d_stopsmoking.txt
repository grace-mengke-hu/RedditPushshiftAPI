I stopped smoking 10 days ago!

Before I start in want to point out that I'm sorry for my sloppy english (I'm working on that :) ) but I feel I need to share my thoughts.
As I already wrote in the title, I stopped smoking 10 days ago. The first few days were exhausting. In every free minute, I HAD to think about cigarettes. 
Lurking on reddit helped barely but then I found this subreddit. I started reading through a lot posts of people having the same withdrawal symptoms as I had. Seeing all those people fighting against these cravings and helping each other, helped to deal with the inner yearning for a cigarette.
8 days later it's still hard to resist the wish for a cigarette but it's getting better day by day and I feel this one was my last quit!
 
So I just wanted to say **thank you** to everyone! You're doing a great job!

If you don't want to smoke, then don't.

Quitting is easy. Deciding, however, to stop smoking is hard as nails.
I've said this for over a year now, and it holds a strong truth for me.
I made and ignorant decision in my youth to smoke cigarettes. I decided as an adult to stop. I made an adult decision, and as an adult, I obligated myself to hold true to my promise to myself. I smoked for 13 years and I no longer have any desire to ingest cigarette smoke of any sort. I'm unsubscribing from this subreddit because I don't make any contribution and I need no support. I say this with with great self assurance: "You're problems are your own, deal with them with the strength and confidence you have within yourself. Because the decision is yours alone."

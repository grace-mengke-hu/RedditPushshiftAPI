40 day break.

So I'm a 19 year old guy that has started to really get into smoking lately. It has become an unhealthy coping mechanism for me when i feel down and I feel like it's starting to become an addiction or at least a very unhealthy habit.

I don't know if I plan on quitting forever, but I do know that I need to take at least a 40 day break from cigarettes before this shit gains anymore power over me.

So I'm just posting this to hold myself accountable. If I do end up smoking again in these 40 days I will post about it here.

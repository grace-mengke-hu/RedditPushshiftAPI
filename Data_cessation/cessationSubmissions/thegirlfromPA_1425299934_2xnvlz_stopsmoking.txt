Today is my day. I have been a 30 year smoker and have many quit attempts under my belt. This time I have to make it a forever quit. Tired of the wasted money, time and health. Tired of having a crutch. Tired of knowing smoking makes me feel like shit. I will be strong and I will beat this. Any suggestions for getting past this first hard few days welcome. I need all the help and encouragement I can get. Thank you.

It's been 13 days since my last cigarette...and my cravings are getting weirder and weirder.

I don't think I've ever wanted and NOT wanted something so badly and confusingly before in my life. I remember how gross and nasty I felt after every smoke break (especially after not smoking for a while). But I also remember the feeling of exhaling, and how relaxing it was to just take a few minutes outside.
I keep reminding myself that I only enjoy the first puff until it starts tasting horrible. 

Such a conflict.
Yet I'm staying strong.

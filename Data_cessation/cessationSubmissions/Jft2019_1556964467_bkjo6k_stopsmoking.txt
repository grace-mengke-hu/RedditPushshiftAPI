Iâ€™m struggling ðŸ˜¢

Hey! First post here as my app said that reading posts from others will help in my quit smoking journey! 

Unfortunately for me Allan Carrâ€™s book didnâ€™t work for me ðŸ˜” Iâ€™d read some posts from people who were in the same situation and said that when they went to the seminars they could do it! Sadly for me that didnâ€™t really work either! Maybe it was me.. maybe I wasnâ€™t in the right headspace at the time! Or maybe I just didnâ€™t really force my self to believe that I could do it

However I am now on patches and an inhilator I am now on day 5 and although Iâ€™m on the patches I still canâ€™t really believe Iâ€™ve made it this far!!! I am really proud! But at the same time Iâ€™m finding it very difficult! 

I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m trying to achieve with this post. Perhaps it helps just writing something! 

But if anyone does have any little tips that may be able to help Iâ€™d really love that! 

Thank you! And well done to everyone ðŸ¤—

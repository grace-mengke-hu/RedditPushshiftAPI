Day 24!

I made it past three weeks!

The first week was kinda infuriating. The urges to smoke about drove me crazy, and every hour or two, I would get fidgety because I would feel the need to go outside...

But I got over it. I drink a lot of water now, as it helps keep my belly full, and if I am taking a drink every so often, it keeps my hands and mouth occupied.

I also picked up the Game of Thrones books on Amazon and have been reading them non-stop. I'm currently on book 4. It helps keep me interested in something, instead of looking at the clock, and it makes me want to stay comfy on the couch and not think about going out for a smoke.

I did have a dream that I smoked last night and woke up in a panic, but I was relieved that it was only a dream.

Saturday will be 1 month for me. I'm excited. Thanks to everyone who posts here for the inspiration.

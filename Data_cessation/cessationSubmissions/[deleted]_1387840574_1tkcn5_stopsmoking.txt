So long so many times I've tried to stop help me

Hello there I have been smoking for 9 years I'm 21 years old and have went from a qtr pack to 3 packs a day to now I'm at a half pack a day. I have tried to stop smoking with help of everything patch, gum, electric cigarette, switching brands doing a clinic, I even switched to dip which turned into me smoking with a lip in. I don't want to smoke anymore yet I can't stop and every time I think about quiting I smoke more then usual. I need help people!

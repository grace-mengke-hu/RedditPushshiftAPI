It's going to get easier, right? RIGHT?!

I am working on Day 6 - I work in finance so month/quarter/year end is in full swing and high stress.  Like others, I am not sleeping, and the last 2 days have been rough.

I tried reading the Alan Carr book, but all the talk of smoking makes me REALLY start to lose my mind, so I'm not sure I can finish it without relapsing.  

This is going to get easier, right?  I know Day 3 seems to be a big deal to some, but I'm struggling way more yesterday and today than I was on Day 3.  :(

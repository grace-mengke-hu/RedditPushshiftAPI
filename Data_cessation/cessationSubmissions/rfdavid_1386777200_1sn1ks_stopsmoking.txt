Feel like bragging a little

I am nearing week 3 and never felt better!  I have been changing everything in my life for the better in the last 20 days.  For me, every change I have made has distracted me from my old nasty habit.  Here is what I have done so far:

* completed up to W2D2 of C25k
* started the 100 pushups challenge
* rearranged the furniture in many of the rooms in my house as well as my office
* replaced Doritos with salad and coffee with green tea
* BECAME A NON-SMOKER!!!

All of these things just in the last 20 days and my only regret is that I didn't do this 10 years ago.  I look at all of the people posting here at day 1 of quitting and hope they can make it just as far as me.  I see the people with years of non-smoking beside their name and can't wait to get where they are.  

This post probably sounds pretty cocky and maybe it is, but I am so JACKED UP I could literally high-five the sun right now.  I have leaned on this subreddit for support almost daily since my journey began and am very thankful.  I hope one person reads this and says "if this dude can pull it off, I can too"

Day 2 - Feeling good!

Hi all,

I made it through last nights 'friend's birthday' really well surprisingly.  I had a bit of a rubbish afternoon yesterday, with a relative being a complete idiot basically, and with not smoking, really made me not want to go out for my friends birthday - however i forced myself out, through the guilt of how my friend would feel if i no showed, and when i got there, the laughs and banter we had was completely what i needed.  Didn't even consider looking for a smoke, and drinking a coule of beers, was fine too.  Thought that would lead me into association, but i've quit a few times in the past, and so i've experienced that feeling and was prepared for it.  

So all is going well.  Today i feel much better, than day one.  Still having to keep myself busy as ever, and switching up my usual routine, by doing items such as this, andconstantly reminding myself that when i do get a thought about a cigarette - that is just:-

1. The previous cigarette talking to me (the last one before i become a non smoker), not actually my brain talking to me. 
2. That every time i tell the craving "no, you are not what i want" - i am re-wiring my brain back to the way it should be.
3. That if i get stressed, i can deal with the problem, and a cigarette will not help me to deal with it.  

Wishing good vibes to all the other early stage non-smokers.  Breathe in, breathe out.  Smell that coffee,  the way it should be.  Time for one actually.  More tomorrow X

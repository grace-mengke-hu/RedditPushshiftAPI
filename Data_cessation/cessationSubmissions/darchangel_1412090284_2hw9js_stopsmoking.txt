My first year nicotine-free since I first took up smoking

After 15 years of smoking and at least a dozen failed attempts at quitting, I've now gone my first full year as a non-smoker since I began.

What a hell of a year this has been. Including a pregnancy resulting from a super-rare spontaneous recanalization (ie: our successful vasectomy reversed itself) and having to sell and buy a house to accommodate the coming baby -- we already had 4 of us in 2 bedrooms at our last place.

My advice to everyone quitting:

- There's no such thing as "just one." Also, the 2nd is WAY easier to justify than the first
- Relapse is a part of recovery. Forgive yourself and move on; don't let a moment of weakness define you. Try again
- Find other people to talk to. /r/stopsmoking was especially helpful to me in my first few months. Also, encouraging others on stopsmoking helped me cope too. Engage. Help each other
- Identify your triggers and be mentally prepared for as many as you can
- Remove physical reminders where possible. Lighters, ashtrays, etc.

Best of luck to all!

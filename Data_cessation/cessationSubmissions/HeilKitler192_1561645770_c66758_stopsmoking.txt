I want my husband to quit smoking

Hi everyone, I hope it's okay that I post here





My husband has been smoking for roughly 10 years now and has tried to quit 3 times now. He has tried the gum, the patches and even hypnotism but he can't quit kick the habit.





He told me that part of him doesn't want to quit so I think maybe that's why he hasn't been able to stop yet. We are planning to have kids soon and I'm concerned about not only our children's health, but also his and my health. 





Any suggestions to help him beat the addiction? Many thanks

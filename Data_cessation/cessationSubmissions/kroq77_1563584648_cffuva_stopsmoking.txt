Went to Disney for the first time as a non smoker

Whenever I've gone to Disney in the past, figuring out when I could slip away from my family long enough to trek to one of the few smoking areas in the park was always so stressful. Even going through the bag check was stressful, as I tried to hide my smoking from my family as much as possible. Heaven forbid security pulls out my cigarettes and lighter if my bag while I'm in line with my family. Disney recently banned smoking within all the parkS as of May 1st. When I heard this my heart sank. What was I going to do?? AAARRGH. My smoke breaks were a minute away from all the kids and commotion and a moment to collect myself and "de-stress". I've been smoke free for a month now. The smoking ban did not affect me at all today! I didn't miss it one bit. To be honest, I think it made my day so much more enjoyable, not having to stress about smoking and dealing with the smoker's shame I had. It felt GREAT. I've tried to quit so many times before but this time is the last time. I AM A NON-SMOKER!

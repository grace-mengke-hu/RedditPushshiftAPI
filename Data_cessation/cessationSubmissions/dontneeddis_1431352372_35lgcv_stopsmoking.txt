3 stars

Just wanted to provide a light at the end of the tunnel for those who have just started to quit, or considering a quit.
I am somebody who was fully convinced that I 'needed' nicotine.  For my anxiety, depression, social, etc....you name it, nicotine was my fuel.

After 3 months - I now know that all of that was entirely in my head.  Anxiety and depression were really a result OF nicotine.  I am a happier person, more productive, better sexer, and in general more in tune with my emotions.

Obviously, stress comes in and out of life, but as an ex-smoker, I remind myself that stress can be good - we're not supposed to be euphorically stress free all the time.  

Sorry if this is a bit rambly...my main point to all those who have slipped, think it's impossible, is to keep trying.  Don't try to 'quit' smoking, convince yourself (and stay vigilant) that you don't even want nicotine.
And if you fail - just keep trying - it will click eventually (I have failed twice).

Making this post to stop smoking

23M smoking since I was 12. I just finished my last cigarette and I know this isn't what I want from my life. I don't want cancer, I don't want this cough anymore, I don't want teeth stains anymore, I don't want bad breathe anymore, I don't want to stink off tobacco anymore. This is going to be the hardest fight of my life but I know it has to be done. Just making this post to hold myself accountable and have a record of when I stopped. Anyone reading this I hope you quit too because its not worth it at all.

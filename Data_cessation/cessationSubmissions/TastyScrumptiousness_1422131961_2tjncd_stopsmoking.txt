Random cravings

I'm over 4 months nicotine-free now, and for the most part, after the initial few weeks, it's been easy sailing. I rarely think about cigarettes anymore, when I do it's usually accompanied by the joy of having succeeded in this quit, I've even spent time with smokers without having any hint of a desire to smoke - I'm well and truly free.

But then out of nowhere these random cravings hit me, like WTF?! Anyone else get this? Today for no particular reason (and no specific trigger I can put my finger on) I'm feeling that restless sensation of wanting to go out for a smoke, so much so that I've compensated by eating about 7 packets of crisps throughout the day haha. But for some reason I'm still feeling that itch. I'm not worried, it's not overpowering enough for me to give into it at all, and I know it will pass - but I'm just perplexed at the randomness of it, so just wanted to share and see if this is a common occurrence.

Any long-term quitters out there - have you experienced this, and does it ever go away for good??

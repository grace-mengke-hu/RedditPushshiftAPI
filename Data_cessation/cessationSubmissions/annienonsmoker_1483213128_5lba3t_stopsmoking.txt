To all the new quitters, you can do this!

Just a quick note, I had a wobble earlier and the people on here were superstars as always. Just wanted to say to those people giving up tonight/tomorrow, come on here often and read or share your thoughts, it's been a massive support for me so always turn to these guys if you're in need.

Have a fabulous new year everyone and let's make 2017 smoke free for us all! 

Thanks so much to everyone who replied to my message earlier, it REALLY helped xx

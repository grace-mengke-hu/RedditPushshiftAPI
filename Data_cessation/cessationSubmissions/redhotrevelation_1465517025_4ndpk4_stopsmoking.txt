this is it

I've read the books. I've done the gum. I've used the e-cigs. I've cut down. I've used patches. I've gotten like 2 months down the line.

Each and every time I've gone back. I can't help myself... its a terrible thing for a control addict to admit they are addicted, and worse to admit that I enjoy smoking. Every day I go without I have horrific dreams and wake up sweating. I have a very stressful job and when I'm home I just sit around which is shit for cravings.
It's going to be difficult but I really need this. The journey begins anew.

Apathy, just another sneaky addiction mind game. I'm staring you down, smokes, and I win!

I have not felt anything like a craving for cigarettes for a few weeks. I was dead certain I had nailed this addiction to the ground. Corpse. Buried. I am still not feeling not feelings cravings. What I find instead is this vague apathy, generalized sadness, mild anxiety. 

I have been confused about where this is coming from. Until it appeared, I was charged up about a bunch of neat things going on with work, career, and life. Unexpectedly, I lost interest. I found myself mulling around, watching tv, doing a bunch of dull things, unable to pluck myself up and get interested again. I figured maybe I was a bit burnt out. Maybe the fall weather was getting me down. 

I did not start craving cigarettes, but I was feeling listless, and started thinking I needed something, something to change my mood. Maybe, you know, I was thinking this morning ... a cigarette.

Hah! It dawns on me! This is just another addiction trick. Bugger! And how do I know this isn't just routine depression, whatever? Because as soon as I  get it, that this is just another addiction trick, I feel way better. I feel my energy coming back. My mood is lifting. Man, that addiction is sneaky. Not me, buddy, not me, I've got your number. I'm staring you down and I win.

Good day everybody.

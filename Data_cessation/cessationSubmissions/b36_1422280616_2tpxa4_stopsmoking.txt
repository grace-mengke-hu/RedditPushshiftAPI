Finally under control:)

In october I did my best to quit, but all I accomplished was to cut down from 15 a day to maybe 7 or 8. At new years eve I smoked my last cigarette. I downloaded a stop smoking app for my phone and bought a membership at a gym. 
I believe the best way to quit is to replace it with something else. No nicotine gum or anything containing nicotine, but exercise in any form. I've been so lazy with quitting. Exercise is the number one motivation for me and For everyone trying to quit I reccomend doing the same. 
I am sure I will never smoke againðŸ‘Š

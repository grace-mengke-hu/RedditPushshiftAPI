This is hard as fuck

Yesterday I quit smoking. I picked up smoking about a year ago and I've gone from limiting myself to 3 sticks a day to smoking a bit more than half pack a day. I've never anticipated how difficult it would be to quit but this is hard as fuck. Right now I'm sitting here just finished my morning coffee and craving a cigg real bad. 

I've never thought I would be a slave to nicotine but the addiction is real. Can someone give me advice on how to cope with the cravings. I'm already missing my peacetime alone sitting outside the balcony and smoking.

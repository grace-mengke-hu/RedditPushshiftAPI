Need some encouragement? Hope my story helps.

I'm 28 years old - 182cm tall, and weigh 99kg. Been smoking since I was 17, and for the better part of it smoked almost a packet, or a packet of 20 a day. I am crap at self control, whatever it is that I do. Was bad at smoking uncontrollably, eating uncontrollably, gaming uncontrollably etc.

I quit 1 month and 19 days ago, after 11 years of smoking. I had quit twice before, in the past 2 years. This is the third time I quit, and this time is for good. Took me three attempts to completely remove cigarettes out of my life, and now is the one that matters because it feels genuine and I feel great.

Benefits I saw so far:

- Saved Euro 285
- Not smoked 1001 cigarettes
- Regained 12 days
- Spent 3 days not smoking
- Resisted 11 cravings since I stopped
- Didn't have a puff since
- Started running a week after I quit (so around 40 days ago)
- Ran 1.34km, at 8 min 25 seconds per KM
- Yesterday ran 5k at 7 min 29 seconds per KM (after 2 weeks out due to hamstring injury)
- Today I ran 4k at 6 min 50 seconds per KM
- Blood pressure down from an average 135/85, to 117/74
- Energy levels are through the roof
- Feel much healthier
- Feel less nervous and angry
- Picked up meditation every once in a while as well

If I can do it, with what I consider to be poor self control (I haven't managed to cut out fatty foods yet, but that's next), then you can too. From the day you stop, consider yourself a non smoker. Think of yourself as never having needed to smoke, and I recommend picking up something that will keep your mind focused, and your body tired. After my first run I felt I was going to pass out. I was heaving and almost fainted, and I felt disheartened. But I kept going, and today I can run much better, and feel energised every day.

Don't give up, you can do it.

I'm a tech guy, so here are apps that helped me:

- Apple health - to record my bloodpressure & heart rate
- Nike+ Run Club - started the most basic running plan to get going
- Headspace - started meditation, and it helped with self control - something I struggle immensely with
- Smoke Free - Great for monitoring progress and recording cravings

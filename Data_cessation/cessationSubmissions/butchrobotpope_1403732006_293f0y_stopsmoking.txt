Just made it to the 2 year mark! I have 5 things I'd like to say

1. Right up front, I gotta say **THANK YOU** to the support of this subreddit. I've learned a lot and been inspired to quit and not start again. You. Are. Awesome.  

2. I was the biggest sucker out there when it comes to smoking. I bought into the whole *edgy* / *dangerous* aspect of it. And that made it a lot more difficult to quit. I had to **unfuck** my brain to have a chance. Which brings me to...  

3. It is almost all *in your head.* The worst of the addiction - the cravings, the nerves, getting aggro - all of that is mental. And you CAN control/change that. You have to.  

4. Because the only thing that worked for me, in the end, was getting **sick of the bullshit.** I got pissed off about failing, over and over. When I realized that another cigarette wasn't going to help, or make me feel better, it just pissed me off more. THAT is how it worked for me. And that is why I haven't gone back to smoking.  

5. There is no ONE WAY. So stop acting like there is. Each person has their own strength and weakness. Don't put down someone's attempt because it "isn't the right way" - help them to find their own "right way". If I listened to the naysayers, I wouldn't have quit. In the end, all that matters is that you STOP SMOKING. Period.  
  

Thanks for everything, stopsmoking! Good luck and stay strong! Every day you don't smoke means the addiction loses its grip. You can do it! Cheers!

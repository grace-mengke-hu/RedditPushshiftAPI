3 Weeks!

3 Weeks!  So far I have had very little desire to go back to smoking.  When the cravings get to be awful I sit down and think about how much that first week sucked ass and how much better I feel and smell.  my skin looks terrific, I can breath again, I don't stink. I watched an entire movie the other night without wanting to get up to go have a cigarette.  my plans no longer revolve around where and when I can smoke. I'm not ashamed of myself and hiding behind a tree to smoke. This is great!

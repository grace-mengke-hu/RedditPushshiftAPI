6th day of quit - question about bloating?

Hello,

I've quit smoking before for a year, and one thing I remember is this absolutely crazy ass bloating.

Normally I am a pretty slim (closer to underweight) person, and smoking has allowed me for many years to eat whatever I want, whenever I want and never put on any weight. When I quit smoking that completely changes, and suddenly my metabolism is reacting to no nicotine and slowing down majorly.

I wondered if anybody out there had any tips or remedies that might help keep my metabolism working fast and stop bloating up so much, digesting is a nightmare. I was thinking green tea...any ideas?

Thanks!

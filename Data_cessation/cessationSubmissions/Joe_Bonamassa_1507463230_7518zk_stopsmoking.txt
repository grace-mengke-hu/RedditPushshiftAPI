First attempt starting tomorrow!

Hey guys, 

I‘ve been a smoker for 6 years now (I‘m 19, yes, it‘s kind of a Dave Allen story) and I‘m starting my first attempt to quit tomorrow. Since it‘s the first time I‘m doing it, I‘ve decided to go cold turkey and get more into sports. 

I don‘t really know what to expect, but I hope this will work out. People have told me about very different strengths of withdrawal symptoms, some found it very hard, some didn‘t struggle at all. 
I‘m expecting a struggle since I‘ve been mostly smoking strong, dark tobacco. 

Anyone got some last advice before I get in the ring?

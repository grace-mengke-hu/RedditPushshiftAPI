Cravings are silly things.

Think on this fact whenever a crave hits:

The second we quit smoking we are non smokers. We do not smoke any longer.

A crave hits and we get miserable, angry, nervous, upset.

Basically, we crave and feel upset as we fight to not do what we are already NOT doing.

Your cig demon is dying. Every time you laugh off a crave, it dies more. See, YOU don't want the cig. IT does. So laugh at the craves. They're silly and mean nothing.

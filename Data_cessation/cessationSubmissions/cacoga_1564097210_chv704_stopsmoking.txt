Struggling

Hi everyone!  I'm new here and have been off cigarettes for 4 days now.  I am on patches and they're making me feel terrible.  I just purchased Allen Carr's Quit Smoking book and that is arriving tomorrow. I know I need to get off these patches but im so afraid I'll start smoking again.  Any support will help.  Thanks for listening.  Simply, cacoga

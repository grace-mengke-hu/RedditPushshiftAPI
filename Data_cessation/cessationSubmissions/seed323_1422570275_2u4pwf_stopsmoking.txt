Just a tip

I quit smoking october of 2013 but replaced it with a vaporizer. I stopped the vaporizer last month which at first was weird but once I learned to keep my hands busy it was easy. I would mostly vape as I browse reddit or watch tv, so to keep my hands busy I bought a deck of cards and I just shuffle it, maybe deal a hand of poker, play myself in blackjack, anything to keep my hands busy. I used to suck at shuffling cards during poker games, but I just did my first bridge shuffle and it feels like an achievement. So if you're looking for a distraction give it a shot. Best of luck to you all.

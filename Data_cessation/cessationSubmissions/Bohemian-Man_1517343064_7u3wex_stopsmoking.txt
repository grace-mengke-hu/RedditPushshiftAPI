Almost 100 days!

(I am not often here, so I'll write 2 days in advance :D )

I have just one maybe-not-so-common comment to add to already existing ones that you wonderful and powerful people wrote here... 

I was rolling tobacco. And that was not just "smoking" to me, every cigarette was also my tiny relaxing ritual. So, when I stopped  - I felt quite bored :D I missed something :D

My suggestion for your first days / weeks - if you enjoyed smoking (as I did) find some "quick fun" to do to substitute that "bored" feeling that will come every time you would usually smoke one. Or find something stupid to do ;) I guess that would help me overcome "boredom".

Stay strong! It's lot easier than we thought before stopping. We are not losing a single thing!

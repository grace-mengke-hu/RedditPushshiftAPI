I ran 4.3km today

Since I stopped smoking 20 a day I have noticed a big increase in how far I can run without stopping or feeling winded/getting a stitch.

I have not smoked for 35 days now and today I ran 4.3Km without stopping and then did 40 burpees and 60 press ups in sets of ten. I'm 31 and this is the first time I have ever taken exercise seriously from being a chronic couch potato.

Tommorow I will try to hit the 5k mark, right now it's time for breakfast. I used to start every morning with a cig and a coffee. The first few  days were rough but I couldn't imagine starting the day anyway else now and the buzz carries me through the rest of the day.

Stay strong everyone ðŸ’ª ðŸ‘Š you can do it!!! ðŸ’¯

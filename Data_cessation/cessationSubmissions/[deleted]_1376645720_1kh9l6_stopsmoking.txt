I am currently smoking my last cigarette

It's going to be difficult, almost a pack a day for 3 years.. it was my stress reliever. Does anyone have any encouraging words or advice on what helped them? I've heard exercise during the cravings, lollipops, carrot sticks, e cigg.. but what worked for you?

Thinking about quitting? Stop drinking and smoking weed first.

I'm about to hit 6 days in 30 minutes, and I know for a fact I couldn't have done it without being sober. I always followed a drink or getting high with a cigarette or chew. Like always.

Your mileage may vary, but i'd highly recommend taking a break from mind altering substances.

That is all.

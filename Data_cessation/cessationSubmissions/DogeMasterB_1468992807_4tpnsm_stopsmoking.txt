10 days!

I know it's not a huge accomplishment, but I feel like if I post about it here I will be less tempted to start again. I've been vaping 0mg which is fun and tastes really nice, but I'm having crazy cravings. I wasn't a heavy smoker or anything, a pack of 25 would usually last me 5 days at least so I'm confused as to why the cravings are so bad.

Whatever, 10 days wooo

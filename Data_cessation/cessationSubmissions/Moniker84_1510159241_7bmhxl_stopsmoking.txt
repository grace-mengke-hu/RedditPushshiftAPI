My biggest reward...

Throughout this quit process it's been a real struggle.  Good days..  Bad days..  Days I thought I'd die. It has been hard. It is still hard.  Every single day I have to fight this demon inside me.  And it's shown me a lot about myself.  I'm a strong person.  I have determination even I didn't know I had within me.  More than anything I am most proud of that.  And also for the example I've been setting. 
My biggest reward has been that my husband has also made the decision to quit.  He began his Chantix yesterday and soon,  with luck,  he too will be a non smoker.  I'm so happy and proud of his courage.  watching my struggles hasn't been easy for any of us,  but the fact that he still wants to go through it so we can both be healthy means the world to me. 
I am so excited and this success has renewed my will to forever be a non smoker.  It's possible to live a happy life without cigarettes.  
Keep working hard.  Even those days when you feel like it's impossible.  It is so worth every second of the struggle.

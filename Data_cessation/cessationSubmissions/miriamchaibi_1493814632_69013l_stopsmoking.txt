Stopped smoking

I stopped smoking about four days ago and haven't touched a cigarette since.  However I do have a SO that smokes A LOT and we live together and it's hard to be smelling cigarettes around you when you're trying to quit.  My main problem is that when I get stressed out that's when I crave a cigarette the most and I stress easily so yeah haha... I'm hoping I can make it through the first week because they say that's the hardest!

Day 1: I quit! starting now

Hey everyone! Today is the first day of the rest of my life. As of June 16, 2016, I stop smoking. I've said in the past that I'm gonna quit smoking, and I'm sure everyone has. But this time I'm serious. When I was 15 I started smoking, I am 23 now. That a lot of money in Canada for smoking. After starting my new job last month I realize that I have a lot of free time at work so I would smoke. Typically I would be going through a pack of cigarettes in about 2 days, and with this new job I would be buying a new pack every morning. 
However I also realized that I have smoked 3 packs of cigarettes over the weekend. So I say it's time to kick this habit and start fresh in life. Save money, be healthy.

I'm gonna be honest, as of right now I do feel something since deciding to quit. I don't feel bad though, I feel almost scared? But I know I can get over it. Especially with everyone's help!!
Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this.

5 weeks stopped and its hitting me hard suddenly!

I've done really well and the nicotine monster has not really hit me... Thought I was over the worst but each day this week at some point of the day I could kill for one. Just sat myself down and come on reddit to see how everyone is getting on. There is a packet of cigs nearby as my partner smokes (not in the house) but something is stopping me taking one, but these withdrawals are driving me insane!

Damn, smoking a few cigs after quitting vaping and snus.

I quit smoking two times pretty consistently after replacing the nicotine with vaping. I decided to stop vaping, and at the same time I ended up having a ton of work due so I thought I could just use Snus to get through an all nighter I threw the last of my Snus away and had gone up to 18 hours nic free. Then I started buming some cigs or smoking neighbors butts. Pissed off at myself for relapsing, but now I just want to be nicotine free for at least 72 hours.

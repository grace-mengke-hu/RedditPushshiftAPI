Serious, is it better to quit when you have the day off work?

I have an 8 hour shift today... and it's what we call "truck day". Not that I need to make excuses but I'm just wondering if I'm going to be feeling like death at work (headaches, withdraw symptoms and whatnot) or if being distracted by physical labor is a good thing. 

Not trying to make excuses, genuinely curious of your opinion of it's better to quit when you have distractions or the day off. I switched to vaping 4 days ago which helps a lot, but it was my intention to use that to help me transition to quitting. Haven't had a puff in 17 hours so far. Feel OK, just a little angsty.

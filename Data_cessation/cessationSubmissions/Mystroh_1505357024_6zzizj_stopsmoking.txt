So sick of feeling shitty

I've pretty heavy smoker for the past 7 years. On average I smoke about 10 cigs a day. Every single time I light up all I think about is how incredibly stupid smoking cigarettes is. I worry about my health big time. I used to be an athlete and now I can't even get myself to work out because I fear I will collapse or something. I tried cutting back..it worked for 4 or 5 days but it didn't work. I really don't want to keep this up. Cold turkey seems like the only way to do it. Any advice?

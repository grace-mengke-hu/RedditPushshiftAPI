21 days

Hi,

Long time lurker, but am on 21 days now. I have used vape as a backup, which I know will bring some heat, but I’ve got here either way.

I’ve saved a ton of money, and feel better - I get it - but I have that itch still. If I could just have one. How long does this last for? I suspect forever. It’s a horrible thing, but of my own doing and would really appreciate your honest reply.

I really don’t want the vape hate and general criticism, I’ve smoked for 35 years - and to be frank loved it - but I’ve got this far. I just really need that one question answered from your own experience.

Humbly yours.

Pack a day smoker for 5 years, have i already done too much damage?

Ive started getting short of breath when i lay down, and especially so when doing anything physical to the point its debilitating, this has more or less scared me into thinking i should quit now, 

Im young early 20s and i know the risks of smoking because Australia more or less puts it in your face but, even if i quit now,  is the damage done still going to kill me? 

Ive tried champex twice and that didnt work, cold turkey this time see how it goes, any advice?

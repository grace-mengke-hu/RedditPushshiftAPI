I just kinda... stopped smoking.

A few days ago I was playing COD WWII with a friend and a few of his other friends.  A few of them vape and we would bust on them every time we heard one of take a hit.  I mentioned something about wanting to trying vaping as a method of NRT, and one of the other guys offered me one of his setups.  At first I just kind of blew it off like "yea,  no one is just gonna GIVE you a vape just because".  The next day I messaged him just to ask a few questions and he offered it again.  This time I agreed but offered him some money in return, which he refused.  We met up and he explained everything and told me what I would need to get started. Again he refused to take any money.  For the past 2 days I've been vaping and smoking.  This morning I bought my pack for the day and had a few.  And then around 830 AM I smoked a cigarette, and then started vaping.  Before I knew it, it was 1030 and then 1100.  At that point I told myself I could have a cigarette at 1130.  1130 came and went and I stopped at McD's around 1 and told myself that I could have one after lunch.  After I ate I grabbed my pack of cigarettes took one look at the pack in my hand and put them back down and grabbed the vape.  At this point I am 7 hours without a cigarette.  This is the longest I have voluntarily gone with out a cigarette in the 19 years that I smoked.

I've stalked this sub for so long.  I've wanted what you all have.  I've told myself over and over that I can try, but it's never worked before.  This time it's for real.  THIS IS THE DAY I QUIT SMOKING. For my health, for my daughter, for the guys at the fire station who count on me.  

TLDR: Friend of a friend gave me a vape a few days ago.  Today it just kinda worked it's way into replacing cigarretes.  Haven't lit one in 7 hours.

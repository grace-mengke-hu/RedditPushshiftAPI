First time posting here. Stopped smoking on Monday.

I’ve been a pack a day smoker for roughly 14 years. I’ve quit once or twice, with the longest time being 2 months several years ago.

This time I’m suuuper finished though. I realized smoking is just something I do. I don’t even like the taste anymore, I haven’t had a nicotine buzz in years, so seriously: what’s the damn point?

I’m excited to do this for myself and my kids. I got a low nicotine vape pen to help with cravings, but I’ve only used it a few times. I’m so glad I made the decision to quit. I went on a run yesterday and I can already see a difference!

If you’re thinking about quitting, do it! Figure out a plan that works for you, set a quit date, and make it happen.

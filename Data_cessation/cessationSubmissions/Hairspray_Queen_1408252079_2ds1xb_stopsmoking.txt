Reset.

I smoked two cigarettes tonight.  After my second,  something very strange happened.  I came inside and suddenly felt like I was going to faint or like I was having a stroke or a heart attack or something... It's difficult to describe.  Everything got blurry and black around the edges and the lights' blurred image on my eyes were bright all over the room.  I was SO hot and pouring sweat.  It was not just in my mind.  My boyfriend came close to me and looked alarmed and asked why I was so hot.  My hands tingled like they had fallen asleep.  It was quite scary.  I can't do this to myself anymore.  This is so hard,  but going back to cigarettes can't be the answer.  I'm reseting tonight.  God (?) help me.

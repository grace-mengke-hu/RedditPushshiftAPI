I failed

So, that is how for i got with my first try to quit.After a month and 23 days i gave up and today i bought my first pack of cigaretts since quiting.I am really sad, but right know i m having my exams and i have been really stressed, learning lots of hours and getting little sleep.Hope i can bounce back and quit for good.

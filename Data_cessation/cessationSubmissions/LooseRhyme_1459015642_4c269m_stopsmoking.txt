[Day 4] Is it going to get easier soon?

Hi everyone,  

I made the impulsive/potentially stupid decision to quit smoking in the midst of one of the most stressful professional periods of my life (I'm a graduate student and have my comprehensive exams late May, and my advisor hasn't been helping this past year).  


I thought after the 72 hours, it would be easier -- that cravings would become less common and less intense. But it's as bad as ever, and the anxiety's showing no sign of subsiding.  


Here's the thing: I want to quit, but I can't have this looming over my head for the next month. It's a serious distraction (an important one, of course), and any time I spend trying to focus on not having a cigarette is time I *need* to be studying for my exams. I'm already behind and falling further behind (which exacerbates the anxiety, making me crave cigarettes more).  


Should I just put a pin on quitting until I'm done with the exams? Is it going to get better *soon*?

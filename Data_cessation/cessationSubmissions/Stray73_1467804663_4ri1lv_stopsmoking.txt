Mentally Preparing and Nervous

Hi Everyone, 

I have set my quit date to this Friday, I have been a smoker for 28 years and have quit before but this time needs to be for good.  I am starting to notice it with my  lungs, I have allergies and reflux as well.  I am dreading the withdrawals, I get them so bad, I am anxious and fearful by withdrawals will push me to the edge of insanity (well not really but it sure will feel that way)  I am hoping this discussion board will help me through the process.  I have to quit, I am done and its just plain stupid to smoke.  The quit date is consuming my mind, I have a lot of anxiety about this.  Wish me luck everyone.  I know its about 3 days of the physical but the mental is also the toughest.

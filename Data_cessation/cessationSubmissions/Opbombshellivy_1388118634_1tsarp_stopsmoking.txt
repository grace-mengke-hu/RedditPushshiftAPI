Not so bad. I've had a few drinks and been ok. i did buy an "ecig" that i use very infrequently (once or twice a week) 
I've battled some serious anxiety, depression and I truly feel bad for the people I love dealing with the brunt of my anger. 

I know its for the better. I also know that I'll survive this.

Keep strong quitters.

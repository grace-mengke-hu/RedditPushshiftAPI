2 weeks without cigarettes, 100 days without cannabis!

So here I am at 100 days of stopping smoking weed. I know this isn't so relevant to this sub but it truly has been a life changer for me. I told myself I would stop smoking cigarettes when I hit 100 days of no cannabis, but I ended up starting early 2 weeks ago whilst reading **Alan Carrs Easy Way to Quit Smoking** . 

Fantastic book which I couldn't recommend enough. I actually had a quitting attempt with the book previously that felt effortless, but I was stupid and had that 'one cheeky cigarette', and was back to 20 a day for months. This attempt has once again been EASY! I even had a visit from some old friends which resulted in a drinking quite a lot of beer three days in a row (not the best idea I know) and didn't even think about asking someone for a cigarette. Love it !! 

It feels great to be on a pathway to positive health again. I'm slightly concerned that I haven't really started coughing up nasty stuff yet (in the past this has began after just a few days). My circulation and Raynauds disease seems to have cleared up too (anyone else with similar symptoms experience relief from quitting smoking)? 

Stay strong guys, it's a beautiful thing we're doing here and you gotta remember that you are not missing out or sacrificing ANYTHING. And when troubles get too tough, deep breathing works wonders. &lt;3

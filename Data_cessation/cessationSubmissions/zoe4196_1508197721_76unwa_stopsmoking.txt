Quitting tonight....

I've smoked about a pack a day for the past 23 years. Over the past grew weeks my throats hurts so bad every time I smoke that I have to quit ASAP. Also a friend of a friend was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer from smoking and has spread to her brain. She's only 51. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and have myself more stressed out about dying then about quitting so hopefully thats enough to motivate me through this.  

Any and all suggestions, tips, hints welcome!

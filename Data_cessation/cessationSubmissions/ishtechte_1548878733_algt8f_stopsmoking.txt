I need some help

Right now it's been 2 months, 18 days and 22 hours since I quit smoking/vaping and I am still having cravings that cripple me. I end up getting a craving and it puts me in a foul mood and then I end up snapping at friends, family, and coworkiers. Does it ever get any easier? Because it doesn't seem like it. I can barely breath right now and It doesn't seem like it's getting any easier. Every day is the same struggle. I was told give it a few days, it'll get easier. Give it a few weeks, it'll get easier. Give it a couple of months, it'll get easier. Well I'm here to say that it's not getting any easier and I'm about to have an emotional breakdown. I don't want to pick up nicotine again but I also don't want to keep doing this to people around me. At this point it almost feels like the lesser of two evils.   


Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated... I'm stuck in a rut right now and I don't see a way out. I was hoping maybe someone has been through what I'm going through. Thanks in advance.

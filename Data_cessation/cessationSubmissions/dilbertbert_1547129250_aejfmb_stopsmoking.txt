Had my last cigarette 7am on Jan 4th. I've smoked for 35 years. I've never been this determined.

I had planned to stop on Jan 4th, I went through the house and thought I destroyed every cigarette but there was a pack with one in it on a shelf on my night-stand.  When I woke up I instinctively searched for a smoke and had it lit before I was thinking clearly, I was half way through the cigarette before I realized what I had done but I haven't had one since.

I've been using nicotine lozenges and they really help take the edge off, using 4 of them per day.  If anyone has any experience with lozenges please chime in with your experience.

My lungs already feel better.  I'm coughing up a lot of phlegm but from what I gather this is normal.
I've been a redditor for quite some time and just now realized there was probably a subreddit for quitting smoking, did the search and here I am subscribing!
Wish me luck!!!!

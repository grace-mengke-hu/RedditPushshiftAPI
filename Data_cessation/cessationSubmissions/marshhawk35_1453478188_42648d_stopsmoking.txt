40 days!!

I wish I could say it's gotten as easy as I expected to by this point. It hasn't. In fact, the last few days I've had seriously hardcore cravings and this ridiculous wistfulness about the taste and feel of smoking one of those evil, poisonous sticks.

But I'm staying the course through all the rocky parts, and I feel really goddamned good about FORTY DAYS. Next goal: 60 days!

How are you feeling today? Take a minute to congratulate yourself, wherever you are in your quit right now.

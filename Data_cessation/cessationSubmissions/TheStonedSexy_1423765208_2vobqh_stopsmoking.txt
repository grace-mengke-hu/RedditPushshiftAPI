Inpatient Cessation Programs

Has anyone ever tried an inpatient smoking cessation program? If so, how did it work out for you? Any pros or cons you could share would be great. My father-in-law is really struggling to quit on his own and is considering one of these programs. Thanks in advance for any and all help!

Three days without smoking, bad brain fog

I've officially completed my third day of not smoking. I'm experiencing awful brain fog and have been very forgetful yesterday and today. When I'm trying to converse with someone it seems like I just forget basic words and it's quite embarrassing. Not to mention the extreme irritability. This is honestly the worst experience ever but I'm glad I've been able to make it this far. I really hope I can stick to it.

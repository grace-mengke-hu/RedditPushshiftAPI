These past few days have been harder...

Wtf... :( I've been smoke free for a month and a half and for the past few days I've been thinking about smoking non-stop!! Specially today it's been very hard. After having a nice meal and drinking a couple of beers all I can think about is smoking. It's driving me mad. 


For some reason I have my old cigarette pack in front of me. A chesterfield pack with 4 cigarettes remaining that I haven't thrown out yet. But I'm not going to smoke, that much's for sure. 


Tomorrow I was thinking about buying some ecig juice without any nicotine. Would you say it's a stupid decision? Should I just remain 100% clean? Do you think it's cheating? Would it help with these crazy cravings? 

I don't want to fall off the wagon specially when I've come so far! :(

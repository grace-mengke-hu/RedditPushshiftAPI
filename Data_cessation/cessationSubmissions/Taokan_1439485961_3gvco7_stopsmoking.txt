The Devil's Bargain

Day 11 here, so by no means an expect on smoking cessation, but I had this thought today, that might help someone.

Smoking is like the ultimate bad shark loan.  You get a 15 minute buzz, then suffer a week of physical withdrawl for it in the form of cravings and quitter's flu.  The actual loan itself is for almost nothing: you don't even have to buy one cigarette, you can usually bum one.  And when you quit you don't have to pay anything back on that cigarette.

But the interest on the loan is what kills you, literally.  You don't have to pay it back right away, you can instead spend 5 bucks a day, smell like shit, and slowly give up a bit of your life and health every day, rather than pay back the loan.

And like the credit card companies, the tobacco companies don't want you to pay back this loan.  Their entire business model relies on thriving off the interest.

So - who wants to be in debt?

ermahgerd, a year and a day!!

I cannot tell you how amazing I feel. Smoking has been pushed so far out of my brain that I missed my actual one year mark. 

To all of the quitters out there, keep on keepin' on. It gets easier. Sometimes it gets harder, and sometimes you don't even think about it anymore. Sure, you'll have the occasional driving-down-the-road-holy-shit-a-cigarette-would-just-complete-this-moment moment, but then you'll stop and call yourself crazy because no, a cigarette would not do anything for this moment.

I can't tell you that you won't ever think about it, or that you won't ache for a smoke occasionally. I can tell you that you will feel better, you will feel proud of yourself and most of all, your body will repair itself and you will get healthier.

Keep your head up. Whether you're at day one or day a thousand and one, just keep swimming.

Thank you, r/stopsmoking, for making me feel like me again and offering such a caring and supporting network of wonderful people. Without you, I wouldn't have made it a week. Now it's been a year - and I still love all of you just the same. You changed my life. Now continue to change yours!!

So much love and respect. Have a beautiful, smoke-free day.

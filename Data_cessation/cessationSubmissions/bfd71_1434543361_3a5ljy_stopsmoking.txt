50 hours in doing OK, but I feel like today will be a challenge

I can't say the desire has been stronger this morning, but its definitely feels like its more persistent.  The last two days, there might have been some intense but fleeting "need" for a cigarette.  Today it feels like every time my brain transitions from one through topic to another it wants a cigarette.

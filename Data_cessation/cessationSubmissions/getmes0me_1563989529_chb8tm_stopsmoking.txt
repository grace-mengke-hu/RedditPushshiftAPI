few weeks in

Hi guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

6-7 weeks in to the process (for about the 10th time) and wondering what you all suggest here. I started with patches and stopped when i got to step 2. Its been 2 weeks since I've had a patch on. However, I'm still getting cravings. For most I can deal with them, but if the need should arise - can i fall back on a piece of gum? Or does doing that set the end of cravings back a bit? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a high stress, sedentary job and most of my cravings happen at work. At home i'm able to distract myself with some other task and forget all about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What i don't want, is to be dependent on gum. While i'd rather push through and hopefully get to the end of the cravings, it would be nice to have a mental break every once in a while.

Thoughts?!?

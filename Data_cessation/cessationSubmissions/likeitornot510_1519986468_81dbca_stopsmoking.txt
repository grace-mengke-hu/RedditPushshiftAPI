2 Months!

What a difference these 2 months have made. I feel like a different person. I’m much calmer, able to handle stress and anxiety better, eating healthier, stopped drinking alcohol, exercising on the regular, lost some weight, and over all feel great. I’m not going to lie, the road to get here has been a rocky one. And I know I still have a lot of work ahead of me to stay smoke free. But I offer my hand in encouragement for anyone who’s struggling today or thinking about quitting.

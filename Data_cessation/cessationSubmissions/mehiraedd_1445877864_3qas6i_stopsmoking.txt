NRT delivering more nicotine than I ever got from smoking

Hey all, 

I just quit smoking 6 days ago. It has been exponentially easier than I expected thanks to the patch and popping a piece of gum whenever I get an intense craving. I have been smoking about 5 years and averaged 10-15/day, so I picked up the 21mg patches and have been wearing them for the full 24 hrs as instructed.


I read online somewhere that a cigarette "on average" gives you 1mg of nicotine (not sure how true this is), so the patch + maybe 2-3 pieces of gum a day is actually a lot more than my body would've had while I smoked. I intend to complete the full program with all steps, and I know the dosage will be lower in a few weeks. I just can't help but feel I'm getting my body even more addicted to nicotine than it previously was, only to feel deprived and make my full nicotine quit tougher in a few weeks when that occurs. 

Anything to dissuade my fears? Something pharmacodynamically I haven't considered? I've been having the gum less and less as the days progress so it won't be hard to stop using completely. But I do still worry that I'm setting myself up for failure somehow. Should I switch to the lower dose now and see how I feel? Any input would be appreciated.

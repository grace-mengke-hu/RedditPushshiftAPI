Question - left Chantix at home

It's been 15 days today and I took my last Chantix at 6am yesterday and I'm about 70 miles away from my prescription. I won't be home until tomorrow afternoon. Should I expect any Chantix abrupt cessation  affects? Been taking for a month now 2x a day.

Thanks!

Edit: my daughter met me halfway to give me my prescription. I didn't feel any ill affects, but I did feel multiple urges to smoke.  
Took one, The Chantix people said don't take the missed dosages. Back on track, and didn't smoke. Thanks for the number!

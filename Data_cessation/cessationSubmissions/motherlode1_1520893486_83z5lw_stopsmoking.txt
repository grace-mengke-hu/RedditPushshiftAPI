15 days, half a month. This battle has been uphill for me.

Been going strong, still have the occasional withdrawal symptoms. Last week had the mother of all panic attacks in the middle of the night. Thought I was done for. Had to call my dad (he is a doctor) and he walked me through it. I still have random anxiety attacks but the frequency is falling. The odd sleeping hours have left me a little sluggish but I am fixing it the slow way. 

I still have a stuffy nose every now and then but nothing too major. Occasionally the cravings present themselves after dinner but the cravings last less than a minute. 

Appetite was messed up the first two weeks (mainly due to anxiety) and I lost a bit of weight (about a pound) but now its returning and I am enjoying food more.

Hopefully things gets better as time goes by.

Anyone that had never been able to stop for even one day?

Hi everyone,
I seriously want and need to stop vaping.
Yep it is not smoking, but I have a serious addiction to the ecig.
I have been a smoker for 15 years, about 20 a day. Switched to vape 5years ago (suffering). Now the ecig never leaves my hand.
Both when smoking and vaping I never ever been able to stop even for one day.
If I was sick, had tooth surgeries, anything.
I would cut down, reduce, but I have never been 24hr without it for the last 20 years.

That mines a lot my self esteem and hope to be able to do it.

I read a lot of posts, because it helps, and it seems people have stopped for a period..

Thanks!

War!

Hi all,
I'm at 28 days.. And feeling pretty positive. I've tried many times over the years to quit (20 a day for 30 years) and never felt this confident that it's going to work. I still get the cravings...some pretty strong but I'm beating them. I thought I'd list here what's working this time, it may help others...
Firstly, I didn't tell anyone, this was gonna be a personal battle and I didn't want any pressure from others. Secondly I gave smoking and cravings a personality... I picture a slimy drug dealer making profit out of my downfall. He plants the messages in my head, the temptations, doubts about success...Well he ain't going to win! This is war and its going to be long haul, but the longer I last... The stronger I get and the weaker and more pathetic he becomes. I don't have a coping strategy I just face the craving and say 'do your da best, you are not gonna win!'..I face him down and it feels good each time.
After 2 weeks family and friends started to notice and their support wasn't pressure by then but a helpful boost. Other support comes in the form of sites like this and dashboards showing money and health gains.

I am 64 years old male from Finland. I started to smoke in 1958. Yesterday morning I had to decide to quit smoking because I am having hard time for breathing. I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor but I am quite sure that I have COPD. I am too nervous to write more. Wish me luck.

This is the title I wrote here one year ago. I never believed then that it could be possible for me to quit smoking it was more like a dream but here we are one year later. Today I am of course 65 years gone up in weigth 18 kilos but I havn't had a smoke since then. So if it is possible for me to quit after more than 50 years of smoking it is possible to all of you if you want it enough. I want to thank you all of that huge support you sent to me in the beginning and i beg your pardon I haven't wrote here much just lurked here almost daily. I know I am still in recovery like people in their 12 steps programs. Anyway I have done my first year and I am happy and proud of it. I just wanted to write this in order to thank you for support and tell that it is not easy but it is possible I still have cravings not very often but every now and then. One more time thank you to all of you and GO FOR IT.

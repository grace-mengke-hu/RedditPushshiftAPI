I wanted to share this before I fade out of this sub

I find myself entering less and less in this sub. I think that means I made it!

I wont unsubscribe yet, but I wanted to share something that happens to me a week ago, before I completely forget about it.

I was coming back home from going out at night... my street is kinda steep up. And I live in a second floor, no elevator.

Im not athletic, but im fit. I remembered this same situation in the past when I used to smoke. I used to get home completely breathless. 

But not this time. I got home fine. I was quite a shock to me. I never quited because I felt bad physically. I didnt think it was doing so much bad to me

But only after 2 months, its hard to deny it. I was paying for fucking myself over

After 12 years smoking, I wont miss you tobacco. I just wish I had made decision before

Future generations will look down on us and say... man, they were fucking retarded

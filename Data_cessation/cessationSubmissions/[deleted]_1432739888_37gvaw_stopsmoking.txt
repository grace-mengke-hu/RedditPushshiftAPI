Injured myself (accidentally) so now I have to stop smoking :)

I've been smoking non stop since the end of January and on Monday I decided to quit so I came on this sub reddit, started a new badge and went out afterwards and played basketball, this idiot ended up sweeping my legs when I went up for a lay up and I landed knee (right) first on the concrete with my lower tendon rupturing completely, and my patella moving a few inches up my quadricep. I had surgery yesterday and was discharged from hospital today so that makes this my third day without smoking :), not even mad about my injury lol it gave me rehabilitation for a couple of days, I really don't want to stop my recovery process by smoking as I heard that makes it worse so I guess I'm onto a good start lol

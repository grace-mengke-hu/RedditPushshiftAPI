I'm drunk, but I'm gonna quit.

Wish me luck. I'm 24, grew up in a house of smokers (mostly inside, too), but I started at 12 and it's about fucking time. This is going to suck, but I'm done. Also thank to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1bcimj/feels_good_man/) post for giving me an app to check my status.

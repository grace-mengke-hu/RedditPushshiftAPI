Chantix: day four

Yesterday was my first 2x daily dosage, still at .5mg per dose. 

I work evening shift and I am totally alone during my shift. I work in two locations an hour apart and travel near daily. Both locations are large repair shops and I am free as a bird to smoke both while traveling and in the shops.

When I left for work I had an unopened pack in my pocket. I had thoughts of smoking during my shift but didn't feel compelled to light one. Near the end of my shift I decided to have one and noticed my pack still had 18 in it. My usual would have been half a pack. I was actually a bit stunned, I thought I had smoked more. If this is how it works, I'm impressed.

So far zero side effects.

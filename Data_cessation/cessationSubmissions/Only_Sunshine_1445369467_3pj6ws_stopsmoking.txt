Well I feel useless

I went 5 days.  A whole 5 days.  The longest I've gone in years.  I was on holiday and had an e cigarette (only used it in the morning anyway) and everything was fine.  

I went back to work and had a whole day as a non smoker.  Then tidied my locker at work and found my "emergency" pack.  

So one won't hurt right?  One became two and I'm now removing my badge and resetting my counter.  I didn't even try to stop myself.

But I won't let this creep back into becoming a habit.  

I just feel like such a failure after making everybody proud.  There was no excuse, it wasn't a stressful day, they were just there.

Help Please: I see smoking as one of my social networking tool

I have seen a similar question asked on this sub before but somehow I couldn't convince myself for quitting. I have made quite a lot of friends in smoking areas especially at work. Now i tried quitting once and was successful for 20 days but i just couldn't get over the fact that i might not be able to strike the instant friendship i used to at smoking areas etc. I want to ask you guys, how did you manage this particular aspect of quitting. I really believe this is  my only excuse and if i am able to come up with a strategy to deal with it i can quit very easily.
I really want to quit and each day feel like shit for not doing so.

I would really appreciate your advice on this one.

Chest pain after quitting?

Has anyone experienced achy lungs, chest tightness or even sharp, shooting pains in your chest/left arm after quitting? 

The first time I quit I didn't have this issue. Second time around, I'm kind of worried. I'm 28, spent 2 years total of my life smoking (usually three cigs a day), normal weight and activity level. Doesn't seem like quitting should cause these symptoms but I also don't think I have an underlying heart issue. It's making it hard to stay focused.

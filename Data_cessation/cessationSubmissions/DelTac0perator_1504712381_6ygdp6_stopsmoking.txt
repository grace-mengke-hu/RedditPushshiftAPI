Health recovery with vaping?

TL;DR: Does vaping low dose nicotine have the same effect as smoking on the recovery of mechanical lung functions like breath volume and ciliary function?

For context, I smoked my last cigarette 7 days ago, but I've been vaping with low dose nicotine since then. Relative daily nicotine intake dropped a ridiculous amount overnight between smoking: vaping (~36mg:6mg respectively). I've already noticed a lot of the little recovery signs (energy levels, skin, better breath, etc), but my breath volume hasn't improved or decreased noticeably. 

This is mostly an idle question, because I've started a 30 day process to wean myself to 0mg nicotine before I drop vaping, regardless. I'm just trying to get a clearer picture of what the short term effects of vaping will be on my recovery timeline. 

As stated in the to;dr, how does vaping with low nicotine dose effect the recovery of mechanical breathing function? Or does nicotine alone have the same paralytic effect as cigarette smoke on the mucociliary elevator? 

All the credible research I've found on the dangerous health effects of vaping has focused on the by-products of heating the flavoring and suspension fluids. I've yet to find any studies that try to explore nicotine's individual effect on mechanical respiration, and so I'm starting to wonder if the nicotine in the vaping fluid is continuing to suppress my lung function and delaying my actual recovery. 

Thanks!

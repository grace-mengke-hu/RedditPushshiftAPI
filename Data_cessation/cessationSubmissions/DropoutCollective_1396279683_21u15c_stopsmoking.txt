So...just quit and having a rough day

So been smoking since I was 18, now i am 23, pack a day smoker, sometimes more. Usually I take a lot of smoke breaks at work when it gets boring or over stressful and so being stuck at work right now I just needed to vent somewhere. My eyes feel painful, my jaw hurts, and I have a weird taste stuck in my mouth. Any advice or suggestions?

The Easyway to quit smoking.

This book is propably somewhat like the bible in this subreddit, but I m guessing there are still people who have not read it here or who have never heard of it. 

Read Allen Carr: The easyway to stop smoking!!! It makes it really easy.

Of course you could sum up the main parts within a few short sentences, but in my opinion there comes a whole experience with reading the book. I am, and I recommend it to all of you, too.

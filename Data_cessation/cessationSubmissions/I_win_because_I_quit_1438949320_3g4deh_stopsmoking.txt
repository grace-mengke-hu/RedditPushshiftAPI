Triple digits, my friends. I'm pretty proud of myself for making it this far. It was rough early on and got easier and easier. Nowadays, I still think of cigarettes but not as much. I really only think of them when I'm stressed out and see someone smoking or I smell it. Other than that, I really don't think much about smoking.

I quit today

Hello. I've been smoking on-and-off since I was 13, and smoking daily since I was 16. I'm now 21. I've been vaping for the past few months, but am simply ready to be free of nicotine. I have ungodly amounts of Big Red gum, several boxes of toothpicks, and a list of very good reasons not to touch tobacco. I'm excited to begin a journey towards better health. Wish me luck.

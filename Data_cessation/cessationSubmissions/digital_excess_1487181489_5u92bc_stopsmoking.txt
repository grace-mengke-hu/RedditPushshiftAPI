Vaping w/ non-nicotine liquids

What are your thoughts?

As you can see with my badge, I'm 84 days in. I feel great and haven't had any significant cravings except the occasional brief thought, quickly brushed away though.

Yet, I have had a few cravings to simply have something like a vape to give me something perhaps for an oral fixation reason? I'm not sure. Especially since I'm nearly 3 months in, I don't know why this is a sudden desire of mine.

My obvious biggest concern is being tricked by an addict justification which could potentially ruin my progress. I never want to smoke again and I just want some honest feedback here.

Do any of you vape non-nicotine liquids? Have any of you done that before and it's caused a relapse?

Thanks for being here as a community, it's reassuring to read the success stories and even the bumps in the road which I can also relate with.

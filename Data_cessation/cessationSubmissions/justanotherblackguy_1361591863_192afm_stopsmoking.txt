Might be my first since I quit.

 So as I sit here in this truck stop waiting for daybreak i'm super stressed. I'm traveling from florida to maryland and can't drive at night or bad weather. Reason being is that my car has electrical problems causing the headlights to malfunction. The pack of cigs left on the backseat by a friend are ultra tempting. Hopefully I can lean this seat back and sleep while fighting the temptation.

Am I the only one? :-(

Am I the only pathetic fucking fuck, that my "quits" always last 3-5 hours, with "highlights" of 10 hours? I have read Allen Carr's book 10 times, and it logically clicked to me immediately. But still :-( I don't feel any physical pain, but still I go back. Maybe I don't believe in me, or think it is supposed to be difficult and self-fail proactively, but having read the book, I know it's easy, or at the very least not that hard. Haven't even reached any of the discomfort people talk about here, like restlessness, feeling like having the flew, sleep problems, lack of concentration, etc, and still I bail out at the first insecurity. Have I no will power at all? 



I think I live the problem before it actually is there. Like, "I'll feel terrible in 2 hours, let's buy cigs now", before I have any problem at all. And I've read a ton of things, and know this is a lie and a junkie's brain trick, and know worst case scenario isn't that bad, and doesn't last that long. But I seem to be such a fucking baby, scared of just the possibility of problem. And yes, the possibility of lung cancer is incomperable. But still. I know the correct pov, I know the junkie's logic, I know the tricks, I know the triggers and what to respond. Still. What a fucking pussy I am :-( Should I berate my weak self? Congratulating doesn't seem to work. It's too slow(?) "Congratulations for 2 hours. Congratulations for 2h and 1 minute, and 2 minutes, and 3 minutes, and ..." smoking again. Reset the apps, for the billionth time. =8-(


...Sorry for this rant(?), but I know all the logic, the pov, the psychological tricks, I've read everything, and all these logically click to me, but I miss something. ...Any help would be greatly and desperately appreciated. Thanks :-(

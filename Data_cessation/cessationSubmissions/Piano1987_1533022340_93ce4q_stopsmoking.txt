Smokefree for 10 months but lately I have urges

It's weird. For about 2 weeks now I have moments throughout the day where I think of just buying a pack and light one up.

I miss the feeling of that initial rush you get. A feeling I haven't even remotely thought about for months.

Don't know what to think of it and why I have these thoughts.

I stopped smoking for almost 2 years between 2013-15 and know how little it takes become a full time smoker again. So this situation is kinda scary.

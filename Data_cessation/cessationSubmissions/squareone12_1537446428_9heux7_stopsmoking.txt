Struggling to concentrate

Hey guys, I'm on my second day of quitting smoking and its going pretty well. A bit of a problem is that I have uni work to do - I have an essay due Wednesday next week (in 5 days) and I'm really struggling to concentrate or think coherently. Does this pass pretty soon or do other people have similar experiences?

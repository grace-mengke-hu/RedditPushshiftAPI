[Day 1] Accountability post

Didn't think it would be today, but here we are. Fact is, my vape pen sprung a leak and since I was just a few days away from stopping that anyway, decided to say fuck it and give it a go now.

I smoked for nearly 40 years, at least 30 of those non-filters. I started losing weight last June and decided once I hit target I'd begin. And I did. At the start of November I had my last cigarette, switched over to vaping as the method to wean myself. We're about to see if that worked. I was down to virtually no nicotine in the juice, and down to 15-20 puffs a day for the past couple weeks. I stopped going out to vape at the morning and afternoon breaks, just a couple at lunch.

I'm feeling fairly confident, I've been pushing myself VERY hard to get healthier theses last 8 months, and I've met every challenge I've put in front of myself (lost 80 pounds, I'm now able to run 10K in a little over an hour, gym 3-4X weekly, vitamins, actually going to see a physician for the first time this decade in a couple weeks), but this one is a little different. I am nervous, nervous about relapsing, nervous about being a dick to all those around me, nervous about gaining back a lot of weight, but I'll give it a go anyway.

So this post is purely me being accountable to me, let's see how it goes down.

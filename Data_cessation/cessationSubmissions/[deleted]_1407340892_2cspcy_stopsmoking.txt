Turning over a thousand stones. Best wishes on your smoke-free day.

Been going very strong with non-smoking. Traveled to a client I haven't seen in months. Used to smoke while I worked there. Sudden strong urge to smoke. I know I will get through it. Just posting here because it helps. I have to turn over a thousand stones to get through this. Best wishes on your smoke-free day.

Stop Smoking

I was admitted into the hospital on 3/1/17 because I couldn't breath.  Turns out I now have COPD for life.  Was told if I continue to smoke I won't survive one more bout with anything chest related.  Apparently I was almost gone.  Being in the hospital makes it easier to not smoke.  However I could be going home soon and I am finding myself planning my next cigarette (which I do not want to have).  I'm now afraid to leave the hospital but I've been here since the 1st of March.

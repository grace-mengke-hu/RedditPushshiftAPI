Car broke down on the way to work. Day 2 of quitting.

My car broke down on the way to work today. Currently in the process of getting to a mechanic to get it fixed. OF COURSE this would happen on the 2nd day of me quitting. I'm incredibly stressed and just want a cigarette. I'm resisting though. If I can make it through this test, the rest will be easy, right?

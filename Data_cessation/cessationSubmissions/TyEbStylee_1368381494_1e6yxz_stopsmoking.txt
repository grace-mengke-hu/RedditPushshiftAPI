Caved last night when drunk. Writing well hungover today. This is what i've got so far. hmmm.... should I keep going after work?

Fuck cigarettes.  Seriously, I don’t think I can say it any differently.  FUCK CIGARETTES.  If I could go back and change one thing as I was growing up, smoking would be that one thing.  I would love to be able to travel back in time to when my fourteen year old self took that first puff, kick him square in the balls and yell, “hey, dummy, this is not a good idea!”  But as I have yet to figure out an idea as complex as time travel, I guess I’ll just have to settle for the next best thing; kicking other teens in the nuts and calling them morons whenever I catch them smoking.  Seeing as I’m already doomed I might as well just live vicariously through this generations youth by physically assaulting them in an effort to cut down on the number of new smokers.  I wonder how well that argument would hold up in court?

Random update

I don't know what my badge says today, I'm on a mobile app so I can't see it, I think it's around 220 days. I rarely post here anymore but I stay subscribed because I honestly would not have quit smoking without this sub. I found it by accident, I wasn't even really thinking about quitting. I 'wanted to' but it was too hard now so I'd try 'later'. After all I'd watched my mom not quit for 30 years even after my grandmother died, so it must be impossible, right?

I read the threads here, I read Allen Carr's EasyWay and it made a huge difference. I read the beginning of Freedom from Nicotine on whyquit.com and it helped more. The first few hours days weeks were tough. The lessons read, and the multiple apps I downloaded, and reading all the threads here helped more than I can say. My husband quit 2 days after me using Chantix and he's still not off it but we're both still quit.

I'm glad I'm still subbed here because honestly it's been tough a few times lately. My still smoking mother and aunt moved in with me and the reasons I quit seem far away after so long. Damn addict brain is always there waiting. But I remind myself how proud I am and all the health and financial benefits I've gained. I don't want to smoke again because I don't want to quit again. 

I'll also mention that I gained weight after quitting but so what? Knowing that I had beaten nicotine gave me confidence to start c25k and keto to get healthy and now I've lost 50 pounds and am loving life. 

If you're thinking about quitting take the advice in this sub. Read Allen Carr's EasyWay and Freedom from Nicotine on whyquit.com. you can do it.

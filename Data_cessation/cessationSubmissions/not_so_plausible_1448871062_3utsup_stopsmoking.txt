I'm nearing the end of Day 2 here...sitting on my computer...anxious as fuck and feeling lightheaded. Just tell me it's normal and I'll be fine.

Fuckkkk I'm already on meds for anxiety so this shit isn't helping. However, if someone could just tell me that they also experienced this quitting, I'd feel a hell of a lot better.

cold turkey from ~3 packs a day, please help

Hello everyone, thanks for reading this. 

First a little background on my smoking habbits, I'm currently 19 y/o and been smoking regularly since I was 11. So 8 years with only one 8 month break.

I had my first ciggie at the age of 9 and started smoking for real two years later.

Over the years I've dealt with some personal issues that made it so I spent most of my teenage years locked up in my room all day, no school, no work, just sitting in my room. 
Which gave me a lot of time to gradually increase my number of ciggies a day out of boredom and stress.

At one point I smoked about 50-60 cigs a day (around the age of 17 till the age of 19).
I had thought about quitting a lot, but I never got further than a few hours without a cig.

In january this year, I bought a vape, and started off at 12mg liquids, in hopes of reducing the nicotine over time and eventually stopping.
However, I've recently been under a LOT of stress and without me even noticing I ramped it up a notch.

I've been vaping 10-20ml a day for about two months now, most of my juice is at 18mg, some of it is at 12.

Now for the fun part: I'm completely broke and living on my own, so I need to give up the habbit.

I quit in the middle of a vaping session 15 minutes ago when I realised I was vaping myself in to a financial grave. (and a real grave as well)

I plan on quitting cold turkey because I'm almost out of juice and normal cigs, and I really don't want to buy new ones to ween it off.

As stated before, I'm doing this out of financial reasons so I'm looking for ways to make it easier for FREE. I can't afford medical help with this and I can't afford patches or gum or whatever.

any help would be appreciated, feel free to share your experiences as well (: thanks

TL;DR: how to quit cold turkey for free from about 10-20 ml 18mg e-juice.

Depression and anxiety since quitting smoking?

Hi everyone. I quit smoking about a month ago, the physical withdrawal I found quite easy but in the last couple of weeks I have been experiencing really bad depression and anxiety. It's very unusual for me and I can only attribute it to quitting smoking 

&amp;nbsp;

I can withstand any kind of physical pain, but I can't handle it when things start messing with my mind. If this continues I'll have to start smoking again, ill health due to smoking is preferable over mental problems.

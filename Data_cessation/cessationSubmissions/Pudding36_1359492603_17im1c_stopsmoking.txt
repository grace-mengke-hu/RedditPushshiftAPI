Quitters Cough, any information available?

It's been 3 weeks since I've had a cigarette, when I hope out of the shower I end up coughing up some sort of mucus, this time it was white. Previous times it was brown and to be expected. I'm wondering if there is any warning signs or anything I should be aware of? What little information I could find on google, it said it lasts 3 to 4 weeks, but only seems to be getting worse.

One of the worst days in a long time, but i did not smoke today.

Today I got a call after work from my wife that she and our two girls one 3 and one 6 found their pet cat named rabbit almost unconscious on the floor after school.  They took her to the vet.   Long story short i was there with my wife for 4 hours and the cat was put down.   I then had to go home and tell the kids, and that was the worst part.

The reason i bring this up is because 4 weeks ago i would have had to smoke like a chimmney through the whole ordeal but today i didnt smoke.  To tell you the truth i havent even had a craving for one.  I didnt even think about it until i got home and my mother in law was leaving, i could smell it on her.  Then i thought i am so glad i do not smell like that any more.  

For those of you just starting the quit hang in there it gets easier.  Remember there is no good reason to smoke.

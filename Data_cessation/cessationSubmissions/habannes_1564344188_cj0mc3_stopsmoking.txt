Help me help my friend!

Hi! My friend is trying to stop smoking. He have had some relapses lately, and I said that if he could make it through the week we would celebrate. 

Do you guys have any tips for me helping him?

I'm trying to think of some sort of reward to get him motivated but I canÂ´t think of something good...

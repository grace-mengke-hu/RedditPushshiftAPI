Terrified quitter, any advice?

I've been smoking for almost 10 years and I'm a 27 y/o female... I know, it's awful. I'm tired of it. I don't want to spend the money anymore, I want to brighten my smile, I want to not smell like smoke, and I definitely want to feel better/improve my overall health.

The hardest part for me is going to be visiting my local pub. Several of my best friends work there, and that's where almost all of my other friends usually meet after work for a pint or two (usually every other day or so) and we always sit outside on the patio. Most of them smoke, and that's where smoking is allowed. I rarely ever smoke at home or work (and I mean RARELY), but I do smoke in my car and I smoke a lot when I'm at the pub. I can usually go through half a pack if not more when I'm up there.

I was there yesterday with my best friend and a few others, we stayed a little longer than usual, and of course I smoked... But I've been wanting to change that every day for a while to where I've decided enough is enough. I'm terrified though. I've tried and failed so many times that I don't even want to tell anyone I'm quitting anymore because of the disappointment.

Any advice or support for someone in my spot? I haven't had any today, and I don't want to. I don't really ever have "cravings" for cigarettes, but the habit itself is so strong that the triggers will do me in if I can't combat them.

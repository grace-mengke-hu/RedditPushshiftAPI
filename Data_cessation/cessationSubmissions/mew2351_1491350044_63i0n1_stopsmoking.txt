Quit attempt #14

After my dad having a stroke (he had all the risk factors for having a stroke, including smoking but quit ~10 years ago), I am trying to quit once again. I'm in my mid twenties, in graduate school and have been lectured over and over again about the risks of smoking and this time it has to stick. Today I messed up, I had to run errands and I smoked in my fathers fancy car (a huge no-no) while stressing about my dad's health status. I am so ashamed of myself and I have to make sure it get the smell out tonight so that way my parents can take my dad for his first GP appointment post-stroke. Nothing like a family medical emergency to smack you into taking care of yourself.

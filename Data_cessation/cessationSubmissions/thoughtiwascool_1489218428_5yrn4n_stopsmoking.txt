Just smoked my last cigarette. Dear God, WHHHHHHYYYY?!?

Alright, what started off as a bad bout of cat allergies had morphed into crippling bronchitis and tonight as I struggled to breathe in my cigarette, I realized the absurdity I was submitting myself too.  So, I smoked another one.  But then, when I heard myself gasping while trying to talk to a friend on the phone, I subsequently began to have a mini panic attack about how I was LITERALLY SUFFOCATING!  Plus, my friend could hear me wheezing.  I decided, this is it!  No more excuses.   Annnnnnnd, I smoked another one.  
 

Now, I am laying here, face numb because I can't breathe, and preparing for the onslaught of Hell that awaits.  I've already warned my friends to get ready to meet the anti-Christ (I've been down this road before, I know all about what is coming!) and have mentally prepared myself to feel the blood curling rage/panic/crying that will happen in the shower/weird moments I depress myself that my life will never be cool, interesting, or my own because of cigarettes not being present.  I legit wish I could have a reality crew present in my mind to document the shit storm of irrationality it's about to go through.  Feel like it could be real helpful to a Psych 101 class or something.

I'm 26 years old and I started smoking pretty heavily at 13.  But the buck stops here!   

tl;dr: I'm excited for psychosis to kick in.

I'm 4 days in. How did you deal with the fallout; congestion, mucus, etc.

I'm 4 days in. This is the longest I've gone quitting, without cheating here and there. Mentally I'm doing really well, but the physical symptoms are hard. Basically feel flu-ish and it screws with my day. Currently I'm taking mucinex and using my Vape pen as little as possible (equivalent of 2-3 cigarettes a day). Im totally on board but I'd like to not feel sick as little as possible.

What did you guys do to minimize the symptoms? TIA

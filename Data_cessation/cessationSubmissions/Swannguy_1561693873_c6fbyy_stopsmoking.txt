No Smoking, No Energy, WTF?

Quit smoking 5 weeks ago (although still on NRT). There’s been many great noticeable changes, including no more “smoker’s cough” and able to take deep breaths again &amp; chest feels much better. 
However, my energy level has totally dropped! Dragging myself through work every day &amp; falling asleep on the couch as soon as I get home. I thought energy levels were supposed to improve after quitting, but I had waaaay more when I smoked! 
Anyone else experienced this?

A Big Thank You

Two years ago I decided to stop smoking. While I wasn't certain If I was able to do this, I didn't know there was someone else that knew I am strong enough, capable enough and determined enough. In fact 83.748 people were here to support me and provide me with their wisdom. You changed my life for the better and I'll be forever grateful to you for that.

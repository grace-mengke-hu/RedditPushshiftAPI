Day 3

Firstly, for those of you that haven't watched 'None-Stop' yet then go watch it! Watched it last night. 7.5/10, easy. 

I woke up this morning with a clear mind. I'm not sure about you guys but when I smoked as I did, if I had say about 10 hours sleep then I would wake up in a state of withdrawal. I could feel it, I could feel the nicotine receptors in my brain had sizzled out. They say that after 8 hours, your nicotine levels drop by 90%. So you can imagine 10-12 hours of sleep. 

Here's where it gets interesting for me, on the weekend I sleep around 10 hours, largely to catch up on sleep because I have to wake up early for work, plus I go to the gym so my body needs rest, so I give it to it. So I'm used to waking up in a state of withdrawal symptoms and I know that either topping up with nicotine/caffeine/sugar etc gets me going after a few hours. Basically, once I get the right stuff into my body then I'm good. 

The problem for me lays in the fact that this is a vicious cycle. Imagine I didn't have any nicotine in my system then after 10 hours sleep, would I wake up in a state of withdrawal? Very much doubt that. And you know what my lovely people? I woke up today after 10 hours of sleep fresh as fuck. That can only mean one thing:

It's been 3 days and there's no nicotine in my system!!!

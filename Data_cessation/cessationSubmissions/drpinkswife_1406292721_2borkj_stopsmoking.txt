I'm a cyborg.

*I decided not to include the photo I just took.*


"Just go about your day like normal". 

Yeah like a normal cyborg. The first electrode is smack in the middle of my chest just below my collar bone. A normal shirt doesn't cover it up. Then there are all the thick wires attached to the black box monitoring my heart.

Welcome to smoking for  25+ years.

Edit: Just to be clear, this is a 24-hour tape...I can take it off tomorrow. So far...I'm extremely lucky!

Pot and tobacco

Hi guys! I'm still nicotine free since 29/12/15!
And I'm not coming back.
I don't know if this topic had already been discussed here, but you guys are always kind and open that I don't think it will be an issue if I write this down.
So, lately I've been having a lot of problems sleeping, I can stay in bed and sleep until late in the morning but I can't get to sleep early (I can't fall asleep before 2/2:30).
Usually when I had these periods of stress I enjoyed a joint to relax and fall asleep without much hustle.
But since my resolution to not touch tobacco anymore in any way, I wanted to ask: what is your relationship with pot? And you pot smokers out here, how do you assume it without assuming nicotine with it?

Thank you and sorry for the long post/offtopic (maybe?)

Have a nice day!

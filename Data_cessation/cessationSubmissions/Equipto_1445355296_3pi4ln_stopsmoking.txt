Woops, missed my 2 year anniversary.

Completely missed my 2 year anniversary. Want to know why? Because I don't think about smoking cigarettes or using nicotine in any form....ever. I remember it being unbearably difficult when I first quit, I even fractured my toe during a craving about 2 weeks in. What I'm trying to say, is cigarettes can fuck off and that no matter how hard it is, it only gets easier and easier as time goes on.

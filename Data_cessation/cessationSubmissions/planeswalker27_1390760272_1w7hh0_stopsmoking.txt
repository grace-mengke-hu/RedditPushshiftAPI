Get rid of tar stains with activated charcoal (x-post from /r/LPT)

I quit smoking last march. While my toothpaste with whitening has altered the color of my teeth, there are some persistent stains on the bottom front teeth where I used to inhale. I read that activated charcoal had been used throughout history to clean teeth, so I broke open a capsule of it by biting it and then brushed. After one brushing, stains are greatly reduced, so I plan to do this a few times. 

Warning: the clean teeth are worth it, but be prepared to scrub your sink!

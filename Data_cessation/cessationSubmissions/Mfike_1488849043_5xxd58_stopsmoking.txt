When does this get easier?

I quit a month ago.  I have never in my life gone this long without smoking and I am so proud of what I have done so far.  Weeks 2-3 were a breeze!  I was shocked how easily the shift happened... but for the past week I have thought about smoking so much. I am so irritable. I won't smoke. I'm just too damn stubborn and proud to do that. But at what point will I stop being so pissed about not smoking?   I had that feeling and I lost it!  I want the feeling of 2 weeks ago back!

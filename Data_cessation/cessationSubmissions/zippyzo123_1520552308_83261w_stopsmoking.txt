Need a better substitute

So I’m on day 15, not smoking, I work evenings and weekends so am around all day at home mainly. Normally I would be going out smoking at least every half hour and now I’m finding myself eating shit to fill the boredom! If I don’t stop I’m going to be fat as hell! I’ve got 2 children at school and my youngest who is at home with me, she’s quite a handful so as much as I’d love to get out walking or go gym it’s a nightmare getting her to walk anywhere!! What can I do to keep busy and stop myself stuffing my face all day?!

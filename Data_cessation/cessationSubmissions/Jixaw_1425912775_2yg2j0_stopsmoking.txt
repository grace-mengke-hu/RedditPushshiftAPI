Why did you guys start smoking?

I myself use the excuse that i started because i broke up with my ex a couple of years ago. Which is not true. Sure, i started around that time. but there was really no reason smoke to be honest. I never felt any different about my ex because of it. Maybe it was boredom? it's hard to recall.

Let's hear everyone's stories. Since nobody started smoking because they liked it.

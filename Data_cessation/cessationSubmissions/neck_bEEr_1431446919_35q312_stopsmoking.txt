It's officially day zero for me. Does any one have some advice?

I have been smoking off and on for about 5 years now and seriously smoking for the last year due to the stress of school. I told my self that after school is over I'm never allowed another cigarette. My last final is in 4 hours and I just had my last cigarette ever about 20 minutes ago. Any tips to help guarantee that.

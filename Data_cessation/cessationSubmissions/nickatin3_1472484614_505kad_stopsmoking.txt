Smoked last night.

Then I woke up from a terrible dream. I have been very stressed recently from losing my job which turns out is a positive because it was a toxic place. However I let my anger seep into my relationship with my partner because he was the business owner. I wanted to avoid that situation but it was inevitable really. The first day sucked being unemployed but I realized the silly mistakes I made and I won't let happen again. I have been smoke free for almost 8 months after smoking for 6 years. This is now when I kick everything into gear, don't smoke, and prove to MYSELF that I can do this and become a better me. Congrats to everyone had made the choice to quit. It becomes so hard at times but it becomes a lot easier! You learn to manage the stress that once made you smoke again. Stay strong!!!!

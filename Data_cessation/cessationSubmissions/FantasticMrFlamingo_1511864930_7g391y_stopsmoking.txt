I’m in a pickle and I really want to quit, please help!

Hey guys, thank you for taking the time to read my post! I’m really in a pickle with smoking and I really want to stop. Today it’s really hit me hard that I have a proper addiction and it’s taking a toll on my physical and mental health. Every time I smoke i can feel pain in my lungs and kidneys and it’s even taking a toll on my self esteem, I know that should already be a motivator but i just can’t stop myself. I usually have a tally on my hand on how many cigarettes I’ve been smoking everyday and it sits around 5 - 10 a day which is a cut back from 20 - 25 a day. I understand that it may not seem like that much to some people who smoke but anything more than 0 a day is too much for me. Unfortunately I don’t have much financial backing to be able to go to a doctor or get proper medication for my addiction like nicotine patches or anything like that and right now i’m honestly open to anything that can at least help me cut down. I’ve been smoking for 2 years now but when I started I told myself I’d stop after a year, call it wishful thinking if you will. I did go pretty well quitting after the one year attempt and even all the many other times I tried but no matter what I do it’s just an addiction that just keeps coming around. I really am starting to hate myself for every cigarette I smoke and i’m just wanting help. Any advice or new ideas are welcome Im just getting desperate! Thank you again for taking the time to read my post.

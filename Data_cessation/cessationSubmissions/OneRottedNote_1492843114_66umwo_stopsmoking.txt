This morning sucks but its nearly 2 weeks!

Coming up to tthe 2 week mark, this is literally the longest I have not smoked for in 15 years. I cant wait till I can say 1 month, 3 months, 6, 1 year etc etc. I wanted to quit before I was 30 (birthday is end of august) so I feel it is possible. This is probably the 5-6th time I have tired, but actually doing things differently this time ie reaching out to people (known and unknown).

I feel strong generally, i dont want nicotine, I do want to be healthy but everyday at the moment feels long and I generally feel rubbish i.e. had a 2 week long cold, 1 week of insomnia, congestion, lung pains (i think i have had quitters flu). I know i will be better in the long term, but man I am hating the run-down feeling. I feel incapacitated and its hitting my confidence. I feel glum and down most days due to it.

I'm having a bad morning and just need to vent.

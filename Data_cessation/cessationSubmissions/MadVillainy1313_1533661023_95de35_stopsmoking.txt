My last pack. Here's my deal...

So, I'm 26 and I need to get my fucking life sorted. It takes struggle to make muscle, so nothing is gonna happen overnight; I wanna change more than one thing about my life, but I need to start somewhere. 

I figure taking care of the "little things" like quitting smoking will be the best place to start because it will probably have the largest knock-on effect as far as subsequent changes that I want to make (saving money, more energy, exercising more etc.). 

Any tips you all have would be greatly appreciated! I have 3 cigarettes left in my last pack. After those, I'm done! I will do this. Thanks for any encouragement you can provide, as well. 

All the best to all of you.

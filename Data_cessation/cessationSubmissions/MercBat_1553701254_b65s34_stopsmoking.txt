Lung scan

I'm sure this may be a different and more difficult thing to answer from the US but I just wanted to ask of anyone has requested from there doctor to have a chest scan or chest xray to see the damage, iv smoked for a long time and a lot. 

Iv an unrelated appointment with my doctor soon and I wonder if it was worth asking for because my paranoia is out of control when it comes to the state of my lung, if I get a pain or out of breath fast I think oh God it's time my lungs are done. 

Has anyone asked such a thing from the there doctor?

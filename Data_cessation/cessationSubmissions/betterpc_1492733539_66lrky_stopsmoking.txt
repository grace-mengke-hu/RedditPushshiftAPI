Downloaded 2 apps, joined this subreddit, wish me luck.

I like how apps keep counting my saved money, show health benefits, etc. Really helps with motivation.

I was smoking-free from August 2011-June 2016 but falled back into this nasty habit after a break-up. Today on April 21st I flushed down the toilet the remaining cigs, and I never want to smoke again. I hope I will succeed.

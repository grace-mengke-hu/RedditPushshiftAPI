24 days, it gets much easier, really fast

If you're just starting your quit, rest assured that it gets much easier, MUCH easier, and much quicker than I expected. Once I made it through the first 10-15 days, it became a sporadic thing to crave a cigarette, and "craving" isn't even the right word anymore. I just think, "Hmm, I would usually have smoked a cigarette right now". I ignore that thought or I smile at it, and it goes away. 

I know it depends on a lot of factors and it isn't as easy for everyone (for instance I live with my girlfriend who doesn't smoke, and I only see my friends who smoke in the weekends), but I guarantee that it will be easier than you think, sooner than you think.

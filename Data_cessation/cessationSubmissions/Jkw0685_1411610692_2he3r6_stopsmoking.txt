Today is 1 whole month:)

I have made it one month smoke free. I quite cold turkey and feel great being a non smoker. I rarely have urges to smoke anymore and if I do they last about half a minute. I found the best thing for me is exercise and staying away from booze. I quite one time before for three years but starte after a huge family tragedy ! I am so happy I made it this far I never post but come here everday and read others posts. Keep a positive outlook and you can beat the nasty habit and if you need help along the way feel free to message me! Best of luck everyone

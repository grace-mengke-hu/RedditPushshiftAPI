I DID IT!

I  can't believe it. A year (and a week) has passed without smoking a cigar! I was smoking for 13 years before and hadn't manage to quit for more than a week! I am very proud of myself. I think this is one of the most important aspect of quitting smoking. You gain your self respect back, knowing you are in control and your life is not dictated by a stupid habit.
I know now, that anyone how sets their mind truly in quitting can do it. I have to admit though, there are still times that I crave for a cigarette... I hope I can do another year, and another, and another....

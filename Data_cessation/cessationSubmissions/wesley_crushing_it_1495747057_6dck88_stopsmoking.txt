Day 18 and I feel like I'm losing it

I've tried quitting before, but this is definitely the first quit where I really wanted it. And I've worked hard to keep up good habits: I'm exercising, meditating, taking my vitamins and drinking hella water, I have a list of reasons that I keep with me, I read this sub for encouragement. And apart from the gnarly first three days, I've been feeling amazing! 

But yesterday and today I've been feeling like I'm about to lose it. I keep alternating between being super sad and absolutely furious, I can barely eat, I struggle to focus long enough to hold a conversation. I don't even want a cigarette, I just feel like I'm gonna absolutely lose my shit if someone so much as looks at me wrong.

Any advice or words of encouragement would be very much appreciated. This is the point where I failed in my last quit, and I really want to make it through this time.

UPDATE: As of today, I'm on day 28 and things are looking up! Everyone's responses here helped a lot, as did keeping myself distracted through the worst of it. Around day 21 it started getting easier, and now I'm feeling pretty happy and productive again. Plus the benefits of quitting just keep gettin better and better.

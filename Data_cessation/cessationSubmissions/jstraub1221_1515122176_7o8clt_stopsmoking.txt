10 Days! Cravings getting worse?

I’m 10 Days in and so far the past 2 days have been the worst.  I’ve smoked for about 20 years and this is the first time I have tried. I came down with the flu last week and had gone a few days without smoking so I figured I would run with it. I mean why not? So I quit cold turkey, no vaping, no x amount allowed a day, no nicotine replacement , I Just quit. I thought I was doing well, it had been hard but I was getting by, but the past 2 days have been hell.  I’m sure it’s going back to work after the holiday, back to the routine and all that is contributing, also had a few glasses of Vino tonight so that doesn’t help. I held strong but all I could think is I just want ONE. But as I know from this sub just one isn’t worth it and it’s a dangerous slope. It gets better right? Any tips on how to get through the craving? Also have been getting headaches almost daily. How long does it take to get through this part? 

Thank you for this sub, it’s been so helpful and inspirational to see how many people have gone through this already or are just starting their journey!

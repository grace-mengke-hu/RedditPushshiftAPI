I just can't quit. Please help me.

So I have been trying to quit for the past week. But I just can't do it. I have never managed to go beyond a whole day without smoking. I know it is ridiculous, but I can't help it. 

My problem is that my whole family smokes and even if I don't buy them I will always be able to get a cig. I usually fight with my mind for 5 min to a couple hours and then I'll give up. I always feel like I will loose something when I quit. I just don't want to give up my smokes. Especially those with friends or when I am walking through the streets in those cold seasons. Even though they make me sick, feel weak, lazy, sleepy, depressive. Yet I still feel like I won't be able to enjoy anything without them.

I know it's all bullshit but I just can't stop. I am not even smoking for that long. Only for 1 year ( I am 18 now ) . But I don't even remember how life was without smoking.

Writing all this just makes me want to smoke one right now.

Please anybody just help me.

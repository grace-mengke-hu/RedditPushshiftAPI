Has anyone tried quitting while sick with a cold?

I coincidentally started getting a cold about 2-3 days into quitting, and it has REALLY helped me stay the course. Previously I would smoke through any sickness, but since I had already started quitting I think it was easier to justify "My throat already hurts SO BADLY, smoking will be unbearable". 

Anyways, I'm finally doing it! (although quite sickly at the moment)

Mother is heavy smoker, any advice on helping her quit?

Hello Reddit,

My mother has been smoking since her teens and is about 60 right now. She is a heavy smoker who was told she will get emphysema if she does not begin quitting soon.

She owns a box of nicotine patches and has tried them a couple times. The last time she tried it she said that the weeks that she was thinking about quitting stressed her to the point of smoking even more and boosted her level of cravings to the point that when she did put it on (the largest size) she took it off before the end of the day was out so she could satisfy it.

We are a more quiet "make no waves" sort of family. If one of us has a problem, we tend to internalize it and keep it to ourselves so that we aren't a "burden" on anyone else, even if we know that they (especially my father and I), would drop everything in a heartbeat to help.

How should I push without being too pushy?

**Edit:** I noticed in some of /r/stopsmoking posts that people rave about a quitting app, I'd like to just note that none of us own smartphones right now.

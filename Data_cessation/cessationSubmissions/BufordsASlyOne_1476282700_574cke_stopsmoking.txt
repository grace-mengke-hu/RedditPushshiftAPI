Situational Smoking/cravings

Hi, first of all thanks to everyone here for their support.

I have my kids part-time. When I have them, I don't smoke, and I feel good about not smoking. As soon as they go back to their mom's, I'm right to the gas station for a pack. Might not finish it, might throw it away after a few but I can't seem to get past it.

Just ending my 5 days with the kids, totally smoke free. Just dreading the drive home after work. I have plans to go to the gym and then trying to plan out the rest of my night to avoid the gas station. 

Not really a question, more of a pep talk for myself I guess. Good luck to all!

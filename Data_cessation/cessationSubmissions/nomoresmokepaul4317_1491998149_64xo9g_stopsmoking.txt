Day 10 - Becoming a thing of the past

If you are in the first 5 days of your quit let me tell you something. It does get easier. 

Day 10 - I am starting to forget the struggle. 

wellquit.com says "10 days - The "average" ex-user is down to encountering less than two crave episodes per day, each less than 3 minutes."

I have only started this journey and I could still fall any day. BUT the pain/thoughts/Brain Fog are beginning to fade. 

Just stick with it guys

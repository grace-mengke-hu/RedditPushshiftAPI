Fell off the horse

Well, it happened. I gave into the temptation and had a few smokes over the last week. Today, I have reset my counter. The previous post I had here helped me push through the first month. Just have to keep going and trying till it sticks, right? 

I can't count how many times I've gone down the path of quitting and started over. This time I'm not going to start over. Success is a series of failures. Hopefully this time around I'll be stronger and be able to kick this habit. Thank you guys for always being there and this sub is the greatest tool I've found.

Help! I still crave cigarettes after I quit 10 months ago

So as you can tell by the title I quit smoking cigarettes in July of last year. I had been a heavy smoker for the majority of my life (I had my first cigarette when I was in 5th grade, started smoking a pack a day by 18 years old and I am now 34 years old). Even after 10 months after I quit I still get huge cravings for a cigarette. Lately, it's gotten to the point where I keep thinking I should get a pack so I can have one now and then but I don't want to give into this urge. I can't understand why after 10 months I still crave cigarettes and it's become extremely frustrating. Has anyone else had this problem? If so what have you done about it?

Just hit 100 days

I started smoking in my early 20s since a bunch of my friends were smokers.  I built it up steadily to about 4 / 5 packs a week, about a cigarette every hour on a day off.  

It's been a very smooth and easy process for me.  I stopped having cravings after 3 days, for the most part.  After that I'd just get a feeling like "well it's about time to go smoke" and sometimes I'd even start to get up from my computer desk to go outside and smoke before remembering that I'd quit.  But that's just habit stuff.  

I think one reason it was so easy for me is because I only smoked outside.  Also, I bought a new car about two years ago and I stopped smoking in my car at that point.  

A big impetus to get myself to quit was a huge increase in my monthly rent.  I just couldn't really afford the high cost of cigarettes anymore, not without working overtime to pay for it, which seemed silly to me.  

Since I've quit, I love the extra free time I've regained.  It took me about 5 minutes a cigarette, so I would spend at least an hour each day off from work just smoking.  I love that I can taste food better.  That I can jog for a mile without getting out of breath.  And of course the extra money in my bank account.   Even though it's only been 100 days, that's already over $430 dollars that I've saved.  

I only wish I'd quit earlier.  I'd heard horror stories about how hard it was which demotivated me from even trying.  I'm here to say that at least for me, it's one of the easiest things I've ever done.

I've set my date, and I'm freaking out!

Hey guys, I've set my date to quit. As life is moving around me I have readied myself to stop smoking. Also, ironically, all my smoking friends have decided to quit individually. So peer pressure sort of kicked in and pushed me to want to do it for myself. 

I however, am TERRIFIED. I literally want to cry about it. I relate it to ending a 7 year abusive Stockholm syndrome bullshit relationship.

At what point did you guys feel like you had it all in control?

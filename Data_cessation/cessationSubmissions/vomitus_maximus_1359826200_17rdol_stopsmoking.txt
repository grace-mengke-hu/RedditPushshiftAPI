First real attempt at quitting. Need help with the nicotine patch! 

Hello Reddit! I have a few questions about the nicotine patch. It says there are three steps and step one with the highest dosage is for those who smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day. I smoke less than 10 cigarettes a day. Why can't you cut the patch (to reduce the dosage)? Does it destroy some transmitting mechanism? 

Also, if I skip ahead to step 2 since it is a lower dosage, I'm unsure how I'm going to make it last 6 weeks instead of 4. Can I leave the patch on for a couple days at a time? Will it still release nicotine on say the second or third day of wearing it? 

Ok, one last question! I still have a full pack of cigarettes. I wanted to start the patch today but I'm worried that the temptation of those cigarettes being around won't help. But I've also heard that people who start using the patch still smoke one or two on the first few days. I can't bring myself to destroy them (they're American Spirits, and lord they are expensive.) I'm wondering if I should set a quit date for in the future, probably two days from now, after I smoke my last cigarette. 

Hopefully your expertise and personal experience will help me quit! Thanks Reddit!

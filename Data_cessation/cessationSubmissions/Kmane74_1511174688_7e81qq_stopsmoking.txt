4 Months Smoke Free, nicotine free everything!

4 Month since I touched any cigarette, vaporizer, or nicotine product, including any other products that can be smoked other than tobacco of course. I'm so proud of myself wow quit cold turkey I'm amazed how far I came. I was told by a wise older man once that "If you're not moving forward you're moving backwards". Find that to be very true. Now I find myself sensitive to any type of burning or tobacco/weed smell etc!!! 120 days later who would've thought

TL;DR : I got 120 clean from every smoking, and nicotine product you can name. It gets easier never give up!

Rededicating to Quitting Today.

I'm sure I'm not in the only one who has attempted to quit over and over again and I'm excited to join this community for encouragement during my next attempt.  I quit for 2 months after smoking 10-20 cigarettes per day for about 3 years.  I fell back into the routine the last two weeks.  I'm here to share and read others thoughts and strategies for quitting.  Good luck to you all!

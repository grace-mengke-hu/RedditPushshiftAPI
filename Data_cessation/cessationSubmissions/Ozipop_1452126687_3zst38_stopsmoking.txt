5 Months and I'm Losing it

I am really starting to feel like I had it all together better back when I was smoking. I feel like I am much more incopetant now than I ever was when I was smoking. Some part of me is trying to convince me that I was an all around better person then. Now I am generally depressed, lack self will and control. Seems like I have lost a lot of passion for life.

I do smell better though I guess..

Hep with Chantix.

Hi everyone. 

I’m 12 days into Chantix and I quit smoking 5 days ago - however, the Chantix is destroying me and I’m curious if anyone has experience with stopping the Chantix early and if you still managed to be smoke free? 

I’m exhausted and weak. I’m sleeping about 15hrs a day and I have 0 motivation. 

I’d be grateful to hear from anyone who has experience with Chantix.

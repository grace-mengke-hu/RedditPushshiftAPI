17 Days

Just wanted to post about my success quitting tobacco. I am now 17 days smoke free! I also quit drinking and am now 24 days sober. I have been using the 21mg patches along with up to four pieces of 4mg gum. I will be switching to 14mg and halfing the amount of gum to two pieces, then 7mg and one piece.

There have been struggles, especially considering that everyone smokes where I work. I have been attending therapy, which has helped me recognize my triggers. I'm building new coping skills and things are becoming easier. 

Here's to 17 more days!

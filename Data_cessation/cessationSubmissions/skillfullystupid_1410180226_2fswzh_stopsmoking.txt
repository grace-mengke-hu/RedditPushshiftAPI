Help on getting over the first three days

I have tired so many times to go cold turkey because I know it's the best way, but usually the end of the second day I fall. I need some advice on getting through it. I've been reading this sub and posting but it has such a hold on me. I start again tomorrow and need some encouragement. I also just ordered allen Carr's book and I've seen the video. Idk sometimes I feel like I'll never quit.

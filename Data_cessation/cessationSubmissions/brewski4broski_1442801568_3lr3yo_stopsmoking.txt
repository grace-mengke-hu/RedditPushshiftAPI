My old circle of friends

There were 9 of us. 6 guys and 3 girls (3 of the guys' gilfriends). 2 years ago there were 7 smokers and 2 non smokers.

As of last night there are 8 non smokers & 1 smoker. 

It's incredible how much people change when they're in a group. And the last remaining smoker smokes about 1/10th of what he used to smoke.

Stop smoking, right now.

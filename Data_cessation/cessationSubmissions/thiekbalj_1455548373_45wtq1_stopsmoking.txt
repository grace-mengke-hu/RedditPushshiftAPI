Nicotine Anonymous the book/process could be helpful to your quit

The title is Nicotine Anonymous: The Book. I'm not too deep into this particular quit and I've never done a 12 step program but a friend has shined some light for me after relating how AA has helped her (she is NOT a 'typical' AA person but it has benefited her immensely). Since getting exposed to it I'm feeling more confident (and more importantly unwavering!)  with the help of you all here and embracing the 12 step process as best I can (there are not many face to face meetings like AA unfortunately but I have been doing the phone conference ones, they also have online meetings). I feel that the systematic approach of NA is beneficial to me while it also repeats many of the lessons from Allen Carr, Freedom from Nictotine, but it adds a layer because it forces my nicotine junkie mind to admit how out of control the tobacco has become (I've been 'serial quitting' for the last 3 years) in my life, and to submit to a process that has worked for thousands of people. Hope this helps a few folks. Thanks.

Still smoking, but trying to quit. I'm having the classic "phlegm problem"

So, I've only been smoking for about 18 months, and my body already seems fine with quitting. I've been vaping a few times a day and if I do have a cigarette, it's only 1-2 (maybe more, but only once or twice a week, and no more than 5). 

I developed a mucus buildup in both my nose and throat for about the past month. 

I want to use my vape and only maybe smoke once a day until my cough stops, and then I stop smoking in general. I also smoke weed maybe once a day, tops, which has made me not want to have a cigarette.

What have you guys experienced? Is my cough from my little bit of smoking? Or vaping? Did any of you use vaping/weed instead of just cold turkey, and have a similar experience?

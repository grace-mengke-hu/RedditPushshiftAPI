Quitting vaping, struggling

Hey guys! I'm new here since this is my first real (longer than a few hours) quit attempt! I started smoking at 18 and smoked about 10-15 a day. After a few months I got a vape and would have periods of hours, then days, then weeks of abstinence from smoking in favour of vaping. Eventually I would end up kicking cigs completely and chain vaping.

My struggle with quitting vaping is the incentives behind it. We all know how much withdrawal fucking SUCKS. It's hell, it really is. That's why you need some DAMN strong resolve and some fucking GOOD reasons to commit to weeks or even months of agony. If I were still smoking, these reasons would be clear to me. I don't want to put myself at serious risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke... the health risks of smoking are established and abundantly clear. My resolve to quit smoking has always been absolute, I am terrified of the health risks.

The health risks of vaping, on the other hand, are not so clear. Sure, it \*might\* be killing me, that is certainly an incentive to quit. So is the money I'd save, and the social situations I would be more comfortable in, not having to worry about whether I can step outside to vape. But is this \*enough\*? What would I do, in a hypothetical sense, to have these benefits? Would I really go as far as to put myself through weeks/months of torture, years of cravings persisting, an empty feeling like something's missing pretty much constantly? Where do I find the resolve? I like vaping, I like always having something to look forward to, I don't mind the cost, and unless it happens to be as bad as smoking which I HIGHLY doubt I don't hugely mind the health risk. We all die anyway, and we all risk our health daily anyway.

I'm on 48 hours of quitting vaping and heavily considering giving up. Perhaps vaping is just enough of a compromise for me. I wish I'd never picked up a cigarette so I didn't have to inhale water vapour in to my lungs to feel normal forever.

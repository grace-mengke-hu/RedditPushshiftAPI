Stressed at work

I've been super stressed at work. I've been overloaded with work and I am having trouble keeping up and its been stressing me out more than I have been stressed in a long long time. On top of that I kind of hate it. But I had a realization the other day. Even though I'm so stressed my mind has not once turned to cigarettes for help with my stress, which is what I used to do all the time. It feels great to be smoke free!

so fucking depressed

on Monday i was on top of the world. Today i feel like the world is crushing me. All i want to do is smoke a cigarette. 

None of my friends or family smokes, except my roommate (so that has been extra hard) so no one really understands.

I guess i just need a little encouragement. I am not going to give in, i just donâ€™t know what to do.

My last cigarette was on May 1.

I'm on day 8 and I feel great!

I was out of hand as a smoker and peaked at three packs a day.  Lots of time on my hands to smoke, and smoke I did.  Every inch of my life was marked by a cigarette and I even found myself waking up at 2AM to light one up.  Finally, I decided to give it up.  I have been using a crutch, the nicotine lozenge, but it really works for me.  I hope to be nicotine free soon but for this smoking chimney, 8 days is amazing.

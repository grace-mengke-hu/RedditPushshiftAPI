Here’s my story…

Started smoking late at 22 [daft!], gave up for 9 years at 29 when eldest son was born. Started again for stupid reasons [maybe didn’t think that at the time] and have been a very pissed off smoker for the last 13 years. 

I genuinely don’t want to smoke! I hate it and the control it has on me. Smoking kills me, literally, but it’s the psychological effect that’s been messing with my head for many years. The constant stopping, and starting, isn’t really a confidence builder!

I’m very familiar with what I need to do but there’s something inside of me which always wants to derail this knowledge and action. My first serious, and successful?, quit was all down to Allen Carr’s book and this lasted 9 years. It totally changed my perception of smoking however because I know what worked then, and eventually stopped working, it’s now not the shock and awe revelation effect that it once had on me. Sounding weird? welcome to my World!
I’ve always had a decent level of fitness from playing squash when younger but I think this has been masking the effect of cigs on my body. I stopped for 3 months last year [Sep-Dec] due to a long lasting viral chest infection but started again when I felt better.

Now’s the time! I’ve regularly viewed this forum over the last 5-6months but now I’ve committed to posting for the first time.

And also stopping smoking today and for the rest of my life! 

Hope to hear of any similar experiences and pearls of wisdom from you all! Many Thanks

I have SO much energy since quitting!!!

Iâ€™ve tried quitting many times before. This time, I quit cold turkey. For some reason, I have had SO much energy and feel like Iâ€™m extra particular about how I do things- like a perfectionist even though Iâ€™m definitely not one. Last weekend I tore my kitchen apart, reorganized every cupboard/ drawer, made to do lists, listened to probably 20 podcasts on spirituality, success, abundance, etc. Iâ€™ve been meditating every day, doing yoga, and reading posts on here to help with cravings. The strong cravings are over now, but I feel like there is a background mild craving that is constantly there all the time. And this increased productivity feels good, but almost like mania at times lol. My husband keeps finding me doing things around the house, meditating at 5am next to the fireplace, in the storage room rifling thru boxes, listening to jazz music in my office brainstorming ideas. I think he thinks Iâ€™ve lost it, but we both laugh about it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤ª anyone else feeling extra productive with too much energy to burn? Any tips?

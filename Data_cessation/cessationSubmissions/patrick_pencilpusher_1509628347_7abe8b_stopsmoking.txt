smoked a spun cone and then 5 darts today

also smoking just made me do nothing. i had no energy for anything and wasted the entire evening and went to bed at 12 because i was so out of shit to do (usually im working/ learning until 2-3). idk future me reading this, nicotine really is only satisfying for that first hit and you can say goodbye to any productivity or energy for the next 8 hours.  also the guilt feels shit.

Story of failure

Hello everybody. As is traditional: long time lurker subscribed to this sub in the hopes that I might find the courage to quit. Yesterday I stopped smoking up until now. I've bought cigarettes again and I've smoked one. The cravings are unbearable. Yesterday was sort of OK but this morning I had an almost constant craving until I succumbed. I feel terrible and so angry at myself. Even as I finish this cigarette the feeling persists. I don't even know why I'm posting this but I don't know who to talk to anymore without feeling even worse. All of my friends seem to have been able to quit without any problems and I feel so lonely at the moment. I imagine this isn't the kind of story that's inspiring to others but I just had to get it off my chest and I don't have nobody to share this with without seeing any faces of disappointment. Anyways, that's my story. I'll try to give it another go in the near future. Thanks for reading.

Tomorrow is the day.

Tomorrow is the day I make my hundredth stop smoking attempt. I've tried quitting over the years and lasted a few days after reading Stop Smoking. Didn't last obviously. I enjoy it. But I'm tired. I'm tired of it sapping all my energy. I can go without eating, I just won a $100 bet with a friend on who can get down to their goal weight first. 
His was 232 down to 194 at 6'1. He's down to 217. I had to drop from 193 to 174 at 5'10. After two weeks and six days I was officially 174 pounds this morning. Not eating and putting in 12 hours of workout time in a week? Easy. 

Quitting smoking is hard. Next year I'll be twenty seven and will have been a pack to two pack a day smoker for ten years. I'm done. I want my life back. Diet is dialed in, good habits set, and I'm ready for what seems to me to be impossible at best somedays. 

To everyone that's quit I offer my heartfelt congratulations and admiration. To people in the process best wishes and luck. To the people like me who want to wholeheartedly...just do it. Take your life back.

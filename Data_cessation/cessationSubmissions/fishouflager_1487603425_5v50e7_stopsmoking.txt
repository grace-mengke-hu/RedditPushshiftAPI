Just passed 8 months, what is happening?

I swear the last 3-6 weeks have been the hardest since the first month of my quit. I find myself thinking about them all the time again, when I thought I was well passed that. It's almost like the excitement of quitting has worn off and now my mind is trying to figure out how to go back.

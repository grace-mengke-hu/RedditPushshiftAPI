Need to get through the first couple days, need advice

So I've "quit" several times and oddly each time is different. One time was severe irritability, another was massive fatigue, this time seems to be this mental fog/background but not overt anxiety. I need to quit, I can barely breathe anymore and everything abiut it sucks.

What makes it harder is I'm in an intense medical program and I'm always burned out with school. Smoking is my break, helps me gather my thoughts and detach for a minute. I know I need to replace this and I come up with tech iques and tools but then about 5 hours after my last smoke I end up forgetting the tools, having a smoke and then seeing, yet again, that the smoke didn't actually help at all.

I've read Alan Carr and it has helped me with alot of the other side effects and with dispelling the illogical excuses to keep smoking. But from prior experience I need to get past the first 2 days (I've quit for months at a time, and usually went back because I thought one smoke wouldn't hook me again). How do I avoid this weird issue where hours later I literally can't access my planned tools and reach for a smoke or buy one? I'm also in NA (though where I am there aren't many meetings, weeks at a time). Between NA and Alan Carr I really feel like I should be able to do this.

I've also tried NRTs, every time I weaned off them it was the worst withdrawal ever, worse than cold turkey from smokes.

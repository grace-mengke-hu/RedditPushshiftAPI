Almost 24 hours in on cold turkey.... Getting much harder...

Must....be.....strong...... 

I feel like I am about to cave.

The only reason I quit might sound stupid. I have isolated pain in one lung, it might be benign, it might literally be nothing, but I thought to myself "Is this how I want to die?" It would be horrible to know my expiration was coming.

I've read and understood Allen Carr's book. Why do I still have cravings?

I've read Allen Carr's book. I've found what's said in the book original: everyone and everything implicitly told me that smoking a cigarette was that hyper-relaxing moment when one is finally complete and I ended up believing that. While reading the book I succeeded in understanding a cigarette can be *hyper-relaxing* just because one is experiencing withdrawal symptoms. That represented a twist in how I see cigarettes.

By the way, I'm disappointed that after having finished the book I still have cravings. In fact I just smoked a cigarette.

How can I make the shift from understanding that cigarettes do nothing for me to not actually wanting a cigarette?

41 days! So why do I want a cigarette?

I haven't wanted a cigarette so badly for a long time.  Driving into work I was fighting my brain - anxiety and fear were eating me up - and as I pulled to the stoplight by work I wanted a cigarette sooo badly that I wanted to drive past work and go buy a pack just to have one.  Just one.  And it sounded like a really good idea.  A guy in a truck behind me had one hanging out the window and another guy next to me had smoke coming out of his open window.  Man, it sounded like a great idea!

Luckily, I kept telling myself, "A smoke is not going to fix anything.  It won't take away my fear of asking for help at work.  It won't make me feel any better or any less afraid or anxious.  It will only make me feel worse."  

I am still a little afraid and anxious, but I did not need to smoke today.  42 days ago, that situation would have led me to buy a pack.  Progress in the right direction is definitely being made.  Thank you all on this sub for helping out and giving people like myself a place to come and be honest about what we are going through.

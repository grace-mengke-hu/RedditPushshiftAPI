Tomorrow will mark my third day without a cigarette, but a first day at a new job... HELP

So I'm starting to get really worried. I've been smoking for four and a half years and even on the patch (Step 2) my cravings have been CRAZY!

The title pretty much sums it up... currently sitting at two days without a smoke, and my third will be my first day at a new job... I'm scared!

I have almost ever side effect (insomnia, increased hunger, moodiness, irritability, anxiety – need I go on?) so I've been avoiding my triggers. To do this, I've pretty much locked myself in my apartment for the past two days.

Tomorrow is my first day at my new job, and with a split shift, I'll be there for a total of ten hours. I'm starting to become really worried about how I'll feel, act and deal with my cravings. 

Any words of advice?

I almost feel like I chose both the best and worst time to quit. The best because I feel ready and motivated, plus no one at work will know me as a smoker so I won't have invites to any smoke breaks. The worst because, well, I feel like a total over emotional bitch which probably isn't a stellar start to a new job. 

What should I do? I don't want to slip! Plus I haven't really been outside or waiting for a bus or stressed out yet – how can I overcome these things?

Two weeks feels like a landmark...

Today was also the first day I didn't have any nicotine lozenges, as I want to get rid of all the nicotine, however it's delivered.

I'm really enjoying working out. :)

Last night I even held a cigarette for a friend for a minute or so without even being tempted to take a drag!

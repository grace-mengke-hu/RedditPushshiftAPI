Boredom really gets me.

It's been about 40 days since I quit cold turkey, and it's going alright so far with the help of Allen Carr's book and some great tracking apps. I've been able to circumvent most triggers, but one thing that really gets me is boredom.

I've tried to cut down on the time that I'm bored by filling up the time with hobbies, but it is exhausting to be occupied all the time. 

How do y'all deal with this issue? Any tips would be extremely helpful!

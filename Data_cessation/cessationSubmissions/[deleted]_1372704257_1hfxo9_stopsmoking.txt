Okay, six hours.

I decided to quit for a number of reasons. Financial - I just moved into a new apartment and I can't really afford to spend my money on cigarettes. Personal - I just got out of a relationship and instead of getting drunk with my friends (which is what I did last time) I decided to do something positive for myself. I've wanted to quit for a few years now, it'd be good for me, and now would be a good time to do something good for myself.

Fortunately, it's a slow day at work and I can keep rereading Allen Carr until my cravings go down. Does anyone have any more advice?

Pack a day or more since 1993...

...And I just drenched ANOTHER pack with water vowing to quit again. I've done this a ton of times, only to run to store to buy another pack. 
Will this time stick?
Managed to quit for 3 months but started up again on New Years hating myself. 
Not feeling so great about coming here for support, but it's a last ditch effort, I suppose. I've tried EVERYTHING else- (hypnosis, acupuncture, cutting back, the patch, the gum...)
Help.

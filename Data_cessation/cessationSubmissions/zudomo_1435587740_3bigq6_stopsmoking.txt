Had 5 yesterday, bought a pack today

It's like I never stopped. Chain smoking at the same times as I did when I first stopped 191 days ago.

Not sure why I even picked it up again. Sure I was drinking but I've been drinking for at least 160 of those quit days.

Just this feeling as I want to hit rock bottom. It doesn't make sense I know.

Maybe it's because I feel so alone. Maybe because I don't have the people I want in my life in the same manner as they were before.

This sub was always so comforting when I was on it on my first quit.

72 hours nicotine free :) I did it!

After many quitting attempts over years (I smoked from 15
/16 to my current age of 24) I finally managed to stop smoking cigarettes using nicotine patches and oral spray. After about 6 weeks I was off the patches as well, but still smoking tiny amounts of tobacco in joints - mostly bud, but a bad idea, nontheless.

Well, 2 days ago I finally cut out tobacco and switched to smoking bud just pure in a pipe. I'm on the evening of 72 hrs, as it were. Probably coming up to about 67/68 hours nd there's no way I'm having one! It's nighttime here in England so I'm going to bed soon and I wake up nicotine free :)

 I know that people advocate cold turkey on this sub, and I agree, but I also believe that patches have a use - separating the physical action and habit of smoking from the chemical addiction, so that you can tackle one before the other. Ultimately, though I agree that cold turkey's got to happen, but you can make it a little less unpleasant for yourself by preparing and gradually lowering the daily dosage to which you're accustomed. It was of particular use in helping me break the habit of smoking at work - it was my biggest trigger; desperation for that 5 minutes to myself (I'm a waiter so I'm sure that makes sense!). I realise now, though, given the choice I really don't want to put smoke in my lungs; it was one of many lies whispered by the nicodemon...

If I can quit smoking, anybody can. I believe, from experience, that tobacco is in many ways the most difficult drug to quit, so take heart and keep going :) Join the community!

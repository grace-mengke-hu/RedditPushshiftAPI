Day One

I stopped a pack a day habit for fifteen years.  Then on September 1, 2012 I got a pack of Camel nonfilters.  There is much about smoking that works for me, but the addiciton means I can't only smoke the cigarettes I enjoy.  So today, after a year, I'm tossing the rest of the Camels out and switching to lozenges and electrosmokes until the urge subsides.

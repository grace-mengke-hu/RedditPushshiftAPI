Thinking about quitting but have some concerns with weed.

Hey guys 

So I assume you can understand I'm feeling kinda nervous, wondering how this decision would effect me. I've smoked since I was 12 and I'm almost 27 (blimey, 15 years... Didn't even realise) tbh I haven't really noticed any of the health problems that most people seem to mention, I don't have a cough of any sort and getting out of breath is probably a combination of weight and smoking. 

But anyway I have been getting a bit more serious with life recently, it drives my boyfriend crazy, plus I have a long family history of lung cancer killing the women between the ages of 43-54. So I'd say I probably can't keep this up forever and get away with it. Only thing I'm thinking though, can I keep on smoking weed? (For clarity I'm in the UK and we tend to use tobacco in our joints) I'd be happy to smoke straight weed in whatever way blunts, bongs, pipes etc etc but I have a feeling the "smoking" would trigger nicotine cravings. 

I'm just wondering if anyone here has experience quitting cigs but keeping on the weed? Would I perhaps have to stop both initially? What about with Champix/Chantix would that effect weed smoking enjoyment? 

Sorry for all the questions, I would be very grateful of any insight someone could give me. 

Thanks

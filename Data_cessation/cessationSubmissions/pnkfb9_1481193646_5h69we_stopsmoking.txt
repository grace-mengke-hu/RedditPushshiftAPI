F**k cigs, I am not ready, give me advice guys

Every day I wake up with the Desire of no smoking , then during the day, even if I don't want to smoke, my brain tells me "Just One, is not a wrong thing, why you don't want to smoke a cig?" . Shit. No willpower.

Yesterday I did not smoke for the sentire day, and once out with friends, at 11:30  pm i smoked for no reason(i was proud for myself not smoking for the entire day).

I think this post is more to vent and not for advice, i know i have to be determined.

Have a good day guys ;)

Hot damn! Can't believe I've done it. 42 whole days. Fuck cigarettes! Oh, and I'm over $200 richer.

Fuck cigarettes. 

Cigarettes made me until I couldn't run long distances. Cigarettes made me all wheezy. Cigarettes made me smell like shit. Cigarettes made me have less money. 

Now, I can run way better. My wheezing has improved dramatically. I don't smell like shit! And I'm a couple hundred dollars richer. 

Don't smoke! It's better, I promise.

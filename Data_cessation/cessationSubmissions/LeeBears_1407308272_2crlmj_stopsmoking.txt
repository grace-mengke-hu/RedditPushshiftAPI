Help!

I haven't smoked in a month, after about 20 years of over a pack a day, and the cravings have diminished in frequency, but increased in intensity.  I have like two super strong cravings per day, and they're way harder to deal with than the all day mild cravings when I first quit.  Anyone have any pointers?

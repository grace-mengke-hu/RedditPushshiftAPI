How do you guys feel about vaping?

Many of my friends around me vape, making me want to give it a try. I’ve asked them what’s harmful about it and they said the only harm is being addicted and the economic factor of needing to buy more juice.

I’ve gone through this sub and seen many posts about the harm of smoking. But I realize that many of these effects are from smoking cigs, not vaping.

My latest favorite thing about quitting

I can smell when my girl enters the room.  It's such a wonderful smell.  I'm so used to having to be really close to her, that now it drives me wild that I can smell her from across the room.

It's not a strong smell, and probably only I would notice it, but that's what makes it awesome.

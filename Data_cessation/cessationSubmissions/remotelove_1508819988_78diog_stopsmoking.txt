On varenicline, yet again.... [Day 16]

The urges have gone... I literally do not want to smoke any more.  My wife still smokes, but I just smoke 1/2 to keep her company.

Other things are affected:  I am ADHD and my meds for that are non-effective, mostly.  That sucks, as I actually require those to function. :(

The urge to drink is gone amazingly.  I am drinking about 2-3 beers and I am sloshed.  Used to drink about a 12-pack and need more.

Meh, cest le vie!  Bai cigarettes!  No more.  2 Packs a day to 2 smokes a day.  Keep wishing me luck!

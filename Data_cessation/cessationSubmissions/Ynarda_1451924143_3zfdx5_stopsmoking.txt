Do you eat more since you quit?

It's not the first time I am trying to quit. Last time I quit for 2 weeks, but this time I want to quit permanently.

One of the problems I am dealing with is the urge to eat more. I am constantly looking for a snack, for something to put in my mouth. I am also watching my calorie intake and the quitting is making my job harder. I don't to get fat in the process.

How do you deal with that?

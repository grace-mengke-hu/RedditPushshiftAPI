Cravings

Trying to quit I'm technically on day 4 but I've been cheating and it brings me great shame to say what I've been doing.

So I smoke outside or in my garage, the cravings have been that strong that even when my head is telling me no I'm still actively looking for a leftover tobacco pouch that couldve fallen behind furniture, the part that brings me great shame is during these wanderings for a smoke I've been going out to my garage and lighting up old cigarettes that I had smoked about 3/4 of and then threw onto the garage floor.

The cravings are just none stop eating away at me and I feel like I'm going to cave and go out and buy another pouch like last time, I've tried patches, gum, keeping myself occupied like fiddling with a toothpick, changing what I'm doing but I can't stop the cravings.

Is it a case of manning through it and dealing with it, are there any methods I'm missing that can help?

HERE WE GO!

Hi all--

Long-time lurker, first-time poster! A bit about my smoking past: I'm 26, smoked heavily from 20-24, vaped for about a year, then smoked heavily (and with great shame) for the last year or so.

I am starting my quitting process, cold turkey. There have been several attempts in the past, either with nicotine gum or vaping. But I've had it with nicotine. It really has completely controlled my life. Over the last week or so, I finally reached the point in my mind where I want to be done with this awful drug. I even tried a few cold-turkey attempts. Unfortunately, they didnt last more than 8 hours or so. 

Yet, this time feels different. After perusing this forum for quite some time, it does seem that a lot of people have that 'a-ha' moment, when they transcend their doubts about quitting and 'just do it.' I feel like I'm there. I also feel like its going to be tough. The 'faux attempts' I mentioned earlier have proven to me the power of cravings. 

However, I feel better for knowing that they will strike. I think the key, in my situation, is to immediately shift to doing something else. Its very easy to be laying on the couch, have my mind turn to cigarettes, and eventually cajole myself into heading downstairs to the convenience store. If I'm watching TV, I'm going to shift to laundry, or cleaning, or writing here, or going to the gym, or literally anything else. 

Anyways, not so much a 'point' to this post other than to say hi to everyone, thank many of you for the inspiration you have provided, and let you know that I will commit to posting here during the highs and the lows. From what I've read on this subreddit, there are lots of both!

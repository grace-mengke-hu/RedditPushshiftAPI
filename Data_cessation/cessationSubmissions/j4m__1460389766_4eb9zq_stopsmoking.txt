First day with no nicotine

Yesterday was really hard for me, I had a cigarette spread out over the course of the day and I've noticed a lot of problems I have. I can't stand certain sounds (misophonia) they make me want to hurt something, my anxiety sucks, I'm finding it hard to concentrate in my classes today, headache, blah blah blah. I don't know why I'm posting this but I am taking measures to fix some of these problems. I haven't been prescribed a medication for my anxiety because I had been alleviating it for the most part with cigs so I made an appointment with my doctor. If anyone has suggestions for helping concentration (planning on working out more, I already do, and I get enough sleep) that would be really appreciated. I feel like I have tried everything at this point (medication is out of the question since I was addicted to stimulants for a few years). Thanks

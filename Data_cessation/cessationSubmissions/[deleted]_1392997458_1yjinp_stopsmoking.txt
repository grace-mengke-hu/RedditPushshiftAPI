Smoking while on vacation/out of city

The last time I went out of my city, I had a nice time. It was cold and people everywhere were smoking. Plus I remembered this one friend of mine who had given up smoking but would allow himself a few drags whenever he was on vacations. He said this also encouraged him to have more vacations (lol). Anyway, while I was there, I remembered all this and had a few cigs. When I came back to my city, I didn't really smoke again since (been about 2 months).

In about 2 hours I leave my city. I have a strong urge to buy another pack and have some smokes (been reeling under a lot of tension lately). Maybe this vacation can be accommodate some light smoking?

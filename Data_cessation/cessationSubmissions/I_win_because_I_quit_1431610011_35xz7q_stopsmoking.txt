Had a craving on the day after two weeks

...but I didn't give in. 

I used a trick I heard from John Tesh just the other night. He said that when we use words like "I can't", that makes us feel as if we're depriving ourselves of something. Instead, we should use words like "I don't".

I had a V E R Y stressful situation occur last night and I pulled into the gas station for a pack. As I sat in the parking lot fighting with my emotions, I pulled out my "Reasons for quitting" list I keep with me and I re-read the tips on [whyquit.com](http://whyquit.com/joel/Joel_Index_03_Quitting_Smoking.html). Then, as I was in full-blown crying and panic mode, I remembered what John said.

I didn't cave in. I still have my dignity and still have my 15 days of being smoke and nicotine free under my belt.

I hope this helps someone else when you're faced with a situation that gets thrown at you that makes you feel there's no escape. Cigarettes are not the escape. Mind over matter.

Thanks, John.

Stink People

Stopped ~16 days now. Even when I was smoking, I had pretty sharp senses. After taking a break, I can always smell a lot more... mostly the not so good stuff though. Like other people's body odor. Most aren't too bad, but some people make me want to gag. And if I'm stuck next to them for long periods of time (like in a work meeting)... blegh.

Should I just keep a bottle of cologne/perfume I can just spray onto random stink people around me?

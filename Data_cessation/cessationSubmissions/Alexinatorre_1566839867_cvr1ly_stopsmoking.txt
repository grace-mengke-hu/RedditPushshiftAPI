Cool evenings like last night...

It triggers me that being in my backyard made me start craving nicotine like a mad lad. Maybe this is because I ate dinner outside and was also drinking a beer but the cravings did pass eventually. I'm hoping I'm just normal one day. I'm almost 2 weeks in. Working on my lawn has helped on my days off but I'm about to start running again. Not another puff, no matter what! We got this guys. Let's do for our future selves.

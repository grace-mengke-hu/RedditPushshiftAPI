When will you fell as a true non smoker?

Six and a half month without smoking! ðŸ˜‰

It has been amazing how better I feel since I decided to quit. So glad this time I am being able to manage it more than a week, as it was with my other attempts to quit. 

Most of the time I don't even think about smoking; but the thing is I can't yet face myself as a non-smoker but always as a ex-smoker. Cigarettes and the quitting still is something really present in my personality, that I think about everyday, at least once or twice a day.

When did you guys stop thinking of cigarettes or how long are you smoke free? When did you became a natural a non smoker, that doesn't think in cigarettes and smoking?

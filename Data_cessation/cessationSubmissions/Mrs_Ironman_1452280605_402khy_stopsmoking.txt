Please help....

Ugh. So... I'm 4 days and 15 hours into quitting. I just had a massive argument with my husband (who isn't quitting) and I smoked 3 cigarettes. I'm so disappointed with myself and angry I was so weak.
Question is... I'm still determined to quit.... but do I reset my app on my phone and lose all those hours and things or do I treat this as a lesson learnt and use it as anot her reason to stay quit.  Btw... I didn't even enjoy it 

I'm pretty much alone in this. I don't really have friends as such so most my time is spent alone or working.

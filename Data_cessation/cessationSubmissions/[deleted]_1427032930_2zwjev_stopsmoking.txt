One week in.

After many attempts, I have committed myself to NOPE again. I'm a week in and doing ok. My sleep schedule has been a wreck, and I am a tad irritable, but I have been enjoying my craves and am pretty quick at remembering that it is just drug addiction talking and that NO part of me actually WANTS to smoke except for the remnants of nicotine left in my brain. 

My primary struggle at the moment is how to get motivated to do other stuff. Like cleaning my apartment. Or finding a job. I feel kind of loser-ish at the moment because I'm just sleeping a lot and have zero drive. But that's not new, and when I was a smoker I was the same way.... tough to make these realizations. Quitting smoking doesn't mean you automatically become a fitness enthusiast with a rewarding career. But it sure is nice to not have nicotine addiction as an obstacle to those goals.

Found my perfect quitting tool.

I quit smoking a week ago. I was a full time smoker (around 20-30 per day) and since quitting I haven't had a single craving or slipped up once. And I am generally a sucker for cravings and poor at keeping motivated.  

So, I thought it would be a good idea to plug what helped me stop smoking without even trying. Not a book, gum, or patch. And I hadn't even planned on quitting when I did. It just happened.  


I tripped LSD. That's it! Certainly the life changer it is cracked up to be.

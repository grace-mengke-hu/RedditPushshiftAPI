Passed a big test this week!

Went on a ski trip with my old college buds.  Lot's of drinking, laughing and skiing.  Made through that social test no problem.  The big test came on the road trip home when we stopped for a few hours at a casino.  All that indoor smoking, more drinking, etc.  Probably the easiest place on earth to break down and fire one up.  To my surprise, I had no desire, no cravings and waked out just as nicotine free as I walked in (not counting the second hand smoke).  This made me very happy and strengthened my resolve even more to never start again.

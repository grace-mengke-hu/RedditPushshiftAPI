I can finally say no!

Was filling in a form yesterday for a pre-surgical assessment and one of the questions was do you smoke. I happily ticked the no box thinking "yes, I am a proud non smoker now!"

I mean the next question was have you recently quit and obviously I had to tick yes to that one like "ugh ok fine, I guess I'm an ex smoker still..."

But it's progress and I'm proud of myself and everyone else here should be proud of themselves too :)

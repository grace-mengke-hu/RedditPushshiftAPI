Sneaky cravings

Over two weeks now and I keep getting those sneaky cravings. Mostly it's fine. 

So far I've managed to:

Watch the back to the future trilogy in the cinema, with no urge for nicotine. 

Go to a two day conference without smelling like ash. 

Discover how nice fruit really is! Mmm so sweet and delicious. 

However I haven't drank since I quit and today I am going to hang out with potential smokers. I have that tiny voice in the back of my head telling me to smoke...

Got to drown it out. Can't wait for the voice to get quieter.

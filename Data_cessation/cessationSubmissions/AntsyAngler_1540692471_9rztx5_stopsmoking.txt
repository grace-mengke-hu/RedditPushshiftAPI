5 months and I'm never going back.

I smoked on and off for over 20 years, mostly on.  I quit a couple of times before, but this time it's going to stick.  I realized I can't go through the emotional trauma of being an addict, and quitting and starting again and again in a torturous cycle.  

I've managed to stay quit through some very trying life issues and I'm more determined than ever.  

To those of you just starting out, use every and any trick you can to avoid the trap of nicotine and addiction.  It's worth it.

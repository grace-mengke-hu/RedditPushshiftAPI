Day 18

I actually went a full day without even looking on here.... I did not so much as think about smoking at all.... well except when I was in the car but only because of the allan carr audiobook that I am listening to... I think things r starting to change... I was happy today instead of moody.... oh, and I forgot to take the chantix

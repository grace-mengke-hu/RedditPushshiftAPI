The senses awaken, the feeling of enjoyment.

OK, this post is about enjoyment of freedom from smoking/nicotine. Since quitting smoking I have felt the burden of addiction lift away. By that I mean now I'm able to enjoy whatever I'm doing, be it drinking a tea or looking out at scenery and not having that niggling thought at the back of mind about topping up my nicotine levels. Whenever I think about smoking I always repeat to myself that now I'm free. I'm writing this to help any of you out there that maybe sometimes question whether you should smoke. These thoughts help me more than just focusing on the health risks of smoking because they are a noticeable benefit to my life. To really enjoy anything is to focus solely on that one thing which is impossible when you smoke. Try it next time you have a craving. Good luck.

Here we go (again)

I just quit smoking. This is my 5th attempt. I don’t know if anything is different this time but I really hope it’s definite. 
In September I’m going to be a dad for the first time and I really don’t wanna be a smoking did like mine who already passed away of lung cancer. 
Reasons enough to quit. Now I just have to do it!

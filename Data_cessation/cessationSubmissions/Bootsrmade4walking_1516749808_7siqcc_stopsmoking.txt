Starting to doubt myself

I smoked for 20years around 10 cigarets a day, only stoped twice while pregnant but for the past 4 years I have been trying to stop, I tried everything available but always went back. Now, this time seemed different, I haven’t bought cigarettes since NYE and don’t even find it that hard, actually feels quite easy but... I have been having 1 roll up for 4 days a week while at work and can’t understand why I do it. It’s starting to affect my confidence and just makes me feel like I’m still a smoker. I’m worried that I won’t be able to cut it off completely and will always have one when the opportunity arises. Has anyone been through the same sort of experience and actually managed to give up completely? Thanks I’m advance.

Emotions

Were anyone else’s emotions all over the place in the beginning of their quit. Not the anger or agitated part but the sad and kinda of depressing swings. Man I feel like I’m on a roller coaster. One minute I’m fine the minute I’m tearing up for no reason.  It’s either part of the quitting process or I’m just getting old and soft. lol

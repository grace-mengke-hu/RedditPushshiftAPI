In the black hole...

Today is day 8. Really down today. Life barely feels worth living. I ate a bunch of junk food which helped a little, and am trying to sleep now - this day needs to end. Hoping for a brighter day tomorrow. I didn’t slip up. Ugh can’t believe how depressing not smoking can feel sometimes.

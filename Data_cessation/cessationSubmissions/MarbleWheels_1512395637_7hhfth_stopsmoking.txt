Help in emotional balance (... and one reason more to hate that poison that nicotine is)

Hey, I`d love a bit of help from you quitters :p

I am 3 days vape-free (and thus nicotine free) and, as warned, I noticed that sometimes my mood goes on a runaway: I started getting very nervous at my SO over little things, I started to get nervous again for the random low-iq person tailgating me, nervous for every time I read in the news how shameless of a criminal this or that politician is etc etc.

This very very very much annoys me, basically the sort of balanced person that I was is now moody because of the fucking nicotine withdrawal, loosing time playing random imaginary scenarios over nothing! 

Right now I am just using a no-mad policy: I basically pardon/ force forget everything that  upsets me because I am unable to assess if that is really a big deal or I am just making one out of nothing due to withdrawal. Obviously this cannot last forever, there are many situations in my everyday life where I am very well legitimate to be pissed!

How long before withdrawal-induced moodiness goes away?
How to help it go away/understand when I should legitimately be pissed or am just being bitchy?

I was a decently balanced person even before nicotine and I very well expect to go back to such condition.

Fuck smoking, why did I started.

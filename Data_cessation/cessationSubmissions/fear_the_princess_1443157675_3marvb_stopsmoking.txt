3 weeks in, so frustrated!

I am right back to being grouchy, moody, and craving. This is unbelievably frustrating. The only thing that keeps me from going out and buying a pack is my fear that I would have to relive the first few days, not to mention subject my husband to me.

I periodically come across an ex-smoker post somewhere online that says that the cravings never really go away, and I don't know if I have the coping skills to do this forever. Everything seemed much easier a week ago!

One of the things that frustrates me most is reading lists of "benefits" or "why I'm glad" that just are blatantly exaggarated, untrue, or trivial. Things about stinking and such. Didn't anyone ever wash their clothes or brush their teeth? Did everyone truly creep around with shame to smoke? I certainly never did. If anyone has any quitting resources that don't rely on cheap guilt trips or overblown claims, I'd be grateful to see them. And for goodness sake, nothing from Carr, what a pile of patronizing tripe!

been cigarette, drugs free for 3 months but lost it today. help

The past 3 months' been so hard and i just lost today. i feel so shitty. Not a single day passes that i don't think of it.... 2 weeks ago my boss fired me for fucking up the job again, my gf broke up with me in the same month that i got fired and I'm in the phase again of thinking of smoking, drugs, getting drunk, and thinking of suicide. My family thinks of me as a fucked person again, my brother again telling me how shitty i am and i must get my shit together. i don't have money for a haircut and new shave but went to apply anyway. in the interviews i got rejected and felt like ridiculed. So a couple of mins ago i took a stick and felt so good... the addiction is coming back. help

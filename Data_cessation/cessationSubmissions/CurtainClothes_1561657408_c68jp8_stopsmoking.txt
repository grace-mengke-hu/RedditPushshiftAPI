Had quit for 9 months, then a close friend died...

He was a very good friend to me and my partner, and we had both quit smoking together. Now, we've smoked maybe 4 packs between us in the last week since his death and I hate it and myself. Our friend was 27 and his death was accidental, violent, sudden, and completely unexpected. We had struggled so hard to figure out how to be human again in the 9 months since quitting and I am so mad at myself for starting again. We have about half a pack left and have agreed to not buy any more no matter what, but it's so hard. 

Nothing brings pleasure or joy right now, and smoking is the only reason I get out of bed or do any of my daily things, like a carrot I wave before myself. Neither of us can afford to take time off work to grieve, and we both desperately need some space and time to just sit with this tragedy. 

I guess I dont really know why I'm writing this here, just looking for any advice from anyone who's experienced this, or just those who've temporarily fallen off the wagon. I guess I want to hear that it's going to be easier to quit this second time, when we've had 9 months of practice being smoke free, when we've not been smoking as much as we used to (we both used to smoke a pack a day). 

I miss our friend so much and dont know how to cope. My work has an employee assistance program but the steps it takes to gain access to a therapist seem overwhelming when all I want to do is curl up and sleep for weeks. 

Thanks for listening.

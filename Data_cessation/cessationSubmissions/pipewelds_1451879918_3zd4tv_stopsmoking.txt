72 hours quit , It Really isn't that bad !!!

I read Freedom from Nicotine and Alan Carr's book , it really had been surprisingly easy . I've had some cravings of course but they were easily thwarted,  my only withdrawal symptoms are a little anxiety and an upset stomach . 

Thanks for all your motivation guys !

nervous for my health

I've never posted on reddit before, so I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right spot but whatever. I just need some answers for some questions after scaring the shit out of myself from looking at anti smoking commercials.

I will currently not disclose my current age however, at the age of 14 I started to smoke(cigs,vaping,hookah) as well as another array of substances I should not be doing. My question is just if I have really only smoked about less than 3 packs of cigarettes in my life, will it affect me in the future? 

I currently vape out of devices such as a Juul or Phix so I'm not sure if this will still make me prone to things such as cancer, but I have completely stopped smoking cigarettes.

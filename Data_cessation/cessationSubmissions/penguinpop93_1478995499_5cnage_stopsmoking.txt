Is This Normal?

I quit smoking like 15-20 a day almost three weeks ago and around the two week mark I started to experience what felt like strep (minus the swollen glands and fever) That has passed but since turned into an extreme nausea (almost puked yesterday) I also have what seems to be a pretty bad cold but with no body aches or swollen glands...just a runny nose, some sneezing and swollen eyes. I have never really felt this kind of sickness before. Could this be not smoking? I have also started to cough up all the nasty black stuff. 

Any input would help! 

Thanks

I'm Finally Doing It

After smoking on and off for about 7 years now I'm done with it. I bought a pack and have smoked two out of it but I'm just done. I'm tired of it controlling me and how ugly it makes me look, smell, and feel. The fact that it's just a disgusting addiction just rattles in my brain too much to think they help me anymore. Here's to hopeful futures. I'll see if I can make it the first 48 hours. Cheers!

Successful Night.

Last night, I was 8 days strong with no nicotine and went to a bar with my friends. I had fun drinking and the only thing I smoked was weed. My friends were even smoking cigs in front of me and not once did I ask for a drag.

My attempts at stopping are in the double digits if not triple, but I finally have it down this go around.

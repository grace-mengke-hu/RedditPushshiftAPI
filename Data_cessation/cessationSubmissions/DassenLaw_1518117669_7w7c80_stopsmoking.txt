1 year and 7 monhts!

Hi there, first post here just want to vent, celebrate and maybe help.

On 24-06-2016 i quit smoking with help of Allen Carr's book. I never thought it could be that easy. I have since recommended the book to everyone i know that wants to quit.

These days some people don't believe me if i tell them i used to smoke. Just because i can be around smokers in the brakes without any cravings.

Thank you Allen Carr! And everyone we can do it, if you have any questions for some reason hit me up!

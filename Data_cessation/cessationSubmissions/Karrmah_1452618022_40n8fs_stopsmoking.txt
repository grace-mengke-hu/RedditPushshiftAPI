Day 2. Health scare made me quit.

Ignore my badge, I need to reset it. I just wish it was 928 days.... My quit date is actually the 10th. 

So I came down with another respiratory infection. I get them constantly and have since I was 11 years old. I've smoked since I was 12 and I'm almost 25 now. At the doctor on Friday, they took an x ray of my chest and the doctor showed it to me. I'm left with only 50% of my lung function. I'm at very high risk for copd. 

I knew this could happen. I knew that copd and cancer were real risks, but I brushed them off as shit you only get when you're old. So I smoked for two more days, and quit. I did really well yesterday, but I'm feeling anxious and fidgety and very fatigued today. I can do this though.

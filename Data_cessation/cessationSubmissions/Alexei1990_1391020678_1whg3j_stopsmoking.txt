Weird Shit

why when im not smoking all day, before going to sleep i start to feel very good (energetic,laughing ect) and at that time i always say to my self ''let's just smoke one sig today is not that bad'' and lose the battle:(
So the weird shit is why when i feel very good both physically and mentally i like to smoke to make me feel shitty again????

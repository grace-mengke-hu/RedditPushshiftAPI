Am I missing something?

I've been a very heavy vaper for the past couple of years, using one of the most potent nicotine juices and never able to go more than 20-30 mins without taking a puff or else I would get tense.

For financial reasons I decided to quit and because of what everyone says about nicotine addiction (my first time quitting) I was prepared for the battle of my life.

Now it's been almost 2 weeks since my last vape and I gotta say it's surprisingly easy for me. The first day was the only hard part. Does it typically take longer for the cravings to get overwhelming, or am I just some kind of anomaly?

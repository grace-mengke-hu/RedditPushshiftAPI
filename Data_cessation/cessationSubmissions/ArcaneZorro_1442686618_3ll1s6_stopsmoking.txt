How can I help my mom quit?

My mom has stage 2/3 Pancreatic Cancer and has always been a 2 pack/day smoker.  I've always tried to be supportive for her and I was wondering if anyone had any tips.  Obviously I'm not trying to force her to but she seems to want to and just not have the will power.

For the last week or so she's been letting everyone know "this is my last carton of cigarettes" and "I don't even like them anymore, I think the taste id disgusting."  About 4 hours ago she had her "last" cigarette.  Then two hours later she begged me to go to the store to buy her her "last pack."  I'm not going to say no to my mother and neither is anyone else, so not getting them isn't worth it.  Any ideas?

2016=Worst Year.

So needless to say this has been a very, very bad day for me. It's taken so much to not grab a smoke from a friend.           


I hope if you're having a bad day you can fight all of those urges. I hope all of you stay strong. I also hope those urges fade away as quickly as they popped in your head. And lastly, I hope your day gets better and your tomorrow even better than that.         
  

Only 67 days left until this shit year is done and we can welcome 2017.            


Stick to your goals and don't light up. You're a nonsmoker.

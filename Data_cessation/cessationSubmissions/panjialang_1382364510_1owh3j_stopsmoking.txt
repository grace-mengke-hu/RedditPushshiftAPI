533 days later...reseting my badge. I guess what I learned is you can't feel too safe.

been partying a lot lately, stress at work, family stuff, started with a puff on an electric cigarette once with a friend at a bar, then the next time i ran into her smoked a lot more, then some spliffs at a few points, before you know it i was smoking at bars.  its time to put a stop to it.  i hate to see the days go, but i figure instead of 500+ days, id rather know that the number is true if im really going to go my whole life with smoking again, except for staying with a lie that will be harder and harder to live with as time goes by.  stay strong guys.

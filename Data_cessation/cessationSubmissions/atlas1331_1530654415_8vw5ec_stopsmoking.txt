4.5 months of no smoking, just started having urges to smoke again

Well, it’s like the title says: I’m at roughly four and a half months of no smoking, and within the last week or so have had these crazy urges to smoke. I’ve even had dreams about smoking. I really haven’t had urges since week two, and I’m concerned to say the least. I’ve been thinking about buying a pack of green tea cigarettes ( no tobacco, no nicotine), to have around in case the urge hits. Has anyone done this? I’m worried that even the green tea cigarettes could become a gateway back into smoking, which I do not want to do ( seriously, I haven’t felt this good in years). Any advice would be great. Thanks!

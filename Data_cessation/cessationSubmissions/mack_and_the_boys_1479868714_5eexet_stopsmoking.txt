A YEAR (and a week) IN THE CAN

The beautiful thing about quitting is when I started, I fantasised about what I would put in my 365 day thread. Fast forward a year and I completely forgot that the event haD been and gone. I quit cold turkey and smoked around 15 a day.

During the first couple of weeks I saw a post on here that said try and ENJOY the cravings. It helped me massively. See them as a challenge. Laugh at them. It's me vs you - and I will win.

Around the 1 month mark the cravings markedly reduced. Around 3 months again. By 4 or 5 months I was getting the odd craving. Now I don't get any. It doesn't and won't happen overnight, but it will happen.

I credit quitting smoking with giving me the kick up the backside to chase my dreams and do what I want to do. I've spent 4 months travelling Asia, have begun a new career in journalism, and am in love with a wonderful woman. Everything is now possible without that awful crutch.

YOU CAN DO IT!!

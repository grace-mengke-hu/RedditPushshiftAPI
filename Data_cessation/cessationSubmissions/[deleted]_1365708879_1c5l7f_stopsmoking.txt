Feeling strong!

Sorry everyone, I just feel the need to write this down. 

I've got a broken ankle at the moment and have spent quite a bit of time in hospital. Seeing really ill people smoke (in wheelchairs, with drips, etc) has really helped motive me to stay off them. 

On Saturday I was sat in A&E and saw a guy hop outside, without crutches, with his broken foot flopping around so he could smoke. That's how desperate some people can be. Pathetic isn't it?

Deep breathes feel great don't they? 

Really happy to report that the chest pains I was getting while smoking have all but gone. But unfortunately I have a clot in my leg. I haven't been very mobile for 4 weeks (not smoked for 8) and had my leg in a cast. But I do wonder how much of it is down to smoking...

The clot in my calf is incredibly painful and I'm having to inject myself with blood thinners everyday and have my blood taken at the hospital regularly. I'm covered in bruises and in constant pain. Not including the broken leg!

If this is any insight into what illnesses from smoking are like then I've had enough. I'm out. Please stay out with me. The air is fresher here and we can breath. Be strong people x

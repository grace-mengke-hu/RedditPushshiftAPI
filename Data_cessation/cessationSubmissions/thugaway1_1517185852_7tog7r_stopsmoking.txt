Anyone notice that you feel more naturally happy after the peak of withdrawals end?

Smoking messes with dopamine production and it takes a while for it to normalize. At the worst part of withdrawals its obviously depression. As long as you no longer romantisize the buzz, it actually feels way better. I feel feelings that I havent felt since years ago when I was a non smoker. Also caffeine and alcohol buzzes feel cleaner after quitting smoking.

I am not smoking today for the circle two badgers. Who are you not smoking for?

I was reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2z0f3r/aw_hell_look_at_that_got_a_shiny_new_badge_today/) in my morning.  And I commented that I would not smoke today in honor of the circle 2's.  I like all the badges.

Sometimes you make a comment and it is still hanging with you 30 minutes later.  It is like following you around because it is important and you are just missing something.

 Of course, I quit smoking for me.  But today I can *honor* the struggles of others while I do what I do.  So today I'll honor those who have gotten those first 14 days down and are starting to face the idea of *never again*.

You guys make me proud.

Do symptoms reset?

I slipped two nights ago while having a drink with some friends and had just a drag after a week of quitting, but now my anxiety and depression symptoms are as strong as they were at the beggining. I don't feel like relapaing, my cravings are not even that strong, I'm just wondering do withdrawal symptoms reset if you had nicotine again?

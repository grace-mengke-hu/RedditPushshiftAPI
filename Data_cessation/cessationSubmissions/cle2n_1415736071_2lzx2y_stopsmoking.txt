Trying to quit again, starting today. It's been 126 days since I last tried to quit...

The longest I've ever quit was 2 months. 126 days ago I tried quitting on impulse and didn't make it through the day.


Well... I guess this is it. I've got a stupid "disposable hookah" this time to help get me through the most intense cravings for the next little bit, but once that is gone I will be done. I dunno. Baby steps. I'm really kind of passive about this whole thing this time around, which is interesting because in the past it's felt more aggressive and like it really had weight to it. Like I really WANTED it. Now I'm just sick of smoking and would really like to quit, but there isn't as much drive. Seeing as how I've got a couple friends trying to do the same, figured I might as well hop on the band wagon. I need to be careful to make sure I'm really doing it for me and not just because my friends are quitting, but now seems as good a time as any. Been about 12 hours since my last cig... I'm definitely craving pretty hard right now. Booooooo. Not sure if I'll make it through the day if I'm being perfectly honest, but I'll try!

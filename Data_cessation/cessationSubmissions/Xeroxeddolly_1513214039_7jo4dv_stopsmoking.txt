I'm getting the day 2-3 craving feelings all over again on days 7,8, and 9. Anyone else?

This sucks ass.  I thought I was doing well, then it went back downhill and my cigarette addict brain keeps saying "oh look, maybe you *can't* do this after all, it's worse now, so it will probably be this way forever.  You know you want one.  Wouldn't a cigarette be great?"  then I remember my reasons for quitting and also remember that first nasty cig after you don't smoke for a while.  I don't know, I definitely don't want to smoke, but I'm getting the itch bad lately.  Did this happen to anyone else?  Did the itch come in waves?  I've read allen carr's book and watched the dvd btw.  Thanks friends.

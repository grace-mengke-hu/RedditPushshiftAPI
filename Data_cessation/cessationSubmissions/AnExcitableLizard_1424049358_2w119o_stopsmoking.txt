So it's been almost two weeks, and I've even made it through a couple drunk nights! But...

I've been SUCH a grouchy drunk.  I snapped at my friends and was just generally annoyed with everything.   How long until you guys were able to have a night out and actually relax and have fun?  

Also, congrats to everyone!!!!  If I've been able to make it this far, you all can.  Keep going!

Quit smoking on saturday... made a boo boo I need some help!

So.. my parents have both had stage 3 cancer (non Hodgkins lymphoma for dad and lung for mom... both survived... both are still smoking!! 

Cancer runs rampant in my family so my daily fear consumes me. I really want to quit! I've been smoking since I was 13 yrs old, now 27f. 

I successfully quit last august for 2 months after reading Allen carrs "easy way" - I was doing great until I went to Florida- everyone smokes there! Was very hard!! 

So now... just to New Year's Eve and I find out that Canada is banning menthols (my smoke of choice) and I thought HELL- good time to quit!! 

Fast forward to last Friday- I read a Reddit post that hit close to home. I grabbed the Allan car book and read it front to back that day. Smoking my last at 11pm. Made sure I was hanging with non smokers (my baby nephew and sister)- it wasn't too hard I was just a bit loopy!
Sunday was ROUGH- I found a cigarette (non menthol) and had a puff, was grossed out and soaked it in water. 

That made things worse. Later on I was cleaning up and I found a half smoked menthol. Smoked that.. then smoked CIGARS. So full of shame. 
Told my husband (luckily he doesn't smoke) he lovingly consoled me and I decided to try again today. 
I bought a PACK! Have smoked half. I am going to throw them out before bed and try again. Need some words of wisdom my friends! I need to be healthy! And live long for my future children! 

Thanks in advance!

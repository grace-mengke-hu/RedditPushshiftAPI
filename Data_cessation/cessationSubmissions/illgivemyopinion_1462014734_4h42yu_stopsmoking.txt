Third day today with mixed feelings

I'm on my third day, on the patch. I can do this fairly easily BUT I suffer from depression and don't know if it's worth it so much. Maybe it's the addiction telling me this. I'm older, with no pension or money to retire, ever. How long can I afford to stick around? I have two kids though, but I don't want to be a burden, hate the idea. I have a love/hate relationship with cigarettes, sometimes a little pleasure, mostly hate the smell and fact i'm addicted, cost and general pain in the ass. When I quit, I miss it, when I smoke I think, i'm going to stop. Generally a lousy, terrible struggle. Quit once for 16 years, never thought about it, got addicted again, it's always bothering me. Don't know what to do.

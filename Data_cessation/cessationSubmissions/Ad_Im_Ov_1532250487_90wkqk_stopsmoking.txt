Day 3 starts, I got my dokha pipe from the trash.

A friend called me and talked about the drinking parties we had, and how we needed to smoke dokha each time we drank.

I just fished through my trash, and I am sitting here, pipe in front of me.

I really don't want to smoke.

Edit: I will be going out in a while. I'm going to throw it out.

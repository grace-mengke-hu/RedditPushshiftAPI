Drinking.

I have to get past this mindset I have where I don't believe I can drink without smoking. I've been able to do everything else without smoking for the past almost 5 days. I feel like if I drink, I'm going to give myself permission to smoke before I even catch a buzz.

What are your tricks for drinking alcohol and preventing yourself from lighting up?

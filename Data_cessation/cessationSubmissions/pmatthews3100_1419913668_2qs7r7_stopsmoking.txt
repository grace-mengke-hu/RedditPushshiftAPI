One year down! A lifetime to go!

Hi r/stopsmoking

I discovered this sub today and thought I would share my experience so far. Before I quit smoking I was smoking about a pack a day for 7 years.

So, at 4 pm on December 30, 2013 I quit smoking cigarettes. I tried everything before such as patches, gum, and vapes. Nothing seemed to work and I thought I would never quit for good. 

Well, on the day after Christmas last year I started feeling sick. Before I knew it I had my first full blown flu and it sucked. I stayed in bed for three days straight fighting fever and aches without smoking any cigarettes. 

After making it a few days on my own without cigarettes I decided to give it my best shot and try the patches again. I started out with step 1 of the Nicoderm patches and worked my way through the 90 day system. 

The first 60 days were the most difficult to me, but I stayed tough. One thing I did to really boost my quitting confidence is that I kept doing the same things I was doing before. I continue to sit in the smoking section at my favorite bar. I continue to go to my friend's house where he and his parents smoke inside. 

I will admit that it never bothered me much at first, but as I have become used to not smelling like smoke and tasting smoke, it has really started to get on my nerves. 

Anyways, tomorrow marks one year for me and I hope I inspire others to quit as we begin this new year.

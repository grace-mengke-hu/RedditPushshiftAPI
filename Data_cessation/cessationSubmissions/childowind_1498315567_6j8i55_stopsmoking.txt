Dreams about smoking

Last night I had the first dream about smoking since going through those first few weeks of withdrawals. In it I was on vacation and had smoked e-cigs without thinking. I ended up buying a pack of real cigarettes when they went dry. I had asked for Marlboro menthol 100s (my old, old brand, before I started smoking smooths). I smoked most of the pack before I looked at it and noticed the brand they gave me were something called Marlboro Menthol Take Two 100. I stared at the unlit cigarette in my hand and realized I'd have to go through withdrawals again. But I wanted to smoke it SO BAD, y'all. I realized that withdrawals were already happening and I was addicted again. The thought came that I should just finish the pack before stopping again. Then I realized that I didn't have any Welbutrin anymore, and that it wouldn't be as easy to stop.

Yeah, that dream sucked, but I still woke up a non-smoker. There was this immediate, intense relief that I felt when I realized it was all a dream and I wouldn't have to go through that again. I think my subconscious was trying to remind me of how hard quitting is and warning me against smoking again. I'm grateful for that.

These sort of dreams used to happen a lot when I first quit.  I try to see them as reinforcement now, but at first they would make me wake up with an intense craving.  Even today I've been thinking about cigarettes more than usual.  I'm obviously not going to smoke, but to be completely honest, it's thrown me off balance a little.

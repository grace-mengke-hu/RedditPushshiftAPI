2 nights in, hardly any sleep. Night sweats are no joke.

Has anyone else experienced night sweats after giving up nicotine?

I was a social smoker, full time vaper. I just got back from a stag holiday in Portugal and was pretty disgusted with myself for the amount I drank and smoked for 4 days straight. The first night I was as drained as my empty vape tank and couldn’t be bothered to get anymore juice. No problem. Until I tried to sleep. Bearing in mind that I was exhausted and hung over I couldn’t sleep for more than 30 mins as a time, and every time I woke up I was covered in sweat. Night 2 has been similar but I’ve been sleeping for 2 hours at a time. Fingers crossed this will improve nightly. Has anyone else been through this? I used to sleep like a baby.

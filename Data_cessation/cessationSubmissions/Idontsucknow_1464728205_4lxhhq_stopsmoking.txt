Random advice

Hey guys, this might seem a bit irrelevant but I thought I would share in case it helped someone.

I was really uncomfortable with anxiety a couple of days ago and thought about smoking. Getting rid of that connection will obviously take a long time, but the other issue is managing the anxiety. Turns out, I think I have/had a vitamin deficiency; I took a berocca (soluble b vitamin complex) and about 10 minutes later I felt normal, like I was just released. I didn't make the connection instantly, I just told my husband I felt better all of a sudden, and he reminded me I had just taken it. Later that evening I came over with sick feelings of stress again, so I decided to go to my fitness class in the hope I would feel better; but I took another berocca and by the time I got there I felt great. Coincidence??

I know b vitamin deficiency causes bad feelings and concentration problems, and when you don't do anything about it it can be very bad for you. I cant find proof that it causes such an improvement straight away in other people, and sure, it could be a placebo. But I just thought I would mention it because there's a good chance it could help lots of people manage their stress and remove some of the triggers to smoking!

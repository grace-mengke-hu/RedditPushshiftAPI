14 days and counting!

Wow 14 days ago I made a decision that I will NOT regret. I've quit smoking. I do have withdrawal symptoms, BUT I sleep better, eat better, feel better and yeah I don't stink anymore! Can't believe how bad I smelled. But my journey has just begun, but I am very excited, my life is changing!

About to meet the old smoking buddy - wish me luck!

Hey everyone. First off, I'm so happy to have joined this sub - the nice people giving me tips is really appreciated.

I'm about to go grab coffee with a good friend of mine, which is great. But as per the title we are a pair of folk who constantly fiend durries together while shooting the shit.

I can do this! And knowing there could be someone out there going "You can do it" just for me makes it feel so much easier.

Day one has gone just fine! You all are fantastic! Keep up the non-smoking, woop woop!

10 days cold sore throat and how to fix lungs

Haven't had a cold in ages, but got it this weekend. Is ot common to get that lile a week after quitting? I  thinking it's just my lungs cleaning out?

Second thing, any suggestions on stuff to eat or supplements to increase lungs healing rate?

Cravings starting to go away now, even when hanging out with smokera, so that's awesome :)

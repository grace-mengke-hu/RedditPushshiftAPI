1 Month. When did you stop thinking of the post dinner smoke?

I never thought i could do this. I never imagined this. There were times when i seemed so deep in the addiction I'd never be free.

I did it cold turkey. You can too. You just have to hate it enough and want to be free badly enough. 

Cravings subsided after 2weeks. Been ok since. Still sometimes reminisce about the post-meal smoke â˜¹

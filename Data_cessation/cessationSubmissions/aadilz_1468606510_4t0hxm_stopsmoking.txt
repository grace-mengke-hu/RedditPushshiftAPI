Started five months ago. Smoke up to 10+ a day. Need help

Hey, I'm nineteen and I took up smoking around five months ago. At first it was just one or two a day but now I smoke almost half a pack everyday.  I want to stop and I've tried. I go cold turkey for a day or two but I always end up smoking more.  Would really be obliged if someone helped me out.  P.S. Nicotine gum or patches are not available here or I would've already tried that

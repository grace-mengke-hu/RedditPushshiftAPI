Thinking of reasons to start smoking

Its unbelievable. I was really happy the last few days that I came this far without cigarettes. Now that I'm in a better physical condition, I enjoy exercising so much more. Since yesterday, though, my brain is thinking of reasons to pick-up smoking again. Like: "You're going to die anyway, so cutting of a few years because of your smoking habit is not going to make a difference!". 

I laughed. Silly brain.

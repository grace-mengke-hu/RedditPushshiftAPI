Questions About Smoking Cessation/Tolerance of Smoke and Physical Symptoms.

23 M. Cigarette and marijuana smoker for 5 years. At my greatest extent  I smoked maybe five cigarettes a day. For the past two years or so I smoked marijuana heavily in conjunction with cigarettes smoking probably a gram daily and often smoking a cigarette after each marijuana session.  I have drastically cut back in the past four months to maybe one or two puffs of a joint every two weeks and one to three cigs every two weeks average when drunk. 

I have been experiencing chronic upper back pain and chest tightness. This is what makes me continue to occasionally smoke as I often think fuck it Iâ€™ve already harmed myself irreparably as a result of this pain. ARE THESE SYMPTOMS OF A REDUCTION IN SMOKING?  or  am I one of those unlucky people with the genetics to give me lung cancer or COPD after a few years of substance abuse?   Hearing advice from others who have quit smoking and what they went through would go a long way towards making the process more successful for me. Thanks!

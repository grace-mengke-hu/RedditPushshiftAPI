Had a drunk cigarette, not resetting my badge

I went to a bachelor party this past weekend and while we were out at a bar and I was very drunk, I slinked outside and bummed a marlboro light off of someone. I sucked it down in like a minute because it was about 5 degrees outside, thought "that was kinda dumb," and went back inside and forgot about it. I haven't had any cravings since, and honestly keep forgetting it even happened.

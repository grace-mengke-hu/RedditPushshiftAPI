I hope I can do this... But I'll need your help.

Hello, I posted back in August about quitting in September and that never happened. Since then, I have noticed being out of breath so much more and also feeling like utter crap all the time. The worst thing for me is my teeth. Due to smoking and my high sugar diet and not visiting the dentist for years, my teeth have gone to shit. I can't do this to myself anymore. I have stubbed out my last cigarette and I shan't be smoking again. 



I know this is going to one of the most difficult things for me to do, so I may post on here for support frequently in the coming days/weeks/months because I don't think I will be able to do this alone. Please help. I need to quit these horrible things that do nothing but drain my money and my health. 



Last time I was recommended to just quit, so here I am, just quitting. I might have cravings but I'm sure as hell not going to miss them. I'm going to find it so difficult also, because my boyfriend is also a smoker but I don't think he wants to quit. I've attempted several times to try and quit together but it just never happens so I am going to do it myself. 



I've never been one with willpower or motivation and my automatic response to any stress or good thing is to reach for a cigarette. 



I feel like I'm waffling now so I'm going to wrap it up. 



I am /u/hcbrit and I am a non-smoker.

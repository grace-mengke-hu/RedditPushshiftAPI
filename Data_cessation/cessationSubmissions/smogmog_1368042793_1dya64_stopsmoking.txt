How nicotine actually works

A few years ago a friend of mine who's in the rationalist community sent me a few links about nicotine (sadly i can't find them right now but i'll search for the sources and edit them in). I learned some things from them which i thought could be interesting for some of the people here.

So here is it:

Nicotine itself isn't addictive.

There is a cocktail of different processes in the brain that tells you whats essential and important for you. Like drinking, eating and sex.
Nicotine kinda hacks those processes, so that everything you do while you're under the influence of nicotine will be stored in your brain as "necessary for life". 

Everytime you smoke a cigarette you get a little more addicted to the act of smoking. Like holding a cigarette (often even in a certain way), draggin on it, the taste of the smoke, etc.
You're not addicted to the nicotine but to the act of smoking.

This also means that you become addicted to smoking while drinking coffee, dancing, driving, working. And it also means that you become addicted to everything else you do while you're on nicotine. 
If you smoke when you work, you can work more concentrated because you've become a little addicted to working while smoking.

Also i read you can condition yourself to be addicted to something if you can avoid experiencing the act of consuming nicotine. Like with patches. You put them on your arm and forget about them, and the nicotine will be released after a few minutes.

What do you think about this? 
Maybe somebody read something similar?

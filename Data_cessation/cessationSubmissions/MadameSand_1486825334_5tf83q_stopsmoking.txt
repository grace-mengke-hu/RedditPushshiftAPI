This is gonna be hard

So I decided to quit. Last weekend, the last weekend before I would quit I decided to smoke as much as possible and then just stop for ever. As a sort of good bye. Got pretty sick of that actually. 

I did not often smoke sober, but when alcohol came into play I turned into a chimney. 

Yesterday night was my first real test: We went out for some beers. It started out okay. Then after I got more tipsy it got pretty bad. I even wanted to take some of the joint a friend was smoking. I quit that addiction half a year ago and have absolutely no desire to get that back. Yesterday, even saying no to the joint was hard. My brain made up all kinds of crazy excuses.

I'm glad I pulled through. I got home safely and the next day I noticed no smokey lungs and had no cough. Pfew. 

Any tips for cravings at parties/social gatherings?

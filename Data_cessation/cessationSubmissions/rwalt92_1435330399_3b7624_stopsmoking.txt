Day 365. It's a good day to celebrate being a non-smoker!

Over the past year I quit smoking, started eating healthier and getting back into running. Instead of being a 65 year old with emphysema and/or lung cancer, I'll be a 65 year old running out on the lawn with the grandkids. I'm happy that I've taken this step towards a better future, and it's absolutely worth it!

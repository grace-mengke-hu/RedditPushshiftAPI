A tip for gamers. it helped me today.

I was craving a cigarette. its early for me, very early. day 3 haha but i was craving a smoke few hours ago so i decided to play NBA 2k13 online, the games last about 45 minutes. i played 2 games in a row (bout an hour and a half) and it really took my mind off smoking. i focused on the game and not on my cravings. i dont know if it will work for you but maybe you can find another distraction that you enjoy and consumes a little time. hope this helps! good luck everyone! :)

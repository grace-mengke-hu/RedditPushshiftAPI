8 days in and I still feel terrible

I'm on day 8 cigarette free and I'm not feeling that rush of health people talk about. My sleep cycle is totally messed up: I wake up like five times a night. My joints ache, my nose is stuffy, I have brain fog and I'm feeling really depressed. I don't have cravings and I'm not thinking about going out and buying a pack of smokes. I'm just wondering when I'll start to feel normal.

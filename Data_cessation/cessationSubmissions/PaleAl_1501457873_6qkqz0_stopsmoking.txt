30 days

Wow.  30 days!  The last few nights started doing soccer with my foster kid in the back yard.  I can not even imagine spending an hour running around with him a month ago.  I woulda been in the hospital!  No exaggeration.  I'm winded and my knees are bitching, but fuck them.  I'll just start eating more salmon and nuts and shit.

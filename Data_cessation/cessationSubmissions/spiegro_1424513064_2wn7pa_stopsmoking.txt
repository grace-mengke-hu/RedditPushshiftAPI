Thanks to Sydney's unbelievably high prices, I'm 7 days deep.

I just moved to Sydney, where a pack of the cheapest cigs can cost $16... Took me three or four packs to finally go "wtf yo?!?"

Still desperately need huge amounts of mints or gum while I work or commute, though.

I think waiting at the bus stop is the hardest. That and having a beer.

But the smell of them doesn't make me rabid for a cig any more. So that's a good thing.

Just found this sub. Helps to talk about it...

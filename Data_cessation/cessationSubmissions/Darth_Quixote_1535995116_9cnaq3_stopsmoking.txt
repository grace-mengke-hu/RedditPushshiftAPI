What's step 1?

I love seeing all the success posts on this sub. As a lurker for 4 or 5 years, it gives me hope to read of others' victories.

What I don't see much on this sub is much advice, or calls for advice. As someone who is an off-and-on smoker, cold turkey has only worked for a few months each time I've "quit." Since nothing has worked, I'm committing to the info-gathering stage and have started seeing an addiction counselor to learn more about my impulses and how to control them.

What's a good step 1 for changing my relationship to addiction? I would appreciate any thoughts you might have, friends!

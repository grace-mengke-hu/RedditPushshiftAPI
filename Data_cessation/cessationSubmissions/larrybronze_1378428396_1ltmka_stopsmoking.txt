Does an Android app with these features exist that could help me quit?

I would love to have an app in which I could log things related to my smoking behavior.  If it's something I can make an ad-hoc solution out of, that's fine ... like, organize some tables and create a form that i enter info into.

The use case I'm imagining is,

a) when I smoke a cigarette:
- log the time
- rate my mood (1-3, 1-5, frowny/neutral/smiley, etc.)
- rate my perceived 'need' to smoke (?, need, NEED)
- ask me, even, if I could put it off for an hour? 30 minutes? 15 minutes?

b) when i purchase
- the brand
- the price

use the combo of b and a to keep track of how much money i could be saving on a per-cigarette basis, perhaps.

Does such a thing exist?

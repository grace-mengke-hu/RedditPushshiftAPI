It is 100% worth it!

Hey folks, a couple of days ago I noticed by chance that I would be hitting my 1000-days mark soon! Smoking feels so far away now that I don't really get to feel proud and grateful for having quit anymore, so I wanted to use this opportunity to actively pat myself on the back and indulge in that pride for a moment! Yay me!

I also want anyone who is reading this and maybe currently struggling with the quitting process to know that IT IS 100% WORTH IT! My biggest fear with quitting was that the struggle would never end and that I would always have this feeling of longing. But it did end, well before hitting my 1000-day-mark! I am not a particularly disciplined person (far from it, actually), so if I can do it, you can too!

Here's what helped me personally:

* Reading Allen Carr's Easy way (had to do that twice, actually, apparently the message didn't fully sink the first time) 

* Writing a long letter to myself in which I tried to reeeally get into the nitty gritty of why I was smoking, why I wanted to quit and what fears were holding me back. This brought some unexpected stuff to the surface

* Really committing to the idea that in order to quit I would have to quit FOREVER and not touch a single cigarette ever again. 

The last point made it sooo much scarier at first and it's probably the reason it took me such a long time to really reach the decision to quit. But it was also very freeing and made everything easier in the long run. SO MUCH mental energy goes into the ever-repeating debates in your own head - trying to justify why you are not ready to quit, why it is okay to have that one cigarette now, why you might just give up now and accept that you'll never be free. Once I reached that point of "I'm SO tired of wasting all that energy, however hard it may be at time, whatever shit life may throw at me, smoking is just NOT an option" everything became easier. Now every day meant real progress rather than one more step towards the inevitable fuck up. 

I know different things work for different folks, but if this helped just one person I am happy! Keep going, life is good on the other side and you are slowly but surely getting there! You are a fucking WARRIOR!

[Edit] Wanted to add some of the major benefits I noticed:

* Being free of that constant guilt and self-loathing, replaced by a sense of pride

* Rarely getting sick anymore (before, every minor cold would turn into a full-blown bronchitis)

* Smelling nice, looking better, and not feeling like I'm rotting from the inside anymore

* The realization that if I can quit smoking I am able to make other positive changes to my life

* $$$

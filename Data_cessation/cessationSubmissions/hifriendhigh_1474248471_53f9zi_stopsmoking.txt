Hungover all day for the first time post-quitting, i did not smoke

So i cut down on drinking while I quit. Last night I had my first hard night drinking . I had strong hungover pangs for cigarettes, but i did not give in. After hydrating and watching some games, I feel a lot better. I definitely feel like I have cravings when I do something ive done while smoking, but not post-smoking. It helps me to make that distinction and identify that eventually those cravings will go away as i build a habit of doing things without cigarettes. Stay classy my friends

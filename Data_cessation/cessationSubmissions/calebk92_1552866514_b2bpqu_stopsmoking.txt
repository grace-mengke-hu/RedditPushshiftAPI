How do you avoid taking out irritation and frustration on family?

I’ve tried to quit smoking on multiple occasions but most of comes down to me taking my anger out on my loved ones. I’ve tried to stop but at one point it breaks loose. I know that I shouldn’t be but I’m just trying to see if there’s another method that someone has used that may work for me. I’ll take any help. Pls not negative comments about how I shouldn’t be doing it because it’s wrong etc. I know it’s wrong, but the irritation gets to a point where I can’t control it.

71 days and proud!

It just occurred to me last night, as my fiance was going out on the porch into the freezing cold for a cigarette, how glad I was that I didn't have to do the same.  It was weird, like it just suddenly dawned on me that instead of feeling jealous, and wishing I was out there with him, I felt relieved that I didn't have to bundle up to go out there and get my fix.  There wasn't so much as a pang of disappointment or envy, as there has been the entire time since quitting.

Just thought I'd share, in case anyone feels like the cravings/desire won't ever diminish.  They will, and it'll feel amazing :)

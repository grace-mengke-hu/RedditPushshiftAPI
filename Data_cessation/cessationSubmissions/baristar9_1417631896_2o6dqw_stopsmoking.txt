cravings are back and im losing it

Just when it was getting easier, I'm having pretty heavy cravings again. I feel stupid, writing a post a few days ago about how great I'm doing. I was. I am. I have been under a lot of pressure the last week or so, but I try not to think of smoking as a solution. But that's not really the problem. I'm back to just missing the smoking. I had a dream last night, that I smoked, and it felt so good. Having a craving right now. Just thinking of how great it would feel. I know it's a lie. Why is that feeling still there? Is it cus i chew gum and still crave the nicotine? (the gum usually helps with the cravings, but right now all i want is to smoke)
Is it just like nostalgia? I'm flipping.

Never wanna go through quitting again. I try to remind myself of why I wanna be smoke free. In spite of that I feel like I haven't managed to make a routine of what to do when I have a craving.

Plus, anxious to meet my best friend (heavy smoker) for the first time since I quit, tomorrow. Any tips???

All of this makes me feel like its never over. I felt so good all of last week. Barely any cravings. Will I ever feel safe to meet smokers and know that I wont ever do it again? Or do I always have to watch out for my brain trying to trick me??? Is it naive to trust myself too much right now???
Rant over, thanks.

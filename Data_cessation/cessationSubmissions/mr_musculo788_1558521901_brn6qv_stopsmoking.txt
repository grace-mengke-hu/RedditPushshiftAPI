Day 50 / mouth changes ?

Hello to everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

recently joined this subreddit and wanted to ask a question.

&amp;#x200B;

I am on day 50 since I quit smoking. I've been a heavy smoker (30 cigs a day) for 3.5 years. Im 24 and decided that this no longer serves me. I have no trouble maintaining this smoking cessation but.... Ever since I quit, like 5 days after my last cigarette i noticed some mouth changes. My skin at the roof of my mouth and the skin near the gums was peeling. I also have a burning sensation in my mouth and on my tongue. my mouth is dry and my lips are dry occasionally. It feels like my tongue and my mouth is irritated. Is it possible that this is due to quitting the cigs ? Anyone else noticed mouth changes (even after almost 2 months of quitting )?

Thanks in advance.

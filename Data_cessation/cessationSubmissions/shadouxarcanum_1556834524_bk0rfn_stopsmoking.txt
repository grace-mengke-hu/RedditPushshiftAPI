100 days smoke free!

I jokingly have been telling myself, for the past 100 days, that I "picked a hell of a time to quit smoking" because, coincidentally, I have been experiencing some of the most stressful times in my life. But I knew that smoking wouldn't help, and now here I am, sitting at a park bench after a particularly shit day, not even thinking about smoking. For the first time in a long time, I can sit outside and not feel like I need to be, or should be smoking. I am finally free. It's worth the struggle everyone! Stay strong and say NOPE!

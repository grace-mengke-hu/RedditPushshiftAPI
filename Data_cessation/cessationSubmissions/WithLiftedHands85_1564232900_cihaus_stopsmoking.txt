Smoke and Mirrors

I’m 34!  Wow that’s old!  Not really but I felt old when I typed it so I figured I’d say it, anyways!,  I’ve been a smoker for the past 14 years of my life.  I’ve quit intermittently for the last 14 years as well.  I even quit the day I started!  But nothing actually stuck until I got on my knees and spoke to god about it after repenting from my past life In February of this year.  I didn’t just smoke tobacco if you catch my drift.  I did a lot of worse things and he truly alleviated me of all my iniquities starting on the day I TRULY gave my heart to him.  You have to give it all to him though 100% and be patient!  I prayed about them back in February and didn’t stop until just 3 days ago!   He is in control and it is all in his timing!  Not ours!  Thank you Jesus for dying on the cross for our sins!  Amen!

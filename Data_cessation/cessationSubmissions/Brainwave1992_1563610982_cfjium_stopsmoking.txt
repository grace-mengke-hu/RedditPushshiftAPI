Getting intense cravings since yesterday

I'm on day 17 and I might have some ongoing depression. Everything feels l hopeless and I feel like I have lost too much to actually care about stuff I still have. Feel so lethargic.

On days like this I feel like smoking again. Been getting intense cravings since yesterday.

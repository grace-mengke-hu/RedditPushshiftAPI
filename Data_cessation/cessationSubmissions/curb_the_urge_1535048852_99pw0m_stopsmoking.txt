Gave in to the craving last night ☹️

I’m on quit day 13 and had 7 strong cravings so far. Mainly they’re linked to coffee and alcohol. When I’m in a good mood it seemed easy to resist them so far and usually I am 😊. And it makes me so happy to see that I’m able to do this. 
Last night I gave in though. Went out with my boyfriend and some friends of his. Somehow the two of us had a weird moment and I got really upset. Instead of talking to him I got myself more and more into an angry headspace. By the end of the night I was so pissed off, that I was like f this, I just want to smoke and took 1 puff from a friend. Felt pretty stupid about it, didn’t enjoy it either.
Today back to being a non smoker. Talked things out with my guy, all good again and I came out of it with a new lesson learned. Stress, anger and sadness strengthen my cravings. Very obvious yes, but I wasn’t aware of it really. I’ll try texting a friend or trying to talk about how I feel next time instead.
I’ve tried quitting before, the times I relapsed were also in moments of stress. 
I’m quitting for real this time. I got this. I’m a non smoker. It’s like getting a tattoo, it’s for life. That’s what I tell myself during cravings. 🙌🏻 
How do you fight your cravings guys?

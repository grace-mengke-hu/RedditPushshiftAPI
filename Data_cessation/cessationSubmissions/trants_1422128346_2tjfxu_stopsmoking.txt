3 Weeks on Chantix- Should I get another 2-4 weeks or stop taking it?

The side effects arnt too bad- Mostly insomnia and irritable. 
Its like $200 for another 2-4 weeks i think though. 

Wondering if i should suck it up and keep taking it or ?
Ive been using a no nic vaper which seems to do the trick. 
I dont even want to do the vaping really.

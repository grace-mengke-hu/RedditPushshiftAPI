Sober and Smoke Free

I guess smoking and drinking sort of go hand and hand.  Drink more, smoke more.  But now that I am sober from booze and no longer live the sex, drugs, and rock and roll lifestyle, I was able to bring myself to quit smoking! Wahoo! I no longer smell and I am no longer a slave to cancer sticks.  I feel marvelous!

Getting ready for the new year.

Been smoking for about 8 years. I've been waking up worrying about smoking for a few weeks now and telling myself I'll stop in the new year.  I realised this was just another excuse not to stop. So I'm sat at my work desk with a nicotine patch on my shoulder. I really hope this is the time that sticks (No pun intended). Wish me luck!

The only thing I regret about quitting...

... Is not being able to go out for a smoke with a girl at the bar or a party. I'm at my house with a bunch of people and this girl I'm interested in keeps going out for a smoke. It'd be a lot easier to get one on one time with her if I still smoked -_-

Fuck it, it's probably for the best anyway, being with a smoker would really tempt me to pick up the habit again.

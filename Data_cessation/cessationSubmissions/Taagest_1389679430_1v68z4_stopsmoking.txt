so im really quitting this time.. kinda long

Hello all, first sorry for the bad grammar, and stuffs. Ive been a lurker since  about NYE, when i was suppose to quit, well that didnt happen I went one full day, NYD then that night was like "Oh good job smoke one" dont ask why i dont know, Ive been smoking for about 9 1/2 years now, my mother used to smoke, my dad smoked, it was just there growing up. I am 24 now and I have an almost 3 year old son and it should be enough to quit, but hopefully you guys know about it like i do and it never seems to be enough, not the family, not the guilt, not the knowing i could get cancer whenever. Its just the need to smoke, idk i hate it, anyway thats what brings me to making this post. As i type im having my last one, the last one i will ever have,and im sad, its stupid i know that. But doing this for so long its just who i am,but its not and its hard to say no to something you've been doing. Its like my son who has to give up the pacifier, its been 4 days since he lost it and he hasn't asked for it except when he goes to bed, and then he falls asleep and is over it. If he can do that, then i can do this lol silly comparison I know, but its what my brain keeps going back to. 
  This is long enough as it is, but i just wanted to say hello all, I will be posting my frustrations and vents and stupid "why i think i need a cig posts" and hopefully this will be it. thanks for reading this :/ (please no judgment for being a parent and smoking,i have gotten crap on other sites for that, I have beat myself up over that and as mentioned I know my son is so much more important than a smoke.Also side note anyone who is a parent would know, quitting with a unruly toddler is very hard, especially one that gets his stubbornness from me.)

I don't know if I belong here...

I've smoked socially since I was 18 (am 22 now). I went through some stuff at the start of this year and ended up in a psych hospital (for the 3rd time) in Feb. Honestly I liked smoking in hospital - the smoking area was the best place to meet people and it helped me feel less alone. 

I stopped smoking after I left but picked it up in April after some more difficult stuff happened. I never smoked heavily. Maybe 5 cigarettes a day. But it's expensive (thanks Australia),it hurts my throat, it makes me hungry, and makes my skin break out. 

I want to nip this in the bud before it becomes too hard. I never really thought of myself as an addict and I don't know if I'll never touch a cigarette again as long as I live but I don't want to be a smoker. 

I used cigarettes as a method of self harm and every time I went to stop something bad would happen and I would buy another packet but I don't want to do that anymore. 

So I guess tomorrow is officially Day 1.

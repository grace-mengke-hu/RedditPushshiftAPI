Day ten: thank god for exercise

Basically just wanted to say I made it to day ten, which is excellent. I kept managing for a week, then starting up again, so this is a breakthrough. 

Anyway, I am exercising pretty much every day, which is helping a lot. I mean why would I want to choke myself every day and then feel total crap when I go for a run? 

I can't believe I even chose to do that before - addiction makes you do stupid things. 

Anyway so far, just keeping busy (and the fact it is freezing cold outside) has made the experience pretty easy and quite pleasant so far.

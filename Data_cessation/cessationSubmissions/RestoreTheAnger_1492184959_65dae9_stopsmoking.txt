Addiction sucks

I'm sixteen days into this quit. I honestly think I have this thing beat and I know I won't let myself smoke. But damn I feel like I genuinely miss it. It's like a a companion I've been living with for a decade just up and left. It's weird I knew during this time I would feel angry and frustrated. Those feelings I have had before when quitting. But this time the sadness is what's getting to me. I think it's hitting hard because I know I'm actually done for good this time. All of my other quits I have known deep down I would smoke again. Not this time. So this is it for real. I say goodbye to my old friend for the last time.

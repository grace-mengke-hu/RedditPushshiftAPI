Back to work.. Worried.

Hey, so it's been a while and I feel like I've been doing really well.

However tomorrow I go back to work after a long break over the NYE/Christmas break, I'm an audio engineer and I have a big outdoor gig tomorrow and I know it's going to be close to 40 degrees and there's going to be a lot of time to kill and probably a lot of stress when artists arrive for soundcheck etc..

Really worried I'm going to slip up.. Anyone got some advice for someone looking to keep their calm?

Thanks in advance!

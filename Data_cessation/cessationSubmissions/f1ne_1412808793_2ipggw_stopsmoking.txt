3 weeks!!!!

I can't believe I went 3 weeks without a smoke. My body feels so much better. My mouth feels so clean. I don't smell. My bedroom doesn't smell like smoke. I walk past the shops in town, and each has an odor I can smell when I walk past!!!!

Everything tastes so good. I keep saying things like "this is the best cake I've had in my life!" "This is the best sushi I've had in my life!" "This is the best pizza I've had in my life!". I am going to gain weight just because everything tastes SO GOOD.

I've quit for a few days before, but never got that "smoking is bad, not smoking is so much better" feeling I have now. And that's just how I feel. Everything feels better without smoking.

I still get cravings, and I know I will have to build up a defense against cigarettes for years to come, or even the rest of my life. And it's worth it. Not having a smoke feels much better than having a smoke.

Occasional smoker the last 8 or so years, the last year I've smoked more then I ever have. Last cigarette was the morning of Christmas eve. Back to work Friday, worried the stress may cause me to smoke again.

Last 8 or so years I had the occasional smoke here or there. Never more then a few a week the first 6 years. A couple years ago I started smoking a little more often. Buying a pack here or there and smoking a few a day. I had always managed to quit whenever I wanted, but this last year has been so rough to quit for good.

I usually only smoke at work in the mornings. If my day is stressful I tend to have them after jobs, but never smoke at home. This last summer I managed to quit for about 3 weeks. I went on vacation for about a week and because I only smoke at work when I came back I managed to stay off them. I had gotten stressed out due to work around end of August and picked up smoking again. In October I planned another break around Christmas with my main goal to quit smoking again. My last day was suppose to be this last Saturday, but got called in Christmas eve and ended up smoking a couple that day. I've managed to not smoke Tuesday through Today, but have gotten two calls from my bosses trying to get me to come in today which I ignored them.

Now I'm bonkers stressed and am worried I'll start smoking tomorrow when I come in, but I so badly want to be done with it. I've been such a prick and asshole the last year because of it and I'm certain I tarnished a very good relationship because of it.

I've come a long way but I can't shake the work smoke break habit. Today is the day.

I get stressed at work. I get overloaded and it is hard to focus. My mind isn't at peace. There's no one in my office I enjoy working with and my sanctuary has become smoking. I'm taking too many breaks and I am killing myself in the process. I'm being selfish by taking myself away from my wife and family early all because I can't coup with the anxieties of working in a high pace service industry office setting with highly emotional people. 

Today is my day. Every other hour when the need arises I'm taking a walk. Maybe riding around in the golf cart for a short while and wave to the guest. Take some pictures of the course. Sit in my jeep and play on the phone. Do anything but smoke. 

It seems like such a simple thing to do at this point. I've been 100% quit for years. I only smoke 4 or 6 a day maybe four days a week. But I haven't been able to shake it until now.

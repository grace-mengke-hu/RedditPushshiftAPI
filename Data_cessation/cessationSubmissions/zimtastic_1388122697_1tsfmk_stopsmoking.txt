I told myself I could make it a month, I could have a "victory cigarette"

Honestly, forgot about that until I just saw my number of days in the sidebar.  It seems clear that was the addiction thinking for me at the time, trying to figure out some way to rationalize having a cigarette, even if it was in the future.

**Joke's on you brain!  I don't need cigarettes now!**

Also, this is the longest I've gone without smoking, so hurray for me :)

Smoking and drinking

I like to have a drink every now and again. Trouble is, I can't remember the last time I went out drinking and didn't smoke. I have a friend's birthday party on Saturday, and I'm kinda sure that once I'm a few drinks in, I'm gonna slip. How do you guys tend to cope with this situation?

See that? That was me falling off the wagon...

So, I had a really bad weekend. I was a smoker for a few years (not as long as y'all), but I quit because my husband (then- boyfriend but I wanted more) said I should. It really was that easy, just quit. (I know I am not as hard-core as some of you... I smoked a pack a week at my heaviest). We were together for five years, and I never picked up a cig that whole time. 

Then, the worst thing happened. He died. I was beside myself, driving home from the hospital. I stopped and got a pack just to keep my focus on something other than him while I drove. And that somehow got linked in my brain. For the last year and a half, I smoked when I got too emotional. It was my crutch. 39 days ago I finally said forget that noise, and decided to quit. My doctor put me on Wellbutrin for depression, but it also works as a quit-smoking aid. So I did have a bit of help.  

It was just a really long weekend. Everything seemed to get on my nerves and I couldn't decompress. I woke up crying, and it took me almost two hours to stop crying. It happens, but life has to go on. So, this morning, I broke down and picked up a pack. Three puffs in and I realized that it didn't do shit for me. So I cried some more. 

But, in the words of Chumbawomba: 

I get knocked down, but I get up again...

I actually quit yday but slipped today :( and am trying again now

I found this place just now and got myself a badge.
I am 22 and been smoking for 2.5 years now. I used to think they don't matter and I can quit anytime I want, oh boy was I wrong.
I used to smoke about 1 a day but was scared to smoke amoung my friends who were very judgemental of such things. so I used to look for some time out of my day to smoke a cig, everyday I would suffer from what I understand were withdrawl effects of nicotine and would finally have a smoke near end of the day. The day I would be able to smoke in mornings without anyone knowing would be great and I felt so happy that I wouldnt have to worry about the pain of not having cig that day haunt me.
From moment I would wake I would think about getting that cig.
When I started working and I could smoke as much as I want. I went from 1 a day to almost 10 a day and now I am sick of it.
I always tried to quit when I used to go home for vacations, but start smoking again as soon as I was back.
Max I've lasted is for a week and I was always so sad knowing that I wasted an entire week's work.
Yesterday I wanted to quit for good. I hate this need for nicotine, Its killing me slowly and I know that.
So on my first day I managed to go till evening 4:30 PM without a smoke and then I went out and had one. Boy did it feel good. But I am so guilty that I smoked again. I am not giving up. I know I am back to square one. but I am starting again. I know I can do it but I am so afraid of the cravings I am going to get.

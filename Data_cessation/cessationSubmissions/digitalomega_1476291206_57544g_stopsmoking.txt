Day 2. Extremely unfocused. Suggestions?

I'm on day 2 of no nicotine. How did y'all handle achieving/regaining focus after quitting? It's taking about 4 times longer to do even simple tasks for work. The cravings themselves have been fairly mild today, but it just feels like my brain is stuck in an endless loop. It's certainly not enough to make me cave. It's just annoying. Any recommendations or techniques you guys used?

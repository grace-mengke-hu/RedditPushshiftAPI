5 days in the hospital got me to quit. This time it's for good. 

I found out my appendix ruptured on the 22nd of February. I had little to minor pain when it happened, so I was quite lucky that It didn't do more damage than it did. I was in the hospital for 5 days and literally bed ridden for at least another 5 days after that, which was a burden on my now fiancee. I was in so much pain during that time with needles stuck in me, getting JP tubes removed, the catheters, and literally the physical pain that happened because of the surgery. 

The worst thing about this is, I know this isn't even remotely as bad as some people have it. I can't even think about smoking any more. Yes, I have a craving once and a while, but I don't want to willingly do something to my body that will make me go through something like this again. 


This is my reminder, I'm done!

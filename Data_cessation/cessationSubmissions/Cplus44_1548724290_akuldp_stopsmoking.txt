3 months in thanks to vaping

Vaping was the only way for me to quit and it was so easy. I started at 24mg nic juice and now I’m at 3mg next month I’m stopping completely, sometimes Hours pass and I completely forget about the vape. Honestly I think more people should stop by vaping it’s amazing I’ve tried hundreds of times to stop my two pack a day habit cold turkey, patches (which I still smoked while wearing!) gum and medication which made me extremely depressed. With vaping I feel like I entered a cheat code to get through the withdrawals without ever experiencing them. Thank God for vaping.

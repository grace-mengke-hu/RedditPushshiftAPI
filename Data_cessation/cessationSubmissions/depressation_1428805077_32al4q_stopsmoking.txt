Advice for depression

I've quit before for 3 months then 6 months (with patches) and now I'm at about 2 weeks.  Trying to go cold turkey this time because the patches just seem to make the misery last longer to me.  

The big reason I've relapsed and I'm really struggling this time again is major depression symptoms.  I've never been depressed before but when I quit I feel like I lose the ability to experience any joy in anything.  My sex drive plummets and even though my fiancee is really supportive I feel a strain on our relationship because of that and my withdrawn demeanor in general.  She's visiting family and today I just sat on the couch and did nothing.  *Like, all day.*  Posting this is the first productive thing I've done and its after 10pm.

I just feel vacant and I don't want to go back to smoking but I hate feeling like this and don't know how to deal with it.  Has anyone dealt with this and how did you get past the black hole I feel like I'm in right now?

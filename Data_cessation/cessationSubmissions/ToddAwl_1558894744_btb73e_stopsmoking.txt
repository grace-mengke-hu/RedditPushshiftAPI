Just quit smoking, what to expect? How to battle the cravings?

Hi everyone,

So I decided that enough is enough and I truly want to quit smoking for good. I've been smoking for 6 years, about 10 cigs per day, since I started working out I dropped to 6-7 per day. I've been working out for about 7 months now and since I'm taking this more seriously, I want to quit smoking completely. The biggest problem is the workplace, I'm craving really bad at work, during my breaks and etc. One of my good friends at work smokes and we always have breaks together, it's really hard to resist when somebody close to you smokes all the time. Also, when going out, I have really horrible cravings. So any tips how to fights these cravings? and any tips in general? what to expect when quitting smoking instantly? I really want this time to quit for good so any help is appreciated.

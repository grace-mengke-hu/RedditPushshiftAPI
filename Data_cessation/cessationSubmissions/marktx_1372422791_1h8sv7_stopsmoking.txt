I've made it a month today...

28th of May.. and now it's the 28th of June.. I've made it a month.. This is the longest I've ever gone.. 3 weeks was my previous record.. I've failed it every possible way trying to stop.. I think I've run out of ways to fail.. lol.. I know this might be cheating, I don't feel like it is, but I'm getting baked to celebrate.. I won't be able to get to cigarettes, I will not have a moment of weakness.. It's happening this time.

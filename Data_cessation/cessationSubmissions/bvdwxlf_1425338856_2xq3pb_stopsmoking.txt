Should I reset my badge?

So today I bought a tin of 20 small cigars. I don't know why I decided to do that or how I justified it to myself, must have been temporary insanity or something. 

Anyway, I smoked two of them after realising that it's exactly the same as just smoking cigarettes, and threw the rest of them away. (I spent 12 euros on them btw. Goddamnit I'm dumb.) Now I reek of tobacco and have a bad taste in my mouth.

Should I reset my badge? They weren't technically cigarettes, and I didn't really inhale as that's how you're supposed to smoke cigars. 

Thanks for any help!

Need some help friends

Hey everyone. I've never posted on here before but I drop by from time to time to read posts. 
Anyways, today makes 7 weeks for me without smoking. I've been vaping in it's place and it's been helping a lot. I've had rough craving the past week or two but I've held strong. 
All this leads me to this. My sister was in a bad car accident yesterday and she's in critical condition. Ventilator. It's pretty rough. And during this time, I've been wanting to just go buy a pack and smoke away. 
I know it may sound bad that this is what I'm thinking of. But anything to take my mind off of what's going on, ya know? I've been 7 weeks without smoking and I'm on the edge of going back.

4 months, yay! New wave of cravings these last few days. I will prevail :)

Hi!

It is possible and sometimes a lot of days go by without even thinking of tobacco. This seems to be in waves, though.

These last few days have been challenging. I am having long and strong cravings which take hours until they subside. I am not sure if this is because I wasn't able to exercise since last Monday (Easter holidays + closed sports center + lots of stuff to do) or just random craving peaks. I do know that I want to keep being free.

Cheers, everyone!

I was told how helpful this sub is, I need advice to help my mother quit smoking.

Hi everyone! I was told about this sub and I'm looking for help. My mom is 53 years old and still smoking. She started when she was 13 and in the prime was about a pack a day. She has a high stress job, as she and my father run a retail business. To her, smoking has been the stress reliever. She has tried everything from the patch, the gum, Chantax, cold turkey, e cig, books, meetings,  phone apps, even hypnosis. Just recently, she tried again cold turkey. She lasted about 4 weeks without a cigarette until she switched to "just 3 a day", which is a lie I know it's more than that. I don't know what to do to help her. it might be selfish of me but I don't want to loose her, I don't want her to get sick. I am not ready for that yet, I'm only 22 and I have 3 siblings. 

My best friends mom died rather quickly from lung cancer. When it was found, it was too late to be able to save her. My sister and I both are nurses in the medical  field so we know what will happen if she keeps smoking. 

The problem is, my sister and younger brother aren't hard on her. I know it's bad but I don't think babying her anymore will help. Maybe tough love won't either, but somethings gotta give. 

Anyone have any advice to help her quit or anything at all? I know that she can't quit unless she is ready to, but maybe tips for when she decided to give it a try again. Thank you for reading.

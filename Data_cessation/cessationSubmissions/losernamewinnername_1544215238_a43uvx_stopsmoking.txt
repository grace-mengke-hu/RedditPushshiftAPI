Nearing day 10 and lungs started hurting now wtf lol+a lil anxiety

I ain't getting mad anymore like crazy, but eh... :) it's worth it, but it's still like meh. I wonder

how long will this anxiety keep fucking me up? When I'm at home i'm kinda alright.. And when I go out into the city

I feel awkward as people pass by me. Maybe because I'm not doing much with my life atm or going out with anyone. 

Tomorrow is going to be some party in my city but I just feel too fucked to socialize, I don't want to be a fucking hermit but people disappoint the shit out of me.

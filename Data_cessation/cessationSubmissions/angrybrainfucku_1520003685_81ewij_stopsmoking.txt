Guys tomorrow is my 25th birthday and I have stopped smoking just 5 hours ago. I have smoked for 7 years, Don't want to continue at all. Please, share your successes stories to motivate me.

Share your successes stories, struggles before you succeeded and how can I remain quit and manage withdrawal symptoms without making my life a mess?
I Have not achieved anything meaningful so far in my life. I remember when I was a non smoker I was lively and positive. Since when I got addicted to cigarettes my addict brain just tries to find a reason to smoke. Cigarettes have ruined 7 best years of my life. I hate cigarettes but I'm terribly addicted to it.
Last seven years was like a battle between me and cigarettes I would quit cigarettes and then relapse. So far my best quit was for 62 days in 2014. I cried many many times for being an addict. I have anger issues whenever I try to quit. I get irritated so easily. I want to quit it. And I am quitting it. I smoked my last cigarettes more than 5 hours ago.

I just Relapsed. Should I just quit immediately again, or wait for next weekend when I will have less obstacles.

First off I chew I don't smoke but I need some immediate help. I had been nicotine free for 28 hours, but I ended up losing it and buying a can. I stuck a pinch in for maybe 3 minutes and spit it out. Did I just reset all my withdrawals? 

I have to drive 4 hours tonight, and it's going to be absolute torture. Then sit and do nothing all weekend. Should I just wait until next weekend when I'm free to try and quit again?

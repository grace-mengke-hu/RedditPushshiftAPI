Hanging out with Smokers - Help!

Day 6. A hard test for me tonight and tomorrow. Going to play ball and a lot of my team smokes. I love ball and won't avoid it. But....when they're all smoking tonight and having a beer...I'm terrified. I would love a beer too tonight but it goes hand in hand. Advice to cope???

Day 1 - I'm so excited!

I've woken up and am feeling really good about not needing to go outside and light up. 
I've been thinking about quitting for a while now and last night I bought a new packet of cigarettes for $27. What the hell was I thinking?! It's strange that I'll look at a shirt in the shops and actually question those prices, but it wouldn't bother me coughing up (punintended) $120 a week to smoke.
So far it's not too bad. I haven't left the house yet though. I have a particular route I take to the train station where i have a smoking spot, should I avoid that route until I'm strong enough to walk past it?

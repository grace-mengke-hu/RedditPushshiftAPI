There is a vacuum in my soul where cigarettes used to be

I tried ecigs but ended up with throat lesions (what's up with that, I can't imagine it's good for you). So I'm just done with it all. This is the longest I've gone without smoking for about 5 years, and have been smoking for 20 years. Luckily I am too lazy to go out and buy cigarettes, it's damn cold.

How do I stop thinking about smoking (ecigs or otherwise)? What worked for all of you?

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments.. It really helps me to know that you've all been through the same thing. I will get through this!! I like democratic dictator's point of view: I'm not giving up smoking, I'm just not having one right now. Thank you.

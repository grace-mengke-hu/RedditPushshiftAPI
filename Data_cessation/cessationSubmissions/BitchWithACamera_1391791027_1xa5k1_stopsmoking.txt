Day One. Again.

The time has finally come for me to quit smoking. Thanks to those awful little facebook "lookback" videos, I know this is my 5th or 6th time trying. I'm a photographer, and recently photographed a little girl who was born with one lung. Here she is fighting every day to breathe, and I'm thinking about when my next cigarette will be. A couple days later, I photographed a baby that just had a heart transplant. That really put things into perspective. 

I am not going cold turkey, (longest I went was 3 days) and I've read Allen Carr's book 4 times. I've upgraded my e-cig, and have a handful of new juices to replace cigarettes. Send positive thoughts my way please. (and that badge I just requested!) 

Woo!

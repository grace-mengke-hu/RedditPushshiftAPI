Tomorrow is my quit day. What do I need to know?

I am finally, truly ready, and I think I've finally got my timing down. 

*I just turned in my dissertation proposal, which means that I'll have a stress grace period and can take some time off from writing (my biggest trigger). This also coincides with my boyfriend's week off of work, so I will have more company and distractions. 

*I sat down and journaled about my reasons for wanting to quit and why I will feel much better when I do. I also made a list of things to do instead when I get a craving and how I will tweak my daily habits.  I'm in the groove of journaling anyway, so this will also be my quit journal. 

Is there anything else I can do throughout this last day to prepare and hopefully make this challenge more successful? Any little-talked-about issues (apart from the usual cravings and irritability and sleep interruptions and that sort of thing) that I might not be anticipating? I feel like I've done my research, but ya never know. 

I should also mention that I've decided to go cold turkey, but I was thinking I might pick up some nicotine gum for emergencies. I just don't want to prolong my dependence on the nicotine any more than I have to.

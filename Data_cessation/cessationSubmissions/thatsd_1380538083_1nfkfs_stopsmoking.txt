I see a problem on the horizon

Hello quitters, I can guarantee I'm not the first quitter to have this problem, it is a problem I have had when trying to quit before. Problem being drunk me. I've gone a week without smoking and coincidentally not drinking. However when I go on a night out smoking was my favorite hobby! I'm not good on the dance floor, the music is too loud in the club so I can't talk to anyone, I savored going to the smoking area to get some ~~fresh~~ air and socialize with people. On my next night out do you guys have any tips on how I can resist the urge to smoke?

Just checking in

So, I have to say, I had to take my daughter to the doctor /surgeon yesterday, and while they were asking the routine questions,it felt very strange when they said,does anyone in the home smoke?? My Daughter And I looked at each other and awkwardly said at the same time "not any more" and giggled!  Just felt strange, so used to saying yes.

Winter is a Huge Trigger!

I live in Minnesota and am pretty surprised at how much I want to smoke when it's cold outside. I quit in April and haven't had a big problem since then. But now...

Ever since I was 14 I've been sneaking out into the cold to smoke. Going for emo teenager headphone walks, huddling under a patio lamp at a bar, drinking tea in my pajamas and a huge coat on my front steps. Damn, it is a good smoke. I'm hope this isn't too triggering. It's just interesting how much a craving can blindside you, and how much your memories are tied up with smoking.  Maybe it's because the only reason to go outside when it's 18F (already? Whyyy?) Is to smoke. 

Aaaaaargh. I'm going to watch tv and will not smoke or eat everything.

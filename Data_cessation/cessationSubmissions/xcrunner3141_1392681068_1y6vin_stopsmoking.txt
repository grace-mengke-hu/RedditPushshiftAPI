Start of a new future

Just threw my last pack in the garbage today. with the help of my new e-cig i hope this will be the last time i kick this horrible habit. 
EDIT: a lof of people are talking about the continuing nicotine addiction with ecigs. I am quitting because of the negative health effects of tobacco, and due to the high cost of cigs in Boston. a continuing addiction, as long as it is not giving me cancer or ruining my lungs in fine with me.

Thank you for introducing me to ALLEN CARR's BOOK

this subreddit introduced me Allen Carr's book which has led me to be smoke-free for over 5 months!!  I didn't completely follow his instructions and used an ecig as a substitute for about 2 weeks.  Then, I re-evaulated what he says in the book and realized I don't even need this e-cig anymore.

I dropped my "hobby" of smoking and picked up a new hobby of lifting weights and a new diet (keto).  As a full-time employee, part-time 2 nights a week grad student with a 3.97 GPA, and full time gym rat,
ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT.

If you are TRULY 100% ready and committed to quit smoking, give the book a read.  
It has changed my life for the better.

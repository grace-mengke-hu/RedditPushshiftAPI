Has getting really sick helped anyone quit smoking?

I have been trying to quit for a while now. I just came down with strep throat after my first day without a cigarette. I am now on my third day, and the thought of smoking is horrendous right now. I am hoping this is a blessing in disguise.

Has this worked for anyone?

Just curious

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I am on day 3, my antibiotics are kicking in, and my throat is feeling better, but I still don't want to smoke! I started running again, which felt good. I am hoping this is it once and for all. Just almost broke up with my significant other due to other reasons, but we are trying to work things out, and the first thing we want to do for each other is quit smoking. This has to happen.

Best of luck to everyone struggling along with me! Just keep your head strong.

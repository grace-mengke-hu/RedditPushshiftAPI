Quitting smoking after smoking for 5 years

I’ve been a heavy smoker for 5 years. I have been smoking nearly 1 pack a day to the point I feel like my brain cannot work without my daily dose of nicotine. Tried to stop quitting many times, but I just felt like I wasn’t myself and was trapped in some kind of constant dream. 

I would like to know what uncomfortable feelings I should expect for the first days of quitting.

What can I do about the brain fog?

What can kind of hobbies I could substitute smoking with?

What are your tricks when it comes to cravings?

Any other tips or advices or what you experienced ?

Any tips would be very appreciated !

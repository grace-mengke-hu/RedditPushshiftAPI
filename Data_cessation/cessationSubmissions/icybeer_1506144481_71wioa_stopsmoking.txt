A little over a month aaaaaand..

I feel so conflicted.

I quit smoking over a month ago by buying a bottle of vape juice and promising myself that once I was finished I wouldn't inhale anymore nicotine what so ever.

The first week sucked, then I went on vacation and was able to forget about it for the most part but still had cravings.. These past couple of days though.. Man I feel like I could really give in.

I feel so empty and weird not smoking. I know i'm technically not missing out on anything, i've read the easy way but like I don't know? The habits I created by being a smoker linger over my head and I desperately want to find something to fill that void. I've been trying everything I can think of, pull ups every time I have a craving, stepping outside for a bit, drinking a lot of water. I feel envious whenever I see other people smoking to be honest. My brother still smokes and I fight the urge everyday to bum one off of him. Fuck I wish this was easier.

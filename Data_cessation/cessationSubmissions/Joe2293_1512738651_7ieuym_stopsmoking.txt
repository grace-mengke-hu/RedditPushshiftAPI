4 days... Thank you so much

Seeing everyones long-term success has really helped with being able to quit smoking. Felt like my life was on a hourly stress cycle where I had no time to live and felt beyond stressed to the point I had anxiety about new things and wanted as little as possible going on in my life.

Since deciding the stress cycle isn't for me I feel so much happier and feel like I have the impact to change my life in ways that smoking made me think I was stuck in the same place. It's only been 4 days but knowing the reality of going back to the stress cycle hourly isn't worth the couple of minutes smoking has really helped me through any craving issues.

Thank you so much for inspiring me to Quit smoking and make my life so much happier I hope to be able to post about long-term success one day!

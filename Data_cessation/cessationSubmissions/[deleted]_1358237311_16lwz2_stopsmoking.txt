100 days with no smoking! how was this quit different?

Every other quit had been "I know it's bad...", this time had less to do with the consequences, and more to do with a desire to feel better, be happier in this lifetime.  Take pride in your silent little battle.  It really is like Master Yoda says, "do or do not, there is no try". I'm SO pleased.

Want to quit but my smoker wife makes it hard

I've been smoking for about 4 years. I started because all of my friends smoked and it was a slippery slope from there. I have been able to quit for short periods of time - 5 months is the longest. I don't smoke near as much as I used to, down from a pack/day to about 5-6 a day now. 

The issue I have is that my wife has been smoking since she was a teenager. She has little to no desire to quit. She doesn't actively discourage me from quitting, but I don't feel like there's any true support there. She asks me if I want to smoke when she does and if I say no, I get questioned why not and so I just succumb to smoking. 

I know the problem isn't her desire to continue smoking, it's my lack of strong willpower to not feel guilty with questioning and stick to my guns. It's hard enough to quit the addiction, and harder still with no support. Has anyone else been in this situation before? How do I make it easier to get through it on my own?

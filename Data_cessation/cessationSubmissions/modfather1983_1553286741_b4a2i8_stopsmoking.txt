Do lozengers work, or do they become the new addiction?

I am now on 4th day of my most recent quit by using nicotinel lozengers. I wake up in morning and munch on them to get me through the first part of the morning then I find it difficult to wait the 2 hours before taking my next one.

My question is, are these things helping or are they becoming my new addiction?  Or are the increasing my boddies addiction to nicotine. The thoughts on not using them worries! 

Has anyone used these before and successfully quit, and weened off them or are they now just addicted to the lozengers?

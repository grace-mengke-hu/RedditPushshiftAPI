Anyone using apps to quit?

I'm trying using an app my smoking cessation adviser recommended to quit, which I think was mostly cos it's free in my area. It's ok there's like a game to distract you and some cbt stuff (called cigbreak) I wondered what apps people were using to quit? And what you found useful/not useful about them?

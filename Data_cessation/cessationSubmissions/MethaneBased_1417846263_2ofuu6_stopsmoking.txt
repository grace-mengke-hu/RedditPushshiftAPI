Nicotine gum makes me thirsty

The instructions clearly state not to eat or drink 15 minutes prior to having a piece of gum, but say nothing about drinking while using the gum. Now that it's in my mouth I am absolutely parched! I just want a nice, cold drink of water. Has anybody else shared this experience?

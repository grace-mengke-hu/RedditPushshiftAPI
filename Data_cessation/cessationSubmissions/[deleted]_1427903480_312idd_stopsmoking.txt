Smoked one cigarette, what to do?

So I quit sunday, but smoked one cigarette yesterday (bought whole pack, but haven't it touched since then), and didn't enjoy it. What to do now? Can I still say my quit date was sunday not yesterday? Because it seems that worst cravings are over and now it's easier not to smoke.

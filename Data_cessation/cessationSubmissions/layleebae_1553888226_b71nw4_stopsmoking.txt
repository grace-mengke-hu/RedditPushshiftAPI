Throat on fire!!

I havent officially quit smoking yet. I’ve cut back from 10-15 down to between 2-4 cigarettes a day. It seems like the less I smoke, the more it feels like I’ve just smoked a whole pack of cigarettes. Like when you wake up in the morning after a night of drinking and smoking up all of your cigarettes. 

It’s hard to explain but my throat and chest burn. I quit cold turkey about 3 years ago and had zero issues but now that I’m trying to quit again while cutting back this time that I’m feeling more crappy. 

Has anyone experienced this? Is this just what I get to deal with and it’ll go away? I find that I have more trouble with the burning sensation when I’ve had two versus when I have had four.

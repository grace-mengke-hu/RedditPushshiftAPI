Long time lurker, first time quitter

Well, I'm 8 hours in and it's a special kind of hell. I'm doing my best tho, even better than my usual best in some cases (like, I went running at lunch because I was so desperate to keep busy?!). I'm clearly *not* myself. It's cool tho. 

Thanks for all the inspo here. Reading everyone's posts for the last few months has what got me here, and I'm hopeful it'll take me through the next few hours / days / months / years, too <333

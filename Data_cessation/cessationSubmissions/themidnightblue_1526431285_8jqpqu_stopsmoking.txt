My (former) argument in support of smoking

It's all about how I look at the universe. If you're a forward thinker you might be terrified of what cancer can do to you. You can perfectly imagine what it's like in the doctor's office. 





It doesn't feel that way to me.





I can't see past a couple of days from now. All I can think about is my past and any lingering issue that's slowly eating away at my soul. Cigarettes relieve that somehow. It gives you comfort. It won't make you feel better, but it makes it less bad. But somehow it stops me from being good. It stops me from caring about the future. It stops me from trying to be a better me. 





I need to be a forward thinker. 





Accept the things you cannot change and have love for a greater tomorrow. 




I will find my love again.

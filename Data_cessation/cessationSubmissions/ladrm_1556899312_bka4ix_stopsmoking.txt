I knew about constipation but the smell of farts - is that for real?

I know that this is not a usually discussed topic, I'm on like day 2 of last two weeks constant on-off smoking and THAT SMELL. It's like chemical weapons attack. Is that normal? Did anyone else experienced that?

Might be my sense of smell is coming back, but honestly I don't think it's in the nose, more like the back nose.

Anyone else still have the odd dream about smoking?

Hi

It's been about 8 years since I quit smoking, and there's no way I would EVER go back. But for some reason, every once in a long while I will have a 'smoking dream' where I'm actually smoking and saying to myself "Well I'll just quit again, like I did before, it's no big deal!"

These dreams are common among new quitters, but it's funny I still get them 8 years later, even though I don't have any cravings in the day time :P

Finally dedicated.

Hey guys :) After about a year of beating myself for not making a commitment to quitting, and relapsing 20 minutes after "deciding" to quit, I have finally mentally committed myself. I hope the cigarette I just had was the last I will ever have. Started at 15 by the way, been smoking heavily the last 4 years since. Wish me luck :)

So I'm quitting. Again.

Time 5321. At least that's how it feels. I've white knuckled through cold turkey. I've used Allen Carr. I've used the patch, the gums, the lozenges. I've dropped money into awesome ecig set ups. 
I always go back. 
I just want this to be done, once and for all. I'm so over it.

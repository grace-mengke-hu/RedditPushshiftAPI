Do you remember..

...how you felt towards cigarettes before you started smoking? 

Let's say with the age of 13? You didn't smoke at that age and saw someone smoking - do you remember what you felt? That's right, you felt nothing - no desire to smoke, no desire to buy a cigarette nothing. Why? You were not addicted!

Here's the good news :)
It is save to say you'll feel that way again. I certainly do! I have no feelings towards cigarettes and no desire at all. 

So if your only fear is that you never be able to "forget" cigarettes. You will! You will forget this awful stuff and you will enjoy evey moment as if you never smoked :)

So go for it and quit!
It is the best thing you can do and I can assure you, you wont miss anything!

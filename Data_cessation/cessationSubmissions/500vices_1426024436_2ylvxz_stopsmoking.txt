Quitting smoking with organic tobacco?

Hi.

I'm a pretty heavy smoker (25+ day) and I really would like to quit smoking.

I've tried countless times cold turkey, the longest Ive gone is probably 5 months, but every time it has failed,

My strategy now is to try smoking only organic tobacco while slowly reduce my smoking. 

I've found a brand that promises that their tobacco is(and i quote):
-100% organic grown leaf tobacco
-free of pesticides and artificial fertilizers
-Free of flavoring agents and preservatives
-free of chemical humectants and burning agents

I hope the addiction becomes different and less powerful when not having the shady people behind Marlboro adding weird stuff to the tobacco.

So far I've been smoking organic tobacco for 4 days, and already I feel better, breathe easier, and have less stress. I also noticed that I crave cigarettes much less now.

The first day smoking only organic tobacco I craved the "kick" normal cigarettes gave me, it was really missing with organic tobacco!

Maybe it's a placebo effect..

But my question is, have anyone else tried quitting by first switching to organic tobacco? 

Would love to hear about others experiences.

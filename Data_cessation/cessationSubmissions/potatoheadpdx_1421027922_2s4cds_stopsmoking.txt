Starting to think about quitting.

I feel anxiety just thinking about it. 

I smoke about a pack every three days. I've been smoking for about five years. I don't think I like smoking as much as I tell myself I do. 

I have some dear friends who live far away and don't know I smoke, and I can go visit them for a week and not smoke the whole time and feel completely fine. It feels much more difficult when I'm at home and in my normal routine. 

I started budgeting this month and it's making me really think about how much I spend on cigarettes. I think that's why I'm starting to think about quitting. 

I've been lurking here for a while and you seem like a supportive group with good advice. So I'm just saying hi, and I hope to be one of you soon.

Those of you who quit using Alan Carr, how long did you spend reading his book?

Currently trying to quit (obviously), and am very serious about it. His mention of continuing to smoke while reading it (and following all of his instructions) has struck a cord because I'm down to 3 cigarettes. Debating on do I just stop with those, or buy another pack. I know that is incredibly lame, but it's where I'm at. Did you power through it and finish in one sitting, or did you take your time to read this over a few days and let it really sink in? Just curious what method worked best for different people.

I literally have 15 minutes in and I'm panicking already.

This is my 1000th quit. I made it 6 months once and a few weeks here and there but usually I can only make it a few hours before I get insane anxiety and cave. I just got back to work full time; I was off for four months dealing with Mental Health issues (starting new medication  and a new diagnoses of Bi Polar Disorder, BPD, and GAD). For those of you who have struggled with anxiety issues and quitting at the same time how did you do it? I have been in the same cycle of wake up, smoke the last of my cigarettes, set a quit time of 10am then fail by 6pm, start the process all over the next morning. I need help.

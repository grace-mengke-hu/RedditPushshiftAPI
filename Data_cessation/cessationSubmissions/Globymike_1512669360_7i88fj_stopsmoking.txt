I quit smoking two weeks ago, and can't tell anyone.

I've been a secret smoker for the last ten years. My wife and kids had no idea, and I went through great lengths to keep it that way. Finally quit cold turkey 14 days ago. I'm cranky, irritated, and not fun to be around, and I can't tell anyone why.

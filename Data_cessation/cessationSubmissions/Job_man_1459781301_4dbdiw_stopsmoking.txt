So I think this is day 1

Hey guys, smoker for 8 years and long time lurker in this sub. I've always secretly wished I had the strength to quit, but never really gave it a try. 
Today I woke up, smoked the last cigarette from my pack and felt too lazy to stop on my way to work to buy some more. I decided that I'd just try to not smoke today, expecting I'd hold out a couple of hours before I caved and bought a pack.
Well, it's been 7.5 hours since my last smoke. I honestly never thought I'd be able to get this far voluntarily. It's been easier than I expected, I only feel the occasional craving and headache. 
Anyways, I'm on a roll so I'm going to see how far I can go with this...who knows, maybe this is the start of a smoke-free life.

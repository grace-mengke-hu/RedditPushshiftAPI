Think this might be my last one...

Been sick and tired of smoking. Used the easyway method with success and then had a big issue with my girlfriend spending a little too much time with another guy and more and more started being revealed and I went back to my cigarettes. Don’t want to smoke, keep smoking but I’m thinking tonight is the end of it. Can’t keep doing it. Any advice on how you quit cold turkey? Would love to hear it!

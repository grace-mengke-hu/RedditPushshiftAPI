[Day 2] A bit late

Hey guys, so this is my day 2 post (even though this is the 3rd day after my big decision to quit).

I spoke to my psychiatrist about quitting and he prescribed me anti-depressants which also help with nicotine deprivation. The catch is that i need to postpone fully quitting for 3 days and then after that I stop. 

As i drove home i was wondering if i should push on or just give in and take the meds and make it a bit easier for myself.

At about 5pm (GMT) i decided that I'm going to go the meds route. 

So i had 2 cigarettes last night. This morning i've already had 2 as well. 

Getting through work is a bitch right now because our servers got hacked so I'm restoring and upgrading all of our websites (i work as a website developer). My goal for the next 2 days is to keep pushing to smoke as little as possible and then go cold on day 6.

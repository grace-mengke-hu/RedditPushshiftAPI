Tomorrow will be two weeks cigarette free!

Two weeks ago (3/25) I came down with a severe case of viral pharyngitis. Since I was already miserable and basically bedridden, I decided that was the perfect time to be able to kick my cigarette addiction. Now, my cravings are easily managed by the nicorette mini-lozenges and I'm feeling great!
Highly recommend piggybacking smoking cessation on an illness. It made it easy to quit and stay smoke-free long enough for the nicotine to leave your system.

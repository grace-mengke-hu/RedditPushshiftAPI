Day 4... first Monday without a smoke

So... I'm at work and it's day 4 without smoking or any nicotine. I'm taking Chantix and it's helped a lot with cravings and anxiety. I still have the cravings... but they are way less frequent and intense.

I had some anger issues over the weekend. Some stuff came out. I was definitely stuffing my anger with smoking. I did talk to a friend on Sunday who reminded me why I was doing this and that it's okay to have these emotions. 

So, it's now Monday and I haven't smoked all weekend... which is a huge accomplishment because I get bored sometimes and want to smoke. But, work is another trigger. I often like to take breaks and go outside to have a cigarette. It's supposed to be 70 degrees outside and sunny... so I know I'm going to want to go out and take a break. I'll ask a coworker if they want to go out with me.

I'm certain I won't want to smoke. But, just in case.

Anyway.. wish me luck this week. So far so good!

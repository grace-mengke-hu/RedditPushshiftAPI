I need motivation

Going through a very tough time. Short version is: I quit smoking when I was pregnant. I had a miscarriage. I'm devastated. I want to smoke and drown my sorrows. For now I'm knitting baby hats to donate to a hospital. It keeps me busy but when I stop I want to just cry and smoke. Help.

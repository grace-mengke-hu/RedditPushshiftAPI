Checking in...

Hey guys, 

30 year 1.5 pack a day smoker checking in. Stopped smoking last sunday, am vaping every now and then. Snapped at gf yesterday for bullshit reason and feel like shit. Just checked blood pressure with doctor and it's much higher than usual probably due to stress.  

Anyways, i did it to myself so can't complain too much.  

Hope i feel better soon. 

Take care all!

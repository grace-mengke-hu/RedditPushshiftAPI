I am doing it. I'm actually doing it.

Little over a week ago I bawled my eyes out on this sub over the fact that I couldn't quit again. Well I'm doing it and it's funny, I don't really feel deprived and though not smoking is relatively "easy" I am TERRIFIED that I will smoke at some point. Ironically I think this was one of my issues, quitting for good the last time. It was so easy, that I had no fear, so picking up a cigarette felt like no biggie. I TRULY believed I would just smoke that one cig or just a couple a year. This time I know better.

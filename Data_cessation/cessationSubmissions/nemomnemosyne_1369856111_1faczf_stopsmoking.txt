I've made it a week!

Just had to come in here and motivate myself by letting you guys know I've made it a week. The worst days were the first and third, as far as withdrawals go. The third day I nearly got into a fight with a friend of mine it was so bad and I was thinking so irrationally. I apologized though so no worries!

At any rate, One week down, a lifetime to go!

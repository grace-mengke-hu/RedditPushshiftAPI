Here goes nothing....

Day 1 here... I have been losing weight since June 1st (so far down 30 pounds) and recently started going to the gym... it's been absolutely brutal. The coughing fits are ridiculous and I don't enjoy smoking anymore. I'm ready to move on.

Any advice on getting through the first couple of days?

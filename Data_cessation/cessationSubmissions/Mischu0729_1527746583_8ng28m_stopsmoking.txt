It's been almost a month!

I started smoking in 2012,  about a pack per day, but  in the last 2 or 3 years, I only smoke 1 or 2 packs on weekends while enjoying soccer matches.

Last time I smoked was  May 2nd, so it's almost a month. Sometimes I still wanted to smoke, but managed to not to smoke,  it feels great, also can save some money.

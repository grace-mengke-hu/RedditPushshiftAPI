Weed got me into a sigarette addiction and don't know how to start quitting

So hi!

I am a 29 year old guy, comfortable job and few big issues but one, and it's gotten me into a grip I can't leave out of..


I recently sold my own house and started living with my brother.
For the last 2 years I've been smoking pure weed frequently (1-2 grams a day). Now that I live with my brother (who is very protective and anti weed) I can't smoke in the yard or at home at all. Or get high for evenings on end. To get my fix however I started buying pre-rolled joints (with tobacco) and smoking then on my cycle home.

This has been the last 6 months and now I don't long to get high anymore (I think it was a phase) but I find an uncontrollable need for sigarettes and for the last 2 months I've started smoking 7-10 sigs a day (I have a lengthy cycle as commute).


I want to quit and talk to myself but there I am again, smoking. I've lost complete control and don't know to get it back and start quitting for real.


Any (dubious) advice is greatly appreciated

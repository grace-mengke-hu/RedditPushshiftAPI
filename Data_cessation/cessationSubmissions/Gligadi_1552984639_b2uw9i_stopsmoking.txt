Decided to start my journey

Hello,

I'm 22 years old and have been smoking for 4,5 years. I've decided to make end with it and here are some of the motives why I want to pull myself together.

I love football (soccer to north americans), and I've been playing since age of 9. Before I made that mistake of having the first smoke I was an engine. I could run all day and run rings around people. I was agile and quick.

That has changed and I always find myself catching breath because I simply cannot keep up with people. I want to be the active person I once was. I want to enjoy football as I used to and be active elsewhere. I want to feel the fresh air and taste the tastiest of foods again. I am sick and tired of having burns in my stomach, headaches and hyperventilation after climbing the 4 stories just to get home. My body is still young and can recover from this well. I consider myself a loser for giving way to the habit but what has happened stays in the past and I got noone else to blame for it but myself.

I am dead serious about getting myself past this part of my life and get back on the football field flashing heels to others. The time has come for me to take control over my life and make the necessary changes to make this a reality.

I hope you, my fellow redditors can help me as well since hearing stories from you can be of great help.

Sorry for the long post and weak english.

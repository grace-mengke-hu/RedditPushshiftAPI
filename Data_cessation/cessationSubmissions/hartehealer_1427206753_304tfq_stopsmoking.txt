Nonsmoker and Sleep/Tired

Has anyone found that they struggle with being tired/sleepier than usual in the morning if they don't get a morning nicotine fix first thing? I usually had a morning smoke within 5-10 minutes of waking up and another two or three by the time I'd left for work and it was essentially my method of feeling awake (tea/caffeine doesn't do it these days the way it used to). Now in day 1 and I'm at work having trouble seeing straight I feel so tired. Not to mention I remember waking up in the middle of the night which isn't common for me these days.

Any suggestions for feeling more awake without the ick addiction? Currently drinking tea and water.

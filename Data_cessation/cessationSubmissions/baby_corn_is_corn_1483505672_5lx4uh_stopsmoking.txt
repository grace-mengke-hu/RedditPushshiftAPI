How to get high on air

Don't do this if you are walking or operating a vehicle.

Sit down.

Wait until you want a cigarette.

The thought comes up and usually, you would just smoke a cigarette.  But this time you aren't going to.

Take a deep breath ALL THE WAY IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE.  This is important.  Breath in as much as possible.  Stretch your lungs out as much as you can.  You want to displace any little pockets of stale air in your lungs.

 Blow out all your air until you can't blow anymore out.  Don't collapse your lungs, though.

Now feel your need for oxygen.  Do not breathe in until you feel like you want to breathe. 

When that time comes, breathe all the way in (all the way) and blow it out right away.  All the way out.

Breathe all the way in and all the way out three times in a row.  Don't hurry.  It might take 15 seconds to transfer all that air.

But breathe all the way in and all the way out 3 times in a row.  

Now do it three more times as fast as you can.  Then do it three times at leisure.

If you have followed these instructions you will now be hyperventilated and should feel a little high.

TLDR:  Take ten full deep breaths right in a row and you will get high.

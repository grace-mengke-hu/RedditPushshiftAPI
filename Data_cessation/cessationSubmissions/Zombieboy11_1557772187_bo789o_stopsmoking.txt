If I stop smoking I will be unstoppable

This is the only vice I got and I feel trapped by it sort of like a slave.
To beat this addiction means beating the biggest monsters of all for me. 
I feel like I smoke cigarettes to avoid reality it is like my sweet spot. 
I want to face it now because everyday when I smoke I hate myself.

I haven't been in a good place recently and quitting was more than I could handle but now I feel motivated to do it.

Tomorrow morning I won't drink coffee and won't smoke.

The urge will haunt me it always does but I know better I should stop being so soft and let it control me.

Feel free to share advice and any thoughts you might have.

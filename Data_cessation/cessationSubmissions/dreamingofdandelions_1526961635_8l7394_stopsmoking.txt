My dog died today in my arms. I gave into my cravings.

My nearly 17 year old pug died in my arms this morning. I felt her heart just stop in my hands as I held her gently. Her tailed wagged up till the end. I’m so thankful she passed away in our home, by her own will. Not at the vets, and not with a shot. But it broke me. I’ve been a mess all day. I went to my volunteer job and was told I was a zombie. So I bought a pack of my favorite death sticks and had a few. I know tomorrow I might throw them out or might finish the pack. But I will not buy another one. I know my dear pup wouldn’t want me to start up again. But it was a few cigs or a bottle of whiskey. I need to reset my 2 month mark back to zero. RIP to the best dog in the world. Your dog might be great, but mine was truly one of a kind.

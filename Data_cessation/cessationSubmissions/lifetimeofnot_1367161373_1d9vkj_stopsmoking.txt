2 weeks down

Its been two weeks now and im feeling pretty good. No cravings really. I will randomly encounter a situation where I think I want to smoke because its what ive always done but yeah. It feels like its been much longer and much shorter at the same time. Im more than willing to answer any questions anyone has.

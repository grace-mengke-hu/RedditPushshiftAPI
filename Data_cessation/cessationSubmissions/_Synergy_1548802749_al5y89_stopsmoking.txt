Struggling Again. How do I always end up here

Hey, everyone! It's time for me to make a post.

I went 6.5 months cold turkey smoke free until December 16 at 4:30AM. I know this because I was stressed out because I was having bad marital issues.

Now, I'm smoking roughly 4-5 a day max but I know I need to stop. It's messing with my heart.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here but I feel so shitty and I hate it.

I love every one of you.

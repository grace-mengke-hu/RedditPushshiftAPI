I'd like to share about the little known rape' that I used to instantly quit smoking

First, remember this is STOP SMOKING.  This is not STOP ALL USES OF THE PLANT NO MATTER WHAT.  

If you think that indigenous ceremonial use of a version of the plant that is NOT SMOKED but does help with mental clarity, mindful breathing, and other benefits shouldn't be discussed here - you are being a nazi and should go to /r/stoptobaccouse.   This fits just fine here AND MAY HELP PEOPLE

So don't judge it as quickly as you did last post.  THIS MAY HELP PEOPLE AS IT HAS HELPED ME GREATLY.

If you don't know what it is.  It is made from ashes of sacred plants as well as tobacco.  It contains some niccotine and you blow it up your nose.  With music and stillness and mindfulness.  Not on your 15 min break.

I found after having Rape' gave me a real benefit from the tobacco.  Cigarettes do not have a benefit no matter what you tell yourself.  They do NOT DO the things you keep saying they do, they only hurt you.  

Because the plant was supposed to be used as the indigenous do, LOW frequency HIGH dose.  And used spiritually in ceremony followed by mindfully breathing exercises. 

Cigarettes high frequency low dose do nothing more than raise your tolerance and make you sick.

I think Rape' helps get your mind to go where the plant was supposed to get you to go when it was mental medicine and not a habitual thing or social identifier.

I'm 8 months (badge is off) cigarette free but every few days I have some rape' and it gives me everything I need.

Need some help to get through mornings without cigs.

Hello everyone, I am on my next attempt to the big goal of no smoking, here is my situation.

It has been long carved into my brain that every morning, i make the same route, go buy a pack, get an espresso at my uni's cafe and sit in the trees till i wake up properly.

The thing is, if I pass this first step of the day without buying/smoking, i don't actually have a problem at all and have minimal cravings all day, i just fuck it up in the mornings.

Help, how do I resist?

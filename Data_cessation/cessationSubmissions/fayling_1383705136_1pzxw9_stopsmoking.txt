Day 1- hungover and struggling

This is my third or fourth attempt quitting. I'm 22, smoking on and off from the age of 17. 

Currently on Champix (Pfizer medication) to quit and I'm still finding the urge to smoke where I usually would. Having my morning coffee, during work etc. 

This is the second time I've taken Champix and I found it very helpful last time. I'm also using their online support service and likely to set up SMS reminders to tell me to take medication etc. I also see a psychologist for unrelated reasons but understand I can use her as a platform for support as well.

I'm looking for support and advice/ideas on small tasks to do instead of smoking.

Instead of smoking I had a massive burrito for lunch. That sated the hangover but now I'm really sleepy.

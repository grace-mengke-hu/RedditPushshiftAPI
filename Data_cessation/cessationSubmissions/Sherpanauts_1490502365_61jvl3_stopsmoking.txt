First post, just wanted to let someone know I'm about to begin my journey to a cigarette free life!

Hi guys, I've never posted before. Not even sure if these kind of posts are cool here and if not I apologize. 

I'm 21 years old, I've been smoking on and off since I was 19. At my worst a pack a day. I don't enjoy it, it doesn't benefit me and I wanna live a healthier lifestyle. I know I'm addicted and that's a problem so I wanted to let someone know who might understand, I don't want encouragement just someone to know I'm trying even if I don't know them personally. 

I watched it slowly kill my mother until her eventual death of lung complications a week after my 20th birthday, she was just barely 50. I don't wanna die like that, and I wanna live a long healthy life so I think it's time I give it a good try. Monday is when I'm gonna try going cold turkey. I'll be having my last 2 cigarettes tomorrow. Thanks for listening, just wanted to let you know!

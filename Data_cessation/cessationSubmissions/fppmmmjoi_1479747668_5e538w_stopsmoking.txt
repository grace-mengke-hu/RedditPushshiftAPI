How likely is to this person to develop some kind of cancer?

So based on what you know if this person is in her 50s and has been smoking around 5 cigarrettes a day for around 10 years. How likely is that she develops some kind of cancer or respiratory problem or something? She has been coughing for the last three months. Is there a quantity of cigarrettes per day that gives you no risk?

15 year old here. Up to about 5 smokes a day. Getting a bit worried.

I'm pretty honest with myself. I told myself "if this ever becomes an issue, I'll slow down or stop". Well now it's getting a bit out of control. It's taking time out of my day and I always feel like a need a smoke to enhance the moment. I'm not really sure I want to quit, I would just like some opinions.

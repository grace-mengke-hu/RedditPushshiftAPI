Two Months!

I am excited and feeling on top of the world right now!

I hadn't gone two days in the last 10+ years without tobacco and today makes it two months! It hasn't been easy, but every day is getting easier.

Thanks to everyone here for posting success stories and slip ups to keep me motivated. Every aspect of my life has improved over the last two months and I am looking forward to making it 1/4 of a year soon!

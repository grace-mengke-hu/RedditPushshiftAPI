So I work with some smoking cessation experts and they've helped me quit smoking. Just wanted to share some tips that I got from them.

So I work for a pharma consulting company and one of the things we work on is smoking cessation products (gums, patches, lozenges, etc).  Some of the people that I work for are top researchers in the field of smoking cessation.  I started working there about three years ago and kept smoking, which was awkward considering the working environment. I tried quitting a couple of times on my own, but I would just start up again a few days later. I was a little paranoid about stinking after my lunch break but the lure was too much.

One day, my VP came into my office and asked me if I'd like some help to quit smoking. I took him up on the offer and I am now three months without a cigarette! I thought I'd come on and share some of the things that I learned. A lot of it is just recap of stuff that's already on here, but it might be nice to have it all in one place.

Some fun facts about smoking and quitting:

1) Those who have quit by the age of 35 have about the same life expectancy as those who have never smoked before.

2) For every year after 35 that a smoker quits, s/he can expect to gain about 8 months of life expectancy.

3) It's much harder to quit if you started before the age of 15 since that's the time your brain is still developing and is more vulnerable to addictions.

4) Nicotine by itself has shown few harmful effects on the body aside from some cardiovascular effects. It might actually help in cognitive function if administered the correct way.

5) Gums and patches have a fairly low success rate on their own, but when you couple a good support system with multiple forms of nicotine replacement, the success rates rise substantially. Also, as FDA has recently announced, you CAN keep using it even if you continue to smoke. Prior to a few months ago, they were saying that if you relapse you have to stop using it. Well, that was crap, so...yea.

6) A lot of smokers say that they smoke out of stress. However, the nicotine withdrawals cause anxiety and may exacerbate any stress you might have. Ex-smokers say their stress levels decline dramatically after smoking.

7) You might gain weight when you quit smoking. Ex-smokers are on average heavier than those who have never smoked, even a long time after quitting. They don't really know why but I kinda suspect it's because you can finally taste things properly again! I just want to eat and taste everything again!

8) E-cigarettes are awesome. They're not FDA approved so you still run the risk of having crap in there that's not good for you (and my VP kinda gave me a disapproving look when I told him I was using one), but if you check out reputable sites or even our own /r/electronic_cigarette, you'll probably be fine. They fulfill the nicotine craving and that oral fixation (teehee). Plus, if you like smoking hookah, the smoke consistency is pretty similar if you use a good quality e-cig (thick enough is thick enough to blow awesome rings with). I love it.

9) There are more former smokers in the world than there are smokers. More than half of all smokers in the world have already quit. It can be done!

Tips on how to quit:

* Choose a quit day and stick to it.  Make it about a month ahead of time so you have some time to prepare yourself.
* Don't do it alone! Let someone know you're actively trying to quit smoking. Obviously, it would be great if this person was a family member or friend who is around a lot to help you through cravings.
* Understand that you're biologically dependent on a drug now. You've changed your body's baseline so that it only feels normal when you have nicotine in your system. If you try to quit without the aid of nicotine, you're going to have a much harder time since you're fighting your body's natural impulses.
* Start using NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) about two weeks prior to your quit date. Smoke as usual during this time. I found that during my two week pre-quit period, the gum and patches were keeping me feeling pretty good. I still had a cigarette at lunch, but I only smoked one versus the four that I usually smoked during my lunch break.
* On your quit day, get rid of everything associated with smoking in your house, car, etc. That means your lighters, matches, cartons, packs, ashtrays...whatever it is, it has to go. If you're like me and you have a really nice ashtray that is a nice collector's item that you'd like to hold onto, pack it away somewhere or give it to a friend to hold.
* Keep yourself out of situations where you'd have a cigarette. I used to smoke a lot when I was out at bars with friends. I haven't stopped going out to bars, but I will decline to join them outside even when I'm left alone inside. It keeps you away from the temptation and hey - you'll smell better when you hit on that cute chick/dude from across the bar while you're bored waiting.
* If you relapse and have a cigarette, IT'S OKAY. You haven't failed. Continue using the nicotine replacement therapies and get back on that saddle. Think about what prompted you to smoke. Were you in a specific situation? Were you bored? What can you do if you were put in that situation again? 

Anyhow, I hope this is useful! Let me know if there are any questions.  Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR** Quitting smoking is hard! Get help from whatever sources you can, including friends, family, e-cigs, gum, patches - WHATEVER WORKS.

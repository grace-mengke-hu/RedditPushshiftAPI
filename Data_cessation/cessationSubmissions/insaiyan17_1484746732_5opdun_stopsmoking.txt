1 week!!!

I just wanted to share my excitement on this lovely day. To any of you questioning if you're ready to stop, read Allen Carr's easyway to stop smoking: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3ugFPnbtHHnQ2w0SlZmSU5kQU0/edit?pli=1

It has been mentioned here alot, and it really helped me realize why i really used nicotine, and how to overcome that little evil nicotine monster. 

Good luck :)

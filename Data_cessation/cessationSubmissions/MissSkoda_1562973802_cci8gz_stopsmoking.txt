Today marks 2 years since I quit.

I smoked since I was 14 (29 now).
I never could imagine myself as a non smoker, But here we are 2 years later. According to my quit buddy app, I’ve saved over $10k. I also don’t cough my hole out as soon as i wake up. 

If your thinking of quitting, give it a try. If you don’t succeed, oh well, that’s life. Try again. 

You got this!

Day #3- anyone else have severe body aches?

I'm on quit day \#3 and you guys I'm so close to giving in due to physical pain!! My back, neck, arms and legs have been cramping intensely since I woke up this morning. I've taken Aleeve and done some yoga stretches but it's so bad I can't imagine working today. Needed to vent, and if anyone has tips I'll listen. Thanks friends!

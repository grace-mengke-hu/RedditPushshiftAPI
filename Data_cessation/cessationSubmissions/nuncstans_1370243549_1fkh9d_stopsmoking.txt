Just stopped. Gonna need some advice and luck.

I'm 23 this year and I've been smoking a pack a day for the last 7 years of my life but decided that I shouls finally get to quitting 2 days ago. Been goinf through spearmint gum like a monster to deal with the cravings. Any other ways that could help that don't include nicotine supplements? Cheers guys!

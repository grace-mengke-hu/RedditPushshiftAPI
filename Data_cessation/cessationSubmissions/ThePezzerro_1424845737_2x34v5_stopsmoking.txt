I took advantage of a miserable situation.

A little over 10 days ago I came down with a bad case of mononucleosis. Laying there with tonsils so swollen they touched together and too much fatigue to even walk outside, I realized one week without a smoke had already rolled around, so I decided to let this virus help me quit. I am at 10 days now and I need my slightly-healthier self to stay strong through the next couple important weeks or this could have all been for nothing. Seems like coming down with mono doesn't have to be 100% terrible...

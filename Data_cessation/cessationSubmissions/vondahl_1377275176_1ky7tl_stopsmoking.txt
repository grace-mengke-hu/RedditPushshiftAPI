"Struggle is nature's way of strengthening."

My husband and I were watching season 1 of Lost last night, and [this scene hit close to home.](http://youtu.be/cOUQlHnsCxQ) [1:21]

I figured I'd share the clip with you all and maybe it will give you a little boost like it did for me. Even though the drug is different, the concept is the same and I think the analogy is beautiful. We struggle to break free of our addiction. When we do, we have this whole new life and bright future, and we can face it because we're stronger than before. 

Struggle is nature's way of strengthening. No matter how long it's been since you quit - an hour, a day, a month, or a year (or if you're planning on quitting soon!) just remember that our struggles strengthen us. We're strong enough to break out of that "cocoon" and not only survive, but flourish without that addiction holding us back. So, that's my thought for the day. Have a great weekend, you guys are the best!

How do you get a badge

Started when I was 16, almost 21 now and tired of feeling like shit about it. Almost quit but then I had to stop smoking weed because of some legal issues and I've been smoking more then ever. I want to get a badge to keep track of how many days in I am. My girlfriend is quoting with me so that's encouraging, any tips would help.

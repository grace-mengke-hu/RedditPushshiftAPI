Wanna quit, what things help you fight the cravings?

Hey /r/stopsmoking. 

So I've tried to quit before, and I just find it far too difficult. The weird part is I've done it before, i.e. go a week without smoking but then collapse right back into it. I do notice im a lot more productive and less tired when I don't do it. But as soon as I'm at a gas station, I can't help it and I buy a pack. 

So what are the alternatives that help you fight the cravings? I'm not real hip on the e-cigs because it just seems to dry out my lungs way more than a regular cig. So all feedback appreciated, thanks!

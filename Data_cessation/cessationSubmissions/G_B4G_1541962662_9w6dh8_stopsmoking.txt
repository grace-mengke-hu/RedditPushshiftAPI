Bleeding Gums as motivation

Yesterday my gums bled for about an hour. I've been able to suck blood from my gums for about 3-4 months. But having them just start bleeding a lot was a bit much. Haven't had a cigarette since. Hopefully this is the motivation i need. 

Stay strong everyone, the longer you wait the worse the problems will be. Could you imagine if I had someone over, a romantic interest even and I just start oozing blood from my mouth... lord have mercy.

27 hours without a cigarette, and I've never felt better about stopping smoking

I've quit many times before, even for 18 months at one point! But I always found an excuse to go back, whether it be stress, boredom, alcohol, etc. 

Every time I've tried to stop smoking, I've focused on the try. This time I'm just stopping smoking. It's not an attempt. It's a a full-stop change. And just dropping that word "try" I feel like there's no anxiety. I'm not fighting through anything, I'm changing the things I do to improve myself.

Maybe someone else out there can benefit from changing how they think about quitting too!

I have decided to quit! I've never tried before.

Hey guys,

I was reading several links you have posted and I've never seen a group so enthusiastic about quitting. You guys made me feel like there is another world waiting for me, I want that.

A little about my habit. I'm 21, I've been smoking since I was 12. This means that I don't remember what it was like not smoking. My earliest memories have always had a cigarette in the picture. I don't remember the last time I had a meal and not have a cigarette afterwards, my brain just doesn't comply.

Enough is enough, I'm slowly shedding my life and bank away to smokes. It really isn't the money but in Australia, my smokes go for AUD$21 a pack. I'm ready to quit, any tips and advice would be great.


Thanks guys, I want to join your new world.

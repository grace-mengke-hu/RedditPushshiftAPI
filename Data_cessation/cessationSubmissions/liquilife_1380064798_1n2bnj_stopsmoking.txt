Well, just realized I am at day 100

I've just discovered I'm at day 100. This is great. I rarely praise myself and stroke my own ego... but damn. So awesome! It's been 100 days since I woke up with the rumbling sound in my lungs. It's been 100 days since I've escaped from the group of friends to quickly smoke a cigarette. This is amazing. :)

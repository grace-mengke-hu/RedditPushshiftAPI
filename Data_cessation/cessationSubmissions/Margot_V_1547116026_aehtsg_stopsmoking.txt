6 weeks non-smoking (cravings)

Hi guys

I have been off the smokes for just over 6 weeks now. On the first few days I was feeling the need to smoke every hour (I was a smoker for over 20 years). Now I only have cravings once or twice a day.... but my question is... when do they go away? Because even though the number of cravings per day have definitely decreased A LOT, the intensity still horrendous. 

I know by now that I just need to control myself for few minutes and it goes away but I'm feeling disheartened  as when the cravings hit me I could do anything for a drag. It's overwhelming. It hits me like a brick wall. 

I feel proud of the fact I am not smoking but I am afraid one day I will just say "fuck it" and smoke one.

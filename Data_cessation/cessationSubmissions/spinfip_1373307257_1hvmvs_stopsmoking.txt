Anyone else start remembering dreams more often after they quit?

I haven't had a cig in about 9 days, and for the last week or so, I've suddenly been remembering my dreams a lot more often.

I could count on one hand the number of dreams I remembered in the last year, but in the last week, I've had 6, and 2 just last night alone!

Is this something that just happens when you quit, or is there something else going on?

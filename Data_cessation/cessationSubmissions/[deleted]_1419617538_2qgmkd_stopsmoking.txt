Deleting my "Quit Smoking" app.

I'm deleting my quit smoking app. I've been off the darts for 4 months and 15 days, and I have completely lost all cravings. I lost all cravings months ago, but just thought to post now. I find cigarettes gross now, and I really can't believe I ever smoked. My girlfriend still smokes and I can not stand the smell, I only hope she can quit someday too. 

The way I did it: Cold turkey. There was a break in my routine (I went out of town to stay with my parents for a couple days to visit), and I would never smoke around my parents. That break in my routine was just enough to kickstart me just not smoking anymore. In the beginning I had to try to not have one, walking out my door to go to the store and then turning around, etc., but over time the thoughts just left my brain, I never have them anymore.  

I can feel it in my bones that I have quit for good. I'll get nice and drunk and still be enthusiastic about telling cigarettes to fuck off. I haven't had even an inkling of a craving in a long time. I am off the darts for good and it feels awesome. I can swim the length of a big pool completely underwater. I can hold my breath, I don't cough, and I can smell every single smell on this bigass beautiful planet. Since quitting I've saved (my phone tells me) about $400. Fuck yeah. Never, ever, ever going back. Good luck to the rest of you.

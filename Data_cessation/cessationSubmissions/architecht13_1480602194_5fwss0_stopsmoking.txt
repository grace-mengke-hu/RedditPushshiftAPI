Probably asked a million times, but any advice to quit for good?

Hi everyone.

I have attempted to quit more times than I can count and went two days without a cigarette until just now.  I'm getting tired of having these stupid things run my day and potentially ruin my life.

Anyone have any good solid advice that extends beyond "you can do it!"?

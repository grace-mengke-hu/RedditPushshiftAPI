How's your New Year's resolution coming along?

I vowed to make 2014 a tobacco free year. I failed with that, but I'm still trying to quit. I was a pack a day smoker. I went all of Jan 1st without a cigarette, but the following week I was careless. I still smoked.

Now, I'm down to 1 or 2 cigarettes a day. I should be 100% tobacco free by the end of January. I'm okay with that. Remember, even if we cheat or break promises to ourselves, keep pushing.

I'm using an APV ecig, and have quite the collection now. I prefer it to cigarettes now. So, when I order more ejuice, I'll be ordering in 6mg and 12mg, rather than 18mg. In my mind, it's still progress. I do plan to give up nicotine all together sometime this year. 

So, how is it going for everyone else here on /r/stopsmoking?

5 months off nicotine

So It's been a few days over 5 months since I quit smoking. I thought I would share my story with you guys. I started smoking when I was 17(19 now). I did it for the reasons everyone starts, because my friends were getting into it. It didn't really seem appealing to me growing up. I always thought smoking was pretty stupid but then one day my friend said his dad left some cigs in his car so I decided to try them. I thought it was pleasant and fun, I enjoyed it but never thought I would get addicted. From that point on, I continued to smoke casually. Whenever someone around was smoking, I had a cig with them. It was a fun social activity. I also loved to smoked when I got drunk and stoned. After a few months, I started asking my 18 year old friends to buy me cigarettes. So I started smoking everyday but only 1 or 2 a day. That's the start of when. 1 or 2 a day turns to 3 or 4 and it's a snowball effect. As time progressed I realized I couldn't even go through a single day without smoking at least a few cigs. That's when I wanted to quit. It sucks having to spend your money on something that is slowly killing you. I struggled for months, had a few attempts at quitting. I finally decided to start vaping but I lost my vape. Once I lost it, I just said fuck it and quit cold turkey. Best decision I've ever made. I now feel much better and save a lot of money. It's nice not being a slave to nicotine.

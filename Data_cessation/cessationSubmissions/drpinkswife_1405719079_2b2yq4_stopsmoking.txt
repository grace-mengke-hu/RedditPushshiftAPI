I totally Impressed My Driving Instructor Today...

Moved countries, new license needed, have to take lessons, wrong side of the car, wrong side of the road....

That said...I live a very very old town. The roads around where I live pre-date cars by a 1000 years, very narrow. So there was a complete disaster getting out of my neighbourhood today. Some road was closed and I had to do a quick fast parallel park on a two way street with room for only one car when about six cars decided to turn down towards me. The road was so narrow that the first three cars to pass me hit my side mirror with their side mirrors, each driver grimaced and kept driving (really!?!). The fourth car had better depth perception and didn't hit my mirror. I was hit by three cars in a row!!! Now my driving instructor is a church goer and so I try to keep the potty mouth to a minimum. After finally getting out of that situation, and having never even raised my voice, he said he couldn't believe how well I handled it. He made a reference to the old (me) and the new non-smoking (me) and the complete difference in how I handle stressful situations. :D

Hindsight being what it is: 3 fuckers hit my car with their car and didn't even fucking apologise! And P.S. no one had the right of way, so I was the only one trying to be polite. It was truly astounding.

Man they were so lucky I don't smoke anymore! :D

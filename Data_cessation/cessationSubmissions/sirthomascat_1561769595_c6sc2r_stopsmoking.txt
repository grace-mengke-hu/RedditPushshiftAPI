My wife is pregnant and I have to stop smoking NOW. Please Help.

I love it though, you guys. Haven't ever stopped for more than 48 hours. This time it is serious.

Just finished the last smoke in my last pack, and I am hoping to make it permanent. This weekend will be tough.

I've got a Juul, I've got nicotine gum. What should I expect? When will it get easy?

Finished Allen Carr's book and just smoked my last cigarette

Not even five minutes ago I smoked that final cigarette, cursing and swearing to myself that it would be the last. I got a little over halfway and didn't want to finish but I forced myself to. I needed to feel the poison I was putting into my lungs and to realize that it really isn't enjoyable in any way. My shoulders genuinely felt lighter as I walked back inside. Wish me luck!

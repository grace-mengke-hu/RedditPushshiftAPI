Quitting and weight gain

I know this may sound like a vain question and frankly I am aware that it is a vain train of thought, but all my recently quit smoking friends have said that they gained weight due to quitting. Is it an inevitable part of the quitting struggle, or are there any tips for quitting and not gaining weight at the same time? I have been smoking for 12 years, and have two young kids which during each pregnancy I quit however picked it right back up again once they started on the bottle. I have started losing a lot of the weight I gained during my pregnancies and have been trying to pick up healthier habits. I think quitting smoking would be awesome but I do love it and depend on it. Sorry for the lengthy text but I thought a little bit of a back story might explain the vanity in my question and maybe get me some more personalized advice. Thanks :-)

Denying a free cigarette

This is really frustrating. I go a while without a cigarette and my old smoking buddies offer me a cigarette and it's hard to deny. Especially after your old addiction comes back for a short moment from secondhand smoke just from being around them. I've gone eight months one time, and a month and a half a little bit ago. When I got back into it, I told the guy I quit and he goes "ok... man these are good." It's frustrating and I need some advise to deal with this.

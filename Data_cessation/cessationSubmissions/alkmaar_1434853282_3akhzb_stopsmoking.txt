1 week (again). Good to be back everyone!

New job, new friends, new country and I've officially been nicotine free for over 7 days now. I was a pack (25 cigs / pack) a day smoker..in fucking Australia. That means i was burning about $130-140 bucks a week on slowly killing myself and always being short on cash for basic necessities like food and medical appointments. 
Ever since i've quit i actually feel young, energetic and rich. I sleep like a king, Eat like a king and my gym work-outs have significantly improved; ALL in a week! there were a few moments when i almost caved, but it's all about reasoning with yourself at that precise moment (one of the hardest things one will ever do honestly) and you'll be alright. I live in an apartment with smokers, i'll sit in the same room with cigarettes all over the table and i wouldn't even bat an eye towards having one.

Stay strong everyone. If i can do this, everyone can!

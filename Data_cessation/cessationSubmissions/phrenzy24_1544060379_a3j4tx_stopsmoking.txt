Phase 2 of my quit: tips from some a$$hole hypnotist, but he has some good points.

So tomorrow is my 14th day not smoking. I've been feeling really lousy this week and I think I know why after realizing I'm not doing 3 main things.

 I was reminded of them after watching this video "The Myth of Nicotine Withdrawal". Personally I don't like what he says about it being a "myth"...but I do know that paying attention to these 3 things might help me or others going through this and wondering why they still feel like a piece of garbage.

1) Cut caffeine in half or out: I've been drinking more coffee.

2) Drink lots of water: as a smoker I never drank much of anything besides coffee, so I've always been dehydrated, just now really feeling the affects of it. 

3) Eat healthy breakfast and snacks: I have been doing this, but my choices are pretty horrible

I know these might be obvious to most, but as a 25 year smoker, I really didn't take care of myself in many ways (cause what was the point? I was a stupid smoker). I need to trade in my 1 bad habit for at least the 3 good habits over the next two weeks.

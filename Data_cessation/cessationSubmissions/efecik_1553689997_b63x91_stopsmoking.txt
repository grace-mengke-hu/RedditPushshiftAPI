Quitting smoking when others around me constantly smoking

I'd been smoking on/off for 8 years. When I do, I usually go and smoke around 1/1.5 packages a day. I quit smoking 5-6 times, usually lasted around 5-6 months then I started smoking again. The last time I quit smoking was 6 months ago and until last month I didn't have any problems with it.

However, last month my dad and I went to a vacation. He is a heavy smoker, and even though he knew that I quit smoking, he kept smoking near me during the whole trip. He even smoked in the car and in the hotel room. When I comfronted him about this he said "Well, it's your problem". After 4 days of exposure to heavy second hand smoking, i find my cravings start again. First I didn't notice that I was craving for cigarettes, so I just keep eating sweet things, put on some weigth, get stressed for no reason, smoked more weed (I mix them with green tea instead of tobacco).

Last week, when I was on another vacation, my friends mixed the weed with tobacco and even though I had strict rules against it, I was like whatever and started to smoke it. All the stress and depression I had was gone. My pal rolled 2 cigarettes for me that night and I was heaving a blast with them. The day after I didn't crave for anything however 3 days later I find myself craving again.

My family smokes, most of my friends smoke, I am exposed to second hand smoking all the time when I am outside (In Turkey, smokers are everywhere). So why bother myself getting stressed and depressed all the time and resist the temptation which is draining my energy and causing other addictive behaviours (weed, sugar)? It is not like any other addictions. If my friends drink alcohol I don't get drunk but when someone near me starts smoking I got that nicotine in my blood anyway, also got depressed and anxious.

Last time I quit smoking, I watched allen carr's video and decided not to buy another package. I know about illusion of happiness and other concepts he talked about. My problem is that I never go fully clean, so I am ALWAYS craving and I am ALWAYS feeling withdrawal.

I wanna cry, I wanna hit someone, I want a fucking cigarette.

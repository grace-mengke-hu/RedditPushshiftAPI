Help/Advice Needed

Hi all,

First time posting here, I've read a number of the posts and the control and will power you people have is amazing! So bravo on that.

I'm looking for some tips/advice on quitting smoking from a gamers perspective. I'm one of those people that has mastered the art of smoking whilst playing on the PC. When sat at the PC I can chain smoke very easily without realising it. I feel that if I can break that mentality, it would make quitting alot easier for me.

I've quit in the past for about 3 months, but went back with it unfortunately.

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks in advance and keep up the good work!

OK I'm doing it again

I need to quit smoking again.

I quit years ago very successfully. I was off for about three years. Leaving a rubbish career was the main driver for it. I changed careers, enjoyed life, stuck to the gym (I still do for sure) but the smoking demon has returned. I basically went to a work do a couple of years back, smoking was involved and I was back on it from that point. Terrible I know.

My main issue is at work. I enjoy the work I do but the main people I hang out with all smoke. Sometimes it's just nice to get away from the desk, go outside for 5-10 minutes and just take a break. Sadly there's really nothing else to do except go outside to take a break.

I have tried going outside and not smoking, but then the peer pressure starts and I usually succumb.

So the question is that now I've identified the achillies heal, what can I do? I don't really want to break by sitting at my desk and surfing the net as my work is wholly computer based (software developer), just need some other activitiy I can do for 5-10 minutes that isn't computer or phone based and isn't of course smoking. 

To be honest, generally at the weekend I rarely even think about it. I'm usually out either at the gym, doing a hill climb, something active. But to be fair the smoking has to go. It's killing my gym progress which I care about more than anything and it's not helping with me getting the flu every 2-3 months. I guess due to being out in the winter cold and smoking.

Any advice? Let 'er rip!

Off the wagon

OK, if my badge has updated by the time you read this it will rightfully read something like "zero". FYI, I made it 5 days. 

Yep, I fell off the wagon last night while having a couple of quiet drinks with friends at the pub. I had kept my packet (with about 5 left inside) around for some reason and spotted it on my way out the door. I picked it up and told myself I'd pass it on to a mate and wouldn't have any myself but of course, later on, the urge got the better of me.

I have thought a lot about my decision to have a smoke last night and keep concluding that I don't 'want to quit'. I am lost at this point as I do not know if it's how I truly feel or my addiction coming through and fooling me. I kind of have to remind myself that I joined this subreddit for a reason obviously, and that should mean that I truly do want to kick the habit. Can anyone shed some light onto this frame of mind? I am truly confused, angry at myself, disappointed but at the next moment nonchalant, unconcerned and indifferent.

I am worried about my future health but also want to be healthier now and feel I can do better. Does anyone know where am I at? I don't unfortunately.

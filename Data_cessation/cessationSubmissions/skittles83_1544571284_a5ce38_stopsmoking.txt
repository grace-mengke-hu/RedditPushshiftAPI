23 Days smoke free, but I feel a sharp/burning pain in my chest

Ive been smoking for about 18 years. I quit about 3 weeks 2 days ago. But now I've been feeling this sharp burning pain in my chest and sometimes in my back. It's always on the left side. Has anyone had a similar experience or have any idea what it could be?  I feel no other side effects. 

The bit of research I've done so far points to the possibility of cell regrowth and the cila in lungs coming back to life cleaning my lungs.

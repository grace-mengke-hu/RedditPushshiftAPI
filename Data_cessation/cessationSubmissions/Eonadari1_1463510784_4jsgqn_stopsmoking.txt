Issues quitting

So I've been trying to quit for a while now. Cold turkey, I caved. Chantix, caved. Gum, you get the idea. I've read Carr's book, watched my grandmother die of lung cancer... still can't cut the habit. I know smoking is bad for me, but from a "it'll kill you" mentality: I was raised to believe death is part of life, and when it's my time, I will go. So that argument I cannot validate. Any suggestions? It seems that I can go days at a time without smoking, the moment I have an overly stressful situation, I'm smoking before I realize I even went to the store.

I'm just passing by

It's been over 6 years for me guys. I still crave it or even have occasional cigarette when at a bar drunk... but that's as far as it goes.  To all those trying, it gets so much better and easier, like you wouldn't believe. My advice for you is: drink lots of water,  take 2 months off from hanging out and drinking, think about all the money you're now saving, not to mention all the health benefits :)) I just stumbled upon this subreddit,  and it reminded me of myself those years ago.  It's so good to read people's milestones and think how far they've come. Keep it up!!!

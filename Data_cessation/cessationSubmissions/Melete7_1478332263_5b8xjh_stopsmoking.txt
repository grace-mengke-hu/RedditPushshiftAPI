Lung support for the post-quitting hack/cough?

I haven't gone cold turkey yet, but even cutting the number of daily smokes in half -- I can feel my respiratory system rebelling as I start to kick up mucus.

Any recommendations for supplements/vitamins/etc I can use to help me start to clear and heal my lungs as I approach "Day Zero" and beyond?

Thanks!

finally, I quit again. one question, though ...

I think for good. Made it almost 6 month last time, and used a knee surgery to convince myself that since I was in a wheelchair, I had the right to smoke again.
I uselessly and expensively polluted myself one more  year (as if fifteen wasn't yet enough !).
  
Truth is, I was over the first part of the struggle. I found that, as long as you're addicted (physically and psychologically), it's kind of easy to refuse yourself a cigarettes since you know it's a trick your mind is playing against you. But once dependency is over ? 

What about the willing to have this one smoke during a night with your mate, after a few drinks, under a starry sky ? 
this one is not impulsed by your drugged mind, but by your "somehow" healthy mind, almost the same as a non smoker who would say "yes, give me one, please".

I will probably remind myself that it's really unhealthy and unnecessary to the enjoyment of anything, just as I do now to overcome the first weeks cravings; 
But I'm not sure It will feel as convincing as it is now...

So veteran of r/stopsmoking, how did you manage this ?

edit: Thanks everyone for your words of wisdom. 
I'm fully committed to stay healthy, it's a definitive good bye to death sticks. 
I will try to remember that I had more than enough (roughly 125,000), so no, thanks you, I'm not going to have one more.

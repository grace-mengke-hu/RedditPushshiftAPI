1 Week

Well after seven days the dust is finally starting to settle and I feel a bit more like myself. Cravings still happen but they are more mild than they were a few days ago. 

I started a running program and have successfully gone out two mornings at 6:00 to go for a 3km run. It feels tough but I am happy to start something new.

It's been a tough week, and I could not have done it without the support of family and people on this board. 

Thank you and best of luck today

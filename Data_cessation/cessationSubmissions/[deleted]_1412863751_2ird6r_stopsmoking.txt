Are 2-3 cigarettes a day THAT bad for your health?

So for 5 years, I've been addicted to snus. Towards the end, as in the past 3 years, I was going through a can (24 pouches) of snus every day. Which obviously cost a lot.


The past 6 months or so, I scaled down. From "extra strong" (18mg of nicotine per pouch) to normal strength snus (8mg of nicotine per pouch). I've now reached the point where I can't even have a extra strong snus in my upper lip without feeling sick (keep in mind i used to run through a can of extra strong per day).


15 days ago, I had my last snus. I don't know what happened, but something in my head just told me that I have had enough, and I no longer have any desire for snus at all. 


Instead, I've been smoking cigarettes (which i also did occasionally/periodically while snusing). I'm smoking anywhere from 2 to 3 a day, usually one in the morning, one at lunchtime, and one at night (some days I'll skip one of them depending on how I feel. Like this morning, I didn't have the morning one). 


My plan is to eventually stop smoking altogether (hopefully once my current pack runs out, which is fitting seeing as I'm broke and don't get paid for another 11 days). I'm using the cigarettes to still get some nicotine in my system after all the snus I did, seeing as quitting snus cold turkey would be so much harder considering how much nicotine is in a snus compared to a cig.


Is this a good idea, or a stupid one? My friends seem conflicted, some think it's a really good idea, others think it's really stupid saying smoking is way worse than snus etc. 



What do you guys think? Is this a good way to go about my plan to quit? I mean, I'm obviously saving lots of money, and I'm getting way less nicotine in my system too (don't really feel any withdrawals either).

MyQuitBuddy not available on Play Store anymore

I reset my phone today and was surprised that I the app did not reinstall.

Even the link they provide for android is broken so I imagine is not a 'only one country' thing: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theprojectfactory.quitbuddy The iOs app is still on the AppStore. 

I did not like the other apps and I really miss the day counter widget.

* Do you have any recommendation for people that liked that app?
* Do any of you have a working (and safe) apk that you can share?

Thanks!

It's incredible how your anxieties disappear when you quit

I managed doing something I never believed possible in my life: I quit on a sunday and stayed almost the whole week without taking a puff. Nicotine patches helped me a lot.

I was feeling normal in my head after a long time. No more neurotic thoughts, happiness, smiling at people, being aware of my surroundings.

Then some bullshit happened and I bought cigarettes again. Going to quit again today and retake the patches doing the reduction regime.

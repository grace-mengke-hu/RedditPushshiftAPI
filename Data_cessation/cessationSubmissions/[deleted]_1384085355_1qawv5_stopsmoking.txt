34 days in, still depressed. [Trigger Warning]

I've since 34 days controlled my addiction, haven't had a single puff but it just doesn't feel like it's worth it. I reminisce a time when it felt great down my throat and cured my head-ache. I've started hanging out with my friends less since my mind can't seem to wrap up the illusion of it being worth it without a nicotine boost. I can't enjoy my life and feel extremely numb..craving for a cigarette. 

Quitting has had its advantages though, ranging from increasing my discipline, self-control and a self-esteem boost but I was just so happy when I was a smoker. It gave me a wake up boost to start the day, made me calm my nerves, what-not and just a happier person. 

Worry not, I'm not going to relapse any time soon but I'm afraid I just might in near future if I keep the same mentality.

Please help.

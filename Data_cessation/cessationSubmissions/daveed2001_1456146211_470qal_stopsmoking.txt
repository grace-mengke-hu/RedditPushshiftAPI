Just had my first cigarette in two years. Sadly it helped. Now I need help.

I just smoked my first cigarette in two year. My boss and I just got into an argument. I was feeling stressed out and agitated. I borrowed a cigarette from a coworker went outside and lit up. 

Sadly as I was smoking it, I realized that I was wrong in the argument. After finishing I walked back inside had a good conversation with my boss and he helped explain his point better and I explained mine. I realized he had a point and that I am wrong or at least partially wrong. So sadly I feel that the cigarette worked. I told my wife and she is disappointed. 

Where do I go from here? How can I fight the urge for another in a high level stress situation? I don't want another cigarette right now or in the near future.

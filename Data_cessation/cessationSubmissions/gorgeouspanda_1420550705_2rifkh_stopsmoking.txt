Day 4 was the worst day - an overview

Day 4: Abstinence hit hard, initial desire impulsed through a quick mention to the brand of cigarettes a character in the book I'm reading smokes. It soon became a necessity, I believed that I was letting go of my only realiable source of confort. I started watching ten movies, stopped them all 10 minutes in. I showered six times. I walked three times around a racing track. I chewed about thirty toothpicks. After all that, I still wanted one cigarette. This is the worst break up off my life.

Still, I was extremely proud of myself when I laid in bed and knew I didn't relapsed.

Stay strong, mates :3

Need a bit of help getting past the 2/3 day mark.

So I've been trying to quit smoking. I Read Allen Carr's book and stopped. Everything was going well but I screwed up and started smoking again at the 2 1/2 weeks mark. I reread the book and quit for another week. 

Since then I've been in this perpetual cycle of quitting for a day or two, feeling completely fine about it, but then finding myself in a really enjoyable situation and just cracking.

The interesting thing is that 2 months ago I was completely terrified of even going a few hours without a cigarette, but now I can happily do a few days work without worrying about it. It's just the enjoyable times that I want one when sitting in the sun after a few drinks or something. There's still enough nicotine in me to feel the relief when I have one.

Any tips or suggestions for getting further than a few days? I'm thinking it might be best to try quitting on a Monday so I can maximise my boring days before the good times of the weekend, but I'm not really sure aside from that.

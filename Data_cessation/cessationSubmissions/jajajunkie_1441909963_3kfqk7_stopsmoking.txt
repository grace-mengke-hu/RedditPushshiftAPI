Day 2 smoke free - question about using patches

Hi I'm new here and have decided to quit smoking after 14 years (minus an 18 month gap 2011-2012). When I quit in 2011 I used gum but returned to smoking when I began working in a pub  (drinking, unsociable hours, very short breaks etc) and in the last few months have been smoking around 20 a day! I feel sick to even write that! I've decided to use patches this time round but I am wondering if anyone else finds them itchy? I've had one on my leg all day and it is very red around the patch. 

What brands have people found best (UK)? I'm using Niquitin and it is also not very sticky! 

Edit: Thanks for your responses and good wishes! In regard to getting addicted to NRTs/ patches I am not worried about that as there is a clear step-by-step programme in reducing the nicotine levels. I am on the highest one (for that brand, 21mg) at the moment and will be hopefully lowering the levels in accordance with the programme!

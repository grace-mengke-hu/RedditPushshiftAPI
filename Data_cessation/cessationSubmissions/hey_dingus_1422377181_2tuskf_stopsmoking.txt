Six months and three days. I "smoked" an e-cig the other night.

So I've made it 183 days without a cigarette! This is a big deal for me, as I was a smoker for ten years before I quit. I had tried to quit two years ago, but only made it a couple months before I was back at it. This time around it's for good, but that's not to say I haven't been free from temptation along the way.  
  
Ironically, I started a job with a marketing company that promotes for RJ Reynolds tobacco. We go to bars all over the area, talk to smokers, and give them coupons for cheap cigarettes so they can try our brand. Lately we got some e-cigarettes in, so we've been on a big push to pass those out for free to people also.  
  
Two nights ago, I walk into my favorite watering hole for a beer after work, and I notice one of our e-cigs has been left behind, unopened, by someone who apparently didn't want it. After about 2-3 beers, I thought it would be a good idea to bust this thing open and try it (you know, for work purposes. I wanted to see it light up and look at the different pieces, so I could be more knowledgeable...). For anyone wise about e-cigs, this one is about 5% nicotine. I didn't like it, it made me cough (an e-cig made me cough), and it didn't taste very good. For the past two days my throat has been scratchy and sore as a result of this. I'm not going to reset my badge, because I didn't smoke a cigarette, but I'm not happy about this little experiment with an e-cig. 
  
  
I guess the moral of the story is that we need to always be on guard and dilligent about our desire to quit smoking cigarettes. I was feeling infallible, like I'd never touch another cigarette again, but if I was tempted to grab this e-cig, I may be tempted again in the future. To anyone who is reading this and trying to quit, ***you can do it!!*** The first week sucks, the second week is easier, and after that you're pretty much out of the woods. It's worth it!

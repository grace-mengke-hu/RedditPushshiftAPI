Just checked. 174 Days. Cannot believe it but its true.

June 28th was the last day I smoked after a 40 year habit.  I never thought I'd see that day come but it has and I'm really glad.  I think what made the different this time was that I actually wanted to quit.  I made all the changes at once.  The same day I quit smoking, I took on a vegetarian diet, committed to volunteering more, and made no excuses for not getting in at least a half hour's exercise a day.  To each of you working through your battle, keep going.  It's the best gift you'll have ever given yourself and those you love.  Wishing you all the best in the coming year......

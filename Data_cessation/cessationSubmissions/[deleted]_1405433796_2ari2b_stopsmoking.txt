Question. Just need some perspective.

I've been cigarette-free for about a month now and planning on continuing that permanently. But I've been wondering; If I quit cigarettes, should I quit smoking weed too? I love my green and ill take that over tobacco any day. But not sure if It's okay to just stop smoking cigarettes and continue smoking green. What do you guys think?

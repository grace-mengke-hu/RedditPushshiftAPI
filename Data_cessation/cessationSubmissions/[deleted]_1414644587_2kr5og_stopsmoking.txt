6 weeks, had a few real cravings in weeks for the first time today.

**Edit: F'd up the title, should be like "had the first real cravings in weeks for the first time today"

I quit smoking 6 weeks ago, about, using an e-cigarette. The first week and a half was tough at times. I noticed that I get cravings related to other needs - etc, hunger, tiredness, thirst. I've cut down on the nicotine in it by half in the past six weeks.

Today at work (a grocery store, dairy department) was a very slow and dull day. And I kept getting smoke cravings throughout the day. I really don't know why.

I went out on the smoke dock with one of my work friends and was really tempted to ask her for one of her Newports, even though I never liked Newports. Later in the day, on my lunch, I was sitting right next to someone and some of her secondhand smoke got into my mouth and I thought it tasted so good.

When I have cravings, I remind myself how drastically my health has improved in the past 6 weeks in an unbelievable way. Walking to my friend's apartment used to take me 15 minutes, now it takes me 10. I am a fast walker, and it still feels weird how fast I can walk up hills! It's like I'm jogging.

I know some will tell me things like "if you sit in a barber shop you're gonna get a haircut" re: the sitting in the smoking area, but that's my favorite thing about quitting with an ecig. I quit with gum before but was like, fuck this, because I wouldn't take breaks at work because I didn't want to sit in the cafe or break room.

I really never want to smoke again, and so far I'm doing well but I just really needed to share these cravings with people who could understand!

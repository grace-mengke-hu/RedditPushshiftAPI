is this normal after almost 2 months ?

I constantly feel hungry . It is as if its caused by low blood sugar. The unfortuante  thing is that eating doesn't really solve the problem if not make it worse. Is this normal ? when do you think things would go back to normal hunger wise?
One note about me is Before quitting i'd been on a diet for 8 months. I liked that diet so much that it became a life style to me and want to carry on.  lost 25 lbs but more importantly it solved all my digestive system problems. Its basically no sugar no carb, no processed food diet. After stopping smoking however, it became virtually impossible to carry on that diet. 
I feel like i could really used some good advice here

Just blew it. Again.

After 6 days, I've just put out a cigarette. I stole it from my teenage daughter, I know where she keeps them. (It was the other way around when I was her age...).
I was upset as I'm fighting with my wife. The cigarette didn't solve anything of course - it just made me feel dizzy. That'll be the carbon monoxide in it. 
This wasn't a "I'll start a row so I can have an angry smoke" situation. At least I don't think so. I think there might be a big issue with my relationship right now - certainly, we don't seem able to communicate effectively. And a cigarette can't help with that. 
I was already angry with my wife, now I'm angry with myself for smoking as well. I didn't really enjoy it - not after the first puff, anyway. And now I sort of "want" another one - because the first one "didn't work". Stupid. But that's how this stupid drug works. 
It's really annoying, as I was doing really well up to now. Minimal cravings. All my previous quits have failed because of "just one", so I'm going to reset my badge now.
I should've come here first, as writing this post has calmed me down more than nicotine ever could. Ach, day one again tomorrow. :(

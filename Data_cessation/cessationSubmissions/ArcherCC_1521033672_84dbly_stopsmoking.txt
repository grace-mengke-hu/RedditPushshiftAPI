Big accomplishment this AM.

This winter before I stopped smoking if it was below 35f out I had to wear a scarf or face mask to walk my daughter to school and I had to walk at a fairly slow pace there and back (hard for me to walk slow), if I didn't do both of these I would spend an hour wheezing and coughing and have to use my wife's asthma nebulizer.

This AM it was 17f out, no face mask, walked there and back at a fairly brisk pace and only have a tiny cough (anyone would with how cold and dry the air is).

My lungs are starting to heal and it feels f'ing great!

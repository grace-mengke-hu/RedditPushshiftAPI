In the store today...

I went to the store to buy some eggs and orange juice. Just normal activities basically. As I was waiting in line I was mindlessly looking at the cigarette display and inside were these things called American Spirits "Non-Addictive organic cigarettes" and all I could do was smile understanding how completely horseshit that was. I believe I've even read an article that there may be MORE nicotine than most cigarettes. 

Then I had a second thought. How are these guys not sued into non existence ? I don't think there's any other single product on the market that could get away with such a bold lie. It also seems like a great stepping stone to sue the government over the issue, in neglect.  

Anyway. That's my rant for the day, and I'm still smiling. I beat the drug pushers at their own game.

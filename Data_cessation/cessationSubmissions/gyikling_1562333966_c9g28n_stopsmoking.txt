Almost at 6 weeks now &amp; yesterday at midnight I realized....

That I had gone *the entire day* without a single craving or even once thinking about smoking. This is after 23 years of being a smoker. 

To those of you in your first (hellish) couple of weeks: STAY STRONG. You're doing amazing. The cravings DO go away &amp; you'll feel mentally freer &amp; freer as time goes on.

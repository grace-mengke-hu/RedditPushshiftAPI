Alcohol and Ciggies

I’m on day two at the moment and actually feeling fine. I don’t usually have withdrawals but I guess that may be because I’m only 22. But o can’t seem to stop myself from buying a pack of ciggies if I drink. They just go too well together. I can’t imagine myself staying sober the rest of my life so what can I do? Is there anything you guys did to not want to smoke while you’re drinking?

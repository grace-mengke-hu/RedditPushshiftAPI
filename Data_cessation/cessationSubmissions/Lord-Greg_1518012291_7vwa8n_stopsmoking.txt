Quit for a year but I’m back...

I used to be a pack a day smoker for years, I switched to vape, (because at the time I wasn’t planning on quitting) but then after a year of 24-36mg of nicotine I started weening myself off with smaller doses of nicotine in the juice every week or so, (to save money and to try and feel better) then dropped it entirely (highly suggest this method!). The only issue is that I had some douchebag friends who would constantly blow smoke/vape in my face (like they were THOSE kind of vape people). While drunk, I started up again after being provoked. What sucks though is that even though I quit a year ago, prior to that incident, I still had the urge to smoke even a year later. I was still easily agitated and all that. I was just wondering if anyone else had problems like that... did you still feel urges even way after the nicotine had left your system? Like anytime I would get mad, after sex, stressed, or after any normal time I would smoke, I still wanted to smoke way after I quit. I caved and bought a small little E cig while I was drunk again, I’m gonna trash it when I’m done with it (not wasting that money!!) any tips?

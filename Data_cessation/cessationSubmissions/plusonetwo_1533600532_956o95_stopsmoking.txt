Lately, lotta' of 1 year anniversaries so here's mine!

One day away from when I can say I've had a smoke free year. Got laid off last Monday and, as far as years go, that was the most traumatic thing to happen since I stopped. There was a flash of temptation to have a cig but I bitch-slapped that flash of temptation back into irrelevance. Steady as she goes, folks! You've got this.

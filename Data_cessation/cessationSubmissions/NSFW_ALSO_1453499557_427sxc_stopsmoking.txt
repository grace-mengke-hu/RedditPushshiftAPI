Smoked for 17 of 33 years, finally WANT to quit, what's the best first step?

I have smoked since i was a teenager, steady pack a day.  Have never really wanted to quit until now and suddenly believe it's possible.  I find the morning cig with coffee and the after lunch/ after dinner cigs are the hardest ones for me to not want.  Any immediate hints, tips, tricks for starting this journey?

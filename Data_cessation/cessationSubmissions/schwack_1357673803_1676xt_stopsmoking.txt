Had a smoking dream last night at 995 days.  The cool part?  I didn't smoke it!

I don't get smoking dreams very often anymore, maybe once every few months if that.  For reasons unbeknownst to me, last night I dreamt I was stressed out about something, and felt the actual craving for a cigarette.  I reached in my shirt pocket and much to my surprise found a full pack of cigarettes, fully aware I was quit for almost 3 years.  I pulled a smoke out of the pack, again, aware of what I was doing, and put it into my mouth, like I had over 1 million times in my life.  The only difference was I didn't light it consciously in my dream!  Then I remembered I kept a pack of cigarettes with me as a quitter in case I had a craving, I would have a placebo.  How f-ing crazy is that?  Then I woke up, realizing I hadn't blown my quit.

I guess I chose to share this here today, in hopes of helping some of you that are new to quitting, that sometimes dreams of smoking may still come, perhaps further in the future... and you don't have to smoke over them.  So glad to be a non-smoker!

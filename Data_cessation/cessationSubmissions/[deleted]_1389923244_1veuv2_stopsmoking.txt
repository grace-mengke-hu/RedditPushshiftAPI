Yesterday I stopped for patches on the way home from work instead of cigarettes on a whim. I'm smoke free for the last 27 hrs. Maybe this is the charm.

Last quit last summer for 7 weeks on chantix. I was nearly homicidal! I had to quit quitting. Maybe the patches will be better. They had a 2nd box for 50% off, so i have 4 weeks worth (step 2 14mg). Are there many here who quit with patches? Edit: ?

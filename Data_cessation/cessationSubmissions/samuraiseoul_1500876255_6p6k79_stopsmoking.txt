I was told this would be getting easier?

I'm 28 days in, and I still get some cravings. I quit cold turkey, and finally after 4 weeks, my lungs don't hurt, but I still want to smoke. Does this shit ever go away? I mean I remember when I got sober it all came to a headway about 45 days in, I put my foot down, and was fine. Maybe that's what I'll have to do here too? It feel like less physical and more mental but dang it sucks. I tell myself the same as with alcohol, you've come this far, stick it out 5 minutes. But I really wish it would just subside, and be more Pavlovian than psychosomatic. When do the cravings end? :(

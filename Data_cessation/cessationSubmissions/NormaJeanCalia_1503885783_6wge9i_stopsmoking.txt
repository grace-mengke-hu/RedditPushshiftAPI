15 d, 1 hr, 57 min. Anxiety is sky high

Well I've officially not smoked in 2 weeks. Energy, great. Breath, improving. Teeth, bleaching. Clothes smell 600% better. Keeping my hands busy by watching YouTube videos and learning to knit. My house is really clean to keep my mind busy during cravings. All of this to say, my anxiety has gotten worse. Unreal. I've pinned a handful of breathing techniques. Hang in there guys. One day at a time, one craving at a time. You're not alone.

Starting to lose momentum. Almost gave up yesterday. Someone help me?

Over the past month, I've been under a huge amount of stress due to my job, and family issues. I live in a house with two other friends and they both smoke, a lot of the time in the house. Yesterday, I reached my breaking point. Both of my roommates were out, and one had left their pack of cigarettes on the counter. I took one out of the pack and grabbed a lighter before stopping, calming myself down, and putting it back. I can't help but feel that nothing would help my anxiety and stress right now besides a cigarette. It seems like my cravings are getting worse and worse. Help??!?!?

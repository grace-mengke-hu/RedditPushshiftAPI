Will I get my appetite back when I quit?

The motivation seems to be there to make another quit attempt...my last failed attempt was last year and lasted 5 days.  


Anyway, I have the appetite of a 90s supermodel.  Today, for instance, I ate a small order of fries and took a few bites of a chicken salad.  Drank an odwalla.  That was literally it.  And this is pretty typical of my daily diet.  Eating is not pleasant for me, I basically forcefeed myself so I don't die or finally pig out when I haven't eaten in 3 days and my body finally kicks into starvation mode.


I'm 32 and 5'10", 140 pounds.  It's honestly a miracle I weigh as much as I do especially since I stopped drinking several months ago so my main calorie source of alcohol disappeared.

I'm not insecure about my weight but I am worried about the long term health effects of eating so infrequently.  Can't help but wonder if it's related to my pack a day habit.  Any extra push to get me over the hump here would be helpful.

Aches and pains

I'm 2 months quit now and I feel like I've aged 10 years. I've put on 15 pounds so I'm sluggish. I'm depressed and tired and I have almost constant nightmares when I sleep. But what is really bothering me is how much my joints hurt. I'm having terrible pain in my hands, feet and knees. It's like quitting smoking launched me years ahead into arthritis. Anyone else had something similar? If so, is it just a phase? I didn't have any of this the other time I quit for about a year, 7 years ago.

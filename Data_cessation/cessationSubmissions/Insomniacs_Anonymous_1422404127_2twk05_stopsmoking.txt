I need to reset my badge.

I am so sorry but I have caved during exams for the tyranny of nicotine. My body was willing but my mind was weak.  I shall reset my badge. I have let you all down. The relief s only temporary. Stay strong. Please, it is not worth it. You can do better than me, and the rewards are great. I had a single moment of weakness and I still subscribe to the philosophy of this sub-reddit. I hate myself for this and you should be strong. Beat this for yourself.

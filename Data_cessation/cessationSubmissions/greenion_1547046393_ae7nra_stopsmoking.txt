Quit nicotine after 14 years

Switched to ecigs 5 years ago. After the switch in an year, my body was unable to tolerate smoke from cigarettes. So I knew I will never go back to cigarettes again. I made multiple attempts to get myself off of ecigs in last few years.  I have quit ecigs for 3-4 days in a row before many times so I know what symptoms to expect in the first few days and was better prepared to handle it this time.  Finally I am happy to be free from nicotine. Last smoked ecig on Dec 31, 2018 in the afternoon. Not going back this time.

Nicotine withdrawal symptoms I faced:

1. Headache on day 2 and 3
2. Tongue sores since day 4 (almost gone by day 8)
3. Foggy mind on day 3 and 4
4. I had acne inversa on my back and forearms for last 7 years. Guess what the skin seems to be healing on it own.

What helps - breathing exercise. I can practiced breathing exercise at lot in last few years. I believe this time was smart enough to use this skill at the right moments.

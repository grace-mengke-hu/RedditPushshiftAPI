HELP! It's been 515 days and I'm about to buy a pack.

Haven't smoked in 515 days but the past 2 days the cravings have been extremely bad. Bad enough to the point of me standing in front of a vending machine about to buy a pack and i talk myself out of it. Any body else still crave this bad after this long??

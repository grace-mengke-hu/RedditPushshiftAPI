33 year old, started bupropion Saturday. Questions.

Hey guys and gals.  I visited my doctor on Friday for a physical, he sent me home with a Rx for bupropion because I think now is a good time for me to join you guys in quitting.  I had a couple questions for the doc because I want to make sure I understand the drugs I take.  He gave me the normal "here's the side effects" blah blah blah.  I guess he'd never needed to take it before.  

So with that said I have a couple questions.  

1. How long did you have to take it before the chemical cravings went away?

1. Did you have to work at the habitual craving? The walking around, socializing, etc.

1. Did you experience any side effects either during the initial days or ongoing? If so, what were they?

I'm a little suspicious about the side effects, as 3 days in still taking 150mg a day I'm starting to feel some of them, but I'm wondering if they are really there or if I'm psyching myself out.  I want this to work for me, so I need some assurance from people who have tried this method that what I'm experience right now is just because there isn't enough built up in my system. 

I'm still smoking, however the chemical craving has subsided a little.  I've gone outside while at work, and walking outside I asked myself "Do I really want to have one?" and I needed the walk more than anything.  

Some of the side effects I think I've been experiencing

* Dry mouth - I'm drinking more water. 
* Agitation - Things at work I'd brush off are getting a little under my skin.  I'm trying to actively catch myself. 
* Anxiety - I got ice bucket challenged, which normally I'd think would be fun.  I'm getting nervous as the day ticks on. 
* Restlessness - Needing to walk around, move, do something other than sitting in a cube. 
* Higher heart rate - I used S Health earlier and I was at 110, usually I'm ~85. 
* I've also had a few bouts of feeling blue.  Not straight up depression, I dunno what that feels like.  But I had a feeling of just not wanting to do anything. Just stare into the sky at nothing in particular.  But also had a feeling of sadness about nothing in particular as well.  

Thanks for reading, any advice would be much appreciated!  Hopefully I can get a badge within the next week and start the real journey. 

**TL;DR - Started bupropion (Wellbutrin/Zyban) and maybe feeling some side effects. Wondered if anyone else felt the same way when they started or have taken it for a prolonged amount of time.**

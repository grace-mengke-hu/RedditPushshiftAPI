Smoked since I was 15, 33 now.

Thanks to lurking in this forum and reading that my experience of trying to quit countless times, fooling yourself saying "It's ok to bum one while working", etc. was not uncommon and has really helped me stick to it this time. 

Everyday is getting easier but man the mornings are rough, I have to constantly tell myself, "You are not a smoker", "Not one puff" to get through it. 

I really want to spend more time outdoors doing things like hiking and running. I plan on trying the Couch to 5k program this weekend, I haven't ran in years!

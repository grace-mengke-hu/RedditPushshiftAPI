7 weeks!

I have officially hit the 7 week mark on no cigarettes and 1 week no vaporizer. This has not been a stress free experience, however no real issue with wanting to going back to cigarettes after getting my vaporizer. I was a smoker for over 10 years! I'm glad it's working as well as it has. :)

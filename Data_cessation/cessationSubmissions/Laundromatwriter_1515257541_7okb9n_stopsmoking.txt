I’ve never made a new Years resolution.

And this year I still haven’t, as it turns out though after working 3 consecutive 18 hour shifts and a busy bar the days before New Years I got horrible sick. So I took off New a Years day and the following two and. I wanted to smoke but felt way too sick to go to the store to buy cigarettes. After a few days I just didn’t care to buy them. I’m almost completely better and have hardly any desire to smoke. If I smoked a pack a day for 4 years and quit on a fluke then anyone else can too. This feels great. Also everything smells so smelly now.

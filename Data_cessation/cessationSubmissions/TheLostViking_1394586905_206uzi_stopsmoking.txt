Reset my badge after 500 days.

So i was going great not smoking up untill recently. I went back to my home town for holidays and fell into my old group of friends that still smoke. I started off having a casual smoke with them here and there and then it lead to me buying my own. 
Bugger.
But now i know that i'll never be clear of the pitfalls of smoking and will have to remain vigilant even after i think i'm well over being addicted. 
Anyways Badge is reset and hopefully i'm back on the wagon.

Good luck to all you guys and girls quitting.

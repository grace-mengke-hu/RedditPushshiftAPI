Even if you've relapsed, you're still fucking awesome.

I was just thinking about this. There are plenty of you guys who are sad about relapsing for picking up cigs, and I get it; it sucks.

But beyond everything else, I think it's admirable that you still acknowledge that smocking is disgusting. It's murderous. The fact that you're still here instead of trying to justify the habit is what determines your value to the rest of us. It's hard; nobody denies it. If it was easy, nobody would smoke.

Good for you. Keep your chin up. You know how bad your relapses are. This shit is bad for you.

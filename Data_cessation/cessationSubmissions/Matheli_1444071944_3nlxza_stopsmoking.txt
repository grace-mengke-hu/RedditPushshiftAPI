From 893 days smoke free to 1

Stay vigilant, you can NEVER let your guard down.  No more puffs.

edit: Okay, so it was probably closer to 863 days.  I've been trying to quit again for a month.  Finally in a good place with it mentally and emotionally and am excited to start back over and beat 864.  =)

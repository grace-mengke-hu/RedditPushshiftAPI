I've been cheating

Just a little.   On Saturdays.   When  I'm drinking.   But I've been training for a triathlon so during the week I've been abstaining from alcohol and I'm fine.    But then I went on vacation a couple weeks ago, and smoked the whole week.   Not my usual 1/2 pack a day.   But a pack that week.   Then last weekend I drank Saturday night and then all day Sunday.   So I smoked.  And had 3 left in the pack.  So I smoked 2 of those on Monday.  And then one on Tuesday.   I bummed one from my uncle after dinner Wednesday night.   And then one from a coworker Thursday at lunch.   

Basically, today is my first smoke free day again since Friday.  And I should reset my stop smoking counter, obviously.   But that 68 days and 19 hours looks so much better than 18 hours.

I swam a mile today and biked 25 miles.  I didn't feel the cigs... surprisingly.   But...   I also know what happens if I continue down this path.   So.... hooray on me for being good again.  And back to day one I suppose.  But it will be a much easier day one than the last one.... 68 days and 19 hours ago.

I had a nic free vape pen that I was supposed to smoke when I got the cravings when I drank.   But, that doesn't seem to work.   Maybe I'll buy some low nicotine vape juice and try that when I'm drinking, because clearly I can't be trusted to just 'not smoke' when I'm drinking.   Not yet anyway.  But I'm getting there.   I really am.  After 5 years of trying to quit.  I just keep working at it and I just keep getting better and better at quitting.    Or maybe I'll just stop partying for a while on weekends.  But... nah... that sounds too dull.

My record is 6 months.  Back to day one.  Let's see if we can beat 6 months.  Or just never smoke one again.

Good luck to the rest of you fuckers.  This shit is hard to give up for good.  Thanks for letting me whine.

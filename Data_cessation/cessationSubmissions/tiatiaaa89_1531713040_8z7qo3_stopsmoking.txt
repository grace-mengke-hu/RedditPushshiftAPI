6 days

Hey everyone, I hope you all survived the weekend. Just wanted to say I survived my first weekend cigarette free! I had three very strong hard to pass cravings randomly this weekend but I didn’t succumb to it. My boyfriend has been a wealth of support to me, and I’m so proud I made it through! Just wanted/needed to put it into words.

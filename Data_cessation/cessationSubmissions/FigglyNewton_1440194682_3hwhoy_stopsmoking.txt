Three Weeks! A Question...

I can't believe it's 3 weeks. The last week has flown by. For everyone at 2 weeks, don't worry it's going to get much better :) I still have problems though.

The cravings have gone but I still have triggers. They're very easy to get over, more like passing thoughts "a smoke would be good now". I can immediately dismiss them and say no without any problems, but it gets me down a little bit every time it happens. I suppose it happens 4 or 5 times a day. 

Like I said, nothing major, not really a craving, very easy to brush off.... just when will this crap finally finish? When will I get through a whole day and not have a single thought?

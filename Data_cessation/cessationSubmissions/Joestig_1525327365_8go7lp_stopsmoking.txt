Two weeks!!

I am very happy that I made it this far. I have far less cravings, though I am not naive, I could still very easily relapse. My housemates smoke together, so there's a large risk. However, knowing this I motivate and prepare myself to deal with these temptations. When I know a challenging situation will appear, I mentally walk through it and picture myself not smoking. I look for alternative things to do, such as getting a glass of water, so that at least I am occupied. This has helped me so far.

My lungs are healing themselves. Still having the quitters flu, and I expect that to last for many weeks or even months, so it is only temporary (unless I relapse, then it was all for nothing, so I plan not to). Also this flu is not as severe as it has been in the past, it does not keep me from doing my daily thing.

Looking forward to check "quitting smoking" off my list, and having a healthy, regenerated body back again. I also quit drinking, I have a good exercise routine and I am improving my diet, so I am definitely moving in the right direction. However, quitting smoking has my highest priority out of all of this, because it has the highest impact, and not just on my health, but several other important areas of my life as well, for example I will have less stress, more money and less shame (for being addicted).

So, let's keep on going. I hope that you will do great as well! It's not easy to get started, but it gets easier as time passes. Though you should always be prepared to fight the urge, because even though it gets rarer, temptation can come even many years into the future.

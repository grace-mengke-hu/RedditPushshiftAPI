30 days of health!

Finally made it to 30 days , it was easier then I thought it would.

I want to thank all you guys here for helping , I might not comment on every post , but I sure do read your comments.

It's so great to actually breath from your nostrils and with your mouth and to chock up.

Can't wait for number 50! 

Thank you guys , you're Awesome! 

Stay strong , you can do it! :)

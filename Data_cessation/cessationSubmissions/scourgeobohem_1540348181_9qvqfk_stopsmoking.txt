Drive time tricks and tips?

My quit date is Friday, locking myself in a room with red dead 2, some weed, and taking off work till next Thursday. My wife will be taking my debit/credit cards so I can't escape. I'm not so worried about Friday-Thursday because it'll be impossible for me to pick any smokes up, but I know when I get in the car I'll want to light up. What do you all recommend for drive time early on replacements?

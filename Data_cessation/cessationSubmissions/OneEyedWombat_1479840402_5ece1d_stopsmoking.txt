Quit smoking today.

Day 1. 
Not sure i picked the best week for this, two different Thanksgiving dinners to attend.
Cant eat at either of them, doctor has me on a lean diet due to my cholesterol.
Gonna be fun dodgin turkeys and cigarettes all week.

Here we go.

Edit 1: 24 hours in. Havent smoked yet. Realllllly close a couple times though

Edit 2: day 4, cravings have stepped down considerably. Easily talking myself out of it now... think im about out of the woods on this one! Thanks for all the support everyone!

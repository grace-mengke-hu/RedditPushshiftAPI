Advice for supporting my partner to quit smoking?

My partner has been smoking for 12+ years and has tried quitting once, his parents smoke too. I've never smoked, grew up in a family that didn't smoke, except my mum quit before she had kids. So yeah, different views on smoking. 

I've raised why smoking upsets me (all the obvious reasons) , and he is trying to quit again. He has a nicotine spray (that he complains about tasting bad) and still smokes with his friends and when he's stressed (so, still a pack a week or so.)

He thinks that weaning off gradually is the best way because it's harder than it looks. It's true that I've never experienced this so I want to hear advice from others going through it. 

I want to know what method worked for you? Was cold turkey effective for you? What kind of support do you want from a partner - just an occasional cheer on or a more frequent check in? How did your partner or family support you and did you find it useful? I just want to see him healthy and happy but it's hard when I don't understand what he's going through.

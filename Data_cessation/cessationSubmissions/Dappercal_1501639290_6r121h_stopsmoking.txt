A month. A whole freaking month.

I almost went the entire day without realizing that it was day thirty as a non-smoker. It's gotten to the point where I scarcely even think about cigarettes anymore. 

This sub has been a **huge** help, as have Allen Carr and the SmokeFree app. I can't believe it's been a whole month already. Wow.

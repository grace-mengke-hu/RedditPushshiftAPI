Day one over and success!

Made it through the first day and the craving were not that bad.  I know that day 2 and3 are harder but the only problem I had today was that it was so long! Don't know if nicotine withdrawl affects your time perception but man it was a long day!. Looking forward to day two and being a non smoker.  That's to all for the support, it really helps

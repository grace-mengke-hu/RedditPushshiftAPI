What replacement behaviors do you guys use to deal with cravings?

I'm trying to quit again, not for new year's or whatever but because I realize it makes me feel sluggish and tired and I hate that. My main problem is that it has become a habit to go outside and smoke, or in my car while driving. What replacement behaviors did you guys use to fill those specific habitual times? What do you do to avoid cravings?

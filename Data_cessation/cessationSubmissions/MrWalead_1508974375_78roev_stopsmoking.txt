Quit for six months, until last week

First time poster here. After over six months of being a non-smoker, I picked it back up again last week after a death in the family. I'm so angry at myself for starting again. Now I'm back to square one now. Hopefully my last cigarette will be my last cigarette. 

Just wanted to post this here to remind myself.

Christmas broke me :(

Ah yes, the holidays. When we all get together and talk shit about the year.

I was staying ay my parents for a few days, and after a while of being there I just had, I don't know.... Nothing to do. I even had my laptop with games on it but I felt after a while really anxious that my parents were going to say something about me being on my laptop the whole time. 

And then Christmas day happened which was a time-trial scheduling clusterfuck in which everything got rearranged by everyone else, and it's not like it affected me Because I had nowhere to go anyway.

Driving my sister home on Christmas (which was weird, because she didnt drive because she didnt have gas in her car) I got pack, smoked two and through the rest out.

The next day was my birthday. It was just weird. It was weird and I felt weird and anxious and eventually I went home to and decided to eat a bunch of pizza and then somehow got cigarettes because I knew I was going to get really drunk and like its my birthday.

And then today I woke up and wasnt going to smoke at all and then after I did everything I had to do I just had.... nothing to do.

I dont know man. The anxiety is real. I through all my ciga away and Ill reset my badge for tomorrow.

I made it 25 days.

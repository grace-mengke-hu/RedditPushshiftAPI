12 weeks in. Some new rough patches.

Hey guys, 12 weeks into my quit and I'm feeling strong. One thing I've noticed since being home from school for winter break is that I get intense cravings when I am home, but not at school! At home I used to smoke about 5 cigs a night after my parents went to bed. Does anyone else get cravings in certain locations but not others? When I'm at school I hardly think about cigs.

Also, another rough thing is that someone I got to quit using the EasyWay broke last week and is smoking again and it makes me feel vulnerable because I used EasyWay too. 

Not really sure what I'm looking for here, just needed to vent. Keep going strong everybody. Remember, you are always in control.

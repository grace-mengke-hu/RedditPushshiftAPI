Two days ago was two weeks without smoking. Here is my journey so far...

Very proud of myself but at times I still have the craving for them, I try to ignore the nasty little voice of addiction, the little voice knows I’m trying to ignore her and that bitch is fucking smart. Really makes me consider what damage is another package going to do? 

”NO. Say what you want, scream, cry, be angry...throw your tantrum. I won’t get the car keys, drive to the convenience store and spend what little money I have on you.”


Then I move on to thinking about other things. 

Also it helps to have accountability, someone you promised to you will quit, that way, you feel compromised to stand by your promise not only to yourself but to someone else, my boyfriend is that person ❤️

Started when I was 12, 25 years later Ive got a week in.

I've been using the patch and havnt really had a lot of cravings but I've felt like shit all week. 

Toothaches, ear aches lots of nausea.  Having a really hard time sleeping despite being extremely tired.  

Been a cable guy for about 10 years and I love my job, I've had 3 sick days in that time because of pneumonia doctor suggested 10 off, but this morning I got to the point of dialing my bosses number before just saying fuck it and going in. 

Point is nicotine if this is the worst you've got you're a pussy and I win.

I know its not easy I had 7 months in 15 years ago but this time I got this.

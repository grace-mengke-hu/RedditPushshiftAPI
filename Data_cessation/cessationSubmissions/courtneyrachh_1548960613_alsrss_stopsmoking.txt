reasons you all quit

whenever i get a huge, HUGE craving, or think "bumming one doesn't out" i try to remember why i want to quit. i know it may be personal, but what are the reasons why y'all quit?

i think the biggest one for me is the smell. 

the second would be the fact i'm on the dating scene again and it seems like smoking is not the cool thing it was when we were all 18.

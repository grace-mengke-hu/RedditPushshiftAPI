1 week. Great! Salty taste in mouth.

So today has been my one week smoke free and I'm very happy and feeling much better. However, later in the day yesterday and today my mouth has had a very salty taste that I can't seem to get rid of. It's almost maddening. I drink plenty of water and brush my teeth and the like. Is it just a symptom of quitting?

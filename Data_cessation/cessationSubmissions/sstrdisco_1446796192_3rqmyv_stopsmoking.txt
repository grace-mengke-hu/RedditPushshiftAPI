Little steps and it continues to keep getting easier.

When I first quit smoking I had three triggers: morning, 2:50 pm, and bed time. I'd forgotten about the one in the afternoon and it was a really specific one too. Morning isn't too bad, but bed time is still a bitch. I imagine that too will fade, something nice to look forward to.

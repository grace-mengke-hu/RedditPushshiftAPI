Day 3 again. It's harder right after a relapse.

It feels like time is going slower this time around. I made it to day 10 on Friday then relapsed that night. Over that span of almost 2 weeks, I gained 10 lbs. I just can't stop eating.  Now that I'm starting over, I've had to add to the challenge by limiting my diet to real/whole foods. So, now that I've just about got the nicotine out of my system again, I'll be kicking the sugar. That could arguably prove more daunting, but it's kinda a compromise. At least that's how I'll look at it. I'll still be stuffing my face all day long, but it'll be with healthy things like grapes & carrot sticks & stuff. Just trying to get ahead of the depression which always inevitably comes. Mind over matter as they say.

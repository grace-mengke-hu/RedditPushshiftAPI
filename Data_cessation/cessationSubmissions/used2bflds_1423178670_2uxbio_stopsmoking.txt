Just over 2 weeks.

Had to have a tooth pulled today (because of cigarette rot, apparently), and the cravings have slowed. I've also been to the bar twice for karaoke in those two weeks. I'm usually fine from here on out until I hit the 4-5 month mark, but then I seem to slip right back into the habit. 

Any advice from you long time quitters? I want to make it this time.

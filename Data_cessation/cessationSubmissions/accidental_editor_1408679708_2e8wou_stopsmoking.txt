1 year +

Without even realizing it, I've crossed the one year mark! This sub was super helpful for me, especially in the early days. 

It hasn't been easy - I struggled and felt pretty bad for three or four months, but it did get better. Quitting is different for everyone, but eventually we all can come out the other side. 

I was a pack a day smoker for more than 15 years, and I thought I loved it, thought I would never be able to quit. I'd tried before, but this time is a whole different experience, because I'm not looking back. 

For those of you still on the fence, I feel so much better now. It's not just the health benefits - the best thing is that I don't feel like smoking controls every aspect of my life any more. It's super liberating. And now I don't smell funny in elevators...

Best to all of you

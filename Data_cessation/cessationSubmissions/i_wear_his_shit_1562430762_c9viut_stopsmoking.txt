Just smoked my last one

I’ve been wanting to quit for a while. It makes me feel like shit after every cigarette but I kept going cause it was the one thing I thought I had control over in my life. I’ve lost 20 pounds in the past 3 months and my skin has never looked worse. I ran out of cigarettes yesterday but bummed one off my dad today. The few hours that I hadn’t smoked between yesterday afternoon and this afternoon made me feel kinda clean. Then I smoked and I felt gross. 
Any tips on how to keep myself from wanting to just say fuck it and buy another pack? I can already tell this is gonna be one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.

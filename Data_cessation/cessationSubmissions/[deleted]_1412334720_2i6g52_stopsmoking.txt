Going to a wedding this weekend

And i know it's going to be tough. I normally get awkward and stressed out in social situations, and this is a huge trigger for me. Alcohol would be another one, but I already took care of this factor by making sure I have to take my own car, and therefore refrain from drinking on this occasion.

If you have any advice on how to prepare myself for this situation, please share them with me!

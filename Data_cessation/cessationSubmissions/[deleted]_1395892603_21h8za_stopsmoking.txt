Resetting my badge

So I am resetting my badge today. I haven't smoked since Sunday, I did hookah. There were also a few times I smoked. Not cigarettes, a black and mild and a cigar. I would have counted maybe only one of them if they all didn't happen. I don't really count hookah, but I talked to a couple of other people and they agreed that it does count. 

I'm not too upset over this reset, I've proven to myself that I can quit. Even if I fell off a couple of times I don't doubt myself in this. Besides, Hookah was something I wanted to do, I don't see it being a problem if I'm gonna quit smoking. It's not difficult to give up compared to smoking cigs(also takes a lot fucking longer to even set up). Good luck everyone else, we got this shit!! 

P.S. I'm also working out on a consistent basis for the most part, pending I don't run into to much school work.

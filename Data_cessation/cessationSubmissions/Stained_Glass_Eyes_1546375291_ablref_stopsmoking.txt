Day 1 again after 10 months last year

I slipped after 10 months and I have been smoking again since August, but I choose to be smoke free this New Years day and be here with you all.  I need to reset my badge and get back on the train.  Glad to be here.  Both my mom and I have vowed to quit today so let's go!  I will not smoke with you today.

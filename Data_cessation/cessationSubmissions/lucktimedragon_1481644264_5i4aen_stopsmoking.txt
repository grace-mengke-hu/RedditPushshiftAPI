out of control, no longer enjoy it

i started smoking when i was seventeen.  most of my friends at the time smoked but i was without a doubt the heaviest smoker.  in my early to mid twenties, most people i knew said it was hard to picture me without a cigarette.  i was a total chain smoker and went through about a pack a day.  it was awful.  coughing in the morning while choking down a cigarette, horrible horrible breath, difficulty studying because i couldn't focus for a very long time without taking a cigarette break.  just the worst.  

somehow, i don't even remember how i managed, i quit!  i quit for three or four years.  recently i started flirting with it again, though.  tbh it was great, it was like the very first time i picked the habit up.  for the past couple of months i've really enjoyed having one or two cigarettes a day.  but that didn't last long.  

sitting on the couch last night, after smoking outside, it hit me that it's no longer flirtatious, it's taking control of my life again.  so i'm quitting right now and i think i'm too old (almost 30) to risk going back again at a later date.  i'm already overweight, there's a history of heart problems in the family, and i want to be around for as long as possible.

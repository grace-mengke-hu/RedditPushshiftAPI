It's been a year!

Man, I can hardly believe it. A whole year without smoking :-D 

I did it the Easy Way (Alan Carr), I recognize that it doesn't work for everyone but it worked for me. I have a friend who quit five years ago but everytime he is stressed he says he really wants a cigarette. That is the huge difference, after reading Alan Carr's book I quit AND I don't miss it. 

I very occasionaly get slight craving, I reveiw all the things I learned in the book and the craving dies instantly. It isn't something I have to struggle with, I must be diligent because and addict is an addict is an addict, but it doesn't feel hard. 

Good luck to everyone here, whatever works for you I wish you all the best!

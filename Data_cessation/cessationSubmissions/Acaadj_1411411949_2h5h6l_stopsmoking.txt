I've had to reset a couple times.

I am in this subreddit quite a bit. I'm trying a lot of different techniques. I'm being honest, and re-setting when I need to. Listening to advice, and ignoring advice (redhead here.)

13 hours, 20 minutes as of right now.

Don't feel happy, don't feel sad. Motivated, maybe. For sure frustrated at my inability to keep on my quit. 

I've always said it would be super easy for me to quit. I can see now that I was lying to myself and everyone else. I am addicted. And it sucks.

I have a lot to keep me busy the next few days, so I'm confident. My worry is day 4, which was the hardest day on the last successful 12 day quit.

This is what my problem is. I am thinking too far ahead. I need to stay in the moment. Hour 13. Minute 24. One hour at a time.

*deep breath*

Good luck, everyone.

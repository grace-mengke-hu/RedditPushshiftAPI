Stop Smoking: Cold Turkey or Gradually?

Ok. So I already feel the bad things smoking is making with my body. I now have gastritis and some other problems with my stomach.

Sometimes I wake and I can't breathe correctly. I feel like there is an elephant in my chest.
 
1. I tried to use nicotine patch but it was worse. I think I overdose it. I smoke ~10/15 cigarettes per day. But there isn't the "right size" for me.

2. I have anxiety (sometimes my blood pressure get too high because this and the only way to stop is taking medication for anxiety - Yeah, it's Xanax).

3. Right now I'm having heartburn. I'm smoking at the same time...

So I have two options (only):

1. Stop smoking cold turkey.
2. Gradually stop smoking.

I don't want to use medication because it's like changing from a drug to another one. I've read that laser therapy doesn't work and is expensive. Nicotine patch makes me angry, like really angry. Oh and vaping and e-cigarettes are **not** allowed in Brazil. Anvisa (Brazil FDA's) didn't authorize the commercialization of vaping and e-cig. 

Facts:

1. I can stay more than 3 days without cigarettes.
2. I have three amazing disorders: Anxiety, Depression and Panic Syndrom. But what really sucks is my anxiety. That's ok. Since I am taking Xanax [for now].
3. I really, really, really, really want to stop smoking ASAP.

It was my favorite breakfast.

Addiction is a crazy thing, it takes hold of you in strange ways. You build these habits that start to feel like a norm, you get into a routine, if you repeat it long enough you forget to question it. 

I used to get up, pore my coffee, smoke a cigarette. I'd get in my car, listen to the radio, drink my coffee, and smoke a cigarette, I'd get to work, I'd do my job, I'd get my break, and I'd smoke a cigarette. I started to realize that I was living my life between cigarette breaks.  

I finally asked myself why?

Why do I smoke cigarettes? Before I was ready, I would answer that question with bullshit. I like it too much, I'm too stressed out, it makes me feel good blah blah blah. I'm a lifer. I was lying to myself and I knew it.

When I pulled the trigger I had to remind myself everyday, every hour, every minute, every second, every moment I ever wanted to smoke. And I have to keep reminding myself. Every time I think of smoking, I have to remember why I don't. 

It's not some forever, I'm never going to do it again promise to myself. It's a constant reminder. If I can just turn down this one moment, I might be able to turn down the next. 

And so it goes.

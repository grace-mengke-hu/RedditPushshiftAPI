The sudden realization when

My buddy and I were just kicking it at mines having a few beers and he stepped out into my balcony for a smoke. I asked him to close the balcony door because I don't like a stinky house.

Wtf?! I used to smoke indoors and now I find the slightest hint of that smell absolutely revolting.

This is a small accomplishment I know but damn it feels good to be a gangsta (non-smoker).

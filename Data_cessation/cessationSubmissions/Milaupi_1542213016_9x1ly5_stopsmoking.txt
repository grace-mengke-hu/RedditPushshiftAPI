I'm on day 4.. progress

Well, I stopped smoking since I was in the hospital this weekend on the lung department. Someone was dying of COPD next to me. I quit immediately. 

All went well until yesterday. I now feel extremely down and sad. Almost like grieving. I don't have smoking urges at all, I just feel extremely sad and angry all day. 
I am upset with my skin, because it's gross AF and oily all of a sudden. My hair is extremely oily suddenly. Food tastes weird and I gained 2 kilos! 

It's not that I have the urge to smoke. I just have the urge to make myself feel better. How long does stuff like this take to go away? I normally smoked about 40 cigs a day.ðŸ¤¦

18 and desperate

I started smoking at 15 and I'm desperately trying to quit. I started because I thought it would make me look cool but now its the I biggest regret of my life. The thing is, I can't imagine my life without cigarettes. Like, what will I do when I'm stressed? What will make me feel better when I'm having a bad day? How would I cope? Life as a nonsmoker just seems so abstract and distant, like a life without eating or drinking. I don't know why I buy packs anymore because when I do I feel a ton of guilt, but I can't bring myself to throw it away because I hate wasting things, so I just use it as an excuse to smoke the whole thing, and then I inevitably buy another pack. I'm terrified that one day I will be on my death bed, in with an excruciating pain in my chest, thinking "Why couldn't I quit when I was 18, when I was only smoking 3 a day? Why do I have to die like this?" I don't want to die early but I feel like I have no say in the matter. Sorry if this is long winded, I'm just looking for advice.

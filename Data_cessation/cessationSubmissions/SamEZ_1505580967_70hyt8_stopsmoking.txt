Who feels like not having a cigarette today??

Today is day 7 for me! It feels demonstrably better than the last few! Got to reading the Alan Carr book last night and it definitely helped fill up my motivation well!

To those of you in day 1,2,3,4 etc... it's going to get better! Remember... non-smokers have good days and bad days too, the nicotine isn't actually doing anything for you other than creating stress later!

So who feels like doing nothing with me today??

P.s. Go Aztecs... if I can beat these cravings you can beat Stanford!

Edit: I didn't smoke today and SDSU just knocked off #19 Stanford in the last minute :)

DAY 1

First time posting on here although I've been lurking for quite sometime. I think I'm ready to finally kick the habit. I've been smoking for about a year and a half now and I noticed difficulty breathing sometimes. I would like to be able to go for a run and exercise without getting winded so easily. Today was my first day and I noticed it wasn't THAT difficult. I feel like it is more of a nervous habit for me, than an addiction. I look forward to seeing what happens and hope this is my final attempt to quit :)

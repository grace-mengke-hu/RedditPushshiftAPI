Morning coffee, GAHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhfpthh

Day four, first cup of coffee and I WANT A FUCKING CIGARETTE. Personal life stress is high, but I WON'T do it. This has been too difficult and I am told the hardest part is over. Besides, I am lucky enough to have people who would be disappointed in me. I guess the challenge is convincing myself that I'm doing it more for myself than I am for them. Thanks for the support, folks!

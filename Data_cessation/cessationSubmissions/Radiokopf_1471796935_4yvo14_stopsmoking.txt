1 Year

Time to Celebrate. But what i celebrate the most is the fact that it really does not matter now. I am a ex-smoker.

No one of my Friends really tought i could manage back 2 Years. Yea, i had a relapse after half a year but i would not let that stop me. Im always hard on me,but this time i just did a perfect job and had not a single smoke in a year!

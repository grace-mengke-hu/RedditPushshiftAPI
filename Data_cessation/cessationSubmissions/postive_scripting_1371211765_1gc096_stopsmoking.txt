Im almost 100 days free from smoking and its still struggle.

It may not be as worse as the first 3 days but the occasional craving is distracting and daunting. It is a demon creeping up my back, reminding me of who I was-- someone who had no will power and who would spend all of his time in front of a computer with an ash tray beside the keyboard.

That life is over. Id rather die running more than 5 kilometers than die sitting at home smoking and feeling worthless. I just want to thank /r/stopsmoking for all the help. I didnt read AllenCarrs book but the badge is the biggest motivation I have for having quit smoking. If you feel like those comments you guys wrote here contributed nothing, dont. I have been a lurker in this sub before I quit and it is the sense of having a community to stand against a common enemy, made me trust myself that I can do this. Thank you for every comment , motivation, advice you guys made. 


Happy 100th smoke free day to me and best of luck to yall!

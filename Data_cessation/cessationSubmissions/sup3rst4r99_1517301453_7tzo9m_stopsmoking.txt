Anxiety Disorder + smoking connection?

Hi!

Developed a anxiety disorder 2 years ago somehow. Had been smokefree for over a year and foolishly started smoking again before that and loathed myself for it when I noticed I was hooked again.
Tried quitting a few times and had a nervous breakdown of sorts - this was when my "disorder" started.

Anyway, has anyone noticed when you stay quit for a few months that their anxiety disorder got better? I'm hoping that would be the case and would make quitting smoking all the more desirable for me.

Chime in people!

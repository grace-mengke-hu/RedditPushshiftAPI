Is it normal to fantasize about smoking?

Sometimes I find myself fantasizing and day-dreaming about smoking. 

Like today when I was browsing /r/travel, I was looking at some pictures and thinking how one day I'm gonna sit and smoke there.

Or I look at a cafe on the road while driving and think about how I'm gonna smoke there. 

I know I don't want to smoke again, I know all the pitfalls. But for some reason, whenever I have these fantasies, I feel I'm doing something wrong, like somehow I'm on the wrong path.

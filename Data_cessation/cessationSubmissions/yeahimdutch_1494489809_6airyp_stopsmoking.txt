On day 4 decided to not buy cigs on Monday now here we are...

This is maybe my 6th quit but I feel like I'm really ready for it. Every other quit was important to get to the stage I'm at now, I have no cravings, I don't want to smoke, yesterday I was at a birthday. Everyone was smoking except me, not even once did I think of lighting up.

I didn't plan this quit, I just did it, yesterday I slept a bit more and felt a bit depressed. I just want the side effects of nicotine to go away but not by smoking another cig.

Fuck tabacco, long live life! After 12 years I'm really really done with this shit. Smoked from 15-27

Thank you and keep it all up! Lurkers out there, it's possible! you can do it too! Keep on trying, I started lurking here too and this sub helped a TON!

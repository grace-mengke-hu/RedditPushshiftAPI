As time goes by!!

Just wanted to let all the new quitters know something!! You see when I first stopped smoking, I would check into this subreddit about 20 times a day(basically) each time I thought of smoking. Now, after 291 days smoke free, I may check in once a week, because even when I do think of smoking, it's so short lived that I'm onto something else and I wouldn't even class it as a craving. Hang in there all you new quitters! I had smoked 40 years before I finally gather up the will power to do this, but it can be done..one craving, one hour, one day, one week....  it really is so worth it. Those little white sticks no longer control my lifeðŸ˜Š

Have smoked for over 20 years, ready to quit. Best e-cig to help me?

I've smoked since I was 16 years old.  As my 40th birthday approaches fast, I have decided I really want to quit.  I have tried before, but never last an entire day.  (yes I am that pathetic).  I smoke about a pack a day.  I think using an e-cig would be very helpful, but I have no idea what kind to start with.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

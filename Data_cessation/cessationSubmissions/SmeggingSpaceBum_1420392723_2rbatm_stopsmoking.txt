It's time to stop. For real this time.

Hey all, and welcome to my 1st reddit post. 

What is it that Mark Twain said? Something like "Quitting smoking is easy, I've done it a hundred times." Ain't that the truth. I've been a heavy tobacco user for a long time...since my teens (I'm now 33.) I know it's bad for me. My wite and kids hate it. I know the benfits, and quitting is something I honestly want to do. 

I've tried so many times before. I even had about a year a long time ago where I actually succeeded. But like many, the stress from work, and life, make it almost unbearable. 

Recently, I've become a runner. Between August of 2013 and now I've logged 246 miles. In a way running has become my new addiction, but it's been unable to supplant these stupid smokes. I've been able to cut back at times, which is good I guess, with the help of nicotine replacement. But I want to be rid of this beast so bad. Especially because I like running more. 

I've got a 5 Mile training run scheduled here in a bit. I think I'm gonna have one last smoke before hand and try once again, to call it quits. 

Wish me luck.

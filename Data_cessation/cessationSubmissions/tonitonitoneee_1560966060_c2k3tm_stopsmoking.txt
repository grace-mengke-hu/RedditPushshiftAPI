Starting Day Two! Cold Turkey!

Hey everyone!

I found this sub through my Smoke Free app and I thought, “Of course! I lurk on reddit all the time, I may as well do it in a sub that will motivate me!”

So, here I am. Starting day two of no smoking. I find that my cravings come while at work because I always scheduled my cigarettes around my breaks. I’ve warned everyone I work with that  I am quitting and to let me know if I get out of line. So far, everyone has been super supportive (minus my smoking buddy)!!

Thank you all in advance for being there for me!

A bit late but... 100 Days!!

I wanted to quit for months before one day on a whim I decided enough was enough. I smoked 10-20 cigs a day. If I didn't buy another packet I couldn't smoke. No matter how much the nicotine devil in my brain screamed I wasn't going to buy a pack for at least 2 weeks. I decided 2 weeks was more realistic than forever. If I decided to buy a pack after 2 weeks then at least I knew I could do 2 weeks. Once the fortnight was up, I was so proud of my achievement that I didn't want to waste the opportunity to become a non smoker. And here I am 112 days smoke free and i've never felt better. I couldn't smoke again. I never though I would be free of cravings. The first month and even at 90 days I thought the cravings would last forever. Now I look at people who smoke as if they're dumbasses not like I wish I was smoking too. The road is tough but it's given me a new lease of motivation in other aspects of my life. I know with enough dedication I can achieve everythign I want to.

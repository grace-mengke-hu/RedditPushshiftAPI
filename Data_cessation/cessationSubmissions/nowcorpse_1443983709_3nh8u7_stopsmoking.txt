I don't know what to do with the free time

8 days. No smoke. Not a single craving. Used to be 25 cigs/day for 13 years.

At office: I finish my lunch, walk out to the stairs out of sheer habit, and realize I'm no longer actively burning my lungs. Come back to the office.

At home: Walk the dog, come back, walk to the balcony out of sheer habit, and realize I'm no longer actively burning my lungs. Come back to the bedroom.

My life has changed, and I need to find a hobby. I'm saving too much time and I dunno what to do with it. :-)

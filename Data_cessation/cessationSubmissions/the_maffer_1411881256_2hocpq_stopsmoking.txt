Waking up early in the morning

I quit about 20 days ago. Felt awesome after 3 days or so. After about 10 days I realized that getting out of bed in the morning has been SO much easier. I always want to be a morning person - but I'm always super groggy, hit the snooze, and a zombie without my morning coffee. But now I am up at the crack of my alarm and getting into my morning routine much easier. I'm pretty excited about waking up easily at 6 am every day! 

Has anyone else experienced this after quitting? I don't really feel like I'm sleeping "better". I have always been a really really deep sleeper. I'm just waking up and jumping out of bed much easier!

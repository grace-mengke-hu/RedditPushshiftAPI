1 month!! But help!!

So i quit over a month ago, i started with nicorette 2mg but after reading on the internet and on here how people got addicted to the gum and didn't stop even after 8 or 10 years, i went cold turkey after the 6th day. Now it is much easier, less cravings and their duration is a lot less. the only thing though, is that i'm suffering from too much gas!! it started a week after i stopped smoking, it's really annoying. i changed my diet when i quit, and i'm eating healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables, and i finally resumed jogging(it's fun again) and i thought it would great for my stomach and body but apparently not, i didn't suffer from this problem at all prior to quitting. did anyone experience or experiencing something similar? what did you do? and how long did it take to stop? like i said it's really annoying and reading on the internet some people went back to smoking to stop it and i will NEVER smoke again!! help!!

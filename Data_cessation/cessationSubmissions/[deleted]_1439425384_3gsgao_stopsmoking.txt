Vacation made week 1 easy. Normal life is making week 2 hell.

It's crazy how much my environment and daily routine affects my cravings. Being on vacation made not smoking easy, and I was even staying right across the street from a gas station. I just read my book and hung out at the lake, and I never really felt like smoking. Now that I'm back home though... It only takes an hour after I get off work and the cravings start to creep in, and every time I try to do something to distract myself I'm just aware that I'm trying to distract myself and can't focus on the thing I'm trying to do. I've almost made it through 3 days of being back home now, but I'm worried that the cravings won't stop. Especially since I'm going back to school in a week and a half! I haven't gone to school in a couple of years now.

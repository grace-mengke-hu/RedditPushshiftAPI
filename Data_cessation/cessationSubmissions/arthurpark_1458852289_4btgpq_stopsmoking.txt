Day 10

I'm on Day 10 of feeling like a morally superior person. Now, when I see someone smoking, I can't help but feel just a little better than them even if I try hard not to. I find myself catching the smell of cigarettes on my friend's clothes and try my best not to mind it but it is a loathsome, overpowering thing. 

I've read that this feeling passes eventually and I can get on with being a normal human eventually. What was your experience like? Did your increased sense of condescension towards smokers start to fade after a couple weeks? Sometimes I can go hours without thinking about how great a guy I am before I happen to see someone taking a cigarette break and a wild feeling of derision surges through my body. I hope it gets better.

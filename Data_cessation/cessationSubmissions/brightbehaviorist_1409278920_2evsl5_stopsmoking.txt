Holy cow, I got a star!

I smoked for 20 years (!). I almost can't believe that I'm a nonsmoker now--I never thought I could do it. But here we are! I never posted here, but I lurked a lot, and it was really helpful. 

The biggest switch, for me, was changing my thinking from "I'm going to try to quit" to "I'm going to quit". In the past, when I said "I'm going to try to quit" what I meant was "I'm going to quit, unless I can find a good excuse to smoke". And my addict brain was very good at finding an excuse to smoke.

I really think I'll never smoke another cigarette again. When I was a smoker, that thought made me sad and scared. Now it makes me feel great!

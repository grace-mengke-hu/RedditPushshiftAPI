I've decided to quit

I'm a 26 year old woman and I've been smoking since I was 18. Last night I was doing a household budget and much to my surprise I have been spending 150 dollars a month on cigarettes. That's almost my entire car note. It's more than my car insurance. I've just seen I have been wasting money on something that isn't beneficial, fun, or healthy. I emptied my pack about 45 minutes ago and refuse to buy anymore. I've quit once before and lasted a month. I'm super glad I have found this sub.

Are there any tips and tricks on how to resist cravings? I'm nervous yet excited and I don't want to fail. 
I'm going to start putting five dollars a day into a savings account to show myself how worth it quitting will be. 
I'm gonna do this y'all!!

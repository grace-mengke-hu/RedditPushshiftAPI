People tell me I'm fooling myself.

As my flair suggests, I haven't been smoking for 155 days. Cigarettes, that is.

Instead, I've been smoking weed almost every day. I've mixed it with tobacco which I've heated up to get nicotine and other chemicals out of it (what's this process called in English?).

In the last week, in which I've been alone, weedless and almost totally broke, I've started using snus (similar to dipping tobacco) and drinking alcohol to cope with my newly gained semi-depression.

People say I can just the same start smoking cigarettes again. I don't want to, because then I'll be back at square one.

Additionally, I'm alone in Denmark. My girlfriend went back home to The Faroe Islands. I'm planning on going home too next month but I'm broke and unemployed. I can't get unemployment support here without moving my address to DK.

Can anyone comment on this? Am I being stupid? What should I do? Help?

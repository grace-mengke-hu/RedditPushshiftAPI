Day 1

Wish me luck. 

I'm 31. I started smoking when I was 17. I've been smoking American Spirit menthol lights for most of those years. I usually smoked 7-10 a day, more or less but in the last month, I dropped down to 2-3 a day. I had my last one yesterday afternoon and now I'm at work for the first time without nicotine in my system. 

Help.

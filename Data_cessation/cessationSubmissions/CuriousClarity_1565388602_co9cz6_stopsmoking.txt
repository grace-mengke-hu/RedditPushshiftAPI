Seriously about to go back after 6 weeks clean.

Just slapped on a 7mg patch 10 mins ago but am worried about my psychological issues which tobacco suppresses. Sure saving money and being healthy is great, but I just can't focus properly without it. Additionally, I'm going back to school in a week and do not know what I'm going to do about study rhythm and study-breaks. Is there anything else that can substitute a smoke break in the same way?

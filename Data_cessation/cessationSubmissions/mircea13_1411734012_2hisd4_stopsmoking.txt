Hi all

Hi all again, I am on day 17 and it's ok it's very good to let this habit go down the river of habits, I am also into nofap but there I relapsed a couple of times but here I can't have that confort to do it, ok, all in all I need some advices and I want to ask you guys from this point of 17 days what should I expect to, to point out I don't have lusts now only mental ones but rarely only when I go out and drink with my friends in bar's where are tons of smoke and I feel that I am choking to death :).
On the improvements section I can point out one thing a much better life and that's it!
P.S. Sorry for my engrish.

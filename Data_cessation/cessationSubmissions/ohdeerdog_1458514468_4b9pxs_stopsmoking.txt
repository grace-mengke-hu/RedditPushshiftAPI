16 years and around 200000 cigarettes later, I extinguished my last one. I am now a non-smoker.

Having gone no longer than 8 hours without smoking during the day in the last 10 years – the single time I tried stopping, some 5 years ago – and averaging 3 packs/day for the last 5 years, I realize this is going to be a challenge.

I just finished listening to The Easy Way and I fall somewhere between the doom and gloom category and the excited category.

I'm not sure I'll be able to embrace cravings with the "yippee" attitude.

What I am sure of is that I have beaten several drug and alcohol addictions in the past.

Godspeed to me.

EDIT: Thanks for the encouragement guys, I'm just 9.5 hours in but I'm holding strong. Did my usual routine just without smoking. Had my morning coffees, went to the gym, went to work, want to kill everyone. Not smoking.

EDIT 2: 14.5 hours in -- I did have some cravings, but not as bad as I expected them to be. But then again, most of my cravings come at night. I ate some mozzarella. I will not eat sugar, since I went keto again yesterday too.

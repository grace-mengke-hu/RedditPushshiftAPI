Addicted to NRT lozenges, can I get advice on how to quit

Not sure if this belongs here, but could really use some advice on how to quit. I’ve been using NRT lozenges for around a year, 4mg - 7-10 a day (28-40mg nicotine). Last time I got them I went down to 2mg, still 7-10 a day.  Should I taper with a 7 or 14mg patch?  It’s been 24 hours since I ran out and withdrawal symptoms so far are irritability, craving, sleepiness, slight headache and general lack of motivation

It has officially been 1 week. (Long post)

I have endured a lot of stress and trials in this week.  I quit Monday morning at 2 a.m. after a concert. Tuesday afternoon, I finally finished working on my car's engine (took it apart and put it back together 3 times) after 2.5 weeks of work. Got pulled over on the test drive and run through the gauntlet of questions, only to end up with a $175 ticket for my registration being dead after I had explained why they were dead and that I had just fixed it not an hour prior.  

The following day,  on my way home with the car from my buddy's garage (couldn't drive it home that night bc registration) it broke down and I had it towed again. 

That night I found out the girl I was seeing had slept with someone else who happens to be a friend of mine.  The next morning I found my basement flooded from a crazy storm and had to go through it all. 

To top it all off, I live with a smoker and have many friends that are smokers. Somehow I've made it through this week and it gives me strength to know that if this week couldn't break me, nothing will.


Tl;dr- extremely stressful week,  but I made it.  

Cheers and thank you all for the support and advice you've given me at this point!

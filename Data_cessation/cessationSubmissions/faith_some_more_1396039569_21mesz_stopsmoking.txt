1000 days

Hi there, this is my first ever thread. 

Today is my 1000th day free from cigarettes. I smoked for the better part of 16 years. Tried a few different stopping tactics, Allen Carr, gum, inhalers and eventually it was cold turkey wot dun it.

I am trying to convince people in work to give up but am meeting resistance. Oh well! 

In the time since stopping smoking, ive lost close to 30lbs and ran 2 marathons. 

But most importantly, if i can do it, anyone can. 

Thanks :-)

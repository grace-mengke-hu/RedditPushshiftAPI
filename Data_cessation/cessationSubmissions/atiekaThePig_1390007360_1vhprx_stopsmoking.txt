okay......today was a little rough, but .........

I didn't smoke so all was not a total loss.  I only ride the bus so after a difficult couple of hours in town, I got to *relieve*  * myself w/girlfriends on the bus and was soon laughing.  

Afternoons like I had today are what worry me about sticking to my guns on no smoking.  I *really* get stressed when I get stressed and I've started doing breathing exercises to help.  I'll be mighty grateful when under stress the *breathing* is the first thing I think of and not a disgusting ciggy!!

Thanks.  That is all.  LOL

*relieve=talk up, LOL

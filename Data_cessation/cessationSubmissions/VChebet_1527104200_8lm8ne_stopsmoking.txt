I made it!

I made it past 100 hrs. Countdown to 100 days begins now. I've been OK all these 4 days. Pretty mellow and laid back. I decided not to push myself and dragged through the first two days. I've realized though, that I'm beginning to adjust. I was early to work today without any real effort. However, this evening I've just gotten super emotional. Crying and sobbing over stuff. Hope this too will pass. It's emotionally draining.

36 hours

About 36 hours now since my last cigarette. I've been smoking for 5 years and this is my 3rd serious attempt at quitting. I switched to an e-cig in early June and was a able to stay off cigs for over two weeks, but "just one" became two, and the trickle became a flood, until I was back to 2 packs every 3 days. My boyfriend showed me this subreddit, and it has already given me so much hope. I guess I felt like I should speak up about my own experience, because I really admire how brave everyone on this page is for talking about their struggles (and victories!) 

In all honesty, I'm scared shitless. I'm as scared of failing as I am of never smoking again. But now when I feel scared, I can come to this page and know I'm not the first person to feel this was, nor will I be the last.

tl;dr thanks for being awesome y'all

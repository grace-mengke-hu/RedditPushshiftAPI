Day 1- No sleep, fucked up appetite, body cravings

Its officially been 24 hours and I am fully embracing the suck. Last month I lost my job because over some interpersonal bullshit between myself and some asshole who I thought was a buddy of mine. Living with my brother and mother in a one bedroom, heavily in debt, I can't afford to smoke anymore. So I quit yesterday and my whole body is out of already out of whack. I couldn't sleep, the cravings come in these intense waves, my appetite is all over the place, and I can feel weakness in my entire body. I've been smoking since I was 17, was only a social smoker until I turned 21, and have been smoking 4 packs a week for the past 5 years. I was on the e-cigs for six months about two years ago, but the battery kept dying on me all the fucking time, so I went back to the cancer sticks. The longest I've ever made it is ten days. I'm hoping to get some support and tips here while in the throughs of misery, and desperately looking forward to this nightmare finally subsiding over the coming weeks and months. Kill me, kill me now.

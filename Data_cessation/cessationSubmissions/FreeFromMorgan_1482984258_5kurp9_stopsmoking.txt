Can't even remember my last craving, hang in there everyone. It's so worth it and it won't even be a thought anymore after only a couple months.

Nothing else to say, just want to offer some encouragement. I doubted I'd ever break the addiction but I did and it is the best thing I have ever done, so much positive has come from it.

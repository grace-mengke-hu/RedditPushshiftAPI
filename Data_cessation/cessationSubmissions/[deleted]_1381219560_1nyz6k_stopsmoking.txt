Day one begins tomorrow, or really, it has just begun.

I've tried to quit before, cold turkey, and with an e-cig (e-cig just made it worse i think) but never lasted more than a week. It's always that "one" cigarette that gets me. Once I have one, I'm right back into my routine (a pack a day). 

Anyway, I'm posting this as some sort of concrete marking of when I quit and also, because I'm looking for advice.

Can anyone give me some tips on ways to keep going when the going's tough? Is it okay to start cardio exercise immediately, or should I wait a little bit? I really wanna go for it this time. I used to run 5 miles a day. Should I bother even attempting that? What are your thoughts, /r/stopsmoking?

Edit: I'm almost 22, been smoking for ~3 years

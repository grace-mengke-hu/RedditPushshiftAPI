Financially, I have to start now.

I’ve been smoking on and off since I was 13. I’ve quit for a few years a few years back, then quit for half a year. I’m smoking a pack every two days, maybe a full pack on the weekend if I’m drinking.

I carpool to work but I can’t stand not owning a car anymore. I don’t make a lot of money and my credit is pure garbage so I need to start saving up to get a car starting this next paycheck. If I’m living reasonably strict to my plan I can save $400/month until income tax comes in so I’ll have $2500 + my tax return to get a pretty decent car. There is no way I can afford this if I’m still smoking.

This starts today. I’ve never been able to quit by using the patch or switching to a vape. I have a pack of nicotine gum I’ll use to ween myself off at work, but after that I’m going to chew regular gum and drink a ton of water when urges or triggers occur. Step one is recognizing those triggers. First cup of coffee in the morning with a smoke, breaks and lunch at work, boredom, drinking.

This is something I have to do. I need the freedom of a vehicle. There are tons of reasons to quit, but at this point if I could smoke for free I probably wouldn’t change a thing. It’s going to be a long half a year, but it’s going to be worth it. Cheers everyone, I appreciate all the support in this sub.

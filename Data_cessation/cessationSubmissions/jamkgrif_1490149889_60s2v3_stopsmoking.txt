HOW TO STOP YELLING

Day two complete and the slightest thing is making me mad. To be point on, I don't yell as much as I strike that "I'm disappointed in you" tone, but with a certain smoking deprived flair. Regardless, I was talking with my parents, I'm 28 if that makes a difference, and hit a point in the conversation where my frack it meter hit limit and I said my mind. I respect and love my parents, a thing I feel obligated to say after admitting my frack it meter released pressure. But now I feel horrible, like me after ordering a pizza. Let's be honest they are expensive and an amazing amount of calories. Now I'm worried about two things...  
  
1.) how to apologise to them?
  
2.) how to stop this from happeningâ€‹ in the future? 
  
Thanks in advance for the guidance.

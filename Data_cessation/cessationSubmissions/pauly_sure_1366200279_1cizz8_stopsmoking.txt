I've made it 10 days after 14 years..

...and I'm only 28. Thanks to a three year old coughing in my mouth, I've had a lingering cough/cold/sinus situation aggravated by 14 years worth of crap in my lungs. I didn't even notice that I wasn't smoking until it had been three days! Thanks, lingering illness!

The last seven days have brought splitting headaches, tears, panic, cold sweats, fear, nausea and irritability (is it normal to be getting cold sweats?) as well as a major drive to keep taking it day by day.

The thing is, I'm afraid to commit to quitting yet... it's like, I've tried so many times in the past, and the pressure of making such a momentous declaration always made me break down and have a cigarette. I am so emotionally attached to cigarettes. I feel like, to definitively say "I quit" is to abandon my most supportive friend. I know it's crazy but it's hard for me to own up to letting this disgusting habit go.

Day One

Oscillated between heavy use and long stretches of no smoking at all.  First cigarette at 16, heavy user in freshman year of college, quit sophomore year, then back at heavy use when I went abroad to Denmark (over 60% of the population identified as "casual smoker").  Quit again for a few years then slooowly slid back into the habit when I started work at a maritime museum in San Francisco and it was like being back with the Danes with how everyone is a smoker.

I never suffered health drawbacks (Other than tobacco use supercharging hangovers...), and as an avid cyclist my blood pressure always skated well under the danger zone so I never got any feedback from healthcare professionals.  However, I'm approaching 30 and I want to make a good health habit stick this time.  I smoked my last cigarette yesterday and hated it and decided to kick it for good.  I figure that I'll throw off this handicap and get to my real potential as a cyclist.  Planning on lots of hill rides over the weekend to sweat it out and keep my mind off of the cravings.  Anyone have any tips for getting through the first week?

Why do I do this to myself?

So here's my story.... I'm 19 years old and I started smoking cigarettes consistently at 13 years old. I was smoking about a pack and a half a day. On January 20th of this year I quit proudly quit smoking after reading "the easy way to stop smoking" by Alan Carr. I went almost six months until I went on a cruise on June 15 where I decided to start smoking again because I spent most of my time in the casino drinking ( legal drinking age is 18 on international waters). The casino was one o the few designated smoking areas and with everyone in my group being smokers I thought "what the hell?"  I thought I would have a cigarette to embrace the experience (stupid as hell). Well, that turned into me smoking for that whole week and I planned on not smoking after that but obviously that didn't happen. I was ifgt back where i started. So I decided to reread that book a few days ago and I smoked my last cigarette and never thought I'd look back. I was so proud of myself for drinking last night and not smoking but tonight I have been having some beers and the craving set in and I waited and waited for it to pass and told myself I would not smoke. About 45 mins go by and I finally secretly smoked a cigarette. I'm completely ashamed of myself. The thing is I drank like a fish in those 6 months that I was smoking and I never once even considered smoking. I'm by no means an alcoholic (anymore). I just work 50 hours a week and on the weekends I like to have a few beers but now I realize that's gonna be a problem considering this just happened. I wish I could go back to the first time I quit. It was beautiful. There was no task involved whatsoever. Now it's different.

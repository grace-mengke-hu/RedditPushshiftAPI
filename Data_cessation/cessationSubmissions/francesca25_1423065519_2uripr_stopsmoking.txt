I need a better reason to quit

I quit on sunday because I ran out of cigarttes and it was raining outside and I was just too lazy to go buy smokes. Then I fgiured I might as well try quitting. I'm in day 10 and it worked well so far but I just want to make a coffee and pop a smoke (since meanwhile I bought a pack and it's still untouched).
I'm 18. I have no kids or health issues to think about so that I stay motivated and as great as my laziness can be, I don't think I can do this without a stronger motive. I usually only smoke 3 or 4 cigs tops a day so money wise the difference isn't great either. So people who are my age, what keeps you going?

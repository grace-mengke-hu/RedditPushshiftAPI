My five biggest benefits from not smoking

1. I can run easier, and I enjoy it more.
2. I don't smell bad, at least not of cigarettes.
3. I don't waste time worrying about what other people think of my addiction.
4. I don't feel guilty for giving money to big tobacco in order to kill myself.
5. I'm lessening my risk for emphysema, heart disease and lung cancer tremendously by not smoking.

Bonus: I'm saving up for a new bicycle.

Have not smoked in 24 hours... It's like i'm doing something wrong, wtf?

My SO has been talking about quitting smoking for a while now and she finally made her move. She was a relatively light or medium smoker, depending on the day and situation (Anywhere from 4 to 10). So I thought I should quit too since if only SHE does, it might be rough having me as a smoker nearby even if I don't smoke in her face. So I decided to quit aswell.

I'm 28 years old. Started smoking at the age of 13, so that's more than half of my life and by now, I average 15~25 cigarettes a day. It's strange because I feel that by *NOT* smoking, i'm doing something unhealthy, that i'm not supposed to be doing. Even tho' I know that smoking is absolutely horrible for me, there's the craziness in my head telling me that i'm doing a mistake. The habit is such a part of me that it's like i'm betraying my body and it's only been 24 hours.

It's incredibly difficult, especially considering that I kind of enjoy smoking and that i'm stopping out of necessity and common sense.

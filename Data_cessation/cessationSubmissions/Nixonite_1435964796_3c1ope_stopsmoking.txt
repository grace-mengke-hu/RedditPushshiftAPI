Going from vaping/snus to nicotine gum, is it fine to chew A LOT?

Hello everyone,

I can't handle the 3mg level of vaping, and I don't want to go back to the 6mg level either. I have been using snus for the past week (used it before temporarily) and it's OKAY, but I would rather just use nicotine gum to avoid gum diseases. 

At my current pace, I'm basically popping a new pouch of snus every 45-60 minutes, and using them for about 25-30 minutes. I am wondering, can I do the same with nicotine gum? I mean to ask, is it okay to use nicotine gum as much as I want?

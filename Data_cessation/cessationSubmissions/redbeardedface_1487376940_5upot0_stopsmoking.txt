I just messed up on day 2, and I want advice.

Day one wasn't smooth sailing, but it was manageable. Today I had a pretty good day to up until I had to deal with some medical insurance problems that got me really frustrated. I came home and avoided my roommates (who smoke). I took some time by my self and calmed down and thought I was past the temptation. Then I came out of my room and hung out for a minute. We are all currently getting ready to go to a party. One of them left their cigarettes out, and I just took one. I know that he wouldn't have minded, because we all bum off of each other all the time. I just hate the hold these things have on me. 


In the past I when I have tried to quit, I would find an excuse to smoke one. Things like : "Ah, it been a few days, I just wonder what it would be like now". From then it would never be more than 24 hours before I would have another, and within a week or so I'd be back to a pack a day. 


My question is how do I get off the slippery slope? How do you deal with early setbacks?

edited for clarity.

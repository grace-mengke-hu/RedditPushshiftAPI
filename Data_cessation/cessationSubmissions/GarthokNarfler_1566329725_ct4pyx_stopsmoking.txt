Day 10 observations

I guess I should be proud of myself but I'm mostly just pissed.  I can't really say the cravings have gotten any better since day one although today they're pretty bad.  In fact today is probably the worst day so far.  I have a very hard time with optimism and lying to myself so Carrs' book did nothing but make me angry. Anyway I'm just ranting I haven't smoked for 10 days yay me.

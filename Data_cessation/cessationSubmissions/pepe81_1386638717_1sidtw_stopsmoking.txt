My symptoms and are they normal?!

I started smoking about 15+ years ago and recently quit about 2 months ago. Here are my symptoms; 
1. Constipation - When I do go it feels like I'm trying to push sandpaper out. 
2. My gums feel "bruised" and itchy for the most part. 
3. Insomnia - Whiskey cures this so I'm not too concerned for now. 
4. Dehydrated - I find I'm actually drinking water by the gallon now. 
5. Migraine - Pounding headache thats off and on.

My main question though... Do these symptoms go away?

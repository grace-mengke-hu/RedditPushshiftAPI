Is this normal?

I quit cold turkey 8 days ago. Was a pack a day smoker for 20 years. I am 39 now and in excellent health. I am concerned however that I have developed some real nasty symptoms. I never had a smokers cough, but since quitting for the last 2 days it has been relentless, to the point it wakes me up and hurts my throat. Also I have a fever, chills, aches and a nonstop runny nose. 

I've been taking ibuprofen for the fever, and mullien extract for the coughs, but it only helps maybe 40%. Is it normal to experience this? I haven't coughed this bad since I had bronchitis as a kid.

I want to quit, but I have no willpower

I started smoking when I was 18, simply because I could.  Now I'm 28 and still smoking.  I know it's really bad for me.  I know it's expensive.  The logical part of me wants to quit, but the impulsive side of me thinks "Damn I love cigs."

I can go long periods without smoking without being fidgety/agitated/craving (I don't smoke at work for example), but I know in the back of my head that in a few more hours I'll be able to smoke all I want.

I know it's really bad for me, but I'm still in pretty good health.  I know it's expensive, but I still have enough money.  I know I should quit now before it's too late, but it's hard to give up that crutch.  I think the only way I can successfully quit is by going cold turkey, but it's really tough to make up my mind and say "I don't smoke anymore"

Does anyone have some advice?  What was it that finally made you decide to quit?  Is cold turkey really the best method?

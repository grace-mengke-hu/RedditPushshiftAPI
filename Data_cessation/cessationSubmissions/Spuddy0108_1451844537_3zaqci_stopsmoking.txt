2 weeks and going strong. But friend has sent me cigars from Hawaii which will arrive any day now. Wat do?

Perhaps i should link to my first post to give context.

Found out on day 5 i broke a rib on that last coughing fit i had. Luckily my lung wasn't punctured. 

Anyway, There is a package on the way from a friend in Hawaii and it contains cigars. (Been in the post for 3 weeks now, before i quit smoking). Would it be wise to light one up (not inhaling)?

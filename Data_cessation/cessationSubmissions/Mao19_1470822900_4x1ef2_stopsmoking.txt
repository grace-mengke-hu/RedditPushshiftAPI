Nearly 2 weeks

Hi, 
I'm an **ex** heavy smoker. My parents were heavy smokers, I literally grew up surrounded by smoke, ashtrays and Cancer. 2 weeks ago I woke with a burning throat and decided to stop. 

I feel something is happening. During a few seconds, because of the habit, a voice tells me : smoke ! it's been a long time ! and that's usually where my last attempts failed. 

This time the voice is still here, but instantly there's another voice that answers : **you know it will NOT have the effects you expect** and then I think about those yellow fingers, bad taste etc etc.  
Yeah, now I have to get rid of those voices in  my head but that's another story for another subreddit. 

also this subreddit helps me so thank you guys.

Healthy Alternative?

I am in the process of quitting smoking (again). I have quit for months at a time, but I am always drawn back.I find that I really enjoy the ACT of smoking; even more-so than the effects.

Is there something healthy (or at least significantly healthier than tobacco) that I can smoke? I have looked at ecigs, but they seem to have most of the same negative health effects of cigs.

It isnt giving up, its self improvement

Something I have always struggled with is quitting something. I am too stubborn to stop even if it's bad for me.

Well, I have had enough of cigarettes. In Australia, the prices are crippling me and I can't do it anymore. 
I anticipate it will be hard after 10+ years of smoking, but it's another challenge I can be stubborn with. 

I'll probably end up posting here a lot as real life emotion talk isn't my thing, but I need somebody to know. Otherwise I fear I'll slip. Fuck it, I can do this. I will do this. 

Today, I am a non-smoker. Hopefully I will be tomorrow too.

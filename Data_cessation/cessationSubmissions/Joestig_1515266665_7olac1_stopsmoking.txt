My lung function has increased MASSIVELY in the past 7 weeks!

The two main factors: quitting smoking, and doing a lot of cardio.

I was able to run 5 km at 12-13 km/h on average 7 weeks ago.

Now I can do it at 16 km/h on average (and I expect to go to 20 km/h as I lose more weight - yeah I also lost 6 kg, that also helps with running).

But I also have increased my cycling ability (a sport where weight is much less important, especially because I do my measurements on a stationary bike): before I could do 30 minutes at 260 watts, now I can do it at 340 watts (and if I can see myself going over 400 this year).

It feels great to not be limited by lung capacity anymore. I can do crazy things now, like run with a heavy backpack from one end of the city to another (5 km) on a high speed and still feel great.

Not saying everyone will reach this point (I have a naturally high lung capacity and VO2max, and I am pretty well trained already), but you will certainly make a big step as you continue.

Perhaps you don't see it that much if you don't do endurance sports, but the fact is that your lung function will improve by 15-20+ percent, which is massive. Everything physical that you do will be easier. So, you can even forget about all the diseases you may get if you smoke, improving lung function alone is reason enough to quit smoking, because it means that you will have more freedom to do what you want, which is awesome!

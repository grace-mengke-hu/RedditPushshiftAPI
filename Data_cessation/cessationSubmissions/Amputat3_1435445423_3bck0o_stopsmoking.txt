Not even 1 day and already going insane...

So how on earth do you guys just 'quit' smoking?
I've been wanting to quit for a while now but never really did.
I smoke a bit more than a pack a day for about 10 years costing me just over 200€ per month so ye... that's why I want to quit.

It hasn't been a full day yet and I'm feeling all sorts of agitated...
I feel like punching a wall and breaking my hand, feel like breaking absolutely everything in the room, and I feel all sorts of angry...
Angry at myself for being such a bitch, angry about the fact that I feel angry without a release, angry because time is going so slow... 
You guys might know this behavior I guess but cmon... it hasn't even been a full day and this is completely mental...

The only thing keeping me going atm is that I might actually punch myself in the face for caving.

I know that the first few days are the hardest but seriously...
I feel like I'm going through heroin withdrawal or something...
Anyone have any advice for me?

Sorry for the rambling, but that's how I feel atm :|

 

 

**Edit:** Owkey, So I made it through day 1... (slow clap)

I've been awake for a couple of hours into day 2 now and I'm not feeling as horrid as yesterday.

Though I still find myself sometimes getting up randomly from time to time and I realize that my body was about to walk outside to smoke <_<

I think that's the worst part... it's such a habit.

Whenever I'm not sure what to do or I have a moment of pause in my day my natural reaction was to go outside and smoke. (resulting in days where I would sometimes smoke 2 packs because I have too much free time).


It's been about 30 hours now and haven't smoked yet :) 

Thanks for the comments guys! 

I didn't know reading positive messages would help as much as it does :o

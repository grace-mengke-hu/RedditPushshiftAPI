When it is forbidden, i crave for it (half a day now)

Hello everyone! I am a 24 year old smoker who is smoking since 15. Until January 2017 i was a heavy smoker, smoking pack a day. I used to smoke like a bloody Turk (yeah, because i am a Turk). After i started cycling i reduced my cigarette consuming without any will effort. Sometimes days went by while smoking a cigarette, and sometimes without even smoking any. 

Right now i decieded to quit and i am craving for it. On a usual day i would never want a cigarette. But now my girl friend is smoking one and i am craving for it. 

Yet, i am commited to quit. The best joy i can feel is having a healthy life. I will quit this time. 

I have a question for you guys. I am having troubles to feel awaken when i wake up. It is most likely because of my cigarette consuming. When will it fade away? Thanks, in advance. 

I wish the best luck to you all.

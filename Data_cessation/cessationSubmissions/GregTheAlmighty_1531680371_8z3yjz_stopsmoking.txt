9th day of NOT smoking + IQOS question

Relax, I am not thinking about buying an IQOS device. Maybe it's called differently in your country? Anyway, in Poland, where I live, it is that thing, that is advertised as "90&amp;#37; less harmful than tradidtional cigarretes". Can you share any data or articles concerning that topic? Because I smell bullshit here from a mile but I can't find any reliable info.  


BTW, today is my 9th day without a cigarrette and I feel AMAZING. Cravings are there, but it's not like I miss cigarretes per se, but mostly going outside, sitting at my balcony, relaxing myself - things like that, you know? So guess my psychical addiction is mostly built of a boredom and I have to find some other things to do insted, and (guess) I'll be fine. Fingers crossed! Right now, cooking, riding a bike, watching tv series work just fine :)

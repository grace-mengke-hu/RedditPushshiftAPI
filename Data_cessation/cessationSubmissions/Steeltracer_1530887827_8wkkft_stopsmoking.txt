If you're trying to "quit" smoking and it's not working, try something else instead.

"Quitting" made me feel like I'm giving away something I need, something I enjoy. And even though I knew that "quitting" was the right thing to do - I felt the urge to have cigarettes back.

So instead, I gave up on quitting and started **adopting** a healthy lifestyle. I'm not "quitting" anything, therefore I don't need anything back - all I'm doing is *adopting* a habit of being healthy.

Looking at it from this perspective, in my experience, makes it easier to tackle the problem of "emptiness" some of us feel without a cigarette.

You're not empty at all - on the contrary - you're full of life and health (and cigarettes try to steal that from you).

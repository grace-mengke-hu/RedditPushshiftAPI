Side effect of quitting?

I quit smoking 3 weeks ago (cold turkey) and I've been having this really sharp localised pain in my throat while swallowing (by localised I mean it's not a radiating pain. It's a specific point in my throat). The pain is only while swallowing. I haven't got any coughs or dryness in the mouth. I went to the doctor 2 weeks ago. He said it was an infection and gave me an antibiotic. The pain subsided and now it's sprung up again. I've heard of quitters flu being a thing.   
Not looking for medical advice. I just want to know if this is a thing related to my quitting and if somebody else has experienced it. Or it could be something entirely different and I should probably get a second opinion.  
Edit: I should probably update my badge

By all means, completely ignore this. Personal rant. Boring. Wah wah.

At this moment, apparently 288 days without a cigarette, I would like it to be known that I'd happily kill each and every person around me for a smoke.  

Not even a whole smoke!  Half a smoke!  Hell, smoke a cigarette and burp it into my face; we'll work something out!

It's been a rough day.  Ignore me; I'll have this shit under control in twenty minutes or so.

Have been a bitch all day - found the cure to it

Been in a real leave me alone or die attitude all day.  Also, doesn't help with a small headache that just will not go away.

I took a small nap this afternoon and seemed to wake up even more angry than I was before.  I decided to finally take the plunge and start running again on my treadmill.  Did 2k tonight between running and a speed walk.  Feel better now. :)

Heading out to supper with friends now. :)

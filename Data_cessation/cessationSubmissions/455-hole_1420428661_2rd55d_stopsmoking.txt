switched to vape to taper off

I smoked one cigarette on New Years day and am now using a vape as replacement. 

I've already started enjoying flavors and smells more and I'm not experiencing as much fatigue with some more strenuous physical activity. I know that nicotine is to blame for heart palpitations and my intention is to gradually lower the nicotine level over time. 

My personal recommendation for any attempting to quit this way is to buy the ELeaf IStick battery with the Nautilus mini tank and stick to no less than 30% vegetable glycerin liquid with no more than 18mg nicotine. This combination will best imitate the smoking experience without the smoke. 

I haven't wanted a cigarette at all so far. I hope this helps and I recommend checking out r/electronic_cigarette.

Thanks.

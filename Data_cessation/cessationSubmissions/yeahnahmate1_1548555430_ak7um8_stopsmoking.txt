Remained smoke free while drinking!

Hung out with a couple of friends who all smoke chronically and last night we drank beers, had a good time and none of us had a cheeky dart. I woke up feeling great! Went for a run and now I’m at the shops getting groceries and I know I’m not going to buy more. 

Early days but thank you to everyone who’s posted here while I lurked and gained the courage to stop killing my body. 


Also I may have a flair that hasn’t been updated but I am on mobile so I can’t tell, if it is please let me know.

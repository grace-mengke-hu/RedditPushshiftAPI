Today is the day I quit. Cannot concentrate at all.

I have decided that today is the day. 

I usually smoked around 4 cigarettes (on bad days, 6), all at night. I haven't smoked today yet, of course. I am not yet going through nicotine withdrawal, as I would usually only smoke later in the night than it is now, here.

I cannot concentrate today at work at all. I have been either completely distracted and unfocused or strongly focused in fighting myself (the old "there's still one cigarette at home, you could smoke it tonight, you don't need to buy any new pack, just that one cig"). 

This is a shameful thing for me. I have smoked mostly in secret for a long time. Only a couple of people know. This secrecy has been maintained through careful planning and work, and I am just tired of spending so much of my time and energy on this.

Just saying hello and trying to connect with people who have done it.

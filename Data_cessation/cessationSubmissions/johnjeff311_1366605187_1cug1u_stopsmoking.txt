Problems starting to stop. need advice

i just found this subreddit while i was browsing /r/new and thought i would give it a shot.  the only problem is, i have "quit" several times before, and ive seen how it changes my behavior.  i hurt the feelings of the ones i love, and i feel terrible about it.  i would explain to them that i am quitting smoking, and that might lead them to some understanding, but im under strict orders not to tell anyone in my family that i smoke, because although my parents both smoke, they want to keep it a secret that i do.  i know that if i quit again, I'll probably go back to this version of me that i dont really like, so i tell myself that i smoke for others sake and light up.  that however, is not my only dilemma.  i love cigarettes.  when anything happens, i can go somewhere, have 10 minutes to myself, and relax.  theyve become a constant that i depend on.  my dad may have left me, my sister may have turned into a terrible person, and i might be lonely, but cigarettes have always been there.  I really hope that this doesnt get buried and reaches someone with some sound advice

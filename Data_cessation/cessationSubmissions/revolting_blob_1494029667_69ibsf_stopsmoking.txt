I missed my anniversary!

April 26th was 6 years since I quit (with an enormous amount of help from this sub and whyquit.com)! I completely forgot about it! And I consider that a good thing. 

For all you guys trying to quit: you can do it! One day at a time, one hour at a time... Hell, take it one MINUTE at a time when you need to. Just remember: all you have to do is not smoke! 

Here are my current stats:


- days quit: 2,201
- Cigarettes not smoked: 55,034
- Money saved: $24,215



Good luck everyone, and good work!

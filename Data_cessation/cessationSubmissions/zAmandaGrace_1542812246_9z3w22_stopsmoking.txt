Psychological effects of quitting

I may be an island with this issue but since quitting, I found myself feeling more depressed and I’m waiting to adjust my antidepressant dosage until things level out with quitting but today I feel manic which is something I haven’t dealt with aside from when I have to take steroids for an infection. I feel incredible but I’m also wary of the impending crash which could come at any moment while my whole family is in town. Has anyone else dealt with this or maybe it’s unrelated to quitting smoking and I’m just triggered by my family LOL

Trying to break old habits

It's really been a challenge these last few days to do my job and my general routines without smoking. Smoking was like a time keeper of sorts for me, it punctuated every completed action. It is something I did when I had to sit and think about how to solve a work problem, or when I celebrated solving a work problem.

Its been 15 days now and I have done well more or less. I mean, I  hung out with a bunch of smokers on several occasion and didn't cave. I went out drinking many times with my friends and didn't cave. 

But still I find when I go about my daily routines, those I have practiced for years, that's when it is the hardest for me. Just sitting here working late, I keep looking around for a smoke, even after two weeks. I do not know what to replace it with yet. 

I feel like one bad day mentally will send me spiraling down and I will just get hooked again. So far it has gone well, but still that fear lingers in the back of my mind.

This has to be the most positive sub I've found

Came here looking for info.  I'm on day 4. Well, I had one smoke on Tuesday but otherwise none since Sunday.  I didn't sleep well last night.  It's easier during the day since I've never smoked at work I don't even miss it, but home at night is a bear.  Think I'll go grocery shopping to kill some time. Thanks!

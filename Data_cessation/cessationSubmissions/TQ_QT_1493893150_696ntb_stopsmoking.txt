10 months of happier life.

Today is my 10 month anniversary of not smoking, after smoking for about 10 years in a row. Couldn't be happier really. I don't think, nor do I dream about smoking anymore.  It's a habit I have overcome and I know I will never go back down the same road again. 
I haven't made a single post here before, but just wanted to share my joy with you all. If someone is wondering, then I quit cold turkey and haven't done a single cig since.

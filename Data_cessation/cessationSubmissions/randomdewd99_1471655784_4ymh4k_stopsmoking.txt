FUCK CIGARETTES

I haven't even seriously considered stopping since I started 10 years ago.. But I just had an experience that's opened up my eyes.

I was at the gym, not even going too hard when I begin to feel short of breath.  I begin the feel as though I can't get a full breath of air, and I begin having a panic attack

I calm myself down and book and get an emergency appointment with my doctor who, actually reminded me that I am asthmatic, and I really shouldn't be smoking.  (The breathing being more anxiety related than anything else)

This bought on a memory of being no older than 6 and being rushed to the hospital because of an asthma attack so severe my parents thought I was dying.

I just felt utterly ashamed and upset thinking about how I'm consuming something so hazardous for so long.  For me, my family... I just know now is the time to quit

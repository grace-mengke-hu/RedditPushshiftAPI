Need strength

Alright so day 11 without cigarettes. Been doing really well. I've been strong but my roommate left a pack in the kitchen and went out of town. I'm home alone. I put the cigarettes in his room but I can't stop thinking about them. How can I move past this. Once an hour I'm like oh yeah those cigarettes are there... I really don't want to ruin my progress. Remind me why being a non smoker is awesome... Remind me I don't need it.

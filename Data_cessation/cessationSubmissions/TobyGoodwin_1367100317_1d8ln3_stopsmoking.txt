Notes after a year

It keeps getting easier. I still get cravings (why do so many films feature so much smoking?!?) Things keep smelling better. I eat too many mints (especially when watching those darned films).

This subreddit is amazing, even though I haven't hung out here much for a while. You all really helped me, and one day you'll be looking back on your first year, and thinking how glad you are to have got here.

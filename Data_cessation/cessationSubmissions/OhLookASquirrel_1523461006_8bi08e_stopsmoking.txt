I like smoking, but hate that I'm a smoker. Need to rant, and maybe some encouragement.

25-year pack a day smoker.

As the title says, I like smoking. Maybe (almost definitely) it's the false feeling that feeding the addiction gives me. Regardless, I enjoy it. 

What I hate though is that I **have to.** I hate the way I feel if I smoke too much or not enough. I hate the way I smell, the way I feel in the morning, the lack of energy, the money wasted and obviously how it's ruining my body.

The physical addiction has always been relatively easy for me to overcome, but that goddamn psychological grasp it has on me is insane. My biggest problem is that each time I quit I feel like I'm depriving myself of something I enjoy. Those triggers are brutal.

I've stopped counting my attempts, but will keep trying until I succeed.

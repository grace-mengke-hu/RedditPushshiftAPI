Thanks /r/stopsmoking. I got through a music festival.

Big thanks to /r/stopsmoking for inspiration and support. Hearing everyone's stories of success and failure are really encouraging. Here's one of mine.

I went to a three day camping music festival and didn't touch a cigarette. I found I would have to move places if suddenly I was surrounded by smokers, but otherwise it was fine.

I've also taken up jogging again, I'm about 3 weeks in. 


TL:DR: Lurkers get your badge and start. Accountability.

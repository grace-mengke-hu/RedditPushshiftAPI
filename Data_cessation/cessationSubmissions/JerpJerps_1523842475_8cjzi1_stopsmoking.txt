A month and 9 days but I feel weird

Hey guys so i have found in the past 2 weeks I have been really irritable, pretty down and am going about my days feeling like a space case. Honestly the first few weeks were easier then the past two. I was wondering if his happened to anyone else. My cravings have become pretty rare at this point and I’m happy I’m not smoking and don’t feel like I’m missing out but god damn I’m just in a shit mood and kinda down about life and super duper irritable.  Like little problems are just blown way out of proportion. The worst was today.. I was trying to figure out a problem on my phone which had me on my computer for like 2 hours. By the end of it I was LITERALLY squirming around in my chair with irritability rushing through me. I was cursing to myself out loud and just wanted to smash things.  I ended up trying to pull a door off it’s hinges but thankfully it was installed well. (I’m a handy guy and chose to attack the door cause I knew I could fix it) What I really wanted to do what whip my mouse and phone at the wall but I know that would have been irreversible damage. 
It felt good to attack the door though and probably would have felt better if I had ripped it off. But it was just the act of letting out aggression like that which felt good. 
Anyway, I can’t remember the last time I got that irritated at something. I feel like I’m going crazy... has anyone else dealt with this degree of emotion later into their quit? I thought the irritability and depression normally disappeared after the first week or two.
It’s just weird cause I feel like I don’t care about smoking anymore but all of this is happening.
Any responses are welcome. I’m almost the point where I’m wondering if its something else causing me to feel like this.

Want to quit smoking

I smoke 5-6 cigarettes a day. I know it's not the worst, but I want to quit for my health and fitness. Problem is, I don't have an alternative to it. I'm pretty much a recluse, and my smoke breaks are the biggest source of mental stimulation I have. Without them I feel really cooped up. Any advice?

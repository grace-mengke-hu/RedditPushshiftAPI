stopped so often i dont even take myself serious anymore

im an on and off smoker, longest i went was 3 years without it. I really hate the expensive addiction and i hate myself after every cigarette. This leads me to "stopping" once a month (this time for real, haha) and i started being able to quit for months, but right now its down to a point where i can only make it a couple of days, partly because quitting has become a routine, i dont even took myself seriously anymore when i told myself i was going to quit tomorrow again. Anybody else experiencing this loophole and any tips on how to make serious attempts? (there it is, im not asking for how to quit but for how to attempt quitting, that sums um the problem)

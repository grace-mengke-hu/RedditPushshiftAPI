1 day, 9 hours, 52 minutes

This is the longest I’ve gone without nicotine in almost five years. I feel completely awful but I know this is temporary.. I called off the next two days of work so I can recouperate from this, the withdrawal is kinda kicking my ass right now. 

I didn’t take a last tobacco hit out of my bong saturday after work- reading the replies to my last post gave me strength to text my fiance and tell him to get rid of everything before I got home. He did. 

I haven’t been sleeping well, shakiness (I keep droping things), dizziness, major sweating. I can barley eat. I’ve also been having a major GI upset.. I’ve thrown up a couple times.. and can’t stop out the other end either (lol sorry). Just wondering if the stomach issues are part of withdrawal? I don’t think its a virus but idk. 

Reading this sub and all the success stories and struggles is really getting me through this. I really feel like I’m not alone, so thanks guys!

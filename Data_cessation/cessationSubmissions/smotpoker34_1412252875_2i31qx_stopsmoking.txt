What's your opinion?

I was wondering how this sub, with its magnanimous support, felt about alternatives as opposed to just cold-turkey quits. I have been doing...sub-par...with my quit and have turned to vaping (with a low nicotine level) to keep myself from picking up another cancer stick. I was just wondering how you guys felt about it.
Disclaimer: Opinions wont sway me, I love this vape setup I've acquired, just reaching out for opinions here.

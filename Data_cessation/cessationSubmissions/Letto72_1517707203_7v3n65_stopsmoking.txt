It's tough, but I am determined...

I've been smoking on and off for the last 6 months. I set myself a goal 2 weeks ago to quit and completed my two weeks. I don't know why I started and I wish I hadn't. The realisation of being addicted didn't set in until my first attempt to quit. After the 2 weeks, I asked my friend for a cigarette, to which now I regret. I smoked half of it and put it out. I released, that my body had changed within those 2 weeks of repair. I'd thought I'd get serious and do 1 year. 1 year is my goal, and after the 2 weeks, I'm starting again...

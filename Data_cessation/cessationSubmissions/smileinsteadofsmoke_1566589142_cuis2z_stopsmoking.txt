Quit smoking with the help of a smartphone app

We have developed a smartphone app to support non-daily smokers who would like to quit smoking. We are looking for non-daily smokers, who are willing to try out this app, and share their experience with us. If you smoke cigarettes on some days (***but not daily***), you may be eligible to participate in this research study conducted by faculty at the MGH-Harvard Center for Addiction Medicine.

Study participation would entail making an attempt to quit smoking while using our smoking cessation app, the completion of online surveys, and the optional participation in an online video/Skype call.

We will compensate you for your time (up to $195).

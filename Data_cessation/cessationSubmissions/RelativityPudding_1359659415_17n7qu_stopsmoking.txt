New to this sub. Never EVER thought I would be a non smoker, but after a pack a day for 5 years, I am officially one month smoke free! :)

If I can do it ANYONE CAN!! I've never felt better and quitting has given me so much confidence in myself, I truly believe I can do anything I set my mind to. I quit using Zyban and patches, if anyone is wondering.

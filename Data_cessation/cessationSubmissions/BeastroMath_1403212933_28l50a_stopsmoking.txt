"Beyond a certain point, there is no return. This point has to be reached." ... and other musings that have gotten me 2 years down the road.

That was a Kafka quote that stuck in my head early on.  

**Backstory:** I was that guy that "enjoyed" smoking, IDGAF if it was bad for me, IDGAF what anyone thought, didn't think I *could* quit, and all my friends confirmed that this was probably true.  

**Stats:**  I've been clear *759 days* and have not smoked 15,180 cigs.  In that time I've kept *$4933.50* in my pocket (based on prices 2 yrs ago...).  I've accumulated over *84 days* in time spent smoking (not to mention years and years of dividends down the road).  

The first week I quit I put together a simple quick spreadsheet that tabulated my stats.  I also wrote a list of reasons of why I wanted out!  After a 10 yr pack-a-day obsession I needed specific motivation.  

Here you go, in no particular order (with a my post-script commentary):  

* **I'm sick of a substance ruling my body, moods, and mental acuity.**  
*After indulging in tobacco for so many years, even my smoker-brain realized that I did not understand the depths to which the habit had weedled its way into the fabric of my lifestyle, choices, behavior, and interaction.  I can easily say that quitting helped me reexamine and reshape many aspects of myself.*  

* **The ability to laugh heartily without bursting into a coughing fit**  
*I have a contageous, generous laugh and can easily fall into tearful giggles.  It used to be a painful experience for my laugh to go to 11.*  

* **Respritory health: increased ability to exercise and obtain fitness goals.**  
*I've never been much of an athletic person and have always been overweight.  Before I started smoking, I used to cycle/mountain bike and really loved it.  There were a few other activities that I wanted to pursue and holding these goals as a priority was crucial to my quit.  Now I ride obsessively and pursue active hobbies that I could not have dreamed of.  My cardiovascular health is awesome now (normal blood pressure, resting heartrate less than 60bpm, fuck yeah!)*

* **Relieve the constant exhaustion caused by sleep apnea; apnea caused by poor respritory health and obesity**  
*Apparently I still snore a little, but I used to have full blown choke-in-your-sleep apnea.  I could get 9 hours of sleep and be lethargic, exhaused, and tired.  This was as much of a lifestyle problem as a smoking one.*  

* **Increased sense of smell and taste. Clear Sinuses.**  
*This one is a no-brainer -- and it kind of snuck up on me, especially regarding smells.  I just gradually noticed that I became much more aware of how things smelled.  Sinuses still haven't cleared and I'll probably go talk to an ENT doctor about it.*  

* **No more disgusting odor**  
*Even as a smoker I knew I stunk, I knew other people could smell it...but seriously had NO FREAKING IDEA how much that smell permeates a room.  Holy shitsnacks that is probably the one thing that repulses me now, another smoker's "indoor" smell.*  

* **Improved hygene (why bother showering when you smell like an ashtray)**  
*Quitting smoking really helped me improve my daily hygene. It's actually a little embarrassing that this was a goal.*  

* **Dealing with stress and emotions in a positive manner.  No longer using smoking as a crutch/coping mechanism.**
*This was pretty huge.  I mulled over all my problems (social, familial, academic, work, etc) over cigarettes and coffee.  During my quit I focused on finding productive outlets (ehem, exercise) to deal with stress and to generally just improve my mood and increase happiness.*  
*I cannot emphasize how challanging it was to re-transform my "pleasure center" away from nicotine and reformat it to accept exercise and endorphans.  I firmly believe actively pursuing this avenue is a HUGE contributor to my continued success!*  

* **Healthier lifestyle: Better sleeping, better eating, better hydrated, better fitness, better image.**  
*I've already covered this above.  But I'll just add that quitting has forced me to overhaul every aspect of my life (it was much needed).  As part of the journey, I'm in the process of losing weight (I'm down ~60 lb and dropped 3 pants sizes).  My sleep is restful, waking up is so SO much easier than it ever has been, daily hydration is surprisingly important, and what I eat really does play into my total wellness.  My self image is improved, and certainly the image that I present to the world has totally been overhauled.*

* **Lets face it, smoking is unattractive to many people.  Quitting greatly increases the pool of potential mates.**  
*If you are currently single, then you probably understand this on various levels.  The key here was that the trajectory that I wanted to set for myself was not one that a smoker could endure, by extension someone with whom I'd want to partner with could not be one either.  But yeah, average looking non-smokers have a larger pool to choose from.*  

* **Financial Benefit**  
*See above. For as long as it was an inspiration/motivation I set my cig money aside and treated myself to things as long as I stayed quit.  I focused on rewards that aided the goals that could not coexist with smoking (for example, bought a new road bike after like 8 months or so).*  

* **No more burn holes in my favorite clothing.**
*Nothing worse than dropping an ember on your favorite shirt.  Should you ever wear it in public, you'll be forever marked.*  

* **By quitting, travel could be so much less painless (esp. driving in someone else's vehicle and plane travel).**  
*As a smoker, travel was torture and I was shocked by how much I'd obsess and literally plan a travel schedule around smoking.  I was neurotic about making sure I wouldn't run out of my brand on a trip (sometimes stowing several packs to ensure an uninterupted supply).  I basically quit carpooling with friends so that I could smoke in my car.  Plane travel was agony.*

All I can say is stick with it.  I quit cold turky and had terrible quitters flu for 4+ days (aweful shit that I never want to endure agian).  Drink lots and lots of water, go ahead and take your usual break for a while (just go for a walk insead).  

It took me 4-5 weeks before I wasn't actively occupied with resisting cravings.  After 6 months, I started to find comfort in new habits and coping mechanisms were becoming more natural.  The best part of my quit happened around 9 or 12 months when one day I realized that I was no longer aware that I was a non-smoker (what I mean is that it didn't register for me any longer -- like someone who has never smoked doesn't think "gosh I'm so glad I haven't smoked in a 36 weeks").  

Quitting has been one of the most profound things I've done in my life.  I still deal with depression and apathy, but it's ability to affect my live is drastically reduced.  I hope I've entertained you for at least a few minutes, and just maybe I've offered a useful tidbit.

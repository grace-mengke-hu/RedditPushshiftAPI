Going on 24 hours without a ciggie (for the first time in many years).

I've smoked for 20+ years, and typing that out for the first time is just...wow. Quitting on New Year's Day is more of a coincidence, since I happen to be changing jobs and in a place where I'd like to make healthier decisions, but not a bad day to quit smoking.

I'm using an e-cig as a crutch, and other than a little headache and a constant sense of being disoriented from disrupting my daily routine, I feel great. I spent the day cleaning and de-smokifying my apartment while chugging water, and the first change I'm noticing is heightened sense of smell. I'm looking forward to the sense of taste coming back, as I hear that's pretty amazing after quitting. 

Anyway, a friend turned me on to this reddit for support, so hello reddit. 

I'm curious to know what you all think of e-cigarettes. I don't want to abuse that either, but a hit or two every couple hours is making the impossible possible, after dozens of failed attempts to quit (woo!). 

By tomorrow I might be losing my mind, but for now I'll go ahead and pat myself on the back for making it one full day ;)

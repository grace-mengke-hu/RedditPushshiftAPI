2 more days until 2 years.

I'm justifying posting this early because I might forget, but tbh, I don't think I'll forget. It's always really exciting for me to check back in occasionally and think how much time I have until another year anniversary. 


(I think more about my next nonsmoking anniversary than I do about smoking again if that is hopeful to anyone reading this that's struggling on day one or two.)


I'm really happy. I quit smoking the way I thought was best, and it worked for me only because I was ***consistent***. I'm trying to apply this concept to other places in my life now that I realize how well it worked for me and this addiction. (Easier said than done when it comes to chocolate, lol.)


Anyway, just wanted to say hello and thanks for existing /r/stopsmoking!

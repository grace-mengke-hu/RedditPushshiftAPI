'stop smoking' is working, but I'm super confused

Good Evening to you all.
My name is Fares, I'm 2 months from being 21 years old, I started smoking cigarettes n weed almost 7 years ago,  I smoked 20-30 cigs a day, a lot of weed for a while (3 years i guess) till I got bored of it.
ever since I consider myself a casual-weed-smoker.


In a few hours, it will be my first 48 hours with 0% nicotine, here is what's going on or what I'm thinking now:


“Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times.” 
 - Mark Twain
what really confuses me is people giving up their quitting attempt after months of hard cravings every day
I just can't help imagining myself lighting up a cigarette after a while because of a stupid mistake and going through the same SHIT/TORTURE over and over again, hell, why not? most people say the cravings won't go even in the next years.

since the minute i stopped smoking, i enjoyed the idea of me smoking weed more than i used to when i used to smoke.
this idea sounds like 'wrong' in a way, do you think quitting weed for a while would be helpful?

the only thing my friends are up too is 'smoking', either weed or cigs, i was thinking of 'DISAPPEARING' for a while. although i'm feeling lonely nowadays, being lonesome is way better than lighting up a cigarette, am i wrong?

i used to do a lot of stuff in my daily routine, now i'm really miserable: i can't do anything, like playing guitar? are you crazy? that seems like maths now (literally my motivation died),
i'm just walking around the house reading about this (i'm on page 46 on  Allen Carr's book), watching videos and keeping myself busy with anything i can do.

one more thing, i didn't tell anyone about this, not my family or friends, cause i don't wanna create more pressure on myself, do you think i should seek help from a friend?

I appreciate your time and patience for reading this and i'm looking forward to read your ideas about this.

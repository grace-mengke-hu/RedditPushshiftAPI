Anyone else ambivalent about all the vape talk on here?

I get it, vaping, most likely, has far better health outcomes than smoking. The problem is that you're not addressing the underlying nicotine addiction, which is the biggest downside to smoking and a major monkey on your back. Add to this my observation, take it for what it's worth, that the people I know who tried to quit with a vape all ended up both smoking and vaping after, at most, a couple months of smoking cessation. It would be absurd to try to quit smoking crack by instead snorting cocaine, and it is absurd to quit smoking cigarettes with vaping.

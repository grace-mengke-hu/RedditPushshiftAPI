New here, first day of no nicotine.

I've smoked cigarettes for years and every time I quit I make it a decent amount of time. The issue is I never make it past 3 weeks and this time around I can't seem to motivate myself to do it at all. I switched from cigarettes to plastic tipped cigars because they helped a few people I know kick the habit, but it seems like I smoke those pretty abundantly now. Just as bad as the cigarettes. I do *want* to quit extremely bad. I've gone cold turkey before and made it to the three week mark but it took a lot out of me and like I said, I just don't have the motivation to try again. Any thoughts?

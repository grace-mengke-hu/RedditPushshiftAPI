65 days tobacco free. Do the cravings ever stop?

I quit smoking 65 days ago after 9 years. I quit using Bupropion 150mg. Also it has been 65 days since I started my altoids addiction. I still get cravings to smoke and I usually get rid of them by going outside putting in a mint or hanging out with people as they smoke. Do the cravings ever stop and what are some good ways to keep them at bay.

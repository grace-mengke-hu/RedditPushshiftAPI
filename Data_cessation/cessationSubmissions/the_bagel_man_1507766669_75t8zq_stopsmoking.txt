ADHD, can't seem to remember that I'm quitting when the urge kicks in, even on meds. Flipped out on my fiancee for no good reason. Any tips and tricks to help me remember?

Hi everyone. I love reading people's stories and progress reports. It's truly inspiring. However, as the title says, I'm having a real bear of a time simply remembering that I'm trying to quit. I'm on adderall 30mg XR, and it helps me stay focused on practically everything else in my life. Unfortunately cigarettes (especially menthols) just feel really good on stimulants. If you've ever smoked them on MDMA you'd know what I'm talking about. But I KNOW that it's going to kill me if I don't stop. I'm at my wits' end here, as I've been "trying to quit" for like 4 months now. Today I flipped out on my lovely, loving fiancee because of withdrawals, and I'm just so ashamed and embarrassed. I succumbed yet again and bought a pack to calm down.

I've got the easyquit app, but it doesn't do any good when I can't remember to look at it and use the urge-defeater game. Can anyone relate? I really want to move forward but the cycle of stress-smoke-guilt-quit-stress-smoke is so fucking hard to overcome. What else can I try? Looking at pictures of diseased lungs works for a few seconds, but eventually I forget about it and smoke again. Quitting weed was 10000000000 x easier than this.

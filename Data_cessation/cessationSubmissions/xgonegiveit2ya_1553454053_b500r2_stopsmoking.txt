Did anyone try Champix? What are your thoughts?

There is a "nicotine free city"  initiative in my city, so I went for consultation. They prescribed me Champix and told me that some people have been able to quit due to it, that have been smoking for 30+ years. What do you think about it? Have any of you tried it? And if yes, what was your experience with it?

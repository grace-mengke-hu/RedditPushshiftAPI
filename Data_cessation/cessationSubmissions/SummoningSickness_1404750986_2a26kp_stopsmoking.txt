Ever since I found this sub, I wondered if I would ever make a 1 year post

And here I am. If you are still browsing this sub aspiring to quit, just do it. Life is much better on the other side. At one point I didn't think I could make it one day without a cigarette and somehow I went an entire year. Stay strong and keep focused everyone.

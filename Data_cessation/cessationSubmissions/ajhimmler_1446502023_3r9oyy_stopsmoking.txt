3 Months smoke-free today.

Hey everyone. There are a lot of ways to quit smoking, I'm going to share mine. 

I smoked for 10 years. The last 7-8 years about 1/2 pack to 1 pack a day depending on what I was doing. I managed to switch to vaping here and there for a few months at a time but I'd always slide back into smoking when my rig broke down or I ran out of juice or it was late and I was drunk. Until one day I stopped. 

I started waking up after nights out with my chest feeling on fire, coughing up a storm. I was no stranger to the morning coughs smokers get, but this was next level. I knew I had to quit or I'd face life long consequences. I happened to have international travel planned a week or so after I knew I had to quit. I smoked my last cigarette in England, flew to the US where my home is and haven't bought, touched, or smoked a cigarette since. It was very easy for me. 

Why? Well, when you really want to quit, you just quit. I know its cliche and lots of people will argue with me, but I felt the withdrawals, they were really bad the first 3 or 4 days. I just suffered through them. 

The easiest way to quit smoking is to not buy them. If you but them, don't open them. If you open them, definitely don't put one in your mouth. If you put one in your mouth, definitely, at all costs, do not light it. It's really that simple. 

If you want to quit, you will quit. Stop literally this instant if you want to quit. 

I know other people have quit other ways, but this worked for me! Best of luck everyone!

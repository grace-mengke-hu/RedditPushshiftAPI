Its been only 4 days without cigs but

Hello. fellow stoppers. I am 25 yo male smoking for 8 years. I tried to quit lots of times in these 4 months period but i couldn't. Now im on my day 4 thanks to champix. But i had issue with my lips. Its constantly tingling i don't know why. Im thinking maybe it's bcuz of the mints and polo's i've been using to keep my mouth busy but not sure. Is anyone have been through before?

I can’t convince myself to stop - what should be my final straw?

Smoker on and off for 16 years. I’ve quit several times and 9 months ago I started up again. This time I am really struggling to quit. I can’t think of why I should. I feel horrible each morning and want to substitute healthier things in my life but seem to fall back to smoking.  

I know I’m thinking irrational but can’t think of any reason to stop. I’d love to hear anyone’s quick, short stories of actual proof they’ve experienced since they quit. I think that will give me the knowledge I need to stop. 

Thank you in advance.

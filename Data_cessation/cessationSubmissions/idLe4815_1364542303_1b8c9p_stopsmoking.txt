Has anyone else experienced sleeping trouble with patches?

I've only just started using nicotine patches - one day to be honest so I may just be overthinking - I felt fine throughout the day, much better than expected and didn't experience any real cravings, but I haven't been able to sleep or even feel tired. I'm wired to the moon if I'm honest! I haven't used any other medication or consumed alcohol recently so I was wondering if this is a possible side effect I'll have to get used to for now?

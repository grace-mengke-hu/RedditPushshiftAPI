Dissociating spouse from smoking trigger

My husband is a HUGE smoking trigger. Not because he is stressful or anything, but because we smoke together...I guess. I don't know how to word it. 

Basically, I do great almost all day without a cigarette, but the second he gets home the first thing I always do is smoke with him. Now that I want to quit smoking, I'm finding that this is so deeply ingrained in me, that I don't even think about not wanting to smoke when I see him. 

So, have any of you successfully dissociated your spouse from smoking to make it easier?  How did you do it?  Did you retrain the thought?  Reshape your routine to stop the trigger?  

Any advice?  

Thanks.

Craving a cig when drinking?

Hey guys,

So I've quit smoking cold turkey about 6 weeks ago and under normal circumstances, I miss it surprisingly little. However, whenever I am drinking alcohol (which I also cut back) I crave a cigarette after my first drink.

I'm not sure if it is just a habit or I feel more like I need one when I'm drinking (used to smoke a lot when drunk) or what else it could be, but I don't know how to handle it.

I told my friends I quit so they wouldn't give me any if I'd ask, but it gets hard after a few drinks when everybody is going for a smoke break.

How do you handle this? Does this get any better? 

Thanks!

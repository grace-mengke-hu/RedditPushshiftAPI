I want and will quit smoking

I'm a heavy smoker of over 8 years (1-1.5 packs a day). I need, want and will quit this nasty habit for:

* My health: I don't want to die of cancer/stroke, I hate smelling like an ashtray all the time, I hate having no stamina, yellow teeth. 

* My finances: saving money on years of no smoking that I can spend on myself and things that really matter.

* I'm a quitter, so let me quit this nasty habit =) joking aside I want to feel a sense of accomplishment, not being the one who never finishes a thing.

Wish me luck and I hope you are all doing good and staying strong. To a healthier life!

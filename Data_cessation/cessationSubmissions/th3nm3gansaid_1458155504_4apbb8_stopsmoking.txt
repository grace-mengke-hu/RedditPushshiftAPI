Day 0

I almost had 100 days completely nicotine free but I smoked on Sunday. I'm already back to smoking how I was before. I'm feeling really pissed off at myself that I let this happen. That was my first time ever quitting smoking and I guess I got a little bit cocky if I'm being honest. I want to quit again but I honestly love cigarettes. But I also know how great I felt not smoking. Any advice?

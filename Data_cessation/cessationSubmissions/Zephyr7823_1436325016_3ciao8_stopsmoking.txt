Story Time: Independence Day Cessation

So I'm trying to quit again. This time kind of caught me by surprise, which is good, I think. 

On the Fourth of July I went to a friend's house for the festivities. Just before arriving, around 7pm, I stopped at quick trip and bought a pack of cigarettes. Before this point I had smoked maybe ten cigarettes at work, and by 1am, the entire pack was gone (as well as two 30 packs of light beer and a fifth of rum, but those aren't relevant:).

Needless to say, I didn't feel 100% the next morning, and as a result, I was running late for work, and so decided not to stop and get a pack. Originally I figured I'd go out and buy one on my lunch break, but I was still hungover, so I decided again to avoid the trip and the cost. 

At the end of the day, I had recovered almost completely from the previous night's frivolity, and looking back on the day, was pretty happy with it. I was proud of myself; I had only smoked a handful of cigarettes, which I bummed from co-workers, and the pace of my work helped me keep my mind off the cravings. So I decided not to get a pack on my way home. So that marked the first day in almost a year that I didn't buy a pack of cigarettes.

Since then I've stopped buying cigarettes, and today, since I don't work, and therefore can't bum from my co-workers, will be my first day since my last attempt that I didn't smoke a single cigarette. It's been uncomfortable and boring and a little stressful, and I've been eating and fidgeting and hawking up black shit all day, and I honked perhaps a bit too aggressively at a fellow motorist, but I feel I'm doing well. And somewhere between waking up and posting this I think I decided to commit to it.

So, fingers crossed.

One Week In, Hitting a Rough Patch Right This Minute

"Hell Week" was a breeze. I swatted away my nic urges as if they were houseflies. All that's left is the "head work", yeah? Ah, but tonight... tonight I'm really really missing it. Like, it's almost like being in mourning or something. 

I mean, I'm not going to smoke tonight, I've got too much at stake to backslide now. But DAMN! I'm feeling hopeless at the prospect of never again lighting up, sitting back and relaxing...

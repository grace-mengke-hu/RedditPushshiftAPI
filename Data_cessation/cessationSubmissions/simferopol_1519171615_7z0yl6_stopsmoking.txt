Horrible mood swings - Day 11 - Please Help

I feel absolutely terrible. I haven't been able to do anything productive other than eating healthy and going to the gym 4 times in the past 11 days since I quit smoking. I've been experiencing crazy mood swings. Today they got bad. I try to think positively but the thoughts of suicide are a bitch. 

I can't concentrate on tasks to do productive things; I don't have the energy to go to find a job; I feel restless all the time; i mostly feel depressed and angry at everyone; ill eat an apple and feel good for a minute only to start to feel like absolute shit 10 minutes later. I feel pretty hopeless. What's the point of living if I can't use my brain to complete tasks that i want to complete?  

I was hoping my diagnoses in 2015 for ADHD was just a misdiagnosis and it was self-inflicted with heavy weed and moderate cigarette consumption. Now im not sure. Im male in my mid 20s; living with my parents; just feel like absolute shit. I'm sorry, i too hate my self-loathing;

Please tell me it will get better.

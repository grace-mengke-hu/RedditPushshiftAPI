6th day and having trouble. This weekend will put me in social situation where it will be harder.

I developed a sore throat 8 days ago (last Saturday, when I was a smoker) and had a cigarette before bed. The next morning and for the next few days my throat was so sore I didn't feel like smoking.

Yesterday (5 days of no smoking), I finally felt well enough to smoke, and was going to light up, but I thought "It's been 5 days already, just quit."

I'm trying to go all-in here. I downloaded an android app "Smoke Free, stop smoking help" by David Crane. I paid the $5 to upgrade the app. The app recommended this subreddit.

Yesterday was really hard. I just woke up and it's only 5AM and **today** is already hard. The worst part is that tonight I leave for a trip to the lake with some buddies. Some smoke, some don't. We do this trip every year and there's not much to do besides smoke and drink beer. That's the idea. I just know I'm going to try to bum cigarettes off of somebody.

What can I do? Should I get some nicotine replacement product? Canceling the trip is off the table. Please help.

2 weeks w/o smoking and feeling so good!

so I’ve been smoking pretty consistently since I started college about 2 years ago. unfortunately, peer pressure worked and I have regretted that decision ever since. I’ve tried to stop numerous times but, as we all know, it’s so hard to find the willpower. I kept making excuses about not wanting to study with any withdrawal symptoms and therefore continued. 

I decided a few months ago that I was going to study abroad for 6 weeks. At the same time, I also decided I would stop smoking because I didn’t want to deal with it and it would be a good way to stop while out of my old environment. 

The 9 hour plane ride was uncomfortable, but doable. Then, I was so busy and jet lagged I didn’t have time to really think about it. I noticed some withdrawal symptoms, but I slept so much the first few days I got through it. I was with someone who didn’t know I smoked so that helped keep me in check as well. 

Now, it’s been 2 weeks officially without any nicotine and I’m feeling great! I still get cravings every now and again, but instead of every hour like at the beginning, it’s once a day when I see someone smoking. While I wish I would’ve done this sooner, I’m proud of myself for doing it at all and hopefully I’ll be able to keep it up when I get back :)

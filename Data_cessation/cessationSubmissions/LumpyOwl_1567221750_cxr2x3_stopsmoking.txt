Vertigo

I wanted to see if I could get some input on something. I smoked for 38 years and quit cold-turkey 57 days ago. I feel pretty good but I constantly have a dizziness or vertigo when I move around. The first week I had terrible vertigo. I couldn't drive for 3 or 4 days. Then it improved enough that I could drive again but I was stumbling a bit like an intoxicated person. It has definitely improved. I'm not running into walls as much. But I noticed the severity of dizziness kind of varies from day to day, some days better than others. Is this just a normal part of withdrawals? Did anyone else go through this vertigo stuff? Did it finally go away? I'm not going to smoke, I'm done with that, but wow this is annoying.

My biggest trigger is other people. Help?

The last time i quit, i had it easy. I was living alone, and the only person i was spending a lot of time with was a new found girlfriend who hated cigarettes. I completely know i'm capable of quitting, but this time it's different. My roommates smoke. My friends smoke. My coworkers smoke. How do i break away from the smoking club?

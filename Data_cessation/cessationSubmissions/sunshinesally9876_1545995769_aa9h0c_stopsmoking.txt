40 days smoke free!! Using NRT but want to quit nicotine in New Year.

I am 40 days smoke free and have had some ups and downs. I quit at a time I knew would be stressful for me, the lead up to Christmas and the social aspect of the Christmas period. But I am using NRT, with some negativity from the pro cold turkey members. My aim has always been to quit the smokes and then the nicotine. I have actually been surprised that I have managed with less nicotine then I thought I would need. I was a pack a day smoker for 20+ years. I am currently using a 21mg patch cut in half for about 12 hours a day ( after talking with my doctor) and no more than 5  2mg lozenges a day. I want to reduce my NRT nicotine from the 1st January but donâ€™t want to risk a relapse. I am trying to decide if I stop using the patch or lozenges first? Any thoughts?

I know cold turkey is the quickest way! But I have had numerous fails in the past and at the moment I am happy with my progress using NRT but that old fear attributed to the loss of nicotine is still very real, even if I am feeling more confident this time around.

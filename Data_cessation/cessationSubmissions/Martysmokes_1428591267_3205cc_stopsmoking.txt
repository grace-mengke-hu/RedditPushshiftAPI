I'm ready to be done

I've allowed myself to make excuses and continue to smoke. I'm only 20, but I know if I continue any more I will be cursed with this habit for life. I've integrated smoking into several facets of my life including my reddit username for God's sake. All of my friends and some of my family smoke so its going to be tough resisting the initial temptation. How did you go about reducing cravings? I want to buy Allen Carr's easy way to quit but I'm a broke college student so I'll see if I can get a .pdf of it or something. I just need support seeing as I dont really live around my good friends and family to help me with this.

Procrastination Crutch

Hi everyone! I'm new, but I wanted to reach out to see if you could provide some advice. 

I've been reading easyway by allen carr. I am really determined to quit smoking, and he talks about reversing the brainwashing. 

For me, I really agree that smoking does nothing for me - it doesn't help my concentration, relaxtion, it's not a social help etc etc. BUT one thing that's not resonating with me is the procrastination factor. 

I use smoking to procrastinate - it's a great excuse to walk away from work. Procrastinating in itself is bad, but I think we all do it to some extent. If I am going to keep procrastinating, I'd obviously like to do it another way. It's just that I know smoking is a great procrastinator, and knowing this, it makes me feel like I'm being deprived of something when I can't have it. 

Does anyone have any advice? Did any of you wonderful non-smokers out there used to use smoking as a procrastination? How did you handle it? I'd love your help!

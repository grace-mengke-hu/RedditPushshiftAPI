Slipped one, didn't enjoy it, feeling like crap

Hello everyone, so I made an attempt to quit 4 days ago, everything was going fine but this morning a friend of mine handed me a cig and I couldn't resist and smoked it.

I am SO MAD at myself, I messed up my 4 days of not smoking and I only had mild cravings in the process...

Anyway, while smoking the cigarette, I noticed that I didn't enjoy it. My heart started beating like crazy after returning to normal for 4 days and it only caused more stress. It killed my "vibe". I love feeling normal, I love smelling/tasting/breathing normally but stupid me couldn't resist saying no to that cigarette.

I lost a lot of confidence. How am I going to prevent this from happening again? I am lost, please help. Thanks.

I fucked up

My husband and I have been fighting all morning for reasons unrelated to my quit. However, he is a smoker, so it's really hard to deal with an emotional trigger while watching someone else puff away. So I broke down and lit a cigarette. That's all. Just the one drag to light and then my quit flashed before my eyes and I put it out immediately. 

But its too late. That one puff was enough. I've been sitting here for the last hour in tears, with an unlit cigarette, going through that internal struggle all over again. The squirrels are back in my brain. I'm rationalizing that since I already reset it all, I might as well just smoke one. But then I tell myself that that type of thinking is going to cause a full blown relapse. Back and forth. Back and forth. The monster got me. :(

God damn it, guys. Fuck. Anyone reading this who has doubts. DO NOT TAKE ONE PUFF. Its a worse hell then the original quit. Jesus Christ I have to do all this again.

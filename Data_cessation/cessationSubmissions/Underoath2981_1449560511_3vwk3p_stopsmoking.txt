Anyone listen to rap?

I've been listening to logics first album lately since I never did when it first came out. If you like rap I'd recommend giving it a go. 

There's a song on the album called d Nikki that's all about his relationship with nicotine and I've always thought it's fantastic, best song on the album. In my opinion.

Day 1... Again

So, my fourth earnest attempt to quit. I've smoked from 17 to 36 and I can no longer justify this habit. 
My biggest hurdle from previous attempts has always been alcohol. Willpower gone during first drink so my remaining summer will be dry(a necessary sacrifice). 
I found this community a few weeks ago and it's really helped me build up a genuine head of steam to do this.
So two questions:
1. What advice would you give around social events,parties nights out to keep willpower strong?

2 I notice alot of people using apps to track progress, can you recommend a good one?

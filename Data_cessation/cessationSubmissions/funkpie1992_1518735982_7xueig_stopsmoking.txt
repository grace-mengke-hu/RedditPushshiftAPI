Withdrawal

Hi folks!

I'm a mid twenties male quitting seriously for the second time (first I lasted 3 months till drink and stress hit). Since then I've smoked a pack or so each day for about a year 

I'm on day 6 of quitting now and although it's been harder than ever I am going cold turkey. No nicotine, no caffeine what so ever!

My only issue is, while in work on day 4 I noticed I was getting strange headaches, sweats and couldn't think or talk straight. It felt like my mind was a washing machine on the spin cycle all day.

Is this withdrawal from the nasty addiction? Will it last does anyone think? Haven't been in work since, but am in tomorrow and I'm worried.

Thanks guys, stay strong everyone!

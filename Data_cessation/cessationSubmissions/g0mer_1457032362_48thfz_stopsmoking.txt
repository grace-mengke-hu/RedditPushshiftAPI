Another milestone achieved!

Finally made it to 4 years free of cigarettes!  I have had successful stints of sobriety mixed in as well just for health purposes and I feel the methods I learned from quitting really helped.  

To the people just starting out, read Carr's book and trust that you will make it through - every day gets easier.

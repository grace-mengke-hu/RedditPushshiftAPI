Save the money you would otherwise smoke away

Estimate the amount spend on tobacco every week. Figure out how much you'd spend per year. Put a jar on your desk and watch your savings grow. In a year spend it with gusto on something you wanted to buy for a long time - be it a musical instrument, a new bike, a trip abroad. Come to think of it, you could also donate the amount to a charity of your choice. Repeat the following year. The next time you hear that lame ["where's your Ferrari?"](http://imgur.com/84NSeO5) joke, you'll know where your personal "Ferrari" is.

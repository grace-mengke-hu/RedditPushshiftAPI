Where the hell do crappy thoughts like this come from?

Yesterday just out of the blue my mind came to the conclusion that buying a pack of cigarettes would be a good idea. It just came from nowhere and stuck around all afternoon. I really though I had got to the stage where I was past things like this. Today the thought is completely gone but it worries me that it can just turn up unannounced like that.

I am so glad that I didn't give in and don't think I was even close to doing so, but it just sux that at nearly 3 months my brain can just betray me like that!

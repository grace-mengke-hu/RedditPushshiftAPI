Third Day Smoke free, feeling really Groggy

I had a full night's rest last night, woke up well. I am in the middle of my work day and I feel as if i've taken some NyQuil, and i cant seem to shake this off. I had some cold water, some coffee. I am sure this is due to some type of withdrawal, but can anybody explain to me what is happening? I think if i have a better understanding of what my body is doing I wouldn't be so freaked out.

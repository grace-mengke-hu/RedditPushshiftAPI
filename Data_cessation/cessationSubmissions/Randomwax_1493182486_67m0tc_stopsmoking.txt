Anxiet attacks returned since quitting.

Hi guys, 
I'm on day 8 cigarette free - still using a patch and vaping though. 

I've started having panic attacks again since quitting. Is this normal at all? Will they stop? It's making want to just give in. 

I'm on holiday at the moment but have to go back to class on Monday and not sure I can in this state. But I need to stay strong. Help? :'(

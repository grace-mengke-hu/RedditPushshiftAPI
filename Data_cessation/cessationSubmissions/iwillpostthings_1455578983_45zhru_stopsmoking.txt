Im having trouble quitting

I hate the fact that I smoke. I hate the smell, how much it costs, how it affects other people and my family. I still cant quit. I throw away my pack at the end of the day disgusted with myself and buy one again in the morning. Ive been wasting my money and any sense of belief in myself.

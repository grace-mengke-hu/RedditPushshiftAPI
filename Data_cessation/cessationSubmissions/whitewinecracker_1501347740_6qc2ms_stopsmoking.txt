38 days, tomorrow never comes until it's too late.

This week my mood has been somewhat volatile and  I have considered smoking again. Right now I'm concerned that I will buy cigarettes tomorrow when I go to the shop. If it wasn't for my Achilles injury, I would probably go right now.  I know smoking won't solve my irritability or my slight boredom, but it still seems appealing to me.

Almost a month down!

Four weeks of not smoking! 400 cigarettes not smoked! That's crazy. I'm feeling pretty stoked about my progress. I made it through hurricane Irma threatening us while my wife was 9 months pregnant without a smoke. That feels pretty great. And when I look at my newborn son, I tell myself that he will never smell smoke on his father's breath. 
The cake is a lie.

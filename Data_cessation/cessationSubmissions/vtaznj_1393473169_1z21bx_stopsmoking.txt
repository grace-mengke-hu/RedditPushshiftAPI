Day one with the help of Klonopin 1mg

I went to the doctors yesterday and told her I wanted to quit. I had tried pretty much everything else. Chantix made me feel insane and had weirdo dreams, and the patch kinda hurt when I would wear it. The gum I didn't like because it burned my throat. So he suggested a mild anti anxiety to get me through the withdrawals. I woke up today and took one and felt a little loopy, but not exactly tired. I have been thinking about cigarettes today because it's the quit day and all, but I think the klonopin has distracted me enough to not have any serious cravings. 

I want to make my body healthy and get back into shape. There is no way I'll ever become a runner if I continue to smoke cigarettes. Wish me luck! Also, I will not be telling any of my friends about my quit because I feel like they are always rather negative when I say I want to quit.

Need some support...

I'm 32 years old, and have smoked from 18 to 30. I quit when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter. It was the best motivation! And I knew I didn't want to be a mom who smoked. My dad was a heavy smoker, and I think that was a big part of my addiction.

 Unfortunately, I duped myself into thinking I could smoke one cigarette and not be hooked again. So dumb. I have been smoking for the last 3 months, and find it just as hard to quit as ever. My daughter is one now, I went almost 2 years without a smoke.

I don't really know what I'm asking for, just needed to put it out there. I don't have any cigarettes now, and aim to keep it that way. I'm already feeling inspired by all the success I'm seeing here!

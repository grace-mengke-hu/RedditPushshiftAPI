Was I actually addicted?

Okay so as you can see my badge says it's been 5 days.  My boyfriend & I had planned to quit as our new years resolution so I bought us e-cigs(safe to say it's working much better for me than it is for him).  I have been smoking since I was about 16(now 25), sometimes heavier than others but never a pack a day.  For the past year or so I was down to about 5 or less a day.  So from Thursday to Saturday I went a complete 48 hours without a cig then had one just to have one.  Then I went another 24 hours without one & was fine.  No irritability, no random rages, nothing.  I think what I realized is that as long as I don't have one until the evening I will not have any cravings during the day.  Maybe I've just been a "social smoker" the whole time but never realized it.  Am I the only one this has happened to?

What's your favourite benefit of quitting?

Mine is that I *finally* feel like I have my health/lungs back. I was a very heavy smoker and it took a long time for the damage to heal but as of about 6 months ago when I started properly exercising I finally feel like my lungs are fully repaired.

What's your favourite thing?

What was your “moment?”

23 days in, just discovered this whole Reddit thread this morning. Generally my mornings have been spent consuming some sort of anti-smoking website with a cup of coffee each day, and that seems to help get thru the challenging mornings. Day by day, I hate waking up less and less, which as you know is all consuming when you first quit. But one thing I can’t really find in my Googling, so I pose this question to you:

What and when was your “ohhh, I got it now” moment? Meaning, what occurred (and how many days/weeks/months into your quit) to make you say “yeah, I got this beat now and it’s finally easy.”

I haven’t really had it yet and think it’ll be a while. But the difference is somehow this time after smoking a packish a day for 21-22 years I’m more resolved. Miserable like any other time, but not trying to talk myself into going to get a pack, so there’s that.

So what was your moment?

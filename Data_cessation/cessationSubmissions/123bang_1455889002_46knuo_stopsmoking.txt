Epigenetics

Hi guys. I think I have finally managed to stop smoking.  It's only been about a week but I think this time is the one (its just like the 10th time, but who counting?). This is why: Allen Carr's Easy Way and Epigenetics. I'm sure you've all heard of the Easy Way method so I won't go into that. I'll just focus on Epigenetics. I listened to a Stuff You Should Know [podcast on Epigenetics](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/can-your-grandfathers-diet-shorten-your-life/) which really hit home for me. Simply put it has convinced me that I am a custodian of body and my gene pool. What I eat, smoke and drink will change me genetically, and impact on the health of my grandkids! I have always thought that what I put into my body only effects me, but not any more.


I hope an introduction to this new field of biology might help someone else live a healthier, more productive life. Good luck to everyone fighting the good fight and thanks for the supportive subreddit.


PS. Also check out the [Ghost in your genes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XzxNGkZsbI) documentary.

Did you ever do the old "throw your pack away and then dig it out of the trash an hour later" thing?

I cant recall how many times I said I was going to quit and then threw my smokes away in the garbage, only to sift through the can a short time later so I could have another smoke. It's really embarrassing when you throw away your pack in the trash outside at work and can't leave the office to get more cigs. You go into secret-agent mode and grab your pack from the can without people noticing you are digging through the garbage--and you come up with some lame excuse why you are riffling through trash encase you get caught. 

Addiction is awful. Glad I will never do that again.

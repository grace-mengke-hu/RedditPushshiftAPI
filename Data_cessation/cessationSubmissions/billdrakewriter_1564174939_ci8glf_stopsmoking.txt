New Facts That Ought To Help Motivate Anyone

Hi - I'm a writer living in Portland, Oregon. I've been on the trail of the Tobacco Cartel for a while, and last Fall I was able to get a number of their popular brands tested, looking specifically for insecticides and fungicides as well as banned pesticides like DDT. We found enough to give any smoker a brand new set of reasons to quit, and hard evidence facts that will affect their quitting. I've just written an ebook detailing these results and offering some analysis. The title is "Smoke No Evil" and I'm allowed to offer a limited number of free download links to Apple iTunes review copies. I will need an email from you for Apple to send the review copy, but otherwise this isn't a sales trick and you won't go on any list. Thanks - Bill

Day 1 Begins Now

Smoking my last cigarette, and I am going to hit "submit" on this post during my last puff. Have tried to quit before, with vaping, and cold turkey...neither worked. Trying Nicorette lozenges this time, at least to ease the first few days. Anybody else use Nicorette before? Any advice at all. I've always listened to music while I smoke, and I'd like to listen to some music that will make me NOT want to smoke. Any music suggestions?

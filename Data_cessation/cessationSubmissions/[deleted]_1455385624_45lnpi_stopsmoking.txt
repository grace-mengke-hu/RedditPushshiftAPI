Day 6! Physical withdrawal fading.

God I'm so close I can taste it. My chest just gets so tight it's almost unbearable. Hasn't been happening so much today! And I have my focus back. Bought roses for my lady and guess what, they smell!

One more day and I'm free from the addiction. I just know it.

So happy with myself. I didn't believe I could ever do this.

Nicotine effets on serotonin receptors

I've read that nicotine fucked up our serotonin receptors, and makes smokers in fact sadder and more anxious.

That's might be why the suicidal rate in the smoking population is higher than in non smoking population.

That's funny, because we usually smoke because we think it helps us, makes us happy, less anxious. In fact it's the opposite. 


"According to research at the University of Dundee, smoking appears to cause physical changes in the brain that inhibit serotonin production over a prolonged period. The actual intake of nicotine, however, quickly stimulates serotonin production, but only in the short-term -- as increased serotonin levels only last as long as the cigarette is being smoked. The irony, explained Dundee professor David Balfour, who led the study, is that smokers believe cigarettes provide a sense of calm, when in fact smoking only provides temporary relief from the anxiety caused by smoking in the first place."

And I guess that's also why we can feel so depressed/anxious during the first few days when we quit, it's because we have a real lack of serotonin. But fortunately the body fixes that quickly.
Moreover, meditation and sport have been proved to increase serotonin levels. So go for a run, and meditate!

It might be unrelated, but since I've quit, my anxiety is much lower than before. 

I just wanted to share this with you, maybe it can help someone else than me :-)

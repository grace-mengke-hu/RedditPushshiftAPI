I'm healthier.

It's been a while now since I've had a smoke. My girlfriend tells me my skin looks better already. It "has more colour". 

When I take a deep breath, it feels amazing. That is probably my favourite part of being a quitter.

I guess I also really enjoy not being a slave to the habit. It was definitely annoying how often I would have to abruptly stop what I was doing to go and poison myself.

When I started exercising it helped a lot. I knew if I would stop the one big thing hindering my progress I would be able to excel at a far faster rate.

I miss the habit a lot. I'm definitely the type of person to smoke but it just isn't practical. It definitely helps having a non-smoker girlfriend. Without her I probably wouldn't have made it past 2 days either time.

I'm not writing this because I'm proud of myself, even though I am. I'm writing this because I want ALL of you newly free breathing souls to continue breathing free.

The best part is smelling smokers when they come into my work and realizing just how bad I smelled all of those years to non-smokers.

I'm healthier now. I breathe deeply and can taste my food. Coffee has so much more flavour now. My fingers are no longer stained yellow.

It sucks not having my vice. My way to feel something is helping me cope with all of the stresses of life. But then, it's also pretty gratifying to sit through it and know that I'm not using any vice. That's strength.

relapse after 5 month quit :(

I fucked up and had a cigarette about 4 weeks ago, just brushed it off as a bumb in the road, then about 5 days ago the demon stirred and I was In a shop buying a pack and I have been unable find that motivation to stop again, its crazy how quickly it can  get its claws in again

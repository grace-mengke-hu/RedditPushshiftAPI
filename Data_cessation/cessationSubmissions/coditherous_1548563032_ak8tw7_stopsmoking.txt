What are some good ways to combat cravings while drinking?

I've been a little over 25 days smoke free! I feel tremendously better, and I know I never want to go back and smoke. During these 25 days, I also took a break from drinking. This has been my first weekend drinking again and it's really hard to resist cigs when I'm out. I don't have the urge to buy packs anymore which is awesome, but still find it hard not to want to try to buy one off a friend or strangers. Any advice on how to get past this?

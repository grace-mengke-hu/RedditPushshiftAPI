Question about quitting with E Cigarettes/Evapes

Hey I'm a 20 year old uni student, smoking is slowly taking it's toll on me.
I've recently decided that I want to quit.

I looked into Evapes, a few friends have told me that they are in fact as bad for you as smoking because of the way the nicotine is produced within the oils for the evape.
In australia I don't think you can order oils with nicotine in them, so I would be using oils with flavours to get off nicotine and then quit the habit.

Is the rumour of the evapes true? If so is it true for all oils? Or just those with nicotine within them?
Also is it possible to assist quitting using these things?

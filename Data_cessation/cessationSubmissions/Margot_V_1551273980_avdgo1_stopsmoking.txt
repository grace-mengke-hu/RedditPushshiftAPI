What does it make you never want to go back to smoking again?

Here I am - 3 months, 4 days and 15 hours smoke free. As all you wonderful people said it... it does get easier. I feel great being a non-smoker. My skin is so much better and I rock in the gym. I wish I had stopped sooner but câ€™est la vie.

I still have cravings, albeit less. I can have a coffee in the morning without craving a cigarette ( This daily craving was the worse to go away) and if I am honest, it's mainly when I am out drinking that I really fancy a cigarette. The drunken me got to the point of once asking other smokers for a puff but thankfully they all said no and I shall be forever thankful.

One of the reasons I cannot see myself smoking again it's because I know I will have to quit eventually and I cannot face the horrors of the first three weeks. When I say horrors, I am not exaggerating. I couldn't poo, I felt anxious, I felt angry... It wasn't me for that first 21 days. I hold on to that awful feeling to dear life every time I fancy a smoke.

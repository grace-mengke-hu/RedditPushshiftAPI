Grateful!!!

Thanks to Mr. Allan Carr and his book, today I celebrate 500 days cigarette and nicotine free for the first time in 40 years!! What an awesome feeling to be free of the slavery of nicotine addiction. Can't recommend this book enough. It's not a miracle but learning the truth about my addiction really helped me become a non-smoker. Today I am a confident non-smoker and so grateful to be finally free! Anybody can do this.

Quitting at 22 years old

Hello everyone, 

I've made the decision to quit using all tobacco products as of today, I noticed some weird bumps on my gums which quite honestly scared me shitless. I'm now chewing some nicotine gum and it seems to do the trick, though I'm having regular urges to fire up a death stick. Since I'm in my early 20s I read that I'll probably be as healthy as a nonsmoker in 20 years or so if I stick to it, is this true? Will I have an increased cancer risk all my life or will it go away in a few decades? Let me know, I'd like to assess the damage and prepare accordingly.

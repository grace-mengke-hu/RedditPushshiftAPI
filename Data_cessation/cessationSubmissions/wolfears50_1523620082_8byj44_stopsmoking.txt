Day 19

Yesterday I finally got out of the house, as I’ve been sick for nearly a week. I did a little work in the yard, broke a sweat, and breathed deeply. It made me feel a lot better.

I honestly haven’t had cigarette cravings in over a week as well.  I’m coughing up all kinds of shit, but that can equally be attributed to the flu like cold I think.  My sinuses are opening up as well and I no longer have chronic stuffy nose.  And I can smell.

One thing I’ve done differently this quit as opposed to others in the past is didn’t tell anyone until I was past Day 5. That helped me find the self discipline and resolve to make the change for myself.

I’m so proud of myself.  I’m so grateful to this sub for being a venue to post everyday and knowing that someone else might read and understand what I’m going through and support me. I do not smoke cigarettes.

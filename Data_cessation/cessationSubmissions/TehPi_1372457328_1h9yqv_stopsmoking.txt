On third day of cold turkey

I'm posting here because reading these posts helps me everytime I need more motivation, so perhaps my post will motivate someone else.

I was a smoker for about 7 years, 2 packs a day (and in Canada a pack is 25). I kept telling myself and my friends/gf that I was going to quit smoking "soon" and that I was going to cut back "soon", but never did. Finally the other day I woke up and said OK that's enough and decided to quit right then and there, cold turkey.

I haven't been using any patches, gum or any nicotine replacement, just going cold turkey. The first day was absolute hell, the 2nd day was no fun, but today I don't feel so bad. Everytime I get a craving I go walk accross town and back. My hands and feet seem to have feeling that I haven't had in a long time and my mouth seems strange. I am sort of in a daze right now, blurred vision, not totally "all there", but it seems to be getting better.

Everytime I feel like I'm about to crack I read a post in here, or one of the quit smoking websites I have up until the craving goes away.

Wish me luck :)

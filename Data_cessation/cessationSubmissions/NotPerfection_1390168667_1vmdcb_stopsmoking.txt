Morbidly depressed?! (Not an inspirational or positive post)

So I'm on day 8 here and saying "I'm miserable" doesn't even equate to how I'm feeling.  No, I don't want to work the fuck out.  No, I don't want to drink any goddamned water.  I can't even sleep it off.  I'm sitting on the couch with a gaping hole in my heart and I can't see the reason behind staying quit.

I've already gained 10 pounds in a week (didn't think that was possible BUT IT IS WHEN YOU EAT EVERYTHING), smoking was one of the few things in my life that I liked...  the list of things I enjoy are so fucking small and I'm already a recovering addict.  I can't even drug myself to go to fuck to sleep.  Like, let's quit everything, really.  

I'm having a hard time seeing a point in anything.  I wasn't feeling like this 8 days ago.  I was fucking fine.  Now I'm miserable as fuck, have been on the verge of scream/crying all day.  I'm starving and there's nothing in the house that I want.  I don't want any fucking carrots or fucking goddamned celery.  

Wow.  This sucks and I don't understand why this sucks as hard as it does.  This was the most ridiculous idea I've ever had.

Someone tell me this gets better???  Please?  I am doing this all the fuck alone and am imploding/exploding/dying.  I don't even know.  I hate music right now too which had been helping.  I hate breathing.  I REALLY HATE BREATHING.

TL:DR - **Fuck everything ever in the history of things.**

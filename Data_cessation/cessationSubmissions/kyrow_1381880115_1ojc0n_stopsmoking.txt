Why did you stop smoking?

I smoke roll ups and get my friends travelling to buy me tobbaco at duty free, so thats about Â£5 a week for 15-30 (30 when out drinking) I do have the gross smoker cough that makes my mum sad but I don't feel they are bad enough to stop (famous last words), I would like to stop though, or become a social smoker, but I dont know how I can push myself to care.. also when I had the flu once and couldn't smoke, a few of my friends says the day I stop smoking is the day they will, as I am a pretty prominent and constant smoker.

Started at 13, now 19, on about 20 a day.

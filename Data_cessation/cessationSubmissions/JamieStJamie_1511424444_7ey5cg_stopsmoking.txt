I just want one so bad!

It’s been a month thus far and to celebrate I just want one... it’s so bad I can taste it. The only thought that keeps me going is that as a pack-a-day smoker, I’ve avoided sucking on about 600 or so cigarettes this last month... the thought of my lips being glued to so many cigarettes is appalling, really. I want one so bad but know one is never just one... crazy, I’ve smoked probably more than 100,000 cigarettes in my life time and just want one more! I think not because I know one will turn into 100,000 more! I’m not smoking today even though I want to! Thank you for reading my frustrations, it feels awesome to vent!

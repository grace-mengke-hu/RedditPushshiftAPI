18 days, but do you guys consider this a legit attempt with a vaporiser?

Ok, I tried quitting a couple of months back. Got to at least six weeks smoke free with a vaporiser and now I'm back to it. The only real issue I'm having is that most of my friends raise the argument that it's not really quitting because I'm still getting my nicotine hit. What's your opinion on it?

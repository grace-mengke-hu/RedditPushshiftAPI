One month! (My tip)

I made it a month cold turkey, which is something I didn't think I could do. I think the most important part of this quit has been a difference in the way I approach it. In the same way that people say diets are not as good as lifestyle changes, my quit has been made much better by the fact that I made a ton of other changes in my life.

When I quit smoking I also stopped drinking. I made a New Year's Resolution to be more adult, so that has included waking up earlier every day as opposed to an hour before I'm required to do anything. I'm also working out more often and purchasing adult clothing one article at a time. All of these things has added up to a life where smoking does not seem to fit in anymore.

For everyone thinking about quitting, figure out why you want to quit and build a whole program of changes meant to help you reach your goal. If you want better health, stop smoking and drinking, work out and drink a ton of water. By the time you make it just a week or two, you're living a life that smoking has no place in anymore.

Good luck guys!

tl;dr: Make other changes in your life as you quit smoking so you have other things to feel good about, and you start living a life that smoking no longer fits into

I've been using Gabapentin to mitigate withdrawal symptoms.

I stopped vaping a few days ago (I know, vaping is lighter than smoking, but it's still fucking nicotine addiction) 

I had been heavily addicted to it for three years, so I knew I would encounter severe withdrawal symptoms. I have some Gabapentin for an unrelated issue and I've learned that it is a general purpose drug for addiction treatment. Alcoholics and opioid addicts and others are routinely prescribed it during their withdrawal period. 

Has anyone had success with Gabapentin? I've just taken one because my withdrawal symptoms are beginning to become overbearing.

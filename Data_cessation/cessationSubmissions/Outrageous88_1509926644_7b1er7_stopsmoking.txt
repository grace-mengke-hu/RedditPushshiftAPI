If I can, You can!!!

Hello all! It has been a little over 3 months for me and I keep forgetting to come and check in. I quit on Aug. 1st this year and in the beginning I basically lived in this sub. 

When I was more active here, a lot of people raved about Allen Carr's 'Easy Way to Quit', I am now one of those people.

His words made something click in my brain and while there were hard times, I made it through.

The best advice I have for newer cold turkeys is:

*When you want a fix don't tell yourself that you don't--when you do, instead ask yourself...do I want the financial and health expense, the disgusting stench, the social stigma that comes with smoking* 

That got me through the difficult times. Now when I see someone smoking, or the thought (it is merely a random thought now) crosses my mind, I smile because I successfully kicked nicotine out of my life for good....FINALLY 

Side note, I live with a smoker who smokes inside, so I was/am consistently around it, success comes down to you and you alone! Now it is disgusting to me, and I know I will never go back. 

Stay vigilant and remember not one puff ever!

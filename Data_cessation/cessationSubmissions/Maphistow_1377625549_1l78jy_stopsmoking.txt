1 Week

After a dozen or so attempts at quitting I feel like I've finally broken my habit. I've tried willpower, nicotine patches, substituting with weed (bad idea) and Allen Carr's way. I managed to not smoke for a month last year after reading Carr's book but slowly relapsed after smoking a joint that had weed + tobacco. 

A week ago I was at a 3-day festival, I bought myself 3 30 packs of luckies and smoked them all. When I came home I stole a cig from my mum and smoked my last cig; leaning out of my window, like I did when I was 16. At the time I didn't want to have the cigarette smoke in my room because my mum wasn't supposed to know I smoked. I thought it'd be funny to end this nearly the same way I started this; in secret and stealthily.

Last week has been ridiculously easy, the first 3 days I had some nicotine withdrawal, but positive thinking and a few beers kept me good. Now I don't have any cravings anymore, physically and emotionally.

I've actually forced myself to go out every day to bars and parties, full of smokers, as a way to confront myself. Strangely I just don't need it anymore, even when I was drinking heavily I simply didn't have the urge to smoke; just the smell alone was enough to turn me off. I've only had 3 drags from a cig which I didn't inhale because I really wanted to blow smoke circles.

I'm afraid that in week or so I'm going to get hit by my habbit again because he feels like I'm getting of to easily. But I'll be ready for him, whether he comes for me tomorrow, next week or after a year I'm going to stay strong. Using a quit smoking app and browsing this reddit makes me feel really confident.

I want to thank you guys for supporting each other, I'm definitely going to stay active here for the foreseeable future. I really think this is a great reddit and I'm sure that without ya'll this attempt would be so much harder. Greets from Holland and stay strong guys.

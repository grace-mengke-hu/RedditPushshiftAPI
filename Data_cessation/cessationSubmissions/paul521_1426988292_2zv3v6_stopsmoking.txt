A story of warning

First off, I smoked for 19 years and have been smoke free for 400+ days. I will never smoke another cigarette in my life. Today, my brother who was smoke free for 8+ years just admitted to me that he's been smoking again for the past few months. I couldn't believe what I was reading. It broke my heart. He's been unemployed for a long time now and has no girlfriend. These were his excuses, which are bullshit. In a fleeting moment of desperation he found a pack of cigarettes in his car (probably from one of his idiot friends) and smoked one. And now he's a full time smoker again. That's all it takes people. One fucking cigarette and you're back to square one. I feel bad for his situation but what the fuck does smoking solve? Nothing, it makes everything worse. He's going to keep feeling sorry for himself and will continue to smoke. I'm so upset over this. Please let this be a warning to all of us that even after a significant number of years free from nicotine all it takes is one cigarette to pull you back into its slavery.

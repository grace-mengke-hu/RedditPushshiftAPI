ALMOST un-quit

But i didnt!  Tuesday, my sister was smoking outside of the bar, and my willpower was very very low.   I asked her for some of hers, and she said no several times before agreeing i could have "ONE DRAG"

Instead i bit my tongue, very hard.  it helped, a little.

Today is day 12. 

This is an unpleasant task.

Does anyone have any suggestions on keeping it up?  Do you use nicotine therapies?  I'm going cold turkey, and its just.... the worst some days!

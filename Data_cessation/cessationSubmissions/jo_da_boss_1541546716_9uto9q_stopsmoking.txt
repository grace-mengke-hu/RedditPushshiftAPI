Could use a little support at almost 500 days...

I posted here a few weeks ago about the fall weather setting off some cravings but man they're still here!

A year a four months, zero nicotine, and I've had some heavy craving here for several days in a row and they keep coming back. They're no where near as strong as when I first quit but they sure are persistent.

I'm having some personal issues, stress and all that, plus I'm living in an area I did a few years ago when I used to smoke. The combo of my old neighborhood, the gloomy weather, and some personal stress, it's all adding up. Many times I day I find myself dreaming of a smoke. I know I cannot have one, not even one puff, but my mind keeps going there. I know if I push through they'll go away, and I know if I give in I'll never be free of this demon.

I don't want to smoke. I love living as a non-smoker. No ball and chain. No stink. My wallet is heaver and I breath 1000x easier. I don't have to brush my teeth and wash my hands and change my clothes before I go out, even though after all that crap I'd still smell. I don't miss hocking up phlegm every morning. I will not smoke. Not one puff. I hope everyone out there tonight stays strong. We don't need this stupid drug, it's a waste and it's gross and it's poison and it kills all it ensnares.

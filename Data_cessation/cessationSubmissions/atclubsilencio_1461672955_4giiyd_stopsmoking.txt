MADDDD cravings going into day 2

There's a pack sitting right out in the living room and I'm so tempted to light one up and just have a couple puffs. But I know it wouldn't be 'just one' but my lord this is hard. I also have a physical today and due to my ptsd from certain childhood issues it's already triggering me as I don't want some man, doctor or otherwise, feeling up my body. Maybe I'm overreacting but ughh, I know the benefits are great and I have my e-cig but I just want one. Must. stay. strong.

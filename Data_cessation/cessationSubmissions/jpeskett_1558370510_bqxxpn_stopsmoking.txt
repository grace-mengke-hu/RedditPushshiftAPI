Day 3

The first two days were easy but today now that I’m at work it is absolute torture. I only smoked 1/4-1/2 pack a day, but it has been my secret little guilty pleasure/me time... for about 25 years. anyway I don’t have a little secret treat anymore and feel like I need to replace it or I might start climbing the walls. I’m doing headspace, the easy way to quit smoking... any other ideas? Support? Tell me it gets easier?

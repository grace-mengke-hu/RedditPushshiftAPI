About to make the leap & put an end to my smoking...

Hi,

I tried to quit a week or so ago, & it didn't go well- I picked it back up after 4 or 5 days & have been smoking more than usual since for some reason. I'm afraid of when I'll run out & have spent more than I can afford on smokes as a result of this fear. I'll be short on grocery money now & will be limited to Ramen for the remainder of the month- & I have no one to blame but myself.

I've got a pack & a half left & at the rate I'm going it'll probably be gone by tomorrow noon. I know I need to slow down to make them last, but my anxiety is high in anticipation of the end & my urges are terribly high. I'd like to quit before I run out, but I don't know if I'll be able to pull that off.

I have patches, but when I used them last time I quit, I put on 2 & still had cravings. I'm planning to be prepared to suffer more this time & want to limit their usage to 1 at a time this time so they last.

I feel like I'm being forced to jump off a cliff.

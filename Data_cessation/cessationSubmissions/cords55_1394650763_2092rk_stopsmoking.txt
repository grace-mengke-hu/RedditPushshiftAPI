When did the irritability stop?

I am sure this has been asked to death but the reddit search function is terrible especially on the phone. But I have tried patches and I get down to the seven mg feeling fine but after I stop completely about half way through the day I want to stab my coworkers for having the audacity to speak to me. This usually ends up with me buying a pack and starting again. I am trying the mints now because you can have lower dosages, but am I just putting off the inevitable? Is that irritability stage some thing that I am just going to have to deal with?

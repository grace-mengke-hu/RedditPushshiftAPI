Something I haven't felt in a while

Yesterday my roommate sent me a text that was supposed to be funny about how he actually puts nicotine patches on me in my sleep and that I should smoke to prevent myself from feeling bad. Where I normally laugh having been tobacco and  nicotine free for two months I got really pissed off. Since then all I have wanted was a cigarette; the smell in a parking garage gave me the shivers and my brain begged me to ask for one (I didn't). I'm under a lot of stress, about two week away from graduating college and leaving a cooperatively run restaurant which has been my family for three years. Has anyone else experienced this sudden desire after not feeling it for a long time?

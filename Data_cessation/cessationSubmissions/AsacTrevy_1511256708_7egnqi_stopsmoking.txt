Might’ve caved tonight, not sure if this counts

I hit an e-cig tonight when I was intoxicated. I didn’t feel like this was cheating when I did it, but I want to be off of nicotine entirely. I know in my mind that no matter how intoxicated I am I will never smoke a cigarette again, but I felt like I caved tonight. Any comments would be appreciated.

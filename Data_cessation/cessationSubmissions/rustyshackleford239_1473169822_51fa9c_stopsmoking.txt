First day deciding not to smoke after almost ten years.

Body has been feeling like shit and I get out of breath far too easily. The money I spend is like a leak in my wallet that I don't patch up. ITS TIME TO QUIT. I only had one after breakfast yesterday then was fine the rest of the day and night. Sadly that's the longest I had gone without a cig in years. Today is my first day back at work where I usually smoke the most and will be the real challenge. If I can get through today it'll be a huge step!

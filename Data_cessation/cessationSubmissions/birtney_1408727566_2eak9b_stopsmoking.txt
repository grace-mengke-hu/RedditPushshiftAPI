Not gonna lie, this sucks. But it can only get better, right? It's not even so much that I want a cigarette (that's a lie), but I'm really craving menthol (I smoked menthols before I quit). I have mentholated cough drops, but I don't want to start using them as a crutch to get through this. Any advice?

Been a couple of weeks of cravings but tonight I am feeling reaaaaal weak and trying my hardest not to cave. I’m going hundy on my vape and snacking on everything in the house. Yesterday was one of the best days for me, but today I’m losing the battle. Gonna try sleep as fast as I can so I can forget about the cravings.

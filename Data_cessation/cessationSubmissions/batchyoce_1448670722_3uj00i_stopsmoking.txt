I only smoke at work, and it's hard to quit.

When I'm not at work, I can't stand them, and I certainly don't crave them, but when I have a half hour break and it takes me 3-4 minutes to eat my lunch, I have 1-2 smokes to fill in time and converse with my colleagues.  
How do I kick this? I really badly crave them at work, but not at home.

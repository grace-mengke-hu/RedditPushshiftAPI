28 days cold turkey after 33 years. Am I *ever* going to notice any difference at all?

I mean, I don't feel anything different aside from that the monkey wants its treat still.  Is it possible that I'm so damaged that quitting now won't make me feel any better, but just prevent me from feeling worse?

I dunno.  Today's my first day of pessimism.

10 weeks smoke free

I’ve been using the patch and today is my first day sans patch. During this time, I’ve had a serious medical problem arise, major challenges at work, my mom suddenly having surgery tomorrow, and several other issue in my life, which if I had known all of this was coming, I wouldn’t have quit when I did. But I’m glad I did because it feels like I can definitely weather the storms that will test my resolve in the future. I mostly lurk around here but y’all have been a big help. I appreciate it and I know we can all be nicotine free. We got this!

Depression or sort of a not knowing in the wake of quitting

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 28 days. I haven't smoked weed in 6 days.

In the void of not smoking I've had waves of depression. I've been an irritable asshole. I've lost my appetite. I've had headaches. It really has been pretty crummy.

I read so much about all kinds of benefits and changes in folks, but I honestly can't say I've felt them thus far.

Any encouragement is greatly appreciated.

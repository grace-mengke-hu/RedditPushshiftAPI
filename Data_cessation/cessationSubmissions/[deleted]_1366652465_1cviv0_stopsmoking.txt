I quit 2 weeks and today I gave in.

I hit 2 weeks today, everything went fine, but in the evening I got into an argument with my parents and for some reason I couldn't take it anymore. I smoked a cigarette. I feel bad about it, it's like I betrayed myself. I even have a pack of nicotine replacers left but I still grabbed a cig instead. I don't know if I'll continue on smoking or try again from here. I don't even know what I got out of it, I'm feeling sick, have a bad taste in my mouth, the stench of smoke is all around me. all that's in my mind right now is a big "FUCK why"

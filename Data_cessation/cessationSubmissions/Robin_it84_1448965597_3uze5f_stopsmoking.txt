Quit smoking and anger.

I believe I tied my smoking to the anger on my family, especially on my mother. We don't get along and unfortunately I live with them. 
They work me up, daily, and I live the smoking as a relief.
My anger seems never go away if I don't smoke when they wind me up.
Quit smoking is already hard (vaping, actually), and gets me nervous, but in this situation is twice harder. 
How can I get over it? Any tips?

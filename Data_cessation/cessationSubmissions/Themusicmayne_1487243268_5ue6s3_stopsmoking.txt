17 days smoke free - it all happened so fast!

Just a word of encouragement for anyone else who's stopped smoking. I quit 17 days ago, and the time has just flown by!

I feel absolutely amazing, and really proud of myself.

YOU CAN DO IT TOO! 

Thanks again to all you guys here, this sub is important and really helps people get their lives back!

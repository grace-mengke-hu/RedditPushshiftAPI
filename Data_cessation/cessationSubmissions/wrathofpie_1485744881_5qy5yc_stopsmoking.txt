Stress Relievers and New Habits to Replace Smoking

Hey everyone. I am closing in on almost 3 months smoke free. I have also been using nicotine gum to reduce the cravings, and so am also closing in on the end of the 12 weeks recommended use. I've been doing really well and am down to only a couple pieces a day. But I have been trying out replacement behaviors for cigarettes, and have yet to find anything that will stick. I am looking for something that will 1) help me feel less stressed in the moment that the stress is occurring and 2) something to keep me occupied around the other smokers and keep me from bumming a smoke. Deep breathing exercises are hit or miss for me, and sometimes stress me out more, and I hate chewing gum (which is why I chose it to cut down my nicotine dosage, haha). I was just wondering what has worked for you all here, and see if there is something I haven't thought of yet.

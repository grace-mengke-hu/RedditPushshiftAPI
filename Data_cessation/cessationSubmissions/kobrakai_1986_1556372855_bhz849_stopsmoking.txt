Day 16: cheeky update

Still going well here. I’ve had two quite vivid dreams this week, which is unusual. I rarely seemed to dream (or remember them so clearly) until recently, so I’m assuming my sleep patterns have improved somewhat. 

Today I went out and bought some running trainers and downloaded the Couch to 5K running app to try and get my heart and lungs working properly again. Went well and I wasn’t quite as knackered as I thought I’d be afterwards. 

Overall a bit chuffed!

Day 7 but I think I need some help

I've gone a week without smoking!  That's kind of amazing, but I'll take it.  It was a rough week, but nothing I couldn't really handle.  However, today, it feels like my willpower is at an all time low.  Part of it is that I don't feel great.  My stomach has been upset for a day, so I'm sure that has something to do with it.

How do I refill my willpower?  It feels like today is worse than Day 2 or 3, just from where my mind is at.  If I'd have had a cigarette or lighter available this morning, I would've smoked for sure.  I'm just a little scared and need some help.

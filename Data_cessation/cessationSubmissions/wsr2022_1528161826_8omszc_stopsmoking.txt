I just made it to double digits and just had an intense craving.

Has anyone experienced this? The first 7 days were hellish and I’ve been cruising through the last 3 days. This evening, about 30 mins ago, I got an intense craving. To the point that I walked to the usual spot that I smoke outside my house. I stood there for a good 2 mins and my mind was telling me how much I miss smoking and to just do it. I don’t even know why it was telling me that when I know damn well that I don’t even have cigarettes anywhere in or close to my house. 

Anyway, I grabbed a bottle of water from my car  and took a few good swigs, then walked back into the house. I did not cave in. It’s just weird. I always blasted through all the cravings I’ve had lately, this last one was just so intense. Anyway I’m good and I am never going back to smoke.

short blog after first week

So, in 5 hours i will not have smoked for one week after 17 years, 30cigs/day.
This is in short the + and - of my first week.

DAY 1

+ by the evening my smell already improved a LOT
+ very few cravings, it seems too easy
- fear of losing motivation

DAY 2

+ food already tastes more intense
+ breathing goes better and sometimes my body forces me to take a very deep intense breath, which really feels nice.
- more cravings, especially before lunch (i used to smoke before eating) and also in the evening. 

DAY 3

+ i eat more (which is a + for me, im very skinny)
+ my hands and feet are tinkeling and it gives a weird sensation
- cravings take longer

DAY 4

- sour throat
- cravings peak between 8 - 10pm
- deep fear to start again
+ i took breakfast (never happened in the last 10 years)
+ my hands are warmer

DAY 5

- sour throat + mouth
- cravings get very hard during the evening
+ breathing keeps getting better
+ i swim without taking breaks after a few lengths
+ cramps during swimming are very short now (i used to have long cramps in my feet when i was still smoking)

DAY 6

+ never thought the mornings would be that easy
+ sour taste in throat getting less
+ deep breathing feels like heaven
- fear of going out tonight and see people smoke

DAY 7

+ proud of myself not to have smoked yesterday
- today i felt very tired even slept in the afternoon
- sour taste came back
+ craving in the evening gets easier to cope with
+ i can keep myself motivated


i want to thank this subreddit and numerous blogs/vlogs throughout the internet which are a good support.
Also Alan Carr thanks a lot for providing the right way of thinking.

good luck to everyone here. i smoked around 200.000 cigs in my life, so if i can quit, anyone can.

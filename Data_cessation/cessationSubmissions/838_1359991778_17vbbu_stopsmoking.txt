Just wanted to say hi

I've been lurking for a bit but TODAY IS THE DAY! After 15 years I am ready to quit. It seems like you guys are a very supportive bunch and I need that. I know there are so many reasons to quit, but that doesn't make it any easier. Right now I am sitting in my cube. It's about 10:20am. I know I am doing the right thing, my brain is telling me to go downstairs to the little mart and buy a pack. I am writing this instead. It is so hard (you all know that though). I am 30 and have been smoking for half my life. The thought makes me sick. 

Just wanted to say Hi and good luck to all of those starting today.

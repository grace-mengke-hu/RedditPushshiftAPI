Day 18. Statistics are my friend!

This is my 18th day of not smoking, cold turkey. (Also 33 of the last 39 days.)

Upon completing today, I will have set the new record for the longest cold-turkey quit I've ever done. My ultimate record (done with the assistance of an e-cig) is 21 and I am not currently far behind.

This year has been challenging. Days into January, I began my 21 day quitting streak. After falling back into smoking, I managed to reduce my smoking to approximately 1-4 cigs a day during the months of May and June. However, a month long trip out of the country roped me back into a 6-8 cigarette per day routine.

On August 4th, I began an 11-day cold turkey streak. After smoking 8 cigarettes over a three day period, I quit for another five days. Then, after smoking the final 12 from the pack over another three day period, I began my current streak; which has lasted longer than I thought to be honest.

Analyzing my smoking habit motivates me to reach new milestones and it also gives me something else to do but smoke. For example, upon completing today, I will have reduced my daily average over a 40 day period to a clean 0.5 cigarettes per day. Does this matter? Not really. But it's nice to create images in my head of the benefits of harm reduction.

Do you have any interesting stats you'd like to share?

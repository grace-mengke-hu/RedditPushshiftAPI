I just quit and will be documenting it all right here in this thread.

The time is 8:15PM US Central time, and I have officially stopped smoking.

I will be coming back here to update as I go along.  I've been a smoker for about 16 years.  Enough is enough.  

I'm very motivated now because...

- I don't want to keep wasting my money on something that makes me worse. 

- I have a girlfriend who I really love and I want to be healthy for her as long as possible. 

- I used to be very energetic and now don't have that energy anymore

- I want that extra time I would kill so I can use it on more productive things.  (5 minutes a day X 20 = 1 hr and 40 minutes of wasted time ruining my health)

As I hit each craving or mental block I will post my thoughts and feelings, and I won't give into them.  I refuse to surrender to those feelings no matter how intense or how hard they are.  I will stomp every craving mentally and become that much stronger with each step.

My hope is that this will help others.  If I can do it. You can too. 

**DAY 1**

- 8:35 PM - Threw away all lighters I don't need them anymore.  Smokers need lighters. I'm not a smoker. 

- 9:45 PM - Went to store. I always smoke when I drive.  It was nice to conquer that. No major urges while driving but now that I am home I have some slight cravings.  It has been about an hour since my last cigarette so that's normal.  

- 10:30 PM - I went to sleep early because I got really tired.

- 1:45 AM - Just got up, always used to smoke when I first got up so the craving is fairly strong.  Feels like my jaw is tightening or something. Not too bad.  

- 2:30 AM decided to eat something.  Afterwards I had a huge craving.  I typically smoke after I eat so this was pretty big but manageable.  I decided to brush my teeth and use some mouthwash right after I ate as it seemed to help when I did that before bed. It helped and I feel pretty good.  But I'm going to take half a benedryl to fall back asleep.  2:30 AM is too early for me to be up. 

**DAY 2**

- 8:30 AM - really didn't sleep well at all.  Not sure if it was because the summer heat, or that I quit, or what...but it was a rough night, and the benedryl didn't kick in till late. 

- 9:30 AM - Slight cravings after breakfast.  It's becoming obvious now to my body that something is missing (read nicotine) so it's a little jittery.  I can handle it.  Some of that jaw tightness has comeback a little so I may chew some gum or brush my teeth again (I like the idea of brushing more than usually just because it's replacing something negative with something positive) 

- 2:30 PM - Really minor cravings every so often.  Slight impulses, but easily mentally overcome, but then I had lunch.  Immediately after eating the cravings picked up heavy.  I have no idea what is is with eating/smoking but there definitely is some sort of neuro connection. I can handle this.  

- 7:30 PM - Took a long nap this afternoon and felt pretty good when I got up.  Slight urges, but nothing that wasn't too bad.

- 8:50 PM - Ate dinner and officially reached the 24hrs mark.  Not as big a desire to smoke after meals as before.  I can feel myself beating this.  Yes at times the urges are strong, but I like to think of them as minor annoying reminders about how much smoking ran my life instead of me running it.  I make the decisions, not nicotine. 

- 11:36 PM - Some fairly strong cravings, but like the ones before they were dealt with.  At one point I went and walked around outside in the area I typically smoked just so I could get used to being out there in a similar fashion without smoking.   The cravings really aren't bad they are twinges and urges, combined with a jaw tightening feeling.  Some linger more than others some are stronger more than others, but they all pass eventually.  I try to put my mind on different things.  Seems to help. 

Found a [nice cessation timeline.](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html)  I would say it's pretty accurate. So right now I'm heading towards the 48hrs point, and I can confirm I can smell things already that I use to not be able to. 

**DAY 3**

- 8:30 AM - Still having some restlessness/ trouble sleeping.  Not too bad, but it still is making it difficult.

- 10:45 AM - No major cravings just ones occasionally.  

- 12:30 PM - Just continued slight urges.  Went outside and walked around for a bit.  I do feel more healthy today though.  I feel like things are clearer in terms of my breathing, and energy level (despite the lack of sleep).
I've also noticed I'm eating a lot more than normal. Which is good because I am sort of underweight. 

- 3:00 PM - Pretty mild today I feel like I'm on the down hill slope now. Just really mild cravings.

- 8:30 PM - Officially crossed the 48hr mark.  But I've noticed cravings have become stronger.  Yet they are still manageable. 

**DAY 4** 

- 12:30AM - Wow. Okay cravings are getting really hard. Probably the most intense I have felt.  Lots of sweating, and irritability, definite cravings to smoke, but I am strong.  They last about 2-3 minutes at a time and are pretty intense.  I only have about 20 more hours till the Nicotine is completely metabolized, and I can tell my body is starting to throw a fit about it.  Gonna drink a lot of water and keep pressing on. 

- 8:00 AM - Feeling pretty good today. Not having the crazy cravings I was having last night, but still sleeping is a little difficult.

- 10:00 AM - Some moderate cravings but easily ignored.

- 12:31 PM  - Occasionally getting a strong craving after lunch.  It's not really as physical discomfort as it is mental at this point.  Feels like something is missing like that missing security blanket kind of feeling.  Cigarettes you are dead to me. I won't take you back.

- 5:00 PM - Things were going fine until I went to the store and got some soda.  That was a HUGE mistake.  One thing I haven't mentioned during this whole journal of quitting is that I also wasn't drinking caffeine.   This might have also been contributing to my restlessness and lack of sleep, but I was feeling really good.  I love soda, and what a mistake it was to have them.   My heart racing went ballistic and my cravings went into overdrive.  Also drinking that one soda felt like I had like 10.   Did some [research about caffeine intake in association with smoking](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9022872) and learned that smokers metabolize caffeine much quicker and that when you take away that synergy your caffeine levels jump DOUBLE.  So that 20oz Dr Pepper... was like drinking 40oz of Dr Pepper. 

**I highly recommend not having caffeine.  Don't make the mistake I did as while I am extremely serious and strong willed this kind of mistake could easily cause someone to fall off.**

- 9:00 PM - Still recovering from the great caffeine mistake. Cravings have subsided, but still they flare up occasionally.   Definitely an increase in appetite and can smell and taste things a lot cleaner.  Hopefully I'll go back to feeling the way I did before the caffeine, because I felt amazing then.  


**DAY 5**

- 8:00 AM - Definitely lost some of the energy spark I had yesterday.  The caffeine really threw off my progress, but I feel a lot cleaner in my energy level, and at times felt just about as good as I did before that critical mistake.  I've noticed that I feel like my sleep is getting better, or that I just have more energy during the day.  At least that's what it feels like.

- 10:00 AM - Well since I've metabolized all the nicotine in my system I can say that I am definitely getting the intense cravings now.  They don't last that long, but they definitely pop up occasionally in the day.  Kind of like a reminder of when you would smoke, coupled with some sweating and uneasiness.   It's definitely not pleasant, but something I've gotten use to handling.  

- 2:00 PM - Took a slight nap because I was up late due to the caffine yesterday, and felt really good when I woke up.  Energy levels are definitely higher.   I'm coughing up mucus quite often... that's not pleasant, but at least it isn't in my lungs anymore.  

- 9:00 PM - Went to dinner, and it was really cool to be out and not smoking outside by myself while waiting for a table.  I didn't order a drink.  After the caffeine disaster yesterday I'm avoiding alcohol too as I'm sure that won't help my situation.  When we left there were a couple people outside smoking and wow could I smell it.  It didn't smell gross, honestly it smelled kinda good, but I've always liked the smell of cigarettes.   It did trigger me slightly but nothing I couldn't handle.  Another day another step.  

**1 WEEK**

- Skipped ahead to the 1 WEEK Mark which was Monday September 8th at 8:15 PM Central.

- Overall I feel much better then I have in a long time.  I definitely eat more, and I do get intense cravings occasionally.  I've also noticed that I am getting depressed/down a lot more than I normally ever do.  Some of this I attribute to a rough couple work weeks / hard time communicating with my girlfriend, but I'm also very sure the no smoking is making normally sad feelings even worse. 

- I have been thinking A LOT about getting a vape when the heavy cravings kick in, but I've already come this far.  It just seems stupid to start something up that puts nicotine back in my system.   Really this is a battle against nicotine itself.  Yes you can change the delivery system for a vape which is healthier, but you really are just transferring the addiction to something else, and ultimately caving into it via another means.  

- I've been sweating a lot, and yes some of that is attributed to the summer heat/humidity, but I'm very certain that the lack of smoking is contributing at this as well.

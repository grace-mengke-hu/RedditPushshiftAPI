So how long until I stop coughing up this mess?

I quit two weeks ago on New Years. It wasn't planned actually. I ran out during a night on the town celebrating, didn't buy any the next day due to having spent too much the night before, then got bad sick on the next day so while laid up I thought why not just stop while I've got a start?

Anyway, while I have noticed the frequency of the perpetual smoker's cough has started to decline, I've been having more and more junk come up with them. How long did it take you guys to get over it?

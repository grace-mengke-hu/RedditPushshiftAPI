Second Hand Smoke Question

My landlord moved in 2 chain smokers. Now they smoke outside around the corner of where my window is. When I turn on the AC every time they smoke I can smell the smoke come into my ac unit. Now since the smoke is mixed with air is it still considered harmful second hand smoke? 

I spoke to them about me smelling the smoke they didn't care and refuse to take a walk when they smoke. I'm basically forced to inhale there second hand smoke. The manager won't do anything either. The only fix is to have them smoke on the side of the house. Even though I'm around the corner somehow the smoke blows around to my side of the house.

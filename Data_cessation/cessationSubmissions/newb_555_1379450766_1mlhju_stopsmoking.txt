Day 1 for me

Day 1 cold turkey. I've quit before so its not as bad and I know I'll get through it..

But what I did want to share was the amount of time on my hands now.  

I used to always be planning for my next smoke in the back of my mind. Always thinking about the next fix or how to go sneak out for a smoke when in a non-smoking place. Or how to ditch my non smoker friends so that I can have a smoke in peace. Or my GF who doesnt like me smoking.

A large amount of my day would be spent thinking of smokes or planning to get them or smoke them. Now there's just silence and a lot less interruptions.

Thanks!

Tried a few times to quit but fooled myself.i

Well since Iâ€™m on vacation now and a dear friend just texted me yesterday that she is in Hospital now with lung cancer I wanted to smoke one over the shock.
Realized how dumb I was and getting serious with quiting this unhealthy, unpleasant habit once and for all.
Wish me luck, and especially her :)

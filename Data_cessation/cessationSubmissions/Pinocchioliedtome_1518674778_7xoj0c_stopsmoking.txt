Day 2 - Painful Brain fog

My head feels like pea soup. I made it to 4 days quitting last week and it felt a little foggy. I broke over the weekend, started again yesterday and the fog is back like nothing else. My vision is almost blurry. This fog is so damn strong, it even blocking out my mood swings and cravings. The moment it lifts, I know they'll come back. 

So long live the fog... 

But seriously, any other tips aside from exercise, sleep, good food, etc. I'm stopping with the gum too, as aspartame only worsens brain fog I hear

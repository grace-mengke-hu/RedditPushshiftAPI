Do you think it is easier to cold quit cigarettes or reduce the daily amount first and go from there?

I lost my grandpa and dad to lung cancer. It is most probable that I have a specific gene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBgB7MbBogA&t=41m26s I smoke the way it is described here) that adds to my addiction. I didn't smoke until I was 23 and then got addicted. Now it has been almost 8 years and I really must quit.

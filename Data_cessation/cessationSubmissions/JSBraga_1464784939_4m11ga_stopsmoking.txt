Reason NOT to smoke number 345023950239239045905023450934059

Nowadays I spend a lot of hours in the library (and yes, I enjoy most of that time - I'm just that kind of person). 21 Days ago, after every single hour I spent here I just HAD to stop what I was doing, go down one or two floors and stay outside with all the other smokers. It was specially annoying when it was raining a lot and we were TOO close to one another to be confortable. Those were some of the times that I felt I was no better than a junkie, an addicted person.

Today I've been here, at my university's library for three hours now. I got tired and I just started roaming around the building, checking random books just to relax my head. I just realized that by now I would be outside smoking my 3rd cig since I started studying and writing my paper. But I don't feel like going outside right now... so I won't... and I certainly don't want to have a cigarette. That feels so weirdly... good.

Even if I get cravings some times, I just started to fear the death sticks way too much by now. And today I just realize I'm even starting to not think of them at all for hours!

I know this journey will be a lifetime of controlling myself during certain moments, but these 21 days without smoke and starting a new life without thinking a lot about those little shits seem a giant victory for me so far.

I really thank this community. A lot. I don't think I could have done ~~with~~ it without your support, you amazing and beautiful people!

PS: For everybody that is having a much rougher time than me by day 21 or even by week 21: It surely sucks that it's taking much longer for you guys, but I think I speak for almost everybody here when I say that we KNOW you are going to start having a better time eventually. You WILL stop having those craves! We believe in you! Together, we can all do it!

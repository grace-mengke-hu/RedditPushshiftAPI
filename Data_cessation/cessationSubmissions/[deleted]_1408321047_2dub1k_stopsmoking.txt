One week without even a single cigaretter!!!

I am so happy I have come this far and my friends are certainly happy for me too. I can smell everything now, taste better, my skin feels better, I can breathe easier, and I just have more energy. This week has been great and I am certainly on the right track to never pick one up again. I also lowered my nicotine levels to 12mg in my vape liquids to help me remove my nicotine dependence. Also smoking just smells terrible for me still and probably will for some time. I cannot tell you how much quitting has benefited me on just one week. If you are about to quit and wonder what benefits you will gain, just stop for a few days to see it yourself. Thank you everyone for your support throughout this week!

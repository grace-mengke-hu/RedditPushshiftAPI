On my own quest to stop smoking

I'm not quite sure where or how I found this subreddit, but I'm glad I did.

I've been in the contemplation phase of quitting smoking for approximately a year now, and now I am taking the plunge.  I've been smoking pretty heavily for 9 years, managed to get it cut down to a pack a day or so, and now I'm just going cold turkey from this point forward.

I'll be leaning on you strangers quite often.  You seem like a positive bunch, and that's something I will definitely need.  Thanks in advance, for sure.

Here goes nothing!

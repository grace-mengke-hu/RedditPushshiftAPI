Feeling jealous of smokers

I've been quit for less than a week. I find myself looking at people with cigarettes and feeling jealous. I start thinking to myself that I wish I could do that too. This makes me unsure if I'm actually ready to quit. Sometimes I want to, but a lot of me just doesn't wanna give it up because I like it too much. Am I crazy? Or does anyone else feel this way?

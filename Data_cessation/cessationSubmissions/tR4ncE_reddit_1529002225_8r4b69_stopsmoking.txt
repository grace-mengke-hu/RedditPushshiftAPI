Was smoking since 12 years. Haven't touched a cigarette though for 2 months and 12 days, but getting more cravings now.

Hey guys, my first post on here as i learned only recently about this sub. Been smoking for the past 12 years everyday, but have quit it for 2 months and 13 days - my best attempt to quit it. However I'm having strong cravings again, unlike the last month where cravings were mild and i could easily control myself. Any tips/suggestions to try to control myself will be very helpful. Also, would like to know how these cravings got back so strong all of a sudden.

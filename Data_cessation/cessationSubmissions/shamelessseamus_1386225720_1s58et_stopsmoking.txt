301! Coming up on a year!

I have been preoccupied lately, and did not realize that yesterday made 300 days without a smoke. The last time I quit, I had 7 years under my belt. When I fell of the wagon, I did so in spectacular fashion, and started immediately smoking a pack a day for about 2 years. My hope is that I will be able to quit for good this time, and not give in to temptation again.

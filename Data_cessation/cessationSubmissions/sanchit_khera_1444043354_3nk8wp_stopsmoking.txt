How i quit smoking

I didn't smoke much on a daily basis, but I used this technique to lose weight and quit smoking. I just did it. I was ready for the chemical side of things to kick in when i quit fast food and nicotine, and I knew my mood was going to get fucked from every angle. Sometimes, we follow our brains (looking for passion, or basing decisions on our moods), but more often than not you CAN lead your brain to make decisions that you choose to do. This helps when you start a new venture or a new habit or quit something that's bad for you. 

Cheers and much love to r/stopsmoking!

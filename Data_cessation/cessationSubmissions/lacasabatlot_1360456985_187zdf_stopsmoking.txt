Ecigs? Do they work?

It's been 31 days and I haven't had a cigarette once, but I'm worried that I'm not actually fighting the addiction but rather swapping it for something else, because I've been puffing away on ecigs daily the entire time.

Is this a lasting solution?Or will I just end up craving that "full" head buzzy  feeling of lighting up if I continue using ecigs? Anyone with experience?

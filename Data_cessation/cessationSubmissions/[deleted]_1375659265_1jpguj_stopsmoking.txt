Creating a wallet-sized reminder card

As the title explains, I'm looking to put together a wallet-sized piece of card with some positive affirmations/deterrents/motivational pieces about quitting smoking; y'know, something to glance at whenever a craving arises when you're out and about somewhere. 

Has anyone got some good, short quotes or ideas of what could be put on there? I'm sure others would benefit too :-)

hopefully if I can compile some really good ones, I'll design a print-out and post a few of them on here for everyone to use...

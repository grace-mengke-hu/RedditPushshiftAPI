Weird Question Alert!

So I’m 1 month and 13 days smoke and nicotine free. Started experiencing a really restless feeling in my legs at night while trying to get off to sleep, never had it before and it’s driving me nuts!! I would chop my legs off if it wouldn’t hurt!! It is stopping me from sleeping and it’s a weird sensation from calves all the way to my big toes!! I googled it last night and it sounds like something called Restless Legs Syndrome, yup there really is such a thing! And it can be down to various things but changes in dopamine is one of them!!! 
Wondering if it might be connected to stopping smoking and has anyone else experienced this and does it go away!!! Dreading tonight!
🙏 in advance

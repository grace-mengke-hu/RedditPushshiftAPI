What is the next chapter of " Easy way to stop smoking " by Allen Carr ?

Hello everybody,

About a year ago I listened to the audiobook version of " Easy way to stop smoking " by Allen Carr and it was amazing and extremely effective.I stopped smoking for about 8 months, then I tried smoking again at a party while drunk, then went through some tough times and now Im back to my old ways.

Recently I tried listening to the book again, but it did not have the same effect, I think because I had already listened to it before.He mentioned something about another book of his " The only way to stop smoking " , my question is this - Is this book a continuation / a part for tougher readers of his ? If not, I saw hes had plenty of works about smoking, is there one for weaklings such as myself ?

Another question is this - I can't seem to find "The only way to stop smoking permanently " on audible.Is there another website I can use to find an audible version of the work or am I going to have to read it ?

I'm new to the sub, but all help will be greatly appreciated !

zoning out and forgetting about my purpose whenever depressive memories or bad situations

it's crazy. I had a trauma in my life that still haunts me to this day. Been coping for past year. Everytime I fall back into thinking about it or I get triggered by some negative circumstance which remind me of it.... I suddenly totally zone out. My "feelings" and reasons for not smoking don't matter anymore... It's like all that is nostalgic is enjoying an illusion of a cigarette and nicotine rush which lasts 0.00003th of a second lol.

Any tips appreciated! just wanna hear someeone inspire me by their own words. When it happens again, I'll think of you and I'll remember someone actually cared enough to prepare me for this moment!!

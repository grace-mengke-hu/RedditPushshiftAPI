Good support groups?

I’ve gotten to an AA realization about quitting recently, and it’s that I’m powerless to quit by myself. I just love smoking too much, and I know that it does nothing for me at the same time. I’ve tried alternates and reading “The Easy Way to Stop Smoking” and I still need some accountability. Anyone have any ideas for groups that I could start going to?

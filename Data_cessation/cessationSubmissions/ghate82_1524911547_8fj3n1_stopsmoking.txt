Sinking feeling

So im a day and a half into my quit. Im surprisingly feeling ok physically. I bought a vape to help get through the cravings and its working really well.

What im really having a hard time with is the feeling of not smoking. I know that sounds strange, but when i think about not having a cigarette in my hands when i do the things i normally do, it fills me with a sense of dread. 

My long term partner left me about 6 months ago, and im getting the same feeling i did then. I feel much better about that whole situation now so i keep telling myself after time passes the same feelings will go away about the smokes. 

Just venting. Thanks for listening. We can do this.

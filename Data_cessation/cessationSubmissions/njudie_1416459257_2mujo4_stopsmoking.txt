Any relaxation tips when cravings arise?

I smoked for 36 years and tried quitting once 11 years ago with the help of Wellbutrin which worked but I did not like the side effects and started back smoking within a few weeks.  This time I'm talking 150 mg of bupropion 1x per day and it doesn't seem to be taking effect as quickly as the Wellbutrin did.  I'm just two days in and I guess cravings are not too bad, but I'm holding a lot of tension in my neck which is driving me crazy.  I just can't seem to get myself to relax.  I've been going to Yoga but the relaxed feeling goes away after practice.

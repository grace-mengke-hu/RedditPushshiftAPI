One year - a milestone I never expected

I hit my one year quitaversary today - 365 days with **not one puff.** Quite frankly I never expected to succeed: I did not cut down, it was not my planned quit date, I just woke up one morning after two weeks with bronchitis and realised that if I smoked another cigarette, I was going to drown from the fluid in my lungs. So I slapped on a patch and bore it. 

Nothing about my quit situation was good. I lived with smokers, worked with smokers, worked around smokers... it was rough. Somehow, I just kept going. In hindsight, the difference between this and my other quit attempts wasn't nicotine replacement versus cold turkey, or patch versus vape - it was Allan Carr, and the mental rearrangements that come with his book. I learned to despise my addiction and gained a determination to overcome it, and before too long I'd cut nicotine out and begun to detox. So far I've saved about $2000 and vastly improved my cardiovascular health.

So if my tale has any lessons for anybody else, it's that you CAN do it, even when your entire life situation is working against you; to be so stubborn that failure is simply not an option. The benefits are incredible once you begin to feel them.

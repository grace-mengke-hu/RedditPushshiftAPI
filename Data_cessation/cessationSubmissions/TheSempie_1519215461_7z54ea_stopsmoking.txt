Substituting nicotine is not a shame

I've been smoking 25-30 cigs a day (50 and more at parties) for &gt;8 years and quit 4 days ago. Full stop with no substitute.  
  
Today I had to abort my yearly target agreement interview because I've been unrelated angry.  
While my boss was understanding in a way, that surely is a no go for many people.   
After I got myself some nicotine chewing gum, we could finish that interview.  
  
Withdrawal isn't easy and using a substitute in certain situations is really a help. It does not mean you're weak, but that you understand what's going on.

Getting more and more depressed?

I don't want to go back to smoking, cravings are managable at this point. But couple days ago I had this mild depressing feeling started, yesterday was more shaky, today is even worse. I am at day 10 rn. Wonder how much will it get worse before it gets better? I was feeling generally happy despite strong cravings last week and also quite proud of myself. That seems to be gone. Thanks for any feedback

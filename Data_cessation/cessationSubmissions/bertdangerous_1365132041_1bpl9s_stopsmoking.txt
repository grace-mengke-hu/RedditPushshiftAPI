1 week down.

Now this doesn't seem like a huge deal to a lot of people, I'm sure...

But this is freaking AMAZING to me.

I've quit for a week and a little longer before, but every attempt was made with nicotine patches and was insanely stressful and painful and agonizing.

This past week really hasn't been that bad (little grumpy the first few days, but meh), and it's so surprising to me how easy it's been to keep on going even after the first three days.

Again, I know 1 week is small change compared to some of you on here, but it's a huge deal for me and how it's been done so far.  So for being here let me share the greatest accomplishment of the week:

Go to favorite gas station that is on the way to class every day.  Always purchased a Full Throttle and a pack of Camel Turkish Royals (every. single. day.)

I went there so often the lady behind the counter would see me come in and as I went to get the Full Throttle, she would be grabbing the Royals and have them waiting for me at the counter when I came to check out.

So just the other day I went in, said hi, went back to grab my drink, then came up to the counter and she had already scanned the smokes and was waiting to scan the drink when I said, "Oh, no, could you reset that?  No cigarettes for me today."

Felt so good.  I know that wording sounds weird for someone in it for the long haul, but as of right now it's still kind of a day to day thing.  No cigarettes today.  Then we'll go through tomorrow and the next day and the next.

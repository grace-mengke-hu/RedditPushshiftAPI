Tips to quit when you're addicted to the act of smoking?

Hi so I am 20F and have been smoking for about 3 years now on and off. When I was 17, I started smoking weed and then got busted for it by the cops (long story) and after that I would get major paranoia when I smoke weed because I would be afraid of having to deal with the cops again. So I stopped smoking weed because it wasn't enjoyable anymore. 

After I stopped smoking weed, I started taking an interest in cigarette smoking to fill the void. I started smoking ultra lights once a month or so and then it moved to lights once every 2 weeks and then once every week. I still smoke lights but have found that my cigarette smoking has increased within the past 3 years. 

I quit for almost 9 months from March 2016 - November 2016 (with a relapse here and there but only maybe 2 cigs in total during this time)

I recently started smoking in my apartment and smoked 5 cigarettes in one sitting after not smoking for 9 months and it is now actually worse than before. 

However, I'm not a daily smoker, just a couple times a week. I would say that since I don't smoke daily, I don't have a physical addiction or dependence from nicotine (because no withdrawals if I don't do it), but I think I am very addicted to the inhaling, burning, and exhaling/smoking action in general. It really helps me calm down and feel better. 

I've tried ecigs but always resort back to smoking. I feel like my addiction to nicotine is not that severe since there are no physical symptoms, but I don't think I can ever quit smoking for good.

What are some tips you guys have for a strong behavioral addiction but not really a nicotine addiction? Thanks.

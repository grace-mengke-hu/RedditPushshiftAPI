1 Week, happy but worried......

So I am one week off the smokes. Currently beginning day 8. I made a conscious decision to over eat this weekend just to get me through my first weekend, cake, peanuts, popcorn etc. I have gained 3lbs in a week, but I am thin enough so not worried about it!! What I am worried about is the regular rationalising having another cigarette, a few times a day I get this thought and feel like just buying a pack. This week has been very tough and I sometimes feel like my life and relationships were happier and I was better when I smoked. Itâ€™s so depressing when this happens, especially when I have struggled so hard to get to day 8. Does this stop? Will I one day think "I was not happier smoking, it did not make me a better person". How long does it take for this rationalising to stop?? Im not expecting an exact timeframe off anyone but your personal experience of when you were finally free or are we ever finally free :(

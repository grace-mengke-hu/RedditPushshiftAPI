I got really drunk and didn't smoke!

Alcohol has always been a huge smoking trigger for me. I've got 9 weeks in as of New Years Eve. I went out for some beers that night and got really tempted to go out and get a pack of cigarettes. I was thinking to myself that "Eh, one night isn't enough to knock me off of the wagon." I popped a piece of nicorette gum instead and the craving passed. No cigarettes. No sore throat from smoking. Just a really gnarly hangover today, haha. My nicorette use is down a lot now as well. I'm not 100% nicotine free yet, but goddamn I'm getting close.

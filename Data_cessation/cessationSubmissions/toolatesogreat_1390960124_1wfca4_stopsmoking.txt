It's easier when you know what to expect

I failed quitting several times. This time around, I'm much more in tune with my body. I *know* what it does when I'm quitting and I understand what I'm feeling.  A few days ago I knew for sure that my 8 year relationship was completely over, I hated him, and we were simply not right for each other and....all sorts of thoughts I had every single other time I tried to quit. Before  those feelings went away as soon as I started smoking again. I know what's happening to me now, though, so I don't need a cigarette to repair my relationship. I just need a few deep breaths, maybe a little bit of space, and the feeling passes. Sure, it comes up a few times a day, but it always passes. Some humility works too. An "I'm sorry" goes a long way after getting on your SOs case for no good reason, as hard as it may be to choke the words out. 

Day 20 and I'm feeling like this is truly possible. :D

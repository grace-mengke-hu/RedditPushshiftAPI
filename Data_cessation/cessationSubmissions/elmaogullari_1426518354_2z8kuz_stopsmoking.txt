Finally, here we are !!!

It was unimaginable for me to achieve but here we are. 
I did it so can you. 
I tried lot of stuff. Nicotine gums, patches, Vaporizer, Champix/Chantix , Cold Turkey, changing brands, gradual reduction, various herbal shit. Nothing helped but a therapy at an Allan Carr Center and this subreddit.
 
It does mean that it will work for all of you but one of them will for you. 

So my advise to smokers; NEVER GIVE UP !!!

Helping my Mother Quit

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions. My mother is interested in quitting smoking but I feel like she isn't totally motivated. She is a strong-willed person so I know she can do it, but she says she is always "too busy" to try and "now isn't a good time." She is currently thinking about a date to set so she can hold herself to starting on that day.

I can reason with her and she knows that smoking is horrible. We are interested in researching ways for her to quit smoking.

My questions:

1. She says she needs something physical in her hand, something similar in weight/shape to a cigarette. Is there anything out there like this? Are vaporizers a good workaround? Are there any that resemble cigarettes?
2. Has anyone had success with Chantix? Can you smoke while taking it?
3. She says it would be helpful if she could smoke during the process, just less and less each day/week. Is there any method out there that suits this?
4. Any general tips/suggestions? She smokes about a pack a day and has been for a long time, 30+ years.

Thanks so much for your help!

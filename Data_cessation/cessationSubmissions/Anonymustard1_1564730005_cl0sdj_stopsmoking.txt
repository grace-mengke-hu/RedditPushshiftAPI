It makes you feel so shitty

I have fortunately been able to stop for a couple days but I bummed one this morning. It made me feel so physically awful, you really notice the difference when you do it just once vs. all the time. I think I just Pavlov'ed my way out of cigarette addiction because every time I have one now it's just like "This shit is so nasty. I'm never doing this again."

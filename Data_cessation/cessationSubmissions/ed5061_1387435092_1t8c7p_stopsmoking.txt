Sharp chest pains in same spots in chest. Minor but uncomfortable pains in throat and stomach. Only 21?

Before I go on,  I want to clarify that I'm not necessarily asking for a diagnosis as I would assume that this wouldn't be the right place to ask.  I'm simply wondering if anyone here had these similar feelings before at when they were around my age.  I have been smoking since I was around 17-sh, but I didn't start smoking a pack per day until about 18-19.  

I've been to the doctor about 6 months back and he had diagnosed me with moderate bronchitis.  The sharp, focused pains around the middle of my right lung and somewhat around the sides of my heart is probably attributed to this.  But it wasn't until the recent three months that I've started having less centered, wider pains along my throat and my stomach, especially when I'd smoke my e-cig or regular tobacco.

I assumed that this was only normal, and I wasn't concerned until my fellow smoker friends who smoke just as much as I do didn't share the same problems.  I figured that I was far too young to develop cancer, but has anyone experienced this before when they were younger?  Should I be worried, or am I just being a big hypochondriac?

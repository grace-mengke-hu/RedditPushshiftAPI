Don't Give Up

As I was walking to the gym this morning, I saw two guys hanging out eating breakfast on their front porch.  As I got closer I saw that along with their coffee they were having their morning cigarettes.  Instead of making me sad that I'm not smoking or making me crave a smoke, seeing them sit there and smoke as I walked by made me want to go to the gym even more.  It made me want to hit the weights even harder.  Seeing how that was me a mere 16 days ago furthered my resolve to quit.  I want to be healthy, I want to feel good.  I'm done having my girlfriend say, " You smell/ taste like cigarettes." Its only day 16, but I'm happy with how things are going.  Good luck to you all.  If you really want to quit, you can.

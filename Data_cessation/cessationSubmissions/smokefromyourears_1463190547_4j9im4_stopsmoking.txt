thoughts of a just quitter

Ever since the time cigarettes were consciously given up, I been looking for a spot where sharing of feelings of a "just quitter" could be done. One of my friends and colleagues who is aware about the challenges faced by a quitter, recommended me to stopsmoking. It's a great feeling to find that there are so many like-minded persons with whom I can share my experiences. 
I have been in the smoking circuit since I was 15 years of age and am 63 now - its mostly been "on" rather than "off" during the years. There have been several occasions during the last 4-5 decades that futile attempts were made to quit smoking. This time  around the physician warned me that COPD has started setting in and my lungs were functioning at 50% of its capacity. This jolted me to severe ties with cigarettes - down from around 15-20 a day to nothing.
To be honest the cravings have not been unbearable and the withdrawal symptoms not that severe so far. But what triggers the smoking urge in me is loneliness. Craving for food or anything to munch has kicked in. Please let me know if this is normal.
Hope to collect many more badges, going forward and thanks for being there to share these thoughts.

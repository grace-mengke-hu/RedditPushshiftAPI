I'm 19 and I owe my future health to you guys...

All you older folk that give us youngins' perspective are not forgotten. Thank you.

Also I had a very strange dream last night where I was chain smoking while running a marathon. I woke up sweating, and angry thinking that i relapsed. Just thought i would share.

Quit about a week ago, curious as to how long it will take to recover, at least partially!

I’m a 26 y/o male 6’2 180lbs, I quit smoking after a pack a day for approximately the last 10 years. I’m at the gym and obviously my smokers cough is still just as bad as ever. I’m really focused on fitness but being a smoker really limited how much I could work out. About how long will it take for me to see improvement in my respiration? How long until I can breath at a close to normal level? Thanks for the help!

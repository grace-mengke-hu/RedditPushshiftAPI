Specific Advice for an Anxiety Sufferer Wanted

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder several years ago. I've also been using smokeless tobacco for a couple years. After years of trying to quit and being temporarily clean of both caffeine and nicotine many times, I am becoming increasingly aware of the innate relationship that exists between stimulants and anxiety disorders. I am increasingly confident that I will never truly conquer this disorder without addressing those stimulant addictions/habits.

Caffeine has always been very easy for me to eliminate from my diet. I've often gone from many cups a day of coffee to nothing, and I am not currently nursing a caffeine addiction. Nicotine is an entirely different story, however. When I'm having a bad bout of anxiety, the cravings created by nicotine cessation (be them psychological or physical) feel absolutely overwhelming. When I'm in a healthier state of mind (plenty of sleep, exercise, no recent booze), they feel much more manageable. Unfortunately, life always seems to throw those bouts of high anxiety at me when I'm trying to quit.

Have any anxiety sufferers here found specific strategies for dealing with anxiety that may be amplified more than the average withdrawal?

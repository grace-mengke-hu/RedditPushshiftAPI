Hope I'll come back tomorrow to celebrate my 24 hours without cigarretes. Wish me luck.

While I am typing this, I am smoking my last cigarette, there's a little piece in my mouth yet of this life destroyer. 

Oh, just finished it, I'll be back here tomorrow, in exactly 24 hours, I hope I inform you guys It's been a day with no cigarettes. 

I've found out months ago that I have oligospermia,  it's a disease that makes me produce less sperm than normal, in others words, I'll have trouble when I try to be a father and I want to be someday. 

This problem may be related to cigarettes and others unhealthy habits that I have (food, stress, etc).

Well, I see you guys tomorrow...or not.
Wish me luck.

Passed.

I went back to the campground i quit at with two smokers . just returned home and didn't even smoke. My chair was broken and i put my cell phone on it and went to bed and my drunk friends threw the chair with my cell into the fire!  My phone case and the top of my phone was melted, but it was saved just in time.i wasnt even pissed but my smoker friend was more nervous than me about my phone ahha.

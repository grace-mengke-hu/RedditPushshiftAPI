Day one......again.

I let myself slip badly last week so beginning again today. Managed nearly 2 weeks previously so very angry with myself for going back to the cigarettes.

I don't really want to stop though, in all honesty. Thing is, I don't want to smoke either. I don't enjoy it, haven't done in years. I do it purely out of habit. There's no financial reason for quitting. I smoke tobacco, doesn't cost me much each week. There's not even a particular health issue a the cause for giving up. I've stopped because my little girl deserves a daddy who will be around for a long while yet. She deserves a daddy that has the balls and the backbone to actually stop smoking rather than go and buy a pack when things get a bit tough. She was my motivation the last time I tried and by smoking again I feel I've let us both down.

So, we try again. Back to square one.

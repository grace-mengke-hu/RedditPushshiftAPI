Day 5

So I’ve just found this subreddit and reading through all the posts and comments has given me hope!!

So I’m 5 days without smoking. So far, tomorrow will mark the longest time I’ve gone without a cig. This is only my second quit attempt (first time was in January). I tried vaping last time and it never got rid of the cravings unless I was vaping 24/7!! 

This time I’ve tried lozenges and so far so good-ish. No lies it’s still hard but finding it better to just take a lozenge and it’s surprising how it takes the edge off a craving. 

Yesterday was by far the hardest so far. It didn’t help with the England game and going to the pub!! But I did it!  I’m glad I made the decision to not drink...I think that would’ve put me over the edge. Moving forward, for the next few weeks I’m definitely going to avoid drinking/nights out. It’s just not going to help. 

So I just wanna say thank you to everyone posting/commenting...it’s provided me with great hope and tips of how to get through cravings. 

Will keep you all posted of how I get on!!

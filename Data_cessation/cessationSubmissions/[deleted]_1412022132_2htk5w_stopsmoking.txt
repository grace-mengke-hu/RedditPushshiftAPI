Has this happened to anyone else?

Alright, so here's a super weird question for you all:    
Has anyone else's face broken out horribly after quitting smoking?    
     
I really don't want to jump the gun and blame everything on smoking - but the only things that have changed in the last two weeks is that I've quit smoking, and started using a vaporizer containing propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (no nicotine).   
      
Its got me wondering.     
I started smoking when I was 12, so all those chemicals were present in me during puberty, and I never really had *acne* acne, if you know what I mean (One of my good friends had to go on accutane, poor guy - I was lucky and only had the random pimple here and there).     
So I can honestly say this is the worst my skin has *ever* been, it is very painful and some areas are even starting to fit the criteria of cystic acne. It will warrant a visit to the doctor pretty soon but I'd still like to know if anyone else had to deal with this.    
Or maybe I've having a horrible reaction to the PG/VG?     
And I'm also hesitant to pin it on stress - because I really don't feel any more stressed than I normally do.. Unless people are looking at my face.. Confidence = 0 :(
     
Did anyone else go through this?

First day of quitting! aaaaah

So it is my first day of trying to quit. I am 20 and have been smoking since I was 16. I have tried so many times to stop but it just hasn't worked, I have given in and let myself down. This time though i am determined to stop, i want to be healthy! Today i bought an E-cig kind of thing to help me along the way. This is so stressful for me, anyone have any tips/pointers for the journey?

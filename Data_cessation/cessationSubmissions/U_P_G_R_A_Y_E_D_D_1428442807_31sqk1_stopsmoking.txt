2nd Day. Still surprisingly easy.

Last pang I had was after work yesterday getting stuck in traffic after work for half an hour and that was just my troll brain messing with me. No physical symptoms other than being able to smell a bit better (Jesus, my car smells so bad) and being really tired last night.   

I gotta say, Carr's book, if you give it a chance, is a life saver. I'm not a self help book kind of guy at all but it's helped me so much! 

Thanks to everyone here. You are all real inspirations.

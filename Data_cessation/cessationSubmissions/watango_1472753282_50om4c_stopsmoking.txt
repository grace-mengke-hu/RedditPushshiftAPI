Lets hear it for those who are just starting out!

Hip Hip Hooray!

This shit is tough as hell but at 4 days I still have held strong and kept my lungs clean.  
I'm on edge pretty much all the time but I will continue to hold strong.
I think about smoking for most of the day but I will continue to hold strong.

As some one somewhere once said - "motivation is nothing, discipline is everything". 

I WILL hold strong.

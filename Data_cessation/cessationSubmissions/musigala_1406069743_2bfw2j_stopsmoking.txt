My first official post here

I'm counting the days to hit 1,000 days.   I smoked for 30 years, at least a pack a day.  It took a month and a half of taking Chantix to get me off of them.  I still get fleeting, momentary urges, but all in all it's been great.

What makes it easier for me is that I had quit in 2005, and stayed quit for over two years.  Then life circumstances led to incredible stress and I stupidly started up again.  This time, I know better- nothing, and I  mean NOTHING, will make me start again.

I wish everyone here the best of luck.  We can do this!!!!!!

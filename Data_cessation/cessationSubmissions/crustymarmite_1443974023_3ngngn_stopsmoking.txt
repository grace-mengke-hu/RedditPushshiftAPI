Chest pain normal after one lapse?

Hi everyone. Never used this sort of support before when trying to quit in the past. But I really want to succeed!

I quit 28 days ago and I've been so proud. However the first time I drank a lot which was two nights ago I lapsed and had one cig. I'm trying not to beat myself up but I've been having chest pain right in the centre of my chest...almost like anxiety but it actually really hurt.

Has anyone ever experienced this when having a lapse? I'm wondering if it's just the shock of smoking a nasty cig after being smoke free for nearly a month.

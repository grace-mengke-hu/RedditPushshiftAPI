Six weeks

I kept cutting down for a month or so then one day laid them down. It was rough at first, but it's getting better since I resigned myself to the fact I can't have another. I had heart surgery THEN a heart attack. Supposed to be the opposite I thought.

My doctors did say I could smoke some weed at night to help me sleep. A past military injury make it hard to stay comfortable at night, reefer helps. I don't really want a cig after weed, I use to. Doesn't seem appealing now. 

I still have my, I want to fight or fuck moments but the time they last are not long and they are getting further apart. I imagine I'll have those the rest of my life though. I've been smoking since boot camp. Over 40 years. 

All and all the worst part for me is being forced to stop. I enjoyed a cigarette. But, like I said, it wasn't like I had a choice. 

Good luck to us all.

day 22

I decided to quit on August 31... I don't know why I chose that date. I just got tired of feeling awful, wasting my money, and I always felt ashamed of my dirty habit. I can't remember how many times I've tried to quit over the past 13 years. Im 30 years old and I started smoking when I was 16 or 17, my boyfriend at the time was older and bought them for me. He was the guy that got me smoking in the first place.... Great guy wish I could go back and slap him as well as younger me.

Anyways- I went for my first run this morning since 8th grade.... Wow am I out of shape! I'm feeling great though and everyday it seems to get easier. I hope to start exercising daily and eventually lose at least 20 pounds.

I just thought I'd share a little... Been lurking in the shadows on here for awhile. This sub has definitely helped me quite a bit in the past few weeks. 

Hope you all have a great day :)

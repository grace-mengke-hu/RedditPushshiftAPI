I'm off the patches. I did step one for one week, step two for one week and step three for two weeks. When I have a drink I still want to smoke but I've been snacking instead. Snacking way too much but it's progress. Thanks for listening everyone having a place to post this kind of thing where people can see it makes the words have more meaning and permanence in my mind.

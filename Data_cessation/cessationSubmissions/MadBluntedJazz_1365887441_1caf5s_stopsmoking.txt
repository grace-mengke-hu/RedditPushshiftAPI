Quit smoking almost a year ago now.. haven't had cravings in a looong time, but lately it's all I think about..

I hold pens like cigarettes, joints like cigarettes, anything small and cylindrical I find I hold like a smoke and start chewing on it or putting it up to my mouth. My boyfriend of 3 years still smokes and I can be around people who smoke, but lately I've been thinking about how nice it would be to just have a puff.

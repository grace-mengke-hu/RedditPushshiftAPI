Enjoying the regular trip outside.

I'm sure that most everyone can relate.  I love the excuse for the constant and regular trip outside.  I love the excuse to walk around the backyard, walk around the side, go out front and ponder the world and just basically go outside.   

My smoke break is the perfect excuse to experience this 15 times a day...otherwise, I have no legitimate reason to do this....

How do you all address this?




(For reference...music videos only aired on UHF channels when I started smoking...)

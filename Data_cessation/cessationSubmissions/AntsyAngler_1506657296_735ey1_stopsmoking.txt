Stumbling with quitting and depression

Hi all you quitters- I am back at it again after a slip up last Friday.  I quit for several months last Autumn and slowly starting slipping up, on and off for months, ever since.  I just finally noticed that every time I quit I get depression for a couple of days and symptoms of being sick: fatigue, sweats, aches, etc. 

I am hoping that this knowledge will empower me to stick with it.  To get kind of sick from withdrawals is just too much of a pain in that ass to go through and I've been off an on for so long.  

I can't afford the depression and the feelings of withdrawal.  I have got to get free of this addiction.   

No More Cigarettes!!!

Day 4: Feeling indifferent

Hey /r/stopsmoking!
I've smoked the past decade (I'm almost 25) pretty heavily. Two years ago I started running, longboarding and decided that I wanted to lose weight - I did all that, but I also started smoking again. Had been clean one year before this decision...

Now I'm on my second or third serious attempt to stop smoking. The one time I told you about, I was clean for about a year, the other time about six months.

Now I've not smoked a cigarette in four days and... it's okay. I'm neither enthusiastic, nor am I depressed. It's just; I don't think I accomplish something. Maybe it's because I don't really believe in myself, don't think I really will get through... maybe it's because I'm still smoking e-cigarettes and I think I'm "cheating". I don't know. 

There should be some sort of accomplishing feeling, I guess. I was partying yesterday without the craving for a real one. I'm starting to smell again and breathing definitely is easier.

I don't know why I posted this, but maybe I hope to feel rewarded when I reflect what I've done (or not done) in the past few days. Have a sunny Sunday!

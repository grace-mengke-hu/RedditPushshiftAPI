The 8th day and counting.

Today is day 8th without a cigarette and it feels good not to smoke. 

Sometimes after dinner I have the urge to smoke one since they're the best ones but that craving only lasts 2 minutes. 

But I feel tired a lot. I sleep a lot. I feel drained somehow. 

I work out in the gym already for one and a half year but since I quit I feel tired? 

Any tips?

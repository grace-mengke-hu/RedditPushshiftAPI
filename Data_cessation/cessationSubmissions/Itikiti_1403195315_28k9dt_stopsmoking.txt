I got drunk and smoked for the second time in my life, I think I'm feeling withdrawal and want to ride it out because I don't want to get addicted

So to provide some context, I'm home from college for the summer, and last night I went to a good friends house for a party. Once the party got really big I decided to go out back where people were much quieter and were also smoking. I'd only smoked once before, while drunk, with friends at college, and at that time I threw up from the light-headedness, and I guess that soured me on cigs until last night. 


But at this party for some reason I decided I'd stay outside and smoke, and I probably smoked 5-7 cigarettes, no bad side effects until this morning. After my hangover went away I felt a bit shaky and woozy, and I'm having trouble not thinking about cigarettes and about how bad it would be for me to get addicted. I read somewhere on this sub that it takes 5 days for nicotine to filter out of your body. I don't know if this is true, but what ways can I ride out any withdrawal and make damn sure that I don't ever think of or touch a cigarette again? I'm extremely worried about getting addicted

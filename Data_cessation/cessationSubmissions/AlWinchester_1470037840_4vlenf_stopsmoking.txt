First time in my life, I haven't smoked for 10 days. But I'm afraid.

I am trying to quit completely for a few years. I wasn't a "one pack a day" smoker. There were times that I didn't smoke for 2-3 days, but then I did smoke a pack. Didn't smoke for 2 days, smoking for the next 2 days. I never said no when someone passes me one nice cigarette after lunch. This was the case for a long time. 

First time in my life, I thought wtf, if I can live without a cig for 3 days, why would I smoke that shit again?

And I quit. Really quit. It's been 10 days and I haven't smoked a single cigarette, no patch, no vape, nothing. Cravings still come and go but they are better.

But I'm afraid. I don't want to give up after an argument with my gf. I don't want to give up when I'm bored at work. I don't want to give up after my team lost the game on Sunday. What sould I do guys? The most difficult cravings come when I'm angry or depressed. And I'm not confident what to do when one comes..

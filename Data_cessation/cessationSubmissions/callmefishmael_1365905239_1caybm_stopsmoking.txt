When will the cravings end?

It's been 60 days, give or take, since my last cig, after eight years of addiction.  The first few weeks were surprisingly easy, but recently I've been getting at least one strong craving a day.  I don't think it's enough to make me get back on them, but it's very annoying.  Can anyone tell me when their cravings basically stopped for good?

One Month Today - Reflections On My Toughest Quit Ever

Just a quick note to everyone, especially those who are really struggling. Today is one month quit for me, and up until this last week, I was really struggling.

First week was fine: grumpy but also glad since it was freezing out and I refused to smoke in my car or my house.

Second week the grumps went away, but this pervasive feeling of sadness crept in, making me tired all the time and hopeless about everything. Didn't feel like smoking, but mainly because I didn't feel like doing anything.

Third week was the worst. I've had bouts of depression my entire adult life, but this was the worst I ever had it. Whenever my mind wasn't occupied, it drifted down this dark path of despair that always ended with thoughts of suicide because it was never going to get any better.

I knew it was the last gasp of the disease, trying to convince me that nothing mattered and I needed to just smoke away my blues. I also never seriously considered acting on my impulses during this time, but it felt like the longest week of my life.

Then, after the third weekend, it was like a switch got flipped and I started to feel happy again. So glad I gritted my teeth and got through it. It was tough, but it's so worth it.

To anyone fighting a craving right now, don't give in. I wish I never had, and I hope I never do again.

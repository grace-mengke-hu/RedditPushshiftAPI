Please help me!

I stop smoking in new year eve, since that i decided to lock me up in my house to avoid tentations. I pass chill the first 2 days, the 3 and 4 was very hard, but now, my mind is convinced to buy cigarretes in the next day (when all the stores open), How can i recover the control of my mind?

So glad I’m not the friend who smokes anymore

After quitting in May and 6 months of using Juul as NR, I’m so glad I’m not the smoker friend anymore. I never realized how hard it is to breathe, how badly it smells. I don’t know how my SO slept next to me when I smelled like smoke. 

So grateful to be a non smoker.

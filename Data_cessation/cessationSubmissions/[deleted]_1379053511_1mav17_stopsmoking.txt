Can someone break down the cold turkey timeline for me?

I've quit cold turkey before and I remember getting seriously sick within a week's time and this hasn't' happened yet.  On a slow day at work I'd smoke about 12 ciggs, but before I went cold turkey I was down to about 3 or 4 a day.  It's been a few years since I took an extended break from smoking and I don't really remember the recovery timeline at all.  I'm not getting hungry, and I'm not having any major cravings.  It's very strange.  

Can somebody break down the recovery timeline for me?  When does my sense of smell come back?  When am I going to become a raging asshole and snap at everyone because I haven't had my smoke?  Websites dedicated to going cold turkey seem to avoid all the negative health risks of quitting cold turkey and I understand why.  Nobody wants to read about how sick they'll get when they decide to quit smoking.  Somebody clear this up for me because I can't remember how it broke down a few years ago.  

TLDR:  Need somebody to tell me how and when I will become sick from quitting cold turkey.  Break it down in a timeline for me.

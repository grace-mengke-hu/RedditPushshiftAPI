Something no one told me about quitting

It doesn’t take long at all to feel results. 
I didn’t plan on going cold turkey because it just sounds overwhelming, but I made it 10 hours that first day without one. By 3 hours in I could feel a difference in how deeply I could breath. 

Tuesday I took my toddler to the park and played WITH her instead of being out of breath after a few seconds and just watching her play, 

I’ve smoked once or twice the last few days but it’s become very clear that when I do so mindfully, I can feel all the negative effects I knew were there, but had trained myself to ignore.  Remembering how awful I feel now when I do smoke makes it way easier to say no to those cravings.

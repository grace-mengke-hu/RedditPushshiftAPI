Day 28 and feeling awful

I am on day 28 of quitting smoking and have been so sick for almost a week. I have a high fever, body aches, coughing and chest pains. Has anyone else had this? I feel like ever since I quit the physical withdrawal symptoms have been horrible. I have barely craved a cigarette at all as I will never put my body through this again. I am super active and already workout 6 days a week but havenâ€™t felt this sick in years! 
Just wondering when the symptoms go away for good.

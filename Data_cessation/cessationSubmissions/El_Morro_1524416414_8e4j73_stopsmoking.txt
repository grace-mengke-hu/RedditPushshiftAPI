Looking for a particular "stop smoking" video... any help?

Hi all... so I've been a smoker for 26 years (between a pack a day to three a day and everything in between), and I've experienced a life event that really woke me up and had me stop altogether about a week ago.

I purchased a "Juule" device to block some of the withdrawals, and it's worked for the most part, but I know it's just a crutch.  So it's time to get ready for the "big break" from nicotine altogether.  

That said, I remember watching a video that helped me quit for 6 months a few years back, but I can't find it.  It's a video from some guy where he really goes into detail breaking down every excuse smokers use to justify smoking, with cuts to different people saying each one, then the guy dismantles each argument.  I think he calls the nic withdrawal "little monster" or something like that.  At some point he tells the viewer to smoke their last cig, as well.  

I'm dedicated to doing this one way or the other, but I remember that video as being a major factor in helping me quit for those 6 months, and I'd love to find it again.  

**EDIT** It was on youtube, and the youtube format would be best, since I can stream it pretty much any time (I drive a lot for my job, so I would play it through an aux line in my car). 

Thanks for any help, and best of luck to you all :)

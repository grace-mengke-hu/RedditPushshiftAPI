70 days no smoking! Temptation is still low but subtly increasing.

Hey all! I've been 70 days with no smoking. (Have been vaping.) Also, I haven't bought a pack of cigs at all since February. (But I did grossly smoke a pack of cigarillos in June and I've had about 11 cigarettes since Feb.)

This is excellent stuff for me and totally unprecedented in my adult life. (I'm 26.) However, I had about 6 weeks in which I wasn't working or going to school. I barely left my house! Now that I've started school again, I'm naturally more exposed to the smoking. The two month milestone was excellent but I guess I'm at that sort of "boring" in between. I don't get excitement from not smoking so much as the realization that it's an extremely wise move, which is also powerful.

I could easily justify a smoke here and there considering my track record this year of going back to quitting shortly after a relapse. (Three separate streaks of 30+ days no smoking.) However, my temptations are not super strong and I'd rather just keep my guard up to avoid it in the first place. Any tips for someone at this stage? Thanks!

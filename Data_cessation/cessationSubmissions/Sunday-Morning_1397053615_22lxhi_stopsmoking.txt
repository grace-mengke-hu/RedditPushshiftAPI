Quitting together, starting three hours ago

This morning we woke up to four cigarettes left. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and said enough is enough! We collectively spend way too much money on these. 

I'm 23. I'm too young to be skipping the gym because of how short of breath I get. I'm sick of being a hypocrite. I don't like looking my patients in the eye and telling them "smoking will kill you"... Then sneaking outside the hospital for a drag. I hate relying on them to relieve stress. I hate the way everything smells!

He's 24. Eleven years ago he picked up his first cigarette, and hasn't stopped since. He has a son, a construction job, and a brand new car. His son gets upset, he gets winded at his job and wheezes at night, his car is starting to smell like mine. 

We bought vaporizers six months ago during a half-assed attempt at quitting. He hates that I smoke, and said if I quit he would too. So we're doing the weaning method together. We want to quit before we move in together. 

Hopefully the buddy system works. You all are an inspiration with your positivity and advice. I've been lurking for some time. I hope to be one of you successful non-smokers starting today.

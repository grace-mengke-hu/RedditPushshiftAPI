Waiting for people

As a smoker whenever I was early to meet somebody, which is most of the time, or they were late I would always kill time by smoking a cigarette or two. Now that I don't smoke anymore I really don't know what to do with my hands, phone or whatever. It all feels so new to me. If you are a punctual person living in India, where people,sadly, are usually late it leaves a lot of time left for you to kill. I really don't know how I'm going to cope anymore.

Friends: it doesnt help saying that

My non-smokers friends wont be reading this, unfortunately. Lets see an unhelpful dialogue.

- (Cheerful) Hi my friend, great news, Iâ€™ve stoped smoking!
-  (Happy) wow, amazing! You finally realized smoking kills people. Congrats! Since when?
- (proud) 4 days ago...
- (aloof face, disappointment) oh, I see... 
- I know is too soon, but I am determined! I will do it. I am doing it! 
- (contempt) you go girl. Good luck.

Arghhhh!

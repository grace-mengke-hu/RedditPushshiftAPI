I've recently quit smoking, putting on weight now wondering when I should be able to run properly?

I quit smoking on the 2nd of January, so it's been about 17 days now. I weighed myself when I was home 5 days ago, and I'd put on about 9 pounds since before Christmas. I know that more than half of this is the Christmas food weight, but I've been eating a lot since quitting and one of the main things stopping me from quitting before was the fear or putting on weight. I decided to quit when I tried running and could only do a maximum of 1km without stopping. I thought that when I quit I could start running and this would prevent me from putting on weight, and also thought not smoking would mean I could run farther without getting fatigued and out of breath.

I went for a run last week and was still only able to run 1km before my lungs and heart were in actual pain. I'm just wondering, is there a certain amount of time from the point of quitting to where my lung functioning should be back to normal and I can start to improve my running ability? I know that if I start getting fat I'll immediately start smoking again.

P.S: I've smoked for 7 years, with a year of not smoking right in the middle (so total 6 years).

...and suddenly, I cried.

I just smoked my last cigarette. I'm determined this time. I don't want to smoke ever again. I've been thinking about it for too long and it's time I take action. I'll be, hopefully, starting a new job soon and I want it to be the beginning of a new me. I've been smoking for six years, and I truly wish I could take those years back. Tears came to my eyes this morning as I wondered how I ended up a slave. Now, a slave no more. 
Any support, tips, and words of advice will be dearly appreciated.

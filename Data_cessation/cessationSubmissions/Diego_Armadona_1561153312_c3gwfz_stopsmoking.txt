Damn...

I lit my cigarette after a month. I can't believe it, I'm so sad. I'm only 17 and I smoked a pack and a half a day. I just wanted to stop. My father bought me a vape and I did just fine. But I don't know. Im sad that I tried. Sorry if this isn't the right sub to vent but I'm sad of myself.




P.S. English is not my first language, I'm still learning how to speak it.

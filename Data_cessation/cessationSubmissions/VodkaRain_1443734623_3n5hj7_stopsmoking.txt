How much worse is vaping than smoking?

Its been two weeks that I have stopped smoking. The thing is I replaced smoking with vaping instead. Am I cheating?

Edit: Thanks for the replies guys and yea im trying to ween off of the nicotine. I must say though that i can definitely taste and smell things so much better!

STOP: Before you give in to the craving, read me

Remember, you are experiencing 2 things. Your job right now is to differentiate between them.

1. The physiological dependence of nicotine. You know, that feeling that you NEED the drug from the cigarette. **Hang in there another 3-5 minutes, and it will be over**

2. The psychological addiction. You take 200 puffs off these nasty things every single day. This is your self-identity. Remember your **choice** was to become tobacco free. **You already made the decision to quit**


Hang in there, and I hope that helps...


 I just came across this subreddit and am very impressed with it.

  I am a public health professional that works specifically in tobacco cessation, and I am also an ex-smoker. I hope to become a little bit more involved here and help out if needed. Feel free to ask me anything, as well.

Keep up the good work!

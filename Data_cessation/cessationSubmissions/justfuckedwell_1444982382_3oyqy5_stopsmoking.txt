Please Help Me Quit Smoking. Please. Thank You!

Got my cinnamon stick in hand.  Downloaded a quit the cig type app for my smarty pants phone.  Attended 12 steps group meetings in an effort to quit the cigs.   Love the people I met there. Great mirror for me.   I'm more of a Goddess person vs God person. Step 12 requires you Sell The Religion. I am willing to help others, always. Will NEVER have a need to sell any one Religion. The step about the moral inventory...do that daily...no step required for me.   My husband n I were blessed to learn from his holiness,  The Dalai Lama:  For The Least Suffering Of All.    For me:  cigs = suffering.

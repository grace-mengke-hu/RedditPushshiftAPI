Cold Turkey Day 5 - Ah Ah ah ah Stayin' Alive

Posting to keep my momentum going. Today is so far so good. Had some stress at work with el jeffe, but got through it. Had to get up & walk around the office for a minute, went to the bathroom & did some wall pushups to settle myself, did a little deep breathing. Two hours after the stressful moment, I feel great again. Relaxed, moving at my own pace, everything's gonna be ok.

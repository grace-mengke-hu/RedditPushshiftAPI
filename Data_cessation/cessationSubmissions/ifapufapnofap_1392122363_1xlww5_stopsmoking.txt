I made it through the first 24 hours!

The first day is always the hardest and I'm fucking proud of myself that I got through it. I was around smokers all night, sitting around eating pizza and having a beer and just puffing away, and I was able to not have one puff! So hell to the motherfucking yeh! Go me! I'm looking forward to posting again at 48 hours! Woohoo!
P.S You guys are amazing! Thanks for all the support, and if you're going through this too, you can totally kick nicotine in the face and tell it to fuck off!

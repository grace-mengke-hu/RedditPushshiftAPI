8 days today

After trying several times , I have to say I am very proud of myself for quitting. I usually break when I drink on the weekends , so I figured it would be logical to cut back on my drinking and had a few beers on Saturday pacing myself throughout the night. Made it through the night without a smoke even though I did have some cravings. Hoping it gets easier and easier from here on out.

Quiting on my daughter's Birth

This will be probably the 10th time I've tried to quit in 15+ years. I'm only 30 and I've been smoking for more than half of my life. The longest successful quit was 7 months. I felt great, finally felt free in my life. Went out drinking one night and had the fantastic idea to smoke a cigarette. 1 turned into 2, 2 turned into 3. Smoked one the next day while hungover and fell back into the trap. Since then I've "attempted" to quit 7+ times, making my wife (ex-smoker, 5 years smoke free) false promises every time. Feeling shameful, guilty, dishonest etc. We have a great marriage and honestly if it wasn't for my smoking weakness it would be about as perfect as a marriage could be. It gives me so much anxiety to even think about quitting. But I know it has to be done. I have 2 sons and a daughter due in 2 days (3/7/19) I know between my health, my wife and kids health, financial health, and my own well being I have to do it for real this time. My wife refuses to allow me to continue when my daughter comes, and I agree it's time to quit. I've been following this subreddit for a while and love the accountability and positive reinforcement so figured I would post my situation. Thanks guys for everything, I will keep you updated with my progress. Peace &amp; Love

Oh, the struggle

I've lost track of many times I've quit smoking and then quit-quitting smoking on blind impulse, in these past two years, spending spirit-weakened evenings artlessly chain-smoking on my porch, waking up bleary-eyed and full of self-loathing for being such a pussy, again breaking promise after promise to myself.  

Then dumping the cigarettes down the garbage disposal, or standing over the trash can by the garage shredding them one by one into tens of little unsmokeable pieces, or driving them to a remote location to throw them away at a trashcan that I know will be emptied by day's end, or leaving them on a street corner for someone less guilt-ridden to find and enjoy. 

Where has my self-respect gone? Why does the power wane, every time, after dozens and dozens of these false starts? How do I deceive myself in these small seconds into thinking that I will enjoy them again? I haven't enjoyed them for years, in actuality, yet still I find myself scared as time goes on after each quit attempt. Am I boring now? Will my life be bland up until the day I get old and die? Have I lost the edge that makes me look dangerous? Not true, doesn't matter; nonetheless, the same thoughts ensnare me time after time. 

I used to be a decisive person who could stick landings.

Lost a friend

Yesterday we lost a dear friend to lung cancer.  I am so sad and angry.  

I thought for sure that in times of stress I would want a smoke.  It never crossed my mind.  Instead,  I was grateful to be with our friends,  grieving together and not needing to run outside.

Fuck cigarettes,  fuck the big tobacco companies and most of all FUCK CANCER.

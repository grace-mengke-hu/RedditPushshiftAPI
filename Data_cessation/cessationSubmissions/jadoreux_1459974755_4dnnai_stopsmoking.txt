Having trouble with those horrid cravings? Orange juice might be what's missing in your life.

I can't rave enough about orange juice killing cigarette cravings. I literally lived on the stuff the first 2 weeks of quitting last time. Currently on hour 37 of no cigarettes and about 30 minutes ago I was having a full blown, awful withdrawal moment. Realised I had run out of juice, bought some more, one glass and I'm back to normal! 

edit: brain without nicotine does not do words well

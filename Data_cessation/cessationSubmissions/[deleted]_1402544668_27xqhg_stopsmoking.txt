Good luck everyone. You can all do it.

I'm just writing a parting message. This forum has helped me immensely during one of the most difficult parts of my life. I worry about what is going on in here now though.

I don't approve of the people who are pushing ecigarettes in here. I think this is completely counter productive and harmful. I worry about others falling prey to the same industry that hooked us in the first place.

I am old enough to remember a time when doctors told us that smoking wasn't harmful. And in the end of the day it isn't just the smell and smoke that necessitates one to quit. It is breaking a chemical addiction that other people prey on. A chemical addiction with 0 benefit. I hate to see the patterns continue with this new and untested industry. Please be careful.

Good luck. I have faith in the quitters and I hope they know that it is totally worth it.

I'll probably get down voted into oblivion for having anti hive mind opinions but there they are. 

Thank you for everything you have done and good bye!

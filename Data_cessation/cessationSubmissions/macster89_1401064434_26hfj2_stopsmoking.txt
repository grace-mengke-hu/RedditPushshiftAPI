Looking for some tips on how you guys have quit smoking

I've tried time and time again to stop smoking, I'm well over a year and a half sober and the more I try and quit the more I realize just how enslaved to these things I am. I used an electric cigarette for almost a year, tapered my nicotine down to 3ml. Got some gum and patches and did that for a couple weeks. I made it five days nicotine free and was loosing my mind. This morning I was driving down the street contemplating taking off my seat belt and driving off the road. I bought a pack instead and have had about five cigs today. The crazies have left but I'm feeling very hopeless and I would love some advice. Am I missing something? Anyone else experience anything like this?

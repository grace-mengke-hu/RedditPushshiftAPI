I've tried hypnosis to help me quit. So far, so good, it works, at least on me.

I had been smoking for more than 10 years and like many of us here, I had tried many times to quit, in vain. 

For the first time though, I had decided to get some help. So I've met an hypnotherapist ( damn, this word sounds horrible once translated to english). 
It costed me around 80$ but the investment is already profitable.

The principle is to move your dependency from the reptilian part of the brain to the logical part through hypnosis. 
During the whole session, you stay fully aware of what's happening. Most of it consists in pretending smoking and then crush it in the ashtray, like it is your very final one.
 At the end, it was awesome, i almost straightly went to a party with friends, and at no time I felt the previous need of ligthning one along my beer.


The guy told me also to quit coffee and coca-cola for at least 3 month. I have no clue why, but it can't be bad. 

Feel free to ask any questions, if interested.

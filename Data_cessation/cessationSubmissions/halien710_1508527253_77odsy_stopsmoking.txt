7.5 years of smoking, coming up on 2 weeks without a cigarette

I know 2 weeks isn’t too long. But they do say once you make it past the 7 day mark, it gets easier. Now I’m not perfect. I haven’t completely stopped smoking. I don’t smoke cigarettes anymore. But I do use a nicotine vape. If this violates the rules for not smoking. Please (kindly) inform me in the comments. I just wanted to put this out here. Because I seriously can’t believe I haven’t picked one up. I always have opportunity to smoke. Everyone at the automotive shop I work at smokes. All my good friends smoke. My biggest hurdle was getting over the urge to smoke a cigarette in the car. Something about smoking and listening to music while you drive really feels good to me. 
So two weeks ago. I literally had no plans to quit. I didn’t see any issue with my smoking. And if I did, I tucked it in the back on my mind. I’d tried to quit numerous times, and never made it past 3 days. Anyways. My friend introduced me to the Juul device and I quit smoking that day. I bought a brand new pack, but never opened it. Because the juul was almost equivalent to smoking (without the nasty smell and harsh chemicals) so I’m here to say to pat myself on the back. My goal is to completely eliminate the vape. But I’m taking things one day at a time! Congrats to everyone who has overcome this addiction and I pray you find strength in every day you are cigarette free!

Request: does anyone know of any good resources that compare the rates of cancer between smokers and non-smokers?

A bit of background behind the request:
My partner (Bob) 57m mostly quit about 6 months ago (but still has one here and there). At the moment his 60yo brother-in-law (Sam) is in hospital, expected to die in the next week or so after he was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of lung cancer at the start of the year and it spread to his spine. The doctors have told Bob that smoking may not have been the major cause of Sam's cancer (which, is true but not motivating to someone who hasn't quite quit smoking themselves). 

Additionally, one of our friends (74m) who has been a non-smoker their whole life has recently been diagnosed with lung cancer. 

I feel as though all of this may be a trigger for my partner and want to be able to again, discuss with him how damaging smoking is preferably with evidence. 

If anyone can help with some resources, it would be most appreciated. (And, yes I will be focussing on the benefits of not smoking that aren't directly related to death E.g. Not smelling like a chimney, having better senses etc)

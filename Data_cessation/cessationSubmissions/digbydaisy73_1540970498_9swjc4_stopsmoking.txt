Iâ€™ve cracked after 2 months and 28 days! So depressed!

Iâ€™d done so well! Only cracked once before and threw away packet! Very expensive failure! Cracked this week and I donâ€™t want to waste more money in case I canâ€™t manage again. I know Iâ€™m being stupid and weak but it did make me feel happier briefly! I really donâ€™t want to smoke but I need to financially and for my health. Not getting younger and terrified Iâ€™ll die young like parents did from smoking diseases. Any words of wisdom would be gratefully received! ðŸ˜©

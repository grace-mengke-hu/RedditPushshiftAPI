What changes did you make in your life to assist in the quitting process?

I've been lurking on this sub for about six months now and I feel it is time for me to try to quit for real this time. I've realized just how much money I've been wasting on these things. The only thing is that it's tough for me to quit because of my life style.

I'm a stress smoker and a poor college kid. I get stressed over school, work, and family. I read on here that you should distance yourself from what tempts you to smoke. Literally all of my friends smoke cigarettes, I dislike my coworkers and would go smoke on my breaks so I didn't have to associate with them in the break room. I have a disgusting cough now that won't go away.

What did you have to give up/do to achieve being a non-smoker?

My dad has cancer

They found a 'mass' in a lung when doing some tests for an upcoming knee surgery. Apparently it's stage one and the doctor believes they can get it all with surgery because it has not spread. He smoked up until a few years ago (he's 60). His dad died very slowly of lung cancer at 70. 

I've been quit for 2 months & 18 days. I'm staying that way this time.

Is this normal?

I smoked my last cigarette day before yesterday, and woke up this morning coughing up phlegm, and had a stuffy nose and a sore throat. Throughout the day I also had trouble concentrating and had a headache on and off and just feel blegh in general and kind of low on energy. I expected the phlegm and the headache, but is the rest of this normal for the process, or am I possibly coming down with something and it's just a happy coincidence (lucky me)?

I've been a lurker on this sub for a while, subscribing on and off for the last few months trying to talk myself into taking the plunge, and now I've finally decided to do it and even if it is going to suck this much I am determined not to give up! Thanks in advance for your input guys.

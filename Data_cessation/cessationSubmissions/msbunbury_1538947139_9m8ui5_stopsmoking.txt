Just about to hit two days, got the best motivation possible.

So two days ago I found out I'm pregnant and obviously stopped smoking immediately. I've done it before twice when I've been pregnant so I know I can get through it, and I had a headstart in that I peed on the stick before having my first smoke of the day so I was already eight hours quit to begin with. So far I'm doing okay but I've struggled to get to sleep and obviously in my current state I really need my sleep! Any tips for getting to sleep that are safe in pregnancy?

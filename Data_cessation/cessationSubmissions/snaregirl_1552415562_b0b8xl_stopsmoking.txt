What made you fall off the wagon after a long time?

This is for people who have stayed smoke free for substantial lengths of time, yet reverted to smoking again; let's say, being smoke free for a year and then suddenly smoking again.

I'll soon be rounding my 9 months smoke free, and I cannot imagine what it would take to make me light up again. I don't like anything about it anymore, the expense, the stigma, the limited freedom,  the smell...! I love having quit, and I'm proud of it. But I still catch myself worrying, especially when I hear a long term quitter lighting up again. I'd like to be prepared, if possible.

So does anyone have advice what to be on the lookout for?

I keep forgetting to congratulate myself

I was going to toot my own horn at my one year mark, but I forgot and blew right past it. I thought, "Oh well, I'll pick another milestone and do a little toot then instead." Blew past 500 days as well. So here's to 504 days! I'm happy to be forgetting about my accomplishment than still have smoking (or the lack of it) at the front of my mind.

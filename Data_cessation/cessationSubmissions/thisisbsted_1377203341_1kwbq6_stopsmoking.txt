Secondhand Smoke

Its been over 3 days since my last cigarette. My dad wants to go to a bar tonight that allows smoking. Will the secondhand smoke restart the clock on nicotine withdrawal? I feel like I'm getting through this quit attempt fairly easy so far and don't want to make it more difficult than it has to be.

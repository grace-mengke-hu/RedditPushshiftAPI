My habit is costing me almost 200 dollars a month at a pack or more a day, and I need to quit.

I started off smoking halfies almost two years ago now.  I had smoked before and never actually developed a habit, so of course, like an ignorant youngling, I picked it back up when the going got rough. Well, you know what, the going is always going to be rough, and so deciding to quit when I don't "need the stress relief anymore" amounts to me quitting when I'm dead, or else calling bullshit on my own bullshit and stopping now while I'm still young. I've escalated to, as mentioned in the title, a pack a day, sometimes more. I can't go two hours without starting to think about nothing but lighting up a smoke. The habit is not only eating up my money, but my time. So, here goes my first day quitting cold turkey. I'm feeling very uncertain and trying real hard not to doubt myself and say "Oh, you know you'll just end up buying a pack after work today." I'm trying to say, DARNIT, YOU, YOU DON'T NEED THOSE.

TL;DR: I have a problem.

Edit: fixed a little formatting thing so I don't upset people.

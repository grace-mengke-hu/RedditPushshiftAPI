Who says the Nicotine Patch is cheating? I'm a 30 yr smoker, quit last week thanks to it.

I had tried quitting before and couldnt take the withdrawals...was back within a week on both occasions.   Had it in my head that I was weak if I needed any kind of help.  Had my last cig on Wednesday night and put the patch on Thursday morning-felt it working right away.  Sure, I have very minor temptations (morning, after eating etc.) but they pass very quickly and I don't dwell on them at all.  Perhaps the real test will come when I'm through with the patches, but even then I would rather buy more patches than start smoking again.  

I think maybe some of us don't want to admit we need help quitting....but why not?  We are DRUG ADDICTS!  The best way to kick the habit is to wean ourselves off of it, right?  And granted, its only been 4 days, but I never imagined that I could actually not have a strong desire to smoke.

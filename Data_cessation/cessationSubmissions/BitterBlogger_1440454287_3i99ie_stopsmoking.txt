First day hanging round smokers since quitting!

As the title states it was my first proper day around smokers since I quit two weeks ago, and while I didn't really appreciate the second hand smoke, I wasn't really drawn towards having a cigarette. 

It's kind of empowering, being able to know that I can trust myself to not give in, despite social pressure, or whatever. 

It's nice. It's a weight off my mind. I was smoking for two years, and now I hope I never will again.

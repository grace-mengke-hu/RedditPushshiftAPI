Day 5: Checking in, general reflections

I've smoked for about 10 years now. I want to be done... sort of. I've posted here a thousand times before (made it 41 days a few months ago).

The thing that sucks, for me, is that I still like it. I still enjoy 75% of the cigarettes I smoke. The actual cigarettes aren't the problem; it's everything that comes with it. The lethargy, the headaches, the money loss... not to mention the eventual cancer.

Drinking on the weekend, and just Friday's in general, are huge triggers for me. Usually, every week I won't smoke. But at 5pm Friday I get this FUCK IT IT'S FRIDAY BOYZ LET'S DO IT GET BEERS AND SMOKES LETS DO THIS.

I've done that for the past like... two months. Won't smoke for 5 days and then will smoke two packs over the weekend.

And, in my heart of hearts, I still want that. So much. But as most people my age (late 20's), my body and brain are starting to grow and change and I need to take my conscious actions with them, or I'm going to develop some real issues. I have friends who drink until they're asleep 5 nights a week... and then go to work, and post about the hangover, and they all laugh.

It's funny, kind of, because it's stupid and "why did we do that lol", but I know it's time for all that to become more of a rare occurrence than the norm.

So, what I've decided is this:

Any smoking leads to more smoking.
The only thing that leads to not smoking... is not smoking.
It's the Compound Effect (I dunno, I heard about it on some blog, but that's the basic concept).

And that, most importantly, it's OK to miss it. It's OK to miss who you were. The longer you try to be your new self, the longer and easier you will be able to keep up being your new self, and eventually you will be the same person, just a bit different.

Mostly making this so I have notifications to check throughout the night.

Gonna try something unusual

I've tried damn near everything to quit. Patches, gum, wellbutrin, vaping...

Gonna try and replace this bad habit with a good one. Instead of smoking I'll write and post the results on this thread every evening for one week (on a business trip, so I won't have a standard daily schedule like I usually do. Seems like as good a time as any). If that works I'll go back to posting to blogs and /r/writingprompts but for now I'll be making this sub my digital home.

Wish me luck ladies and gents. Cheers.

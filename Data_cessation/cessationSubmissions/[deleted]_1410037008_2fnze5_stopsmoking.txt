Day 9 - had an actual nightmare that I smoked last night

That's right, I had a dream last night that I lit up a cigarette. In the dream, I took one puff, looked in the mirror, and felt completely disgusted. I woke up this morning relieved. 

The cravings are almost entirely gone, too. Had maybe 2 seconds this morning where I thought I could use a smoke. Immediately put the thought out of my head and I was all good :)

Stuck in a vicious cycle

As I'm reading this I'm smoking and loath everything about it.

Every night I quit, and every morning I say I'll quit tonight.

Clearly these stupid sticks have driven me insane considering Einsteins definition: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

The longest I've quit is 2 weeks, I've done all the research possible, Allan Carr's Easyway, you name if I've tried it.

I'm 22 years old and really want to quit, but the cycle just keeps enticing me.

Help.

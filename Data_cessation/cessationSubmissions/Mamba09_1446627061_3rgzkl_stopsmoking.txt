Introduction...

Hello everyone, I just wanted to introduce myself as this subreddit looks like it could be a good tool in my quitting journey. 

I had my first cigarette at 12 years old and was smoking every day by 14 which means that for the last 12 years of my life I've smoked every single day. That is a really horrible thing to have to admit to. 

I also want to post my motivation factors here so I have something to look at when times get tough so they main ones are: 1. Getting fitter so I can take my dogs out on longer and more energetic walks without feeling like my lungs are about to explode, 2. Being able to go on a meditation retreat at a monastery without nicotine cravings interfering with my practise, 3. Being a better role model to my sisters who are currently the age I was when I started smoking all the time, I don't want for them to think that cigarettes are anything other than horrible, nasty things that should be avoided at all costs and finally 4. No longer contributing to an industry that carries out horrific tests on animals that don't deserve that treatment. 

I can't wait for Monday and my quit date! 

Sorry about the length of this post - tl;dr hello, I'm excited to be here :).

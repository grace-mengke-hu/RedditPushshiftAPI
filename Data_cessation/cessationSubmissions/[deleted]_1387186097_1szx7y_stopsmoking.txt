God damn it's hard when your friends are generous and your 7-eleven clerk is super kind.

I took a cigarette from a friend the other day when he lit up in his car - I had asked for just a drag, which I would have reset my badge for anyway out of guilt, but he had a cold, so I took a whole one. Uch. I felt so gross later, like this burning in my lungs. Ewww. I then realized that my cravings flared up ridiculously badly on Friday; late that night, I bought a pack and smoked one on the drive home. I took that pack into the kitchen and snapped all of the other 19 into quarter-sized bits and ground them up into the trash, which I then took out. I'm not going to slide too far downhill, this is just a short misstep and I'll keep on keeping on. Thanks for listening and being here, /r/stopsmoking!

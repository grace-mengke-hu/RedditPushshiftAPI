the small things - maybe the ladies can relate...and maybe some of the men :)

Last night I was taking off my nail polish and realized it was so nice to look down at the cotton ball and not see any weirdo yellow/brown stuff that was rubbing off from my fingers!  

Gosh smoking is gross!

Just thought I would leave this here as a reminder to keep focusing on the little things that can seem like huge victories.

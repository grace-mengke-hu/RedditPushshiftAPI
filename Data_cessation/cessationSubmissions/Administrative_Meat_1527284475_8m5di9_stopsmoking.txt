I don't want to depress anyone but I've been here before

I feel like this sub is a really positive place so I'm sorry for what I'm about to say! 

I have quit before and I didn't smoke for close to a year. Part of that success was coming on here and at least commenting every day even if I didn't post every day. Then I thought I had it under control and I didn't smoke for a long time. But then I did. And I kept smoking for a while too. 

I think having a community of non-smokers made a big difference. I don't want to clutter up the sub but I'm going to post or comment at least once a day unless there's some major crisis. 

No badge yet because I smoked this morning. But I'm ready to stop! It's stinky, my throat hurts and I can't really articulate the arguments that got me to start smoking again although drinking was a big part of it and I had to quit that recently too. Woohoo! Slowly but surely getting my life back in order.

Anyway, thanks r/stopsmoking for being a great place to be. Y'all really helped me out last time and I'm looking forward to making better choices with all of you. :)

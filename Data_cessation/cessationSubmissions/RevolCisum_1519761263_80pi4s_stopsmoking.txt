Trying Again

The cravings feel like they are lasting for hours/days.  I am trying to quit cold turkey, and feeling pretty defeated that I can't seem to do it.  I make it 3 or 4 days and cave.  I quit for 9 months before, using lozenges for a week or two, but something was different in my mind then.  I literally didn't even want to smoke then, and didn't have a single drag for 9 months,  no problem.  I need to quit, but I guess I don't want to badly enough?  Smoking since 15/16, am now 42.  I hate this habit.

Smoking doesn't, so what does?

Day 10, third day without the patch. I have a question about cravings.

We all know that feeling. The twisting, uncomfortable, anxious feeling. The back of the mind ogre saying, "I want. Now!"

I broke down and smoked part of a cigarette. Puff 1 tasted like crap. Puff 2 also tasted like crap and made me feel a bit jittery-dizzy. Puff 3 didn't change for the better and I stubbed it out.

So if that feeling that we all identify as a nicotine craving wasn't made better by smoking, what actually will relieve it? Water doesn't help it. Candy doesn't. Smoking doesn't. What will?

Almost 3 weeks! Thanks everybody!

This subreddit has been an amazing help for me. The positivity and the flair that tracks my accomplishment are awesome. Thank you guys! I actually had a smoking dream a few nights ago and knowing that I had to reset my counter really bummed me out. And then I woke up! Something about this community has burrowed into my subconscious and it's super helpful for me. I'm very grateful for all of you here. And good luck to anyone reading this who's on the fence. Hop off and join us! The grass really is greener on this side!

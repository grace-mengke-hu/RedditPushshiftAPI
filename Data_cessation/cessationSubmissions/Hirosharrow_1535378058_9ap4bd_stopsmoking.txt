Day 1 - again.

After just over a full week, I slipped over the weekend, so starting over today. This is not the story of a loss, this is just one point in the larger game.

Remember, my fellow players, quitting this game is a marathon, not a sprint! If you play again, get back out of it, set the goal of non-participation again, and keep trying not to try it!

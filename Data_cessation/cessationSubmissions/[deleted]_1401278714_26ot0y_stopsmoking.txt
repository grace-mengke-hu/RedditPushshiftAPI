How to get my mom [56] to quit?

I'm sorry, I'm sure that similar iterations of this question appear frequently here, but I wasn't able to locate any related threads. 

She's smoked a half pack a day for about 20 years. I smoke too, and sometimes we do it together, which is obviously bad for both of us. When I talk to her about quitting, she shuts down completely. I've offered to quit with her, I've directed her to numerous resources (livestrong phone app, therapy, the patch, etc), I've given her guilt and positive motivation, but she won't hear any of it. 

Her lifestyle is very healthy otherwise, but she's developed a terrible hack and I'm terrified that she's going to get sick. 

Has anyone ever successfully motivated you to quit? Am I psychologically reinforcing her addiction by pushing her?

Dear Gawd, What Have I Done???

After smoking 2 packs a day for 28 years, I broke all of my remaining cigarettes (42 of them) at work and disposed of my portable "smokeless" ashtray.  I have not had a cigarette in 4.5 hours and in 28 years, have never quit longer that 35.5 hours.  I am going to be a ball of freakin' sunshine, I can feel it.

I have no clue what withdrawal is like beyond 35.5 hours.  I have never made it to the other side.  I just bought a newer car and realized that the entire back seat is covered in ash.  I'm not destroying another car with cigarette smoke.

All day, I've been catching whiffs of how bad my hair smells.  This is pretty damn disgusting, considering I'm female.  No wonder I'm single.

In a wonderful moment of self-righteousness, I noticed the dirt bag employee from the company next door outside smoking.  I don't want to be lumped into that category.  I know she had bedbugs and probably has herpes...

I made a list of all the people I knew who still smoked.  NONE of them were my friends and ALL of them fit into the stereotype of low income trailer trash.  I am not making fun of low income trailer trash, just the ones I know.  Believe me, they're losers...

Anyway, it has occurred to me that I had lunch and am now starting to lose my damn mind.  This was a rather spur of the moment decision, but what's done is done.  I left my emergency juice at home because I wasn't supposed to quit until tomorrow.  I guess I'll manage until I get home.

This should be about as pleasant as seeing my ex-husband in a pair of women's panties...

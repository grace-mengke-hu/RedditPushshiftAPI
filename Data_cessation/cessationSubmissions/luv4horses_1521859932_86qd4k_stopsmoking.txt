Day 15

So I was quit for 2 months and started back about 3 weeks ago. Now I've been quit for 15 days again. I only use the nic gum and chew about 3 pieces a day. What made me start back last time is i got tired of chewing the gum and wanted the real thing. Now I feel like I have to wean myself off the gum. What do you all recommend?   How can I get off the gum?

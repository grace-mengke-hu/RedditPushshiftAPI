Cold-turkey!

Day 3. I won't say it's easy, but it's important. I know it'll eventually go away, but I feel a hefty void accompanying my coffee, my driving, and my telephone conversations. I have found so many of your posts helpful (chewing gum, scented hand lotion, avoiding boredom and idle hands), and on day 3, I can report that what is really working for me is keeping active and busy. There are so many little projects to do and negative feelings to hike away. In my experience addiction is fueled by boredom. Don't just sit, think, and feel. Distract yourself and stay busy. Though I feel like I'm losing my mind at times throughout the day, working myself keeps me on-track. We can do it!

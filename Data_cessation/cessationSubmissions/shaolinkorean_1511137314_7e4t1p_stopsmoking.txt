Third times a charm? Smokers flu

Hi all,

This is basically my third time trying to quit.  Three years ago I was actually successful for a whole year but for some reason I went back.  I did quit again recently for a week but went back.  Today though it has been 9 days since I last had a cigarette and I went cold turkey.  I was smoking close to two packs a day for the past 4 months but a pack a day for about 6 years.  Prior to that it was a half a pack a day for about 10 years or so.  

As of this past Friday I came down with a head cold, runny nose, a bit of coughing, etc etc.  Just started a low grade fever today and noticed this happened to me the last time I tried to quit smoking for a second time.  Is this normal?

Anyways I know this time I’m done.  No more cigarette and I know for sure this time this is it.  The other times I had to fight the urge but this time I didn’t have to fight the urge.  Still got anxiety though but that will past.

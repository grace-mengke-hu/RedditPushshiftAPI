4 days without a cigarette, 24 hours without nicotine of any kind.

I decided to quit a few days ago, made it through the first few days with the help of an e-cig. Around lunchtime yesterday, I decided I was going to see how long I could go without it. Two hours turned to four, four turned to eight, etc. I’ve made it 24 hours without any sort of nicotine. I’m sure that today and tomorrow, as nicotine begins to totally leave my body, cravings and general unease will get worse, but I keep telling myself “one more hour”.

I posted here a couple days ago saying I thought I was hopeless, and that’s true, I thought I was. It’s cliche as heck to say “if I can do it, anyone can” but in my case, it’s literally true. Let’s all beat this thing!

4 years without a cigarette

I didn't notice it but two days ago I hit the four year mark.  I was a very heavy smoker like two packs a day.  For me quitting took a lot of practice, failed attempts and learning.  I'm not going to lie the first few weeks were hard but it got easier.  Quitting was completely worth it the long run.  I gained a little weight but I breath, smell and taste 300% better.  I will never ever smoke another cigarette in this lifetime.  Good luck to all you quitters and fight the good fight.

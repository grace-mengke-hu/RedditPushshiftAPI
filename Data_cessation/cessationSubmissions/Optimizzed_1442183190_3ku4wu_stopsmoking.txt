50 days, but then....

Oh man I thought I was safe. I had zero desire to smoke. I made it to around 50 days. Except, my room mate smokes. One night while she was asleep I noticed her cigarettes and decided that if I had one no one would know. That was it. That's how I blew it. I didn't have an emotional crisis to set it off, nothing. I smoked the cigarette and remember thinking how it meant nothing, why would I ever want to do that again? And then the next day I stole another cigarette. After a couple days I confessed to my room mate and requested she keep her cigarettes hidden... but then I just went looking through her room and found them. I was like, stealing cigarettes and "taking the garbage out" to smoke them. After awhile I bought a pack to repay her cigarettes I stole. As of last night I was smoking my third pack since quitting. I just fucking sat there and chain-smoked. Today my chest feels absurdly awful. So, reset the badge, back to day one

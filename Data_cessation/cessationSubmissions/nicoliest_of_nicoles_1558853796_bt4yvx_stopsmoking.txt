I want to try something I’ve not done in a long while...

1:02am this morning, I smoked the last cigarette in my pack. My goal is to not smoke for one whole year. I’ve quit many times, I’ve read Allen Carr’s book several times but I’ve never made it a year. For now I’ll just strive for 24hrs while simultaneously not having a bad attitude or needing copious amounts of sleep.

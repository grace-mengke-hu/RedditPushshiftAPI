Want to go play pool in a few hours but don't know if I should...

I quit on August 3rd, cold turkey, and it's been pretty easy so far other than the first and some of the second day. Haven't really been thinking about smoking too much, but have been having smoking dreams every other night if not every night. I was invited to go to a pool hall tonight to play pool. The friends who invited me don't smoke and know I'm quitting, but I'm sure other people there will be smoking. I haven't been to play pool in a while, but when I'd go I'd have a few cigs. 

I just wanted to ask you guys and girls if you think I should just skip today and stay home? Or if I should go and fight the urge. I really want to go, and realize I can't hide from smoking forever, I have to learn to say no to a cigarette and not want to smoke. Is this a good idea though? Or would it be wise to wait another week? 

Thanks for any advice.

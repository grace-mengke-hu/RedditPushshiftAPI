Weight gain, 14 days quit

Feeling great after 14 days quit but I have to admit a few pounds are starting to creep on. Trying not to be vain about this because I realize the extra Pounds are a better trade off than smoking but as a woman in her 30s, it does give me pause. I haven't been going crazy eating but I probably have given myself permission for a few extras. Thinking of starting a low carb diet tomorrow which has worked in the most but wondering if anyone has successfully dieted and maintained their quit. I don't want to put myself over the edge and slip... TIA!!!

Is it possible?

Hey friends!

I just passed the 100-day mark, and I'm feeling great. I can smell everything, I enjoy food more, I am a cardio machine now, etc. However, I still feel like I miss cigarettes. Not in every day life - the freedom from cravings is a beautiful, beautiful thing. But, for example, I was planning on going to a concert last weekend, and was convinced that I'd find myself smoking. And, if I didn't smoke, I'd be thinking about smoking the whole time and have a crap experience. In the end, I didn't go to said concert. So, with all of this in mind, I ask you: Is it possible to smoke once every few months without falling completely on my face? 

This is my first quit attempt and I couldn't have gotten this far without all of your help, so I appreciate any insight you might have here. In my mind, I'm kind of rationalizing that when I set out, I wasn't trying to go X amount of days without cigarettes, I was trying to break the habit and no longer be dependent on cigarettes. I have a bunch of friends who "only smoke at concerts," and wonder if that's a possible for a former 10-12 cigs-a-day smoker. So is this something that I should try for myself, or is this the recipe for disaster?

Thanks for listening!

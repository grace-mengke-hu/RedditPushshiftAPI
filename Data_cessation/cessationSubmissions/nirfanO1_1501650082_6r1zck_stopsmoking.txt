I Quit

Dear Marlboro,

Thank you. Thanks a lot for being on my side during my tough times. Thank you for being with me during my ups and downs. Thank you for being with me when I woke up, when I slept, when I was at work, when I was with my friends, even when I didn't need you. A big thanks for everything but this has to end here, you and me. I never anticipated in the beginning that we would last this longer but hell, you made me addicted to you for 7 long years. But that is it, I don't need you anymore.

Yes. I am done. I am done paying from my health for your company. My love for you has been long gone and now my addiction for you has to go away. This is not the first time that I am breaking up with you but this for sure is going to be the final one.

The time when I started seeing you was the sweetest, you got me high every time I was with you..... but now after 7 years when I am with you, it feels so stressful, it feels like I am losing some thing of myself. You are the cause for increase in my visits to the doctor. I have been introduced to new terms like bronchitis, hair loss, fatigue, constipation, heavy breathing in my prescriptions. Though everybody has told me about the toxicity of being in relationship with you, I never took them seriously. But now I can see what they meant by and I can't take it anymore.

To be frank, it is not you , it is the person who introduced you to me at that party 7 years ago, I hate the most. I wish I had gone to the loo when you came across us that night , I wish I was never in that party, I wish I was never friends with him. I just wish you never came into my life.

I had left my ex, Rothmans, for you but this time I am not leaving you for somebody else. I am leaving you for myself, for my own health.

Yours, (Not anymore)

 An ex-Smoker.

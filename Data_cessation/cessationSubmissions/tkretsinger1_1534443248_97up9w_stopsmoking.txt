2 weeks down!

Iâ€™m officially at my two week mark of quitting smoking and chewing. I accomplished this with the assistance on Chantix. I plan on stopping the Chantix in 5 days when my starter pack is out. I have had terrible bad dreams and has become difficult to fall asleep. Does anyone have tips for staying quit after stopping Chantix?

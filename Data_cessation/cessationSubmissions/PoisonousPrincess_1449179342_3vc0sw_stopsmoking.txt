I desperately need to quit smoking. Help! How did you/are you doing it?

So my 3 year old daughter and myself have just been diagnosed with whooping cough. We are both vaccinated, I even had  booster shot a month ago, and we still caught it. Despite the fact I'm coughing constantly, I'm still craving and smoking. I fully realise that smoking is a terrible thing to be doing while having whooping cough. I'm kind of hoping the cough will get bad enough to force me to stop, but that hasn't happened yet. 

So what are your best tips guys? How do you get through the cravings? My partner is also a smoker, and it makes it hard when he's always going outside for a smoke. Just though I should add that I do not smoke around my daughter at all, or allow her to be near cigarette smoke. God, this is tough :(

Quit smoking mental stuff

I stopped smoking 3 days ago and i have noticed on day 2 and day 3 that when i walk, drive, sit etc i feel weird. I can't exatly explain how it feels but i feel like i am in a tunnel or not mentaly there, i try to focus on the current moment but i cant i steel feel empty...  Am i the only one who experience this while quitting?

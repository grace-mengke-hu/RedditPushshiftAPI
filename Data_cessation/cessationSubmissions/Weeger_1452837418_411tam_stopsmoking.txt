Anyone else suffer with eczema flare ups since quitting?

I have eczema on my hands and it has flared up really badly. Feels like someone is dragging razor blades across my palms. Have tried the usual lotions and potions but was wondering if this might be linked to my quitting and if so should settle down soon? Anyone else had a similar problem?

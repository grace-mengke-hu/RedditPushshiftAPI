I think I need help.

I've been a heavy smoker for 14 years (20 or more a day). I tried Allen Carr's method last year and I went about a week (the longest I've ever managed) without smoking, everything was fine! I wasn't having cravings at all. Then, all of a sudden, I woke up one day and was desperate for a cigarette. I mean really desperate. I was freaking out, as a matter of fact, I was crying my eyes out as I drove to the grocery store to buy a pack.

So ok, I smoked for few more months, and I tried again, same thing happened. Except it lasted two or three days. Another period of months smoking (failed and short-lived will-power method attempts peppered throughout this time). Yesterday, I gave it another shot with Allen Carr's. I listened to the audio book, watched the video and quit. Threw my pack, lighter and ashtray out and everything. Everything was fine until I woke up today and BAM, desperate, freaking out. (btw, I dug that pack out of the garbage can when I woke up, how pathetic is that?).

What am I doing wrong?

I keep going over his instructions in my head, I'm aware of all the brainwashing, I know I'm not supposed to smoke, but at the same time, I'm literally pacing all over the house fighting this battle inside my head.

Have any of you dealt with this type of thing when trying his method?

Are there any other methods that you would recommend? 
I have also tried the patches and the chewing gum, despite agreeing with Allen Carr's view on them. The patches gave me a hell of a rash and the chewing gum did nothing for me.

Please help. I'm really desperate. Thank your for reading and I'm sorry for the long post. :/

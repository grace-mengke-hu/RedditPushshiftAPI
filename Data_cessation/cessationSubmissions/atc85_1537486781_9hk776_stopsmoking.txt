Trying so f**king hard, BUT

At work lately, it seems everyday is harder. I am being undermined by my boss so it’s making my job almost impossible. I teach tiny humans. There is a few severely, I’ll just say it, violent crazies in there this year. This one kid had cause injury to kids 3times this wk, one has to go to the hospital, but when I tried to punish him by doing a referral (makes guardian come in to deal with the problem) she just said she’ll take care of it- which means she’ll do nothing but “talk” to him. Talking involves playing and lots of candy. Like wtf. I got a very u happy parent messaging me now about her son still saying he’s hurting, I’m worried to death cause I feel responsible since her child. I love that kid. I went to school with mom so she knows there was nothing I could do but what I’ve done but I really fee shitty that this isn’t being dealt with according. Btw, this same kid grabbed another child’s butt (so sexually harassed the child) last wk and they (the higher ups) convinced the girl it was an accident because oh he was crying so don’t she think it could be an accident. Before y’all ask, it’s women higher ups. I sooo badly want to report them to the higher ups but then I’m being insubordinate. I usually would just say fuck this shit, and smoke to try to not think about it. But I’m fighting that so bad. I just can’t. It’s making me depressed. I just feel I was happier when I was smoking. Like I don’t remember things being this fucking bad.

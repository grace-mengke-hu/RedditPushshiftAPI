Backstory! A friend of mine had noticed I've been trying to quit lately and gave me a vape two weeks ago. I had been blowing my meager money on a pack a day and could not get off for the life of me, so I couldn't afford one myself.

I bought some flavors at 6% to try them out with the mentality that I HAD to quit, and I haven't touched a cigarette since. Threw my pack away last week and I've waited a bit to make sure, but it looks like cigarettes are finally out of my life! My front porch smells nice again and I feel a hell of allot better! I'm going through at most $24 of liquid ($16 if I can limit myself, which I'm working on) vs $50 of cigarettes a week. Vaping also tastes a hell of allot better and I don't smell terrible all the time. I'm going to stay at 6% for a bit and then ween myself down to just the flavors themselves. 

Thank you guys for the support here, allot of people recommended vaping and it worked incredibly well for me.

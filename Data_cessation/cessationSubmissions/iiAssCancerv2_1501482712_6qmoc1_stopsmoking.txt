Get my parents to quit. (Advice)

I'm 15, and both my parents smoke heavily.
I'm actually pretty afraid of my leath, as they smoke in the house, in the car and even in my room sometimes when my Mom or Dad is talking to me.
They have come close to quitting. My Dad did quit aswell, but my Mom ended up bringing him back to it, as she kept smoking when he used Vaping, and slowly cut back on Vaping until he was done. (He was close, but didn't ever reach the end.)
I'm just scared to lose my parents, and that's why I've made an account for this. (I don't want anyone I know personally to see this, as some of my friends know my main Reddit account.)

My Dad's already lost all of his teeth, he's 47.
My Mom has Multiple Sclerosis and Brain lesions, and the smoking to top that off.

I just don't want to be this young at the very least when I end up losing them. Any advice anyone can give?

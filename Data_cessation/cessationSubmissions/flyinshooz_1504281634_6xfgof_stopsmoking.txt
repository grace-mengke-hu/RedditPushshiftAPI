things that work for me things that dont

on day 19. have had good days and bad. mostly bad!

-Things that work-

Exercise: mostly running and lots of it. ive been training for a 10k which gives me a goal and date to work towards. It tires me out, and makes me feel good. I cant be a smoker and a runner too so it would ruin my hard earned progress if i lit up again. It has also helped me avoid some of the weight gain ive been hearing about.

Toothpicks: pure destruction.

Confrontation: i told myself this time im not changing my life. I'm still drinking coffee, going to bars etc. this option seems counter-intuitive, is VERY risky, and difficult but every time i beat the trigger, i feel super empowered.

Bouncing a ball: pretty simple, i have a ball and i go outside and bounce it for a few minutes when i get a craving. kinda helps

-Things that dont-

Praise: for some reason when someone tells me "oh thats great, keep it up" , "i know its tough but you can do it" , or "im so proud of you!" ....it makes me want to punch them in the face and go buy a pack. seems like positive reinforcement from family and friends should be a great thing to have but i just hate everyone right now so, ya.

Discussing quitting: when it comes up, it makes me think about smoking, not think about quitting. i have to walk away from these conversations

Breathing exercises, meditation: ive noticed this help marginally, but it doesnt make the craving go away sometimes it makes me hyper focus on it. maybe i need to break though or dig deeper. still working on this one 

so thats it. im feeling confident about it this time. devoted enough to create a reddit account so i can post this! this forum has helped a lot too

Day 4 almost done, but

I'm so close to caving. I keep reminding myself why I'm quitting and that one puff will lead to 1,000s of more cigs until I can get up enough courage to quit again. Nothing seems to calm the raging monster. This is the hardest thing I've had to do ever. ugh I want to just cry myself to sleep and hopefully wake up a little less irrational.

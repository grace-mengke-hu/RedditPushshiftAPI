This is my last day as a smoker.

I really want to quit and I've been putting it off falling into the trap of excuses (now's not the right time, I'll quit when I'm ready, etc). I decided this is it, not putting it off anymore, I'm DONE. I still don't feel ready, but I don't think I ever will be. I never wanted to be a smoker all! This is it this is it this is it!

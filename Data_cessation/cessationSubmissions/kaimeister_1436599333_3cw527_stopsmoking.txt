Don't know how to give advice to others after I stopped.

I smoked for about 18 years, and I smoked a lot. But then I managed to quit and it was embarrassingly easy. So now I don't really know what to tell others when they ask me for advice. "Just stop and enjoy that you did" seems so stuck up and unhelpful. But I want to communicate to people they it isn't as hard as they imagined. Any advice?

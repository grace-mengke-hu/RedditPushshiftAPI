Day 1

Today has just become my day 1.
My wife found out (again! Fuck.) That I'm smoking at work. I've tried so many things.
Gums, ecigs, patches. Nothing does it. I don't know if I've really wanted it before, but the pain in her eyes... Its too much. I have to fix this, but I need help. I don't know what to do.

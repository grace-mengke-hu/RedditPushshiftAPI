I did it!

It has officially been a week since my last smoke. Two weeks since I finished my last pack. I had some weak moments in the first week and smoked 4 times but regretted it and didn't enjoy any of them and am happy to say I have gone a full week without. I have been a long time lurker and am glad to finally be one of the gang here.

Haven't smoked or vaped for almost two monthz

So a little back story of how I got into smoking. I was in my 3rd year of college when I got stressed over a class and finally started smoking. My friends always smoked around me as well my dad, but I didn't let that influence me. I did it knowing the consequences. Fast forward post grad, I started to vape which lasted me about two years before I went cold turkey. The last time I recall vaping was around two months ago. As of recent, Ive had complications with a friend, and stressed with applying for pharmacy school. I found myself buying a pack of cigarettes last week. I actually pulled over to the sidewalk after leaving the gas station just to reevaluate my decision. I didn't open it, instead I gave it to a friend who still smokes. And I just discovered this subreddit to vent about my current struggle of myself wanting to smoke, but as well restraining myself. I'm not sure what to do. Advice?

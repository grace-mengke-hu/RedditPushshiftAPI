Question About Nicotine Gum

Trying out nicotine gum. I hear that you shouldn't chew it like regular gum, because excessive saliva production will cause you to swallow the nicotine into your stomach. Problem is I just seem to produce a ton of saliva regardless, so I'm wondering if I should spit my saliva out.

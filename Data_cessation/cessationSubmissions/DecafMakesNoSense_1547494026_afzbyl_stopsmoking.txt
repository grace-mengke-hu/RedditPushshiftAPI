Lethargic?

Anyone feel lethargic/tired immediately after quitting?  I quit for about a month a year ago (back to smoking now unfortunately).  I could NOT get my energy going in the morning after quitting.  My routine had been, for years, to wake at 430 am, have about 5 cigs and three cups of coffee before going to the gym around 0600.  I had no energy in the gym.  So I bought one of those things I saw on Shark Tank--it was marketed to lock up sweets for those trying to diet.  I used it for smokes, and it worked pretty well--for awhile.  I'd have my alloted five, lock up the pack for the rest of the day, and go on with my day.  But I feel as though going back to 5/day (in the mornings) was the reason I started back up again.  BTW, the locking box does work well for curtailing.  Even when craving, I had two choices:  one, to use a hammer to crack open the box (not a good idea, reeks of desperation, and a waste of $50), and two, drive to nearest store, which was 15 minutes away.  Cravings were never so bad to give in to either of these.

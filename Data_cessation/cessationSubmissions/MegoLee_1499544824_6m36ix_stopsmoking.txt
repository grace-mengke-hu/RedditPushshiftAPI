3 weeks, patches, games & I can even have a beer!

So today marks 3 weeks. I've used patches as directed. Never have I been able to go this long without a slip or a vape and I was smoking for 15 years. I found that games are extremely helpful in the "doing something" department. I play super smash brothers or cooking fever or angry birds or cards or scrabble! Anything to keep my mind occupied. I know I'm not off nicotine but for me the habit and time passing is harder to deal with, however the patches have helped with the going mad and psycho or crying and being mean. Slowly I will wean off those too and it feels amazing. Some days I get slightly depressed but I know that's my addiction trying to sway me into a puff. I even find that I can drink. I took a 12 hour road trip, went to a wedding, visited bars and went to a couple parties. All those things are triggers for me. But, No smokes! It feels good to be on the other side now, I no longer have to feel the shame of sneaking away for a cig or being the only one in a group who "has to have one" and also I really love not waking up feeling like death. Can't wait to hit my 30 days! This is the real deal folks, keep going!

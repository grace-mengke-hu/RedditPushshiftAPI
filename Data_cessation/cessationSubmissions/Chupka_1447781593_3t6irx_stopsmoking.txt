1 year no cigarettes

It's a landmark I never thought I would reach. I needed people who support me in my life to make it there. Not so much that as people who don't try to drag me down. I used to have friends who would literally remind me they'd give me smokes when I was quitting. Especially when I was drunk, "oh this cig tastes so good". My quitting discomforted them because then why couldn't they do it? Now hardly any of my friends smoke and the ones that do are respectful, even jealous in their words, of my ability to overcome addiction

Been lurking around here for a while and....

I have finally decided that I need to end my addiction.. But I'm almost certain that I won't be able to it just on my own. 
I'm more of an audial learner and I've grown accustom to podcasts. 
Are there any podcasts that can help me quit smoking ?
I tried /r/podcasts and they couldn't answer. 
Thanks

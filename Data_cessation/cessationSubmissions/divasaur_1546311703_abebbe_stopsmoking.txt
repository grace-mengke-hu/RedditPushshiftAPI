I just went through my very first major craving and I beat it

4 days in. The craving felt like hours, I'm still shaking... but suddenly I feel relief. It feels like I actually smoked that cigarette I wanted to buy off of someone on the street. I feel amazing. I'm in charge here. Holy shit, I did it.

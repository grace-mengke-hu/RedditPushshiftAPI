How can I help my friend quit smoking?

How do I help my friend who looks like he is dying due to smoking more than 20+ cigarettes per day. He cannot even breath like a normal person anymore, it feels like his lungs are struggling to keep up. He makes a loud gasping sound when breathing and breathes from his mouth atleast twice a minute. I don't know if it is too late or not but he is just 26 years old and has been smoking 20+ cigarettes for the past 9-10 years.

I keep telling him to cut down but it feels like he is trapped and is unable to give up the urge. I requested him to cut down to half he wants to but it seems he does not have control anymore.

What steps I can take to really really help him. I can stop him from smoking when he is with me but once he goes back to his home he smokes cigarettes back to back and I feel very sorry for him. I was once a victim to this evil I manged to quit with lots and lots of will power. I hope I can help him.

I just had another cigarette

Recently I started feeling depressed, and because of that I basically relapsed from a 100 day quit. So far I haven't even smoked a whole pack yet. I'm hoping I can quit while I'm ahead.

I was outside in the cold and the dark, thinking, "this is so stupid and gross" I seriously feel dizzy and sick right now. I was so grossed out that I just flushed my pack.

I think I need to be mindful of times that I might get depressed, and address those, so that I don't fall back into this habit. I guess I will reset my badge.

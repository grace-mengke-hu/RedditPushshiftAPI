Quit smoking tobacco almost a month ago, now weed is taking over

I quit smoking almost a month ago but now I'm starting to crave weed, I smoked weed less than 10 times in my life but in the last month I abused it around 3 times.. Am I on the way to replace tobacco with marijuana? How can I stop this?

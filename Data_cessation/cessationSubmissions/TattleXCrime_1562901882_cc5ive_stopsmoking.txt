Question about the patch

I know I should quit smoking and mostly want to quit but I also don’t have anything that quite exactly matches it to relieve my stress. I’m also a writer/film editor and have gotten super used to smoking while doing this. It feels wrong to not have a smoke while doing these activities. I have manage to cut down a lot but I can’t stop entirely. 

I’ve also tried doing other things instead of smoking. Literally everything people suggest to do instead but it doesn’t work. My life sucks and is stressful. I hate where I live and my roommates and am in massive debt. Nothing is going right not one thing. I also can’t see anything for my future. As much as I don’t want to die a horrible smoking related death because I don’t,  I also find nothing helps my stress levels more than a cigarette. I’ve tried multiple times too. 

The one time I’ve tried the patch it irritated the hell out of my skin, swelled up, and got super itchy. Can’t stand the taste of the gum. No, I’m not making excuses if I could honestly get just one of these things to work I would. Is there any possible way to quit smoking while living in a high stress environment that you hate and have literally no way of escaping for the next 40 years?

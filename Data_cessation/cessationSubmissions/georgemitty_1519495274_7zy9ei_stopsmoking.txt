The first cigarette.

Started smoking when I was 15, am 25 now. Over the past 10 years the thought of quitting has come up every now and then but never stuck. My country raised cigarette taxes a couple of days ago.

Came across this thread and read many of your stories here. Reminded me of my first real cigarette. Before I inhaled I thought to myself: why do people even smoke? After inhaling accidentally I finally understood why. My heart beat faster, my knees went weak and there was this ringing in my ear. Amidst all these I found myself feeling so relaxed. What began as experimentation turned into what is now a 25 stick a day habit.

It occurred to me that I no longer feel that strong sensation (dare I say pleasure?) Not even the first cig of the day. Not even when having a cig after not having had one for 12 hours. 

Then, Why do I still smoke? I smoke when I am working, when I am reading and writing, when I am watching a movie at home. Why do I do this?

When the store opens I am going to pick up some nicotine gum and see how it goes.

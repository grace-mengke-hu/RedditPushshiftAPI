300 down!

I remember being a week in and thinking that this would be unattainable but, here I am. I tried and failed several times before and it took a toll on my confidence. This time hasn't been without it's hard parts but I have been able to do it. It has built my confidence in ways I couldn't have imagined.  I'm back to mountain biking regularly and I'm able to run more than a hundred feet without being winded. And food, holy moly, food tastes so much better.  So cheers to all of you quitters out there.  Stay strong and thanks for all of the support.

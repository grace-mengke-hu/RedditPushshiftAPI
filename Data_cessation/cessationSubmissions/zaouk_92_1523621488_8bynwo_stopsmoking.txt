Day 2.5

I’m at work and lots of my colleagues are smokers. They are much older than me and have been smoking for longer than I. And looking at them and listening to them makes me realize I don’t want to end up like them: crappy teeth, pasty skin, one guy looks 60 when he’s actually 45, really bad cough, shortness of breath...
The worst part of all is that I loved the smell, taste, feel in the lungs. I keep fantasizing of that one hit, it’s driving me insane

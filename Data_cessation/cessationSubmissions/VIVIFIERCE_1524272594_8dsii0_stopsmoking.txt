day four... I'm trying(?)!

On day four cold turkey... been pretty great so far.... but today the cravings have been much stronger.  I want to run and grab a pack, have a puff - then throw away the pack.  BUT I want this time to be different and I don't want to do that.  I'm trying to find strength.  Trying to cruise through.

Thanks for listening!

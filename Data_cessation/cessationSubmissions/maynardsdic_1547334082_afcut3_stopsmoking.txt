Doing great!

I haven't exactly been keeping track of my progress,  but for the past two and half months I've switched to vaping instead of smokes and have only bought 2 packs in this time. I feel way better, but often find myself craving smokes pretty aggressively in the morning as my morning smoke used to be the thing that signalled it's time to start my day. Just thought I'd share my progress.

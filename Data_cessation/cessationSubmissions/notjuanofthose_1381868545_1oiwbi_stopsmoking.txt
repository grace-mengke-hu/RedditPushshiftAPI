After 1 week - It does get better, fast

So I'm starting my 2nd week smoke free and here are some comments to those just starting:

- The first three days are TOUGH. I would recommend to stay at home as much as possible and definitely avoid alcohol. Some people think that you should face your triggers as soon as possible, and it makes sense, but you shouldn't make it harder just because you want to face all the triggers ASAP. Give yourself some time. Also know that you *will* get cravings when facing triggers, no matter how long after you quit.

- Facing cravings: drink lots of water, colder = better, sunflower seeds were better for me than gum or candy but I guess that's up to you. 

- Fruits and juice are highly recommended during the first days, I didn't know about this but I think it's good advise

- You will think about smoking practically all the time, there's nothing you can do to stop this. For me it got better around day 6-7. Just today I noticed I didn't feel like smoking after lunch, big surprise as it was one of the strongest urges. During days 3-4 it helped to listen to some [down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPZAYgzyJTw)  [tempo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI25qnsH_M0)  [songs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9UbE1slI-Q) (maybe it's just me,  but music *always* helps)

- I found it was great to face the cravings in my mind. "Smoking won't cure the cravings, it will cause more cravings later" and similar thoughts were quite useful. But I have to be honest, thinking didn't help with the stronger urges, I needed to keep my hands and mouth occupied at those times. [This funny post by /u/megret also helped](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nfqe1/a_year_ago_today_i_was_a_3packsaday_smoker_a_year/)

- The process is MUCH FASTER than I thought (this is my first time quitting). I felt the first benefits on day 2 and I'm feeling much better now, only a week after. The cravings also go away fast once you get past day 3 or 4.

- Write your feelings during the first few days. If later on you want to have a cigarette read them and ask yourself if you want to go through that again. Get a badge or a phone app, having to reset the date is not fun (***it's not an option either!***).

- Come here often, this sub is a great place for comfort, advise, ranting, etc.

I think that's it for now. Keep up the good work.

Sore mouth

Im on day 25, using gum and an e cig occasionally, But let me tell you! My mouth is sore. It feels like a canker sore but did not go away after using some epsom salt. Its mainly in the gums but overall feels like everywere. Im devoted to the gum and im going strong besides the occasional flip out while driving. As soon as I pop a piece in its instant pain. Obviously im cutting back but its not easy. Any body ever delt with this or is it something else in my life you think? Does the gum contain a ton of sugar maybe mixed with the e cig it irritates the gums? I feel if I can make it maybe another week ill be good to cold cut it and go turkey.  Im not sure whats the point of this post. Just wondering if maybe im already into the dread c word stage and should get to the doc immediately. Any questions, answers, advice or kind words are welcomed. You guy have helped immensely getting to this point figured id reach out again.  Rant fin.
Edit: stewing on this im thinking im gona go talk to the doc about it.

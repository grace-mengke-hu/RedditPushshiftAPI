When I smoke I think of Quitting and When I am not I am day dreaming about smoking..

I am 24 Started smoking at 18 in college ...When I was in college or right now at my office I smoke 8 cigarettes a day and about 15 a day on weekends...Right now I am at home and my daily intake is lowered 2 a day....I know I am not a heavy smoker....But I don't like it. Recently read Alen carrs Easy Way To Stop Smoking book trying to quit from last one week. Each day i quit and next day I rationalize in morning one more doesn't hurt...My leg shakes when I smoke when I smoke more than two I get dizzy and cant walk properly...Actually I deep inhale them by smoking through fist closed. Any suggestions or help....?? Actually I forget the drawbacks when I don't smoke...What to do...except patches or gums. Also trying a challenge at r/NoFap subreddit.

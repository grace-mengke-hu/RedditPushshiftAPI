Life at 5 Months - The good and the bad

So I quit 5 months ago cold turkey. Had smoked a pack a day for 10 years. Here are the changes I've seen.

GOOD:
1) I've started to exercise which I haven't really done regularly since high school (I'm 33). I just walk around my building at work and go up and down the steps (4 floors).
2) I replaced nicotine with alcohol and recognized it so I have now cut alcohol out which helps me to sleep better and be more present for my family.
3) After I took out alcohol I replaced that with food and recognized it so now I really watch what I eat and use the LoseIt app to track my calories.
4) I've started drinking lots of water... which I never did before.. just coffee and tea all day. So my skin isn't super dry.
5) Super excited I don't have to stand outside in the cold and rain. I used to always have to have a coat with me, now I never do.
6) I don't smell like crap. I hugged a smoker today and was like HOLY COW DID I SMELL LIKE THAT????
7) My wife respects me more and is very thankful for me quitting
8) Those dark shadows have gone away in terms of seeing cancer ads and always feeling guilty
9) I can sit through mass without wanting to pull my hair out (by the time of the announcements at the end I am usually ready to bolt out the door)
10) I can go out to dinner with friends or family or coworkers and not have to step out for a smoke and come back smelling like an ashtray
11) Have saved $945.
12) Don't have to have a pack of smokes in my pants with sharp corners poking me.

BAD:
1) I did gain about 15 pounds but that can always come off... what I regained that I would have lost is 37 days of my life.
2) I did fall into pretty bad depression two or three weeks into my quit, but I listened to this hypnosis video and it all went away: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2s2bVWWu7A&list=LLhdU0KN03tuu9w6gveE7f7g&index=10

For those of you wondering how I quit... I did it with hypnosis. Just listened to this video before bed with my eyes closed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6A1IOkIsM&index=1&list=LLhdU0KN03tuu9w6gveE7f7g 

I rarely think about smoking at this point. I usually think about it when it is cold or rainy outside and I'm just thankful I can be warm inside. For the odd times the brainwashing comes back (smoking relaxes me, etc), I watch this video explaining the Allen Carr Easy Way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zeZhHq0WtY&t=321s&list=LLhdU0KN03tuu9w6gveE7f7g&index=6

Wish you all the best of luck!

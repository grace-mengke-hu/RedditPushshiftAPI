Days 4 and my god it's tough

So the first 3 days weren't so bad, thought oh yea im totally in the cool and now suddenly im feeling like crap, my body is acting weird, im sometimes in a panic mode of sorts, I got into a fight with my gf and just feeling I guess kinda "dope" sick. I gotta keep on it tho. Im feeling great, I walked up a huge hill and i was so surprised to find that I didn't need to catch my breath. It was so crazy cause my lungs were nit used to not gasping for air after waking up a hill that they felt like they needed some more deep breaths it was sorta annoying but so much better then hacking and gasping for air, I had no idea the effect that nicotine has on your body it's so gross.

Day 4

I've been trying to quit for a little while. I'll go a couple days and then it's "one won't hurt" and I'm back down that slippery slope. 

Well, yesterday I had a doc appointment/physical. We went over my blood work from last week. Everything looks great except I have high cholesterol. He told me if I was ten years older, he'd medicate me. That scares the shit out of me. As a woman in her early 30s, smoking ups the risk for stroke when there shouldn't be one to begin with. Now finding out about the cholesterol, I'm not putting myself in danger. 

I have a 5mo old daughter. I never smoked while pregnant. When she was 2mo old, I convinced my husband we could smoke once a week... Then once a day... There's that slippery slope again. I HATE that I'm smoking as a new mom, but I love smoking. Ugh. And it's always that game of "when we hit (insert milestone/goal/random future day) then we'll quit."

Well, I hit that random future day yesterday, without meaning to. I'm glad I already had the weekend without any. I'm struggling a little; stopping is hard, no matter how you slice it. But this time, I feel motivated. This time, I WANT to be done. I want a life with my family, not an early death. 

Next step: motivate husband to follow my lead.

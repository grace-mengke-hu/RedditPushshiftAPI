29 days and counting!

Almost a month and going strong. Still hard but much easier than the first two weeks.

If you are just starting, be sure it gets better rather quickly. First few weeks are a nightmare!

What's working for me at this point is taking cravings as a sign that i'm breaking an association and forming a new habit.

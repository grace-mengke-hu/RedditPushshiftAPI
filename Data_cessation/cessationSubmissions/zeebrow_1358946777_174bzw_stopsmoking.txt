I am about to start using Chantix, the stop smoking pill, for the second time.  It is truly effective, and I want you to consider it. Please, for your sake, AMA about the experience.

I understand that AMAs are usually done in one sitting, and people answer questions for a few hours immediately after posting.  I have classes sporadically through out the day, so I could get around to answering questions in my free time over the next few days, or however long it takes for the thread to die, or if anyone is even interested to begin with lol.

*background*: I have been a smoker for about 8 years, since I was 15.  The first time I used Chantix was a little less than a year ago, and I quit for 5 months before having a weak moment during a typical college-student Friday night at the bars.  I have been smoking for about 3 or so months since I started again.  I want to do this to encourage people who have had trouble quitting in the past to try this life prolonging medicine.  I am not a doctor.

*EDIT* lets just turn this into a discussion, how about.

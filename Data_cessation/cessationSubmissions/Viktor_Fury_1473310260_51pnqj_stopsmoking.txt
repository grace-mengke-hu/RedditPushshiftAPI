1 Month in and I need help from experienced quitters.

So I'll start at the beginning. Back in my university days I started smoking, at worst it was just shy of a pack a day. After about 3-4 years of smoking in the traditional sense, I decided as a form of harm reduction to switch over to vaping. Boy did I feel great there! No more stink, no more ashes, my lungs felt better (but not 100%), basically everything improved. Aside from one thing. While I smoked, my typical consumption was about 5 cig's a day. When I vaped, it was constant. I mean, I would wake up, vape (typically 6mg juice - not too bad right), vape at work, vape while gaming, watching TV, vape at social occasions. Basically I think it became a complete crutch of mine. I was never one of those 'open-vapers', I did it in my own time, I wasn't blatant about it or anything like that, but it was constant. I really think it became a total crutch for me relating to any stressor, any unpleasant feeling or anything like that. If I didn't vape for a while, I'd start to feel drowsy, brain fogged, anxious etc. So I knew it was an addiction just like smoking. 

So here's how it went:
- I stopped 1 month ago, completely cold turkey. I just flipped and decided I didn't want this crutch in my life anymore. It was also prompted by the fact that while vaping I did have a minor palpitation attack (probably too much nicotine in my system). 

- The first week? Hell. Couldn't function. Didn't want to go outside. My brain felt like complete mush. Couldn't concentrate, all I wanted to do was lie in bed and sleep. Constant anxiety, dizziness/lightheadedness etc. 
- Second week? Panic attacks. Strong, random and accompanied by constant state of brain fog. Couldn't think straight, malls and anything with loud noises/lights (I became really photophobic) completely fried my head - I did start going outside though, walking, working etc. - but every day seriously seriously sucked. 
- Third week, little bit better. Significantly less panic attacks. But still, brain fog (you might be sensing a theme here), anxiety, 1 or 2 attacks in the week. Started mindfulness meditation - this seriously helps. Mindful breathing etc. Amazing stuff - seriously.
- Fourth week, no panic attacks, continued mindful meditation, but still, foggy as hell - especially when watching TV/sitting behind PC/in malls. Just feel completely overwhelmed in my head/dizziness without rotation etc all the time. Only thing that helps? Meditation. If I do 10 minutes, closed eyes, breathing/body scanning etc. I feel great for a while. 

- Now: Same situation, malls trigger something in me, I don't know what it is but I feel like I can't handle too much noise/visual stimuli/flashing lights etc. 

I'm fully aware all of this is related to anxiety/panic disorder. But holy shit I had no idea this would be triggered so strongly by quitting vaping. What scares me/effects me most is that virtually every conventional site/source states that all of those symptoms should be gone within two weeks.

So here's where I'm asking for experiences. How did those of you quit manage? Are there any of you with similar quitting 'symptoms' that I've outlined here - for such an extended period of time? If so, how long?
It's driving me insane and I keep thinking that nicotine masked something underlying. But then flipping and saying, look, you were pumping this crap (read: nicotine) into your head all day every day for a good few years and now your brain is recalibrating back. But it's so disheartening to read people feeling 'incredible' within 2 weeks. Funny thing is, I don't have any 'cravings' in the traditional sense. Just don't seem to be able to 'handle' things like I could while vaping/smoking. 

The only thing that helps is meditating/exercising. But meditating 10 minutes at a time, 6 times a day (or more) can't be sustainable in the long run. Please tell me this will eventually go away. The brain fog/dizziness whatever you want to call it is just dragging me down so much.

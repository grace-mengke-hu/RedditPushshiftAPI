Checking In

So my New Years resolution was to quit and haven't had one since thankfully. It's 64 days in now without one, and I think I'm doing pretty good. I get dreams about smoking and some days I'll have really bad cravings still but for the most part I think I'm out of the woods. 

This has been my 5th serious attempt to stop and before I never made it past 4 weeks. I'm 22 and started when I was 17, never thought I would be stuck smoking for 5 years! Wish I really understood what I signed up for when I first started and how it would be a life long battle.

I've also been around others smoking and didn't cave. Haven't caved while drinking either, and now I don't even think about it when I drink thankfully!!!

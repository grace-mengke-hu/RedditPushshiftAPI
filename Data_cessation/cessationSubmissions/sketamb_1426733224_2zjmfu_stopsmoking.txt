This has worked for me and might work for you.

I, and I assume many others, have the intention to quit smoking all the time.  However, a combination of weakness and the little voice in my head leads me to have another, or buy another pack.

I decided I needed something to constantly remind me why I dont want to smoke anymore. So I wrote down the 5 main reasons on a piece of paper, took a photo, and set the image as my home and lock screen on my phone. 

Now everytime I look at my phone I am reminded why I choose not to smoke, and in a moment of weakness, I can unlock my screen and affirm myself to remain strong.

Went from a pack a day, to cold turkey going on three months now.

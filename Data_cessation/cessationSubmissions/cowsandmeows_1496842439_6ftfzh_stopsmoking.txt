Girlfriend quit smoking 85 days ago, but wants to smoke cigars... is this ok?

Hey Reddit, like the title says my girlfriend quit smoking cigarettes 85 days ago, and has been smoking a vape with 3% nicotine ever since. Considering she had been smoking 2 packs a week since high school, she is really proud of herself and so am I. She says she doesn't feel cravings for cigarettes anymore but would occasionally love to smoke a cigar. 

For example, the other night she asked if I wanted to split a Black and Mild with her and I didn't even know what that was so I had to ask. She said it was like a little cigar, but I told her I'd rather not because I didn't want it to refuel her desire for cigarettes. She assured me it wouldn't, but ended up tossing it in the trash anyway. 

As a non-smoker, I don't know how smoking an occasional cigar would affect her progress, if at all. Anyone have any insight? Thanks ahead of time!

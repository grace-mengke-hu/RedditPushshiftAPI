Quit smoking one week ago and lost my job yesterday. Redditors who have quit, how did you deal with cravings in stressful situations? 

As the title says I quit smoking last week using the patch, it was going fairly well until yesterday when I lost my job. I caved and had a cigarette pretty much as soon as I got the news and feel like I've somehow failed quitting smoking completely. So, what do you do when stressful situations arise?

Anyone a bit younger on this sub?

Just curious, I am 20 years old (male) and realizing I need to kick this habit so I can be athletic as I once was. At the same time I am finding tough as shit not to get through a pack a night at parties/bar over the weekend. I smoke maybe 3 a day during the week but that ramps up hugely on the piss. I would love to be able to get my smoking down to 2 fags on a friday night after pints and pool but this is proving hard to "moderate" smoking.

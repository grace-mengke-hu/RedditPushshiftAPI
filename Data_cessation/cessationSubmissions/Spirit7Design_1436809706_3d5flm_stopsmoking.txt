44 days in, exercise seems harder

I was a smoker for 16 years, less than a pack a day.  I've been quit for 44 days now.  Before I quite, I would run around 3 miles a few times a week, I would have to walk about every 5 minutes. 
Now it seems like I am running out of breath sooner.  sometimes after a minute or two of running.

Has this happened to anyone else? Is this part of the healing process?

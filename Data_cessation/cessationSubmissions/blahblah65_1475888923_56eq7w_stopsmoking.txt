Don't know if this is how I do it, but here it goes

Didnt smoke for a day then did it as soon as I came home today


 I have been smoking cigs for the past three years on and off when I am not in the mental hospital.  I weigh 275 lbs and i attribute some of it to my lack of exercise and labored breathing.  


I go to a mental health program during the week and they allow us to smoke.  But I had no problem not smoking with the aid of gum throughout the day mostly because there were people to talk to. 

As soon as I got home, i got stressed out by being alone in my apt, so I bummed a cig.

When should I try quitting again

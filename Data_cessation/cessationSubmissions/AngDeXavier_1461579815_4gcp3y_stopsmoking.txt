Skin breakout

Today will be four weeks since I stopped smoking. Usually I have pretty clear skin (pimple wise anyway) barring one or two hormonal pimples once a month. Right now I have three pretty big zits on my face (chin, eyebrow and a seriously sore one behind my ear). Just wondering if this could be related to quitting?

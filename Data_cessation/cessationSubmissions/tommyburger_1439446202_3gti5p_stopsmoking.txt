Two days down...

Hi all, I've been lurking here for a bit.  I just quit after 20 years of smoking.  I'm using nicorette and so far so good.

But I'm also pretty sick.  I have a fever, goes between 99.5-103.  Is that normal?  My cough is getting more intense but that's okay, I was expecting that.

Any help or advice would be appreciated!  Thank you!

Coughing something up. Thought it was allergies... (how to break the hand-to-mouth urge/habit?)

Man was I wrong. I thought I just had a lot of post-nasal drip because of my allergies. But then I got put on allergy meds and it still hasn't stopped. Before I got in the shower an hour ago, I had the urge to spit. So I did, and I see little brown chunks of something...

I need to stop this right now. I haven't even been smoking for two years. I only smoke half a pack a day. In all honesty, I thought it would be easy to stop smoking cold turkey, but I'm having some difficulty. I've tried two or three times to quit and the longest I got was 3 days. I always seem to go back to smoking not out of need, but either out of habit or boredom. For example, the times I always light a cigarette are: Every time I get in the car; usually when I'm bored and just watching TV or playing video games; when I'm taking a study break during the semester.

I feel that if someone could help give some options to break the hand-to-mouth habit and replace it with something else, I may have an easier time to do this. I only have two cigs left in the pack I have. Would it be a good or bad idea to just finish them off before starting to quit?

Any and all help would be appreciated!

PS: I have really really really bad anger issues and will snap at the smallest and most petty things. I unfortunately don't realize it until after the moment is done. Not smoking has amplified this, and if someone can recommend me something to try and ease up on the anger, that would be even more appreciated. Stopping the anger would stop my frustration of not smoking even more. I'm really trying to get to the point where I'm disgusted by the SMELL of cigarettes.

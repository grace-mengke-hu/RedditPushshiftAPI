Perpetual cycle

I seem to always make it three weeks. Almost without fail, somewhere around 21 days, I'll have one cigarette and within two days after that I'll be buying full packs to carry with me as I chain-smoke through my day. Then I will feel physically and mentally terrible and begin the process over again. Help me beat the cycle this time. Maybe it isn't easier after 21 days and beyond, but I would sure love to find out.

I've smoked for a year but now I feel like I'm dying

Can someone please lend a hand? I picked up smoking a year ago and have since been smoking two to three packs a week. There was a month where I didn't smoke at all.

Cue my problem: a few weeks ago I had an annoying sore throat. I smoked while I had it so it took a while to go away. It passed and now it seems to have come back; now I'm very phlegmy and have difficulty breathing. It's been like this for almost a week and I'm scared. I don't have insurance and I'm a broke college kid so I can't afford to see a doctor. Do I have COPD? Will this go away? I haven't had a cigarette for a week now because I'm starting to fear for my health.

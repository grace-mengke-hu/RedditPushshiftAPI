Really want to quit

I don't even buy tobacco but when I'm offered a smoke I can't help but take it. I often take butts from an ashtray just so I can get a few puffs. I feel like shit both physically amd mentally from doing it. I don't ever crave smokes except if I have access to them I can't help but give in. Just wanted to get this off my chest. Im going to start reading to see if I can overcome it. Does anyone think the doctor can help even if I'm not really a full on smoker?

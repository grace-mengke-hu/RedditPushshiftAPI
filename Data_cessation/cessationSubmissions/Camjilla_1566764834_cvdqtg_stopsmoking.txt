How did you do it?

I have recently felt horrible after every cigarette. It doesn’t give me that satisfaction anymore, and I really wanna quit. Since I’ve been feeling worse about smoking, now is the time to stop. My biggest reasons are that I wanna be healthier for myself, and have the healthiest body on the inside as much as possible, now that my boyfriend and I have decided to try for a baby in the very near future. 

I downloaded the app “Alex” who is supposedly helping you to be smoke free by smoking less and less each day, and giving you hacks, information, etc when you have cravings. But is this the right way to go, when I already feel grossed out after each cigarette? 

I’ve noticed I only smoke when I’m bored or restless, and that it’s 100 percent habits going on autopilot than actual cigarette cravings.

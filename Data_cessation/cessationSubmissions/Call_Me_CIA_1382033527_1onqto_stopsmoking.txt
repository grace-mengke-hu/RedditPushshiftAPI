am I addicted?

Hi r/stopsmoking. My thoughts are rather scattered right now so I am going to try to my best to explain my situation. My first experience of a ciggarrete i absolutely hated it. fast forward a few years and I started occasionally taking hits off of friends ciggs and bustdowns etc. If I took one pull then it was pleasant but anything more than that was too much. I continued smoking socially for a year or two afterward. only about a couple pulls per month. This year, I have been accepting ciggarettes when I got drunk and didn't care. this happened about once a week. Now I just bought my first pack on a whim because I thought they would complement some other substances that I had been using. I smoked the first one and didnt feel much. Smoked the second one after lunch and felt like not too bad. Smoked a third just now and I am hot, my head is itchy, I can't think straight (or type straight obviously). All along I have never really enjoyed the feeling that it brings but I like the act of smoking something ( I cold-turkey quit marijuana a couple months ago). Does this mean that it is time for me to stop totally or throw away my pack or what? Would it be advisable to never ever smoke one again or to tone it down to the levels that i used to smoke them at (one or two a month)? I'm confused guys.

Sorry for formatting, grammar, etc. I am extreamly lethargic and shitty feeling right now. I am usually a pretty good typer. 

EDIT: Idk if this is relevent but I have never experienced the "relaxed feeling" or dopamine spike. Just pleasent uncomfortableness and ZERO energy or productivity

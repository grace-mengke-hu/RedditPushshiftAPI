4 days and it's unbearable

I don't know if it's part of the quitting process, but when I try to relax or sleep I get this huge rush out of nowhere where my body starts itching. It's like I get bitten by thousand mosquitoes at once and it doesn't go away even if I ignore it. 

It usually itches at the back, on the palms and sometimes on the stomach and feet.

Anyone else experienced this? How do you overcome that? Is it the quitting process or something else?

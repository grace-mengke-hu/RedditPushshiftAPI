Advice needed. Today or next Tuesday?

I am a 20+ year pack a day smoker. I have tried to quit one million times before and always failed. This time I decided that I would get some help since all my other plans had failed. 

Anyway, I began working with my therapist on a quit plan. Basically I had to do a bunch of research and thinking, write it all down, and really prep for kicking the addiction. Anyway, I saw her on Wednesday and we agreed my quit date would be next Wednesday and she gave me a bunch of homework to do before then.

I finished it all last night, so now I am left wondering what the hell am I waiting for? The big thing is I am missing a few things I ordered to be part of my stop smoking kit (mainly a fidget, a journal, and a puzzle book). The idea behind the kit is she had me identify all my triggers and come up with good replacement behaviors. So for example on my breaks at work I have a cigarette, now I am going to do a logic puzzle. When I am on the phone I have a cigarette, now I am going to use a fidget. And so on. 

I guess what it comes down to is that I am so excited to have this concrete plan and am feeling pretty positive about this time around. I want to just stop, but I am worried I will sabotage all the work and preparation we have done if I don't start implementing the replacement behaviors right away, but wont have some of the things I need until Saturday... 

I am not sure what I will decide to do but needed to get this out there. Either way, I will smoke my *last cigarette ever* within the week...

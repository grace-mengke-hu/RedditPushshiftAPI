30 hours.

Hello!

So yesterday my fianc√© and I kind of spontaneously decided "thats it, lets quit smoking" and we went to the store got ourselves an E-cig each and some e-juice with 9mg of Nicotine to stop us from wanting to rip our own eyes out. 

Now here we are 30 hours later and I still want to rip my eyes out but not as badly as I was expecting, I have been a smoker for 7 years and wanted to quit but a lot of the time it was fear that was preventing me from being firm about it, I mean by all means this is sucks, but it isn't nearly as bad as I was expecting it to  be.


What do I have to look forward here in the future? and what are the best ways to cope with the craving for a real cigarette?

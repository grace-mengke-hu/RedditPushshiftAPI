After a week of starting to wind down

Last week I made a post about how much i'd been smoking, around 30-40 a day (costing me heaps in money and health) been smoking since i was 18 and am 21 now. I tried quitting cold turkey but found it really hard, so I slowly went down over the last 6 days, Day 1 I had 20, Day 2 I have 15, Day 3 was a tough one but I managed to get myself down to 8, Day 4 I had 8 again, Day 5 I had 5, and today i had 3. I still feel like i need heaps of cigarettes but i hold myself back and use nicotine spray. I still feel like crap and was just wondering if any of you guys and girls had ways to cope with wanting Nicotine. Because i don't want to get addicted to something else (The spray and gum). Should i stop using the nicotine products and switch to caffeine? I've heard caffeine has a similar effect on the body as Nicotine

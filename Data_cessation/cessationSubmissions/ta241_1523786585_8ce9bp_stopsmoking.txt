Need help fighting negativity

Hello,

I feel I need some help, and I need to find people who faced the same problems I am facing. 
I am really motivated to quit smoking, but after each attempt, I fail for the same reason.

During last year, I tried 5 times to quit smoking, cold turkey. For each tentative, I managed to stay smoke free for periods ranging from a few days to 3 whole monthes. 

When I quit, I have "cravings" and know how to deal with it. It's hard, but I know I am able to manage it. When I fail and smoke again, it is not because of cravings, but because each time I'm afraid of the person I am becoming.

My normal identity is being someone open, positive, jovial, cheerful, good hearted, and motivated. I am happy with my life, have projects, happy with my girlfriend, have an ok job, plenty of friends and compassionate family. 

Each time I stop smoking, after a few days or a few week, in addition to the cravings, I feel desperate exhaustion, lack of motivation, and lack of interest for everything, including things that I usually enjoy a lot, and am very naysaying. 

When I am far enough in this dark tunnel, I don't recognize myself, gets scared, and finally buy a new pack of cigarettes. Then, very rapidly, I'm back on rails and find back the personality I usually have.

I have a few relatives who quitted smoking, and none of them seems to have experienced that to this extend. They only talks about cravings. For me, it seems dealing with cravings is the easiest part.

Did anybody here face the same kind of issue ? How did you deal with it ? Did you finally succeed ?

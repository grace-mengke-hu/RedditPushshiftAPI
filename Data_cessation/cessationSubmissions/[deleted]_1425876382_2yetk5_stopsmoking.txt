when do you think i will be able to drink again!!!

im going to fucking crazy. i relapsed today and smoked half a cig. i also quit smoking weed earlier this week but i have kept this up, although the only reason i have done this is because i have a job interview tomorrow and i know if i get it i will be tested soon after. i am used to smoking,drinking, and getting high almost everyday and the cessation from doing so is causing me to stay up all night. how long after my last cig do you think it will be safe to at least drink again? i am committed to quit smoking cigs but i honestly plan to go back to smoking weed once a week on weekend when im off work after i hopefully get this new job. please help!

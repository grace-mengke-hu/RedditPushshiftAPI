I feel like shit.

On my "Quit Now" app it says 108 days smoke free. It's a lie. I can't believe I got sucked back into it... After a month completely smoke free I had one when I had a melt down (mental illness) but I didn't count it. Then two weeks later it was my birthday, I bought a pack and had three. I felt like that was so significantly better than the hundreds I would have smoked if I had continued smoking a pack a day so I didn't count those either.  Then a couple weeks later I stopped taking the Chantix for whatever reason and I smoked for a week. Then stopped. Now it's been another week that I've smoked.

It always starts as "just one won't hurt" and it's fucking incredible how, given enough time, one turns into addiction again. I'm so ashamed and disappointed. I HATE this. I hate smoking. It's disgusting, it's gross, it makes me sick, I hate feeling like an ashtray, I'm so afraid of cancer, I hate not being able to breathe, I'm scared, but just one won't hurt. Fuck dude.

I hate the thought of restarting that counter, because I did so well for so long... But a fresh start sounds good. I guess it's as simple as never ever ever picking up another cigarette again.

The vapes look cool. I might look into those, my new group of friends get drunk and smoke cigarettes (college musicians) and I don't really want to do either but I love my friends. I like smoking when drinking, and when I have meltdowns... Idk, maybe a $10 hookah stick will be enough.

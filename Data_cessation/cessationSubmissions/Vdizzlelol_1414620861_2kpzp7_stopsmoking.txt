Are e-cigs or vaporizers considered cheating?

I've been cigarette free for the past five days, and I was wondering what the group consensus was on e-cigs. Since I've quit smoking I'm feeling the same withdrawal symptoms of going cold turkey, but the e-cig I'm using seems to counteract the withdrawals. So am I doing myself a disservice by using the e-cig as a crutch, or is it a legitimate alternative that could allow me to get through this process?

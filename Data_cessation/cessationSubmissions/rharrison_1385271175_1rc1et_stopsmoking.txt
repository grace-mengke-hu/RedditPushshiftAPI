Been freaking out for hours now

This is my 13th attempt at quitting. Usually I get father than this before I run into this problem, but I've been having anxiety for hours now and now it keeps getting worse. Usually I can wait out the crave wave because it only lasts a few minutes, but for a good four hours now, I've been losing my mind. What can I do? I've been doing pushups whenever I get like this, but I'm not in a place where I can right now. Help?

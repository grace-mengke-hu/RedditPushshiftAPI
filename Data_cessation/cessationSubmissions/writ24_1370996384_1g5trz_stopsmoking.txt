On January 17th, 2013 I stopped smoking, and it feels like the last thing I started.



I put the cigarette out and I haven't been able to muster the will to start much of anything. My job performance has tanked and I'm not feeling so hot about anything. 


I won't smoke but I haven't had the will to do anything else that's "hard" or something I don't want to do. What happened to my discipline what happend - What if I actually don't like the life I've been living and smoking just made deal with it?

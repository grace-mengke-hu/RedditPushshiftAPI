It's an improvement I suppose.

Well. I made it three days, and then smoked at the end of the third. Upside, I started taking chantix a couple days ago and it seems to be working because the last one I had just did not do it for me. I requested a new badge and feel a lot less anxiety ridden this time. Not overly exited, not totally down on myself. I feel pretty zen and am actually quite encouraged by what the chantix seems to be doing. If it works I will most definitely have it refilled.

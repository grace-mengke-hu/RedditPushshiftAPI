Been smoking since I was nine years old...is this viable?

So, after many failed attempts to quit smoking, I'm trying once more. I've been smoking since I was nine years old - I'm twenty-six years old now.  I've tried quitting a few different times, using different methods.

Disposable/Cartridge E-Cigarettes led to the longest hiatus from cigarettes, at about three weeks.

Cold Turkey lasted about three days max, each time.

This time, though, I ordered a 510 e-cigarette, and a few different liquids at 18mg and 12mg strength.  I'm going to be loosely following this guide: http://www.puffweb.com/how-to-quit-smoking-in-90-days-using-electronic-cigarettes/

I ordered liquids in both 18mg and 12mg strengths, only because I've been smoking so long that I don't want to damn myself from the beginning.

I also am carrying a pack of chewing gum in my pocket at all times, and the rule of thumb is going to be gum first, and if I'm still anxious after ten minutes, the e-cig will be there.

I'm not going to lie, I'm terrified.  I've been smoking for seventeen years, and I started so young that I quite literally can not remember ever smoking.

So, my questions: Has anyone else here used e-cigarettes to taper down?  Did it work?  Any tricks/tips? Anyone else successful quitting when they started as young as me?

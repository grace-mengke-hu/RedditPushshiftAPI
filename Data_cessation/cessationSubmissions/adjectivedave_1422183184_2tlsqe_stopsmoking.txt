Confused about how to carry on

So last night i went to a party and j ended up buying a box of 20 and just plowing through them.

Obviously today i feel shit (mentally and physically) but i have no plans to buy anymore today or tomorrow or hopefully ever. Last night was just some weird blip.

What to you guys think? Should i restart my counter back to zero or just keep going or what?

My brain is so frazzled right now after pounding it with nicotene after 20odd days free from it.

Edit: although for a positive it does prove i can't have "just one" - and i can remove that thought from my brain with actual prove

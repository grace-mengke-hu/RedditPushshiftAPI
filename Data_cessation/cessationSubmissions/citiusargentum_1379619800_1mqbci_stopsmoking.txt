Its been a hard 24 hours for me...

I was never a chain smoker but have been at it consistently for the last 3 years. At first it was part of the routine with my colleagues and roomies and then it stuck on. I averaged 4-5 a day but very consistently in the key phases ( morning and evening coffee; post lunch, post dinner and sometime 1-2 when I felt like screw it I need a break).

After reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1l39f3/anybody_who_has_taken_up_smoking_tobacco_since/cbvf2wq) I decided to take the plunge. Its gonna be hard but I am not gonna give up easily.

Will keep you folks updated and good luck to whoever is in the same singking boat.

Anyone have an issue with teeth grinding while quitting?

I really want to give up nicotine for good. I'm sick and tired of the ball and chain... I've been smoking for about 8 years. I can deal with the withdrawals, but I grind my teeth so badly when attempting to quit... to the point it has caused real damage. I believe it's tied to my anxiety, which skyrockets, and something I need to deal with as well.

I've tried chewing gum and sunflower seeds, but as soon as I am done with them (I can only chew so much gum, and although I love sf seeds, can't eat those indefinitely!) the grinding sets in almost immediately. I need something to help me get through it.

I don't typically grind my teeth in my sleep, but it will follow me to the dream world as well... 

It's so incredibly frustrating. I can't stand it. I hate these cancer sticks so much, but I'm really struggling to overcome this obstacle.

Day 3 and going strong...mostly!

Long time lurker, used the fact that I was snowed in as a chance to force myself into a spot where I couldn't run out as soon as I needed a smoke.  Not going to lie, the cravings are hitting pretty hard right now but...still smoke free on my third day without a single pack in the house.  Thanks so much for being out there, I love reading how different folks handle their attempts and the encouragement is always positive.  You guys are awesome!

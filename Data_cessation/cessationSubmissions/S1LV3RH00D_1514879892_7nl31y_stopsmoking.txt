Need advice on how to cancel out depression and negative thoughts after quitting.

I get that it is normal to have a chemical imbalance after quitting but I really don't feel like myself. I'm having a hard time feeling happy that I am doing something good for my life and my health. It's ritualistic for me at night and I still haven't found a way to cope with my late night thoughts. I feel like I'm not at my best mentally unless I have a cigarette to put me back on my level. I know this may be a lot but I'm trying to be as concise as possible while my mind is like this. Any advice on how to handle any of this would be greatly appreciated.

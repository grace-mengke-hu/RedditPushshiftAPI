Book

Easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. Quit for 8 years.

Some stuff came up so I started again and smoked for about a year, knowing that I could quit again relatively easily anytime. That time finally arrived and I'm smoke free on day 73, and not even thinking about it. First few days were rough as expected but I didn't even need to read the book again, I knew what needs to be done.

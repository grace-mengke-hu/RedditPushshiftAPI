Trying like hell to quit

I really want to quit cigarettes. I have smoked for about 17 years. I quit from 2009-2016. But this time is much harder given co workers smoking and habit of my smoking in the car. It’s starting to drag me down and give me some trouble breathing at times and affecting my overall endurance or lack thereof. When I told my co workers that I was thinking of quitting one made fun of me. So there’s peer pressure too. But I really would like to stop. As much as I enjoy the act of smoking it’s starting to affect my health and I can’t do it any more. A couple of my co workers use a Juul. I have tried vaping before but didn’t really care for it. Maybe I didn’t have the right juice or something and plus I had a Smok stick which was a little bulky and leaked. I like something streamlined. The juul is really small but I don’t like the pods design I prefer being able to pick what strength of juice I use. So I may hit up a vape shop and look around again. But ultimately I’d like to be free of this. I use nicotine gum but again i still want a cigarette. I’ve tried Chantix and it gave me terrible headaches and made me feel weird. The way I quit before was to smoke Marlboro ultra lights and just told myself that I would not pick up another one and it worked somehow and I stayed quit for 7 years. So it can be done I just wish I knew how.

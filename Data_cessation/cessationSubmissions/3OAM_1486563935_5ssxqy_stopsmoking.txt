81 days, cold turkey. Cravings are stronger, but more sporadic.

I've been a non-smoker for 81 days and its been sort of a smooth ride since those first three weeks.

I only get a craving once a week or week-and-a-half, but I've noticed, that when I do have cravings, they're getting weirdly stronger.

My will to quit is infallible. I won't be beaten. I've gone almost three months and if I falter now, all that will have been for nothing. I just find it interesting that all of a sudden, the cravings are particularly violent.

Maybe its because I'm getting the run-around with my tax returns. I can't think of any real *profound* stressors. 

Anyone have any experience with this?

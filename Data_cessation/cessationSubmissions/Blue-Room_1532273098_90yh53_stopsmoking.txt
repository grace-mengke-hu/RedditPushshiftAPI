The addiction to nicotine is 99% psychological and 1% physical.

The physical withdrawal from nicotine barely exists. Smoking is a social disease if anything. You tell yourself you are going to crave a ciggie and get headaches ect, and that is why you do. 

The ACTUAL physical withdrawal symptoms are done within the first two days - and are only what you experienced when you were already a smoker anyway. 

You keep thinking of your cigarette as the treat you want to give to yourself but can't - which is why you have cravings, it is why you have mood swings, it is why you get irritable. 

The thing is you are not depriving yourself of a treat, you've been tricked into thinking that. You are actually rewarding yourself by not choking in ammonia, bleach and other poisons! 

Ask yourself, who benefits from the lie that nicotine is hard to quit, that it's super addictive, and that you need replacement threrapy to cope...

That's right, it's the companies that produce nicotine supplement products. - and the tobacco companies themselves, as you are too afraid of the disappointment of failing to quit to try.

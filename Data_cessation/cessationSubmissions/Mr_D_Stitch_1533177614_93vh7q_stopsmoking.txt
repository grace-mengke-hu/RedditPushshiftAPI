How do I start?

I started smoking due to my now ex-fiancé.  I’ve been smoking pretty seriously for about 3 years.  I hate it.  I hate the taste, I hate the smell, I hate the habit.  I like the social aspects &amp; forcing myself to take a break.

That being said I want to quit but I just can’t get it started.  I make it maybe 3 days before I’m back at it hating myself the whole time.  I got so desperate to make something, anything work, I even wrote “last pack” on a pack of smokes.  That was 3 packs ago.  I hate doing this &amp; I hate myself for not being able to make any quitting progress.

Given what I’ve said about what I “like” does anyone have any recommendations about getting started?  I’ve tried stop smoking aids but they all make me physically ill.  I’ve tried cold turkey &amp; tapering to an equal lack of success.  I’ve read about tips &amp; tricks &amp; they haven’t worked.  I’m hoping someone who was in a similar situation can offer some outside of the box ideas.  Thank you.

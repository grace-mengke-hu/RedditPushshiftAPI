I quit smoking tobacco 4 years ago... but I am now a chronic e-cig user now. worse than when I smoked.

I need help. my lungs burn and I have mucous in my lungs. I don't know how much safer e-cigs are than regular cigs, but I know they aren't 100%  as safe as breathing natural air all day.
e-cigs are so much more convenient. I don't need a lighter any more, I no longer smell like a smoker, or have bad breath. I no longer am staining my teeth. However I still feel like I am damaging myself, and I am uncertain that I am lengthening my life because of just the sheer increase in volume of the amount of vape I go through. is there any info?

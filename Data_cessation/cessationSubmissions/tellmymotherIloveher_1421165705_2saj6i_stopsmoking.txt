Booked to see the dental hygeinist

Just booked in to see the dental hygienist on 24/01/2015. Looking forward to a good clean and polish and to saying goodbye to nicotine stains (if not coffee stains) for the last time. It'll be a good motivator in what I hear is the tricky week 3 period too. Anything I should ask the hygienist to do specifically?!

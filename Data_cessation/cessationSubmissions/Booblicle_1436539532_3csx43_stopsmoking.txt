Anyone else?

This post isn't about addiction but more in tune with long time abstinence or non smoking. 

Last night I decided to go for a walk, and along my path I came across someone using one of these newer electric cigarettes. or vaporizer. I didn't particularly take note of style or anything. But this individual was rude enough to blow it in my general direction as I passed. Since they were sitting, I doubt it was purposeful. But hell that shit was strong. And I don't know if it was a placebo  but I was grossed out by it, and not just by it's fruity and quite strong aroma. 

So anyway, I was wondering if there are others out there that have had this undertone of disgust or nausea for electric cigarettes.

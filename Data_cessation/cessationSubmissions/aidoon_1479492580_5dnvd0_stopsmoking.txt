Freaking out over stopping the patch!

Has anyone quit using nrt patches? I'm 12 days free and finding it beautifully easy, but I'm using the patch and assume the fact that I haven't actually given up nicotine is the reason for this, which is why I'm dreading the day I stop using it. I smoked 20 a day for over 20 years (which I hadn't really thought about and sounds scary!!!) and have made more attempts to quit than I can remember.

Every time I try to quit, I only make it till around noon.

I wake up with the intention of never smoking again, and my morning goes great. Around noon, the urges get so strong I find myself buying a pack or bumming one. Once I smoke it, I feel like such a failure, and I don't even enjoy the cig. 

I have been smoking for 16 years and want to stop so bad.

50 hours and still going

I'm 50 hours from my last cigarette and...I feel fine this time around actually. I was worried about constipation from quitting the smokes, brain fog, etc. But I'm not getting any of those side effects at the time. I am eating a lot of junk food and smoking lots of weed to curb the cravings. I think I'll be able to eat healthier tommorow and for the rest, of my cravings for smoking go away tommorow.

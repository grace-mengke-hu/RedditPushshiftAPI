Quit 2, day 1, just venting

I wanted to put down some thoughts about smoking somewhere, and thought this would be a more productive place than a text file. I'm 31, started smoking when I was 25 (weird, I know). I'd been having a few cigarettes when drinking at 25, and after an insanely stressful situation with a friend, bought a pack, started ripping, and never looked back. I still remember how good it felt going for a long walk in the rain instead of taking the bus, listening to depressing music, chain smoking, and taking swigs of vodka. The pleasure of smoking for me definitely originated from a place of self-harm and wallowing in my depression.

I'm not in nearly as dark a place today. I have people in my life who I love and who love me. I have an OK job and make decent money (it can be stressful, which I like to use as an excuse to smoke). I'm involved in work to better my community. And today I decided to quit for the second time.

The first time I quit was on vacation. It was my 30th birthday and I didn't have a cigarette for five days. I finished Alan Carr's book and thought I'd kicked it. I had one cigarette the first day back from vacation, hated how it made me feel, and threw away the rest of the pack.

The next day at work I was stressed/pissed about something and bought a pack. I had one and it actually felt pretty good, or at least clouded the stress a bit. I left the pack at work and told myself that I would only smoke at work. About three hours after getting home from work that day I walked to 7-11 and bought a pack.

Why do I smoke?

* It breaks up the day and gives me an excuse to step away from work
* There are so many shitty things about the world and there's a stupid appeal to slowly killing myself
* The ritual is insanely addicting

Why do I want to stop?

* I've had asthma my whole life and this isn't helping
* I'm getting older and my health is actually something I have to work to maintain
* When I breath in and out after smoking a lot I wheeze
* I am constantly congested and can barely taste anything
* I was thinking about it recently, and even though 30+ felt old for a while, I've barely lived half my life; 0-20 was like a ramp-up to my actual life, and with ten years of adult life gone, I want to have a good chunk left to grow, change, and have a positive impact on the world

Not posting for anything in particular here, just wanted to get some thoughts down in one place.

I also downloaded the Smoke Free app for my phone, so hopefully that will help a bit. I don't have a set plan for dealing with cravings, other than telling myself my brain is tricking me and all of the things it tries to convince me a cigarette will do are bullshit. I lasted five days before, and I can do it again. I think it was a mistake to quit on vacation, because the second I was back to my normal day-to-day routine, it felt much easier to make excuses to go back to smoking.

I'm also going to try to drink a lot of water (I should drink more anyway).

Through all of this I have not picked up a cigarette. There have been times, like the time I tried to bum one but the guy said he only had enough for the night, THANK YOU UNIVERSE FOR THAT!! Through it all I've done it, remained smoke free.

I've seen people with more days than me. I've seen people who are just starting out, and more that are still contemplating if they can reach day zero. 

No matter if you read a book, or change your life completely, or meditate on the person you were before you even started... YOU CAN DO THIS. No bad thing is a good excuse to pick up a smoke. Nor is a good thing a reason to celebrate with a smoke. There is no reason good or bad to harm yourself in the way that cigarettes do. 

**TLDR: When you quit, you'll do it your way and nothing can stop your success. You are in control and have all it takes to say '*no, thank you*'**

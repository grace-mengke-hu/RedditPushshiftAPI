DAY 1

SO TODAY IS DAY 1 AFTER 16 YEARS :) i have no idea how to stop smoking other than tricking my brain into thinking i am still smoking, so i began my day vaping it out & so far so good. i have no urge to smoke a real cigg ( just yet)> however, i am wondering, are there any bad side effects of smoking an e cigg? the brand i am using is  VICTORY.
i will also be using BLU when it arrives this week. any useful info you guys can tell me will be highly  appreciated. thanks

Came close to caving today...

But I made it through and am making some personal history, here :)

Since I've started smoking at 18, I quit last year for 9 months, then for 2 months in January and February, and then for 15 days twice since then, 8 days numerous numerous times.

So, if I can make it past tomorrow to day 16, it will be my third longest quit time ever!

Just a quick question: is it typical for people to be able to regularly quit for these kinds of lengths of time?

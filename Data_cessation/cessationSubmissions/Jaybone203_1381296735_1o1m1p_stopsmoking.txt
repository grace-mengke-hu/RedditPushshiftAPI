Passed 90 Days and Didn't Notice

after the first month, all it took was some basic self control. didn't even notice how much time had gone by. 

I was a Black and Mild smoker who probably went through a pack every two days. all my friends still smoke them and I don't even get urges when hanging out with them. feels great.

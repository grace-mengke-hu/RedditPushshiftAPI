Today I caved, how much have I set myself back?

So basically I quit smoking a month ago after a year of smoking and I haven't found it too bad, untill yesterday. I was dying for one and got through the night. I didn't let myself buy a pack but instead got one from a friend and had it today. 

Have I just boned myself and set myself right back? (I'll find out over the next day however)

You saved me again /r/stopsmoking !

Hello fellow non-smokers!


The last week we're very rough and stressfull for me. I am going to do a new study and there were alot of thing I had to take care of. 

One of those things is money. At a certain point I was so stressed about money that I wanted to buy cigarettes.

I went to Reddit and thought about it. 

Then it hit me how stupid I was. I was worried about money and because of that I wanted to spend it on cigarettes. Exspensive, dirty, cancer sticks.


I am glad I am still a non smoker. 


Keep strong everybody!

Tomorrow, after 15 years, I am quitting

It's been weighing on my mind for weeks. I am 36, a mother, a vibrant woman with dreams and goals and an intense desire to focus on my health. 

This morning, I had a frightening experience which seals the deal. I woke up after a night of drinking and smoking to a crushing weight on my chest, a swollen throat and the serious belief that I might be dying. It was terrifying! A combination of several things.... Poor diet, too much wine, being fat, being a smoker.... Probably a reflux attack. But it was a wake up call. 

So, I am making preparations today. Cleaning up my hidden outdoor ashtray, throwing away lighters and I have four ciggs left in my pack. I have Allen Carr's book. It's time. 

I live my life in fear because of my addiction and I am tired. 

This sub has been so great to browse through and I am grateful for it!!

Day 3 without smoking

Guys...I feel like a crusader, and the Saladin is the cigarette.
Back in the days where I was an idiot the smoke used to seal my rage within me, now the gates are open...I found myself somehow always angry, apparently I'm quiet and calm, but it takes nothing to make me snap.

Fact is...feels good.


Just in case someone's in trouble: I smoked up to 20 cigarettes every day, I got financial and relationship issues, I had depression over the last year, and I quitted all by myself, without any substitute or encouragement; in fact only me and who read this thread (and the one posted 3 days ago) knows about it.

If you believe that you're weak and you'll need some sort of assistance, well, it'll become the reality. Instead, slap yourself to reality and write down in flames in your mind that YOU ARE IN CONTROL. Nobody and nothing else.

I ran a full 5k today without stopping.

Hey all, just wanted to say that stopping and sticking with it is totally worth it. Today I was able, for the first time since I was in high school, run a full 5k without stopping. My time sucked ass but the point is that my body is healing enough to allow me to trot for 3.1 miles. 

Stick with this everyone. This post-run feeling is better than any cig I've had.

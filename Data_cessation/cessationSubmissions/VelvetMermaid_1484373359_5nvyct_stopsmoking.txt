Something happy during the agony of quitting smoking.

I finally gave up again on the 3rd of this month after nearly nine years of being a smoker and I'm determined to make this my final attempt and stay quit.


A couple of nights ago, I had chicken kiev with mashed potato and vegetables. The mashed potato had pepper on it and I could actually taste the pepper. There wasn't a lot of it but it hit my tastebuds in the best way and now I want more.


My tastebuds are coming back. I'm so happy even though tonight is agonising in terms of cravings.

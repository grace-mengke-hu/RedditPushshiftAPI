Becoming a non-smoker today

I tried to quit on Sept. 1st, and failed after 13 hours (my sister pressured me into having one). I'm 24 years old, I start smoking when I was 14 and I feel like it's time. I'm an athlete, I outrun everybody else, I have better stamina than everyone else, and I am curious as to how I will perform after not smoking a pack a day anymore. I want to gain weight, here's my chance to eat like a fucking champ every time I want a cigarette. 


I should probably dump out the ash tray next to me.

Thoughts on E-cigs?

After several (dozen) failed attempts at quitting smoking over the past 13 years..

I was broke, and I asked my bro to front me a packet of cigs (we have a revolving credit system) and he refused, and instead bought me a considerably more expensive electronic cigarette.

So I haven't had a conventional (analog?) smoke in 2 days, and I feel fine.  No withdrawals whatsoever.  

However, I'm still inhaling nicotine, and quite possibly an even higher dosage of.  Am I lining myself up for an even worse addiction?  Or is the transition from e-cig to clean easier than quitting smoking normally, bearing in mind that it's all the other shit in smokes that makes them *soooooo* addictive.?

Just curious on other peoples experiences and opinions.  Shoot!

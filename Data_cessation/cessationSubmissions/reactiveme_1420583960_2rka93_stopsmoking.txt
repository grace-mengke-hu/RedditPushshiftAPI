Stopping smoking is like breaking up

I just realised that stopping smoking is like trying to forget someone after a break up. The person keeps popping in your thoughts. Those don't seem to let you sleep at night. You can see her everywhere. You can feel her smell in you clothes. You realise that all your day was around her. You need to hide everything that reminds you of her. At some point it gets better, and you can stand being around her, until, some time, you don't even think about her.

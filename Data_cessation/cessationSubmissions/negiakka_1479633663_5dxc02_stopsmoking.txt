Bit of inspiration

Hey guys first time poster, I'm a  young father of 2 with a some what stressful life, I had been smoking for 2 years+, safe to say 14-16 smokes a day at $40 a pack, (Australian).

Just want to give some hope, I decided it was time for me to stop smoking, I got my mentality right,I read Allen carrs book it worked like a fucking charm, day 10 of not smoking, no cravings in the last 10 days, my wife smokes around me doesn't affect me one bit, 
I decided to quit for a healthier lifestyle, somewhat less stressed now, I sleep through the night without coughing up phlegm, I feel so much better
   
If I can do it this you guys can, believe in yourself, mentally prepare for this first, it's so easy! 
Get the book!!! 
Good luck guys soz for the shit posting but first time!

Just smoked my last. I want... I NEED that badge!

I read Allen's book last year and it really helped me understand what exactly is going on.  I tried quitting last weekend (after a few weeks of mentally prepping for it) Buuuuuuut I'm still smoking 3-5 cigs a day. 

From a pack a day (at least) for 14 years... to a week of 3-5 a day, and now I just finished my 5th cigarette in the 4.5 hours I've been awake.  I can already see where this is going and I MUST FIGHT IT.  (Going to rereading the book now.)

I know myself well enough to know I can fight it for the next 12 hours. But the 12 hour mark will be my first big hurdle. And if I can get through that, go to sleep, wake up and resist... man oh man 24 hours without the beast sounds awesome!  I want that fucking badge!

Today someone asked me if I am a smoker. I answered 'no' without hesitation...

... and it felt really, really good, after I realized what I just said. It's my fourth attempt now and I am more motivated than ever. I have the feeling, I can finally do it. 15 days already, DaysOfMyLife - 15 days to go!

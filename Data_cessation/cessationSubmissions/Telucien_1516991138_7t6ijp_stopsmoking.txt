This is the time, I know it. Wish me luck!

Hey all, it's my fifth attempt to quit in the last six months or so.  I've never made it much longer than a week, but with every failed attempt I've felt more and more sick of smoking.

Sure I've failed before, but experiencing even a few smokeless days here and there really makes me realize how bad it makes me feel every second of every day.  I'm sick of the coughing.  I'm sick of being winded after walking up two flights of stairs.  I'm sick of working out and literally feeling my lungs' inability to inflate.  I'm sick of sleeping eight hours and waking up tired.  

So this is the time, and I just wanted to share my excitement with you guys.  You're an amazing community, and checking this sub is more than enough to kill even the strongest of cravings.  

Thank every one of you, and wish me luck!

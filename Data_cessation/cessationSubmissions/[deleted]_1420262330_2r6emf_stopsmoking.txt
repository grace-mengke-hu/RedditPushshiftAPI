Day 1... Again

Decided its time to stop... again. I've smoked on and off for the past few years, and managed to quit for about 6 months a little over a year ago. Felt pretty good about it too. Then music festival season hit, and I went straight back to my old habits. Haven't been able to replicate my previous success so I've been back at it since.

Lately I've hit a point where I just feel guilty after every cig, so I'm giving it another go. Already broke my resolution a few hours after I started, so I figured some help from reddit might be in order.

Any tips to keep me going?

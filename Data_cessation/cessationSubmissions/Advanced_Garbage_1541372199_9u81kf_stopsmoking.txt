Erectile dysfunction due to smoking?

I am aware it's 100% known that smoking causes ED. I have been smoking for around 9 years now, and I have been noticing that my erections are getting weaker. Not as hard anymore and for not as long anymore, especially if I'm not touching it.

Today is my first day where I will try to quit smoking as much as possible.

Anyone experience with this? Is there a point of no return? Or does it almost always help to return back to normal? Any Ex-smokers willing to tell me after how long you start to see improvements?

I am only 25 and it would be a shame if my dick is already ruined.

Any advice appreciated.

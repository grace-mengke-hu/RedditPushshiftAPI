:( I gave in again

Went two days almost, and had really bad cravings and went out and got cigarettes. I should mention I am suffering from a number of mental health issues right now, including anxiety/panic disorder and major depression.  Since giving up smoking I have been up and down like a seesaw.

I don't want to give up, but I am not happy with myself.  Just looking for support from all you guys.  Thanks so much for taking the time

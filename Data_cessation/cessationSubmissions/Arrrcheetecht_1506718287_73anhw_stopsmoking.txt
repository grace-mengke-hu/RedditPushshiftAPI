Passed another test

Grandma passed away Tuesday morning. Had to deal with everything and arrange the funeral logistics and formalities....today I carried her ashes to her final resting place. Got drunk a little afterwards. Really wanted to smoke during these days but resisted till now. Going to bed now...proud...Think she would be proud of me too. Stay strong everybody. Its doable.

Craving is unbearable

I don't know why this is so hard. I'm only on day two and I had a fight with my SO and I really want a ciggie.

Don't see the upside to this at all. Apart from the streets of fighting with SO, I am now fighting myself to keep me from smoking.

So fucking frustrating. I had like a dozen cups of coffee and some sweets already.

Day 2 after many failed attempts

Yesterday was the day i decided to quit...again.
Ive tried quitting before by going cold turkey, electric cigs, patches, sprays, gum, inhalers and lozenges. Most of the times i havent lasted more than a day. Gum makes me hiccup as doe the sprays and electric cigs. Last time i managed to quit it was using these low cost lozenges called Galpharm 4mg. I quit for 6 days and the other day i saw them on sale again. This time im going to quit for sure. Im going to save money and im going to take me and my partner for a short break away somewhere.

Well here goes nothing....again.

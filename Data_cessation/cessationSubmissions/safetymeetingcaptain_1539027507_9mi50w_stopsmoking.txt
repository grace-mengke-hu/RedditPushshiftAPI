Day 0. Again.

I broke my leg pretty back back in July and let myself use that as an excuse to smoke again.  I'm ready to recommit.  Last year I quit on Dec 2, and want to be there again.  Here and now, in this little optional text box, I am making a promise to myself and to those who helped encourage me to quit last time.  We got this.

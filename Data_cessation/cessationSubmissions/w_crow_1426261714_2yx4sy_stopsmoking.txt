Last Cigarette: Vomited

I've been reading Carr for the past week.  I've been wanting to stop since December and after having my quit date picked and discussing it with friends, I chose to have my last smoke this morning. 

I had two drinks last night, and awoke with a slight headache.  I brought my attention to the butt and smoked it down to the filter concentrating on the feeling of inhaling the smoke.  I got the 'spins', usual with my first one.  When I went inside my legs got shaky and I had the immediate urge to vomit.  I couldn't believe I was affected as badly as I was when I was through. My body was awash in shivers and cold sweats.  The perks of being a drug addict.  I'm done with smoking cigarettes forever and I don't want to be a smoker anymore. 

I've decided to become a nonsmoker.  I want to thank this sub and all your contributions, I don't think my body could send me a stronger message.

TESTING

Wow what a night, arranged a surprise birthday dinner out for my partner, I had a few wines as did we all, his 12 year old daughter was with us and I arranged for his sister and husband to be there without him knowing.  All went well until we got home and the first thing he does is go outside for a joint, it wound me right up, I  basically went out saying “oh first things first” and being short and nasty.  I didn’t realise I was struggling but obviously I was.  I said “right I’m having one then” he then went a little mad and left, I did not smoke.  I gave it 10 minutes went upstairs to bed where he was and it got viscous with words and now I’ve left the house to a salon I own.  If I was ever going to smoke it would be tonight, trust me

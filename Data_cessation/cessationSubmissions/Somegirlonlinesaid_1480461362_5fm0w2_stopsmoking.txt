I'm sixteen and I started smoking...

My boyfriend (18) smokes, so that's where I got the cigarettes. I only did it for about two weeks before coming to my senses, three a day max. I love it, it feels really good, but I can't do it anymore. I now realize how foolish I was, and have promised myself never to do it again. I have a niece who looks up to me, and my uncle died of oral cancer due to smoking cigs. I'm about three days clean.
My question is... Will doing this come back and bite me in the ass later? Can smoking the small amount that I did still cause cancer or other diseases in the future? Did I permanently damage my lungs even with such a small amount, or did I quit before anything could actually happen? I'm asking y'all because I figure you guys probably have experience with this and know what you're talking about.

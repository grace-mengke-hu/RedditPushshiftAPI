Thinking about giving up

I know I've made it 24 days.. and I've been very confident the whole time that this would be my first and only time quitting.. that I've made it this far so I can't fail. I'm feeling very discouraged right now. I want to buy a pack of cigarettes on my way home from work. I'm very depressed with my current living situation, job, location, everything.. everything feels wrong right now. And I know that smoking won't make any of that better.. that my issues were still here when I was a smoker and they continued when I quit and they are still going on.. but I'm still trying to rationalize smoking. Like, when I smoked at least I had something to look forward to during the day when there was nothing else to be excited about. But what a shitty thing to look forward to. I don't know, I guess I'm just looking for someone to talk me out of giving in.

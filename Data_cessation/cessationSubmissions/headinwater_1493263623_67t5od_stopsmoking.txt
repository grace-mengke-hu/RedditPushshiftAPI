Sleeping issues

I quit smoking for 2 months.  I have always had sleeping problems but those 2 months were the hardest I have ever had.  I ended up smoking again (my badge probably needs a reset) because of the sleep issues and an onset of panic attacks that I have never experienced before.  
Does anyone have advice for this?  Everytime I even think about quitting again I feel overwhelmed by the sleep issues.  I can't lose my job because I can't go to work after two days of not sleeping.  I have lenient enough bosses but having panic attacks attached to the sleeping problems just keep sidelining me completely quitting.  I want to be done I'm just terrified of the immediate consequences even though I know the future consequences are much worse.  
For context-30 yo/f/smoker for 14 years.  Last decade or so about a pack, or more, a day.

Need to clean out my car

I haven't had a cigarette in 5 days. Cold turkey this time after a pack to 2 pack per week habit for 10+ years. 

One of my big triggers is driving/commuting to & from work. Survived the end of last week with a riveting book on CD to help distract me.... but there are still butts in the ashtray from before. There is still the smell of tobacco in my interior.

I'm a little scared to tackle the job myself. Not sure where to start.

Having a kind of crappy day. Feeling depressed & stressed out over other life stuff, but determined not to let me use that as an excuse to fall off the wagon. 

Any other car smokers have advice for battling the upcoming commutes sans cigarette? Or what to use to refresh my car's odor?

I quit vaping as NRT

I realized, while listening to Allen Carr, that I wasn't doing myself any favors by using my vape as NRT. So yesterday, I threw away all of my juice and had my last vape.

In a month or so, if I miss the act of vaping, I may get some 0% juice. But I also may not. I'm feeling ridiculously strong right now. Thank you to everyone on this sub who recommended Carr's book.

25 days w/o smoking

Feeling great! Sense of smell has improved and my breathing has gotten better! Although some cravings can be difficult they subside in minutes. I feel great and there are more positive feelings and outcomes ($ saved, health, happiness) that outweigh those brief craving challenges. I have removed all visuals (ashtrays, lighters, etc) from my surroundings to not tempt me. Stay positive in your pursuit to stop smoking and don't cave in to temptations.

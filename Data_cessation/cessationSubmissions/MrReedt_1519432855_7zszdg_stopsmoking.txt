Mouth skin loss after stopping, is this what is happening to me?

I have what I believe to be an absence of the first layer of skin on my cheek that is probably around the surface area of a dime and a half. It isn't painful, it is skin color as well, It doesn't look like anything online really, trust me I've looked at a lot of images of mouth cancer, nothing is quite like mine, all the cancer images are either bright red or white and much smaller. The "sore" did grow for about two weeks but seems to be getting better. I'm going to the doctors soon but I have recently come across some information stating that peeling of the skin in the mouth is not uncommon when stopping smoking, the description sounded somewhat like what I am experiencing, although I could not find any good pictures. So I'm wondering if this "peeling" has happened to any of you and what was it like exactly. I would say I had already stopped smoking for a month before the sore showed up. I was never a heavy smoker smoked on and off at different levels for about 4 months and dipped around 5 cans in my life. My last pack I did smoke fast. So I ask you if you have experienced "skin peeling" from the cessation of smoking does it sound similar to my experience?

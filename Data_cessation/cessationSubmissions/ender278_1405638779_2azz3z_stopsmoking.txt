Fell off the wagon :(

A little back story - When I was around 28, I was about 285 pounds. Long story short, some guy in a truck cut me off on the road and then proceeded to call me a "fat fuck". Not sure why that set me off, but next thing you know, I'm hitting the gym and running every day until a year later, I'm down to 195 pounds. During that time, I also quit smoking, and stayed off of it for 4 years.

4 years later in 2010, I broke down at my grandfathers funeral and had a cigarette. He smoked for 76 years, so I guess it reminded me of him. It's no excuse, but the stress of him passing was probably some sort of trigger. I also stopped working out due to a very stressful new job which took up most of my time, and gained weight back - not all 100 pounds, but around 50, which was, and still is, incredibly disheartening for me after all of that hard work I put in.

I've been smoking ever since then, 4 years later. I don't remember what I did originally to quit smoking, only that I did it cold turkey and I don't remember it being that hard. This time around though, it seems to be SO much more difficult. 

Anyway, I was hoping you guys could throw some encouragement or tips my way on how to quit once again. Any ideas would be very greatly appreciated!!

Thanks

Started the patch 5 days ago

After playing a short two on two basketball match and not being able to breathe I decided it was time to quit. 

I've tried cold turkey a couple of times but it never worked for me. 
Been smoking 20-25 a day plus a little less than a pack if I had anything to drink and the withdrawals really got to me. 

This weekend I was really busy and the patch worked great together with munching on carrots and chewing toothpicks or matches. 
Despite me having a bit to drink I didn't go back to smoking, except for one night where I got bad news and couldn't cope. The day after I got right back to not smoking.

Today is my first day off work and after a sleepless night my cravings are coming in strong. 

I am deadset on quitting but hell I want one really bad. (Stupid little voice going:"just one man. Won't hurt you. You can go back to quitting right after.") 
But with the patch it doesn't even do anything for me .... 

Well sorry for dumping but I am grateful for any help I can get.

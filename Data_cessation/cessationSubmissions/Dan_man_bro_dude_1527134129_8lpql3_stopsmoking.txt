I think I've finally figured out why I keep relapsing

I just got done submitting the removal for my badge of 110 smoke-free days. I relapsed. 

I started smoking when I was 15, maybe it was because my father smoked--or perhaps I needed something to help cope with the stress in my life. Fast forward to now, I'm 22 years old, doing okay in college so far, I've had my ups and downs--the same goes for my relationship with cigarettes. I've quit "successfully" twice, each time lasted around 100 days. 

When I relapsed the other day, I didn't tell anybody, not because I think talking through things is ineffective, or because I do it too often/little. I didn't tell anyone because I figured it out myself why I'm continually relapsing. For so long, in my life, I've tried so hard to be things I'm not, and I was upset--like really fucking upset that I wasn't smart enough, fit enough, social enough, etc... There's so much I'm craving in my life, and the only crave I could easily solve was my craving for a cigarette. My addiction was the one void in my life I could fill, everything else has yet to be fulfilled. 

I don't know if this revelation will help me make a more successful ,and hopefully permanent, quitting. But I know this, I'm done. I am SO done going through life wanting things and never going for it. I'm SICK of hating myself for not being something. I hope I learn to accept myself for what I am currently, and from there I can build up to what I'd like to become.

11 days in

I'm 11 days in to quitting smoking. I used to wake up many times throughout the night, I cannot believe how much better I'm sleeping.  I never expected my sleep patterns to change so drastically, so quickly. 

I'm also a little nervous about going to a party tomorrow night.  I don't feel strong enough to avoid smoking.

My method for quitting in a sneaky way.

Hi there, fellow future ex-smokers. First of all, a word of warning: the experiment I did on myself to quit smoking might not be liked by some, since it's not in accordance with what doctors propose. Either way, it helped *me* quit, so I might as well share it with you and you can leave it or take it. It's been *about* a week that I've quit. I used to smoke for 3 and a half years.


I was mostly a psychologically-dependent smoker, so this might not work with everyone. Meaning, it was not so much the nicotine high that kept me hooked -if I was doing something engaging, I could go 5+ hours forgetting to smoke- but the whole ritual itself. My smoking would go from half a pack to sometimes a whole, especially when I bought ready-made cigs, which didn't leave me satisfied (I mostly smoked roll-em-ups). The usual triggers -coffee, drinks, waiting etc.- existed for me. I'd sometimes even *miss a bus* and be late to school not because I needed a nicotine fix, but because I *had to* smoke at the bus stop. The first time I tried to quit, I used e-cigarettes, but I'm going to talk about this experience in the end.


When you pinpoint the source of a problem, it's easier to tackle it. For me, it was all about killing the romance of smoking and severing the ties with certain activities. Failure is a great way to learn, so the second time I went cold turkey, I was almost *fantasizing* about smoking again more than I would with sex! Thus, I devised a plan to leverage my own psychology into indirectly quitting. Here are my steps, but you can take them with a grain of salt and tweak them to your own personality.


*  *Do not set a quit date*. What this did for me -and most people I know- was turn us into super smoking machines who would even *double* what they smoked until that date. It's a basic instinct, *grab what you can until you no longer can*. The problem with this is that you're effectively upping your nicotine threshold by telling your brain it should expect more, thus further desensitizing your reward system. What I did instead was 'feed' my brain with all the negative facts (not medical facts, personal facts) I could brainstorm about the coffin nails, slowly letting it process the information until it was fed up, and after a certain cigarette I said 'That's it.'

*  *If you can, by all means go cold turkey, but avoid gradual cessation*. As you might have guessed, I couldn't. On the other hand, I knew that tapering was not reliable, as the brain would find hundreds of excuses to crawl back to half a pack, one cigarette at a time. So, this leads us to the turning point of my quit.

*  *Tell the most judgemental, in a good way, people in your circle that you're quitting*. The first thing I did after I went a day without a cigarette was tell my parents, one of my BJJ training partners and my med student girlfriend about it. I got plenty of support from my parents, but the other two people were already on a crusade to make me stop. The catch is, *I was still smoking a few*. You might think this is futile, but in my case, it wasn't. What effectively happened was that I was forced not to smoke before training, after training, and every time I was out with my girlfriend, and I sometimes stay 4+ days at her place (and before that, or she would obviously smell it). I practically set immovable pieces of concrete in my daily schedule where if I smoked, I'd have to explain what happened and look like a liar. Not only that, but I felt extremely guilty every time I lit up when I was alone.

*  Coupled with No. 3, the above process helps your brain forcefully dissociate events with smoking. Sure I was shaking every time me and my girl were having a drink, but after 3-4 times, I started needing it less and less. The brain works by replacing habits with habits, but habits are formed with repetition...so *repetitively don't smoke until it gets the message*. 

*  *Do things that are inhibited by smoking*. Ever tried grappling for 5 minutes as a smoker? Sure, I'm only 25 and have got a huge gas tank, plus I'm very fit and athletic, but every time I lost to an equal opponent because I ran out of steam, I was so angry at myself. Or every time I had to pause my studying because I couldn't focus. Or, to put it bluntly, every time I couldn't get it up to 100% because of the cancer sticks. Reading the negative health benefits of tobacco did jackshit for me, and I'm too young to be intrinsically scared of heart disease and lung cancer (yeah, I know they happen, but I'm still in the phase where I feel immortal). Experiencing the frustrating effects in the present, *yourself*, is another beast, and is sure to test your patience and strengthen your resolve.


**A word about e-cigs**: I don't like being absolute about stuff, and I can see their potential. For me, even nicotine-free juices helped me, because as I said, I was hooked to the ritual. I'm not denying nicotine dependency, it just wasn't as strong as the habit itself. The problem with vaping I think lies in two things: first of all, it's easier to justify a cigarette every now and then (hint: that's how I began smoking again). Secondly, people online seem to push the idea that only tar and the toxic substances of tobacco are bad, and that nicotine you can live with. Sorry folks, but just because it doesn't coat your lungs with black goo doesn't mean it is less harmful. Nicotine is a very potent **vasoconstrictor**, meaning it narrows your arteries, meaning you get cold hands, bad circulation, high blood pressure, erection problems, and the list goes on. And make no mistake about it, it's *also a drug*. It has severe, detrimental mental effects -that, for some reason, are never addressed, even by docs- since it messes up your reward system. Dopamine is universal, so you are bound to have problems with other reward-based activities, like sex. It also puts a few bricks in the wall of **depression**.


That's all folks. Excuse the lengthy essay, but I wanted to make sure everything was included there. It might help a few people, or it might help no one, but it certainly helped me quit, so I might as well share it with you. Use your own brain to analyze it, keep what is helpful, or dismiss it altogether. I'm not a medical student, but I'm a physicist, so all information has been researched carefully and from multiple sources. Stay safe and tobacco-free!

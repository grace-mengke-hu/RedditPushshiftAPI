Quitting Nicotine

I've been on/off the smoking wagon a couple of times since the end of April, but so far I've continued to get back on pretty quickly after I fall off.  I am currently at 16 days.  I had been using the patch and an e-cig sporadically and noticed yesterday that I felt shaky and sick.  I had felt that a few times the previous week too (but blamed it on too much sun.)  I decided to take my patch off about mid-morning yesterday and didn't have my e-cig with.  I feel like I'm ready to just get off the smoking and the NRT.  While the NRT was helping me get over that initial hump, it seems to be making me feel worse now.  Time to just move on and be healthy.

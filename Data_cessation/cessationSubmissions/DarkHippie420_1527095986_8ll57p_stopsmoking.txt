I made my GF cry today

One week behind me, and I've started to smell stuff again. Which includes others smoking and reeking of cigs. That includes my GF. I realized we haven't been as close as we were after I quit, and it's because she smokes. I've been on the edge emotionally and annoyed by the smallest of things which I didn't care about when I smoked, and spent nights in our own flats. I still love her but being near her gives me a headache, and today I blurted out that she smells bad and it's the reason my head hurts. Well, I could've been more discreet because she started crying and thought herself disgusting to me. Luckily we can talk things through and we did. Hoo boy, I wish I'll start feeling normal soon. The good news is that I haven't had any desire to smoke, just been grumpy and suffered through it. 

Thanks, felt good to vent.

I threw my tobacco in the bin

Yesterday I decided I wasn't going to smoke anymore, so I went outside and binned my tobacco+papers. I couldn't help but smile and I actually felt good about myself. I haven't slept yet so I guess it's only the first day, and I'm already having cravings, but I just remember that quitting makes me happy and it gets easier.

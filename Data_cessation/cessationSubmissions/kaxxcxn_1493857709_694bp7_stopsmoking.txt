Nobody warned me, damn.

In canada I always get an insert with my pack that outlines the benefits of quitting, and what I can do about cravings. But cravings seem like the least of my worries at this point...

Before I go on, yes Ive been to the doctor, and yes he has determined that my symptoms are a result of quitting. COUGHING, WHEEZING, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, SORE THROAT, SORE MOUTH, SORE CHEST, DIZZINESS, FATIGUE, ACNE.

Holy shit, did I just get unlucky or something? I dont read much about all of these crazy quitting symptoms, especially not in those little inserts. Fucking hell mate, this what I imagine dying feels like. Doc said it should clear up in 1 to 2 weeks, and my throat and mouth are already a lot less sore.

Forget about the cravings, this is hell.

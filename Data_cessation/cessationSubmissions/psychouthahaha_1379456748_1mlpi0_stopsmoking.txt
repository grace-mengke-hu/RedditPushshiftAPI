This is my fourth morning without cigs

Hey, morning of day 4.

I am still counting the days. Mostly because it is kind of fun. Feels like an accomplishment, even though the only thing i have to do is not to smoke.

This reddit helps a lot. All these ppl that have beeing able to become non smokers.

I can sleep well. Maybe because i ride my bike to work now 20 km. It makes me feel sleepy when i lie down.

I have no cough so far, but i have red it will get very bad. Is that true to everybody? 

Since i moved far away to start a new work, my friends here didnt even realize i dont smoke. We went out for food and shopping. Since none of them smokes, they dont pay attention to that habbit. It is a good thing. I am relaxed when i am around them.

I hope all of u have a nice day without smokes. Thanks for reading.

..... Also i am saving money. I dont know what, but i will buy something nice in the end of november.

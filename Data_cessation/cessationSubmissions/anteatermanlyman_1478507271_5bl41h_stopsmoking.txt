Lozenges and hard candy go really well together

Just a tip, I have had lozenges and jolly ranchers, and it's a really good combo. Started popping a lot of lozenges like how I chain smoke over the night. Popped a jolly rancher just now instead of a lozenge and it's doing the trick.

It kinda feels like how you'd imagine nicotine gum would work with regular gum. I would imagine life savers can be like it, but jolly ranchers don't break super fast. I generally just like them more than other candies tho :)

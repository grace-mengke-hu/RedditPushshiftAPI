A week in...

Hi everyone.  New here.  39 years old, smoker for 20 years.  

I had a wisdom tooth out last week and was ordered to not smoke for 48 hours to avoid a painful dry socket and figured it was a good time to quit, especially with my first child on the way.

The first day or two after the procedure, all I wanted was a cigarette.  I'd see people smoke in movies, on TV, my neighbor stepping outside... I somehow managed to make it past that 48 hour mark and have been holding myself to not smoking.

Now, at exactly the one week mark, it's easier to talk myself out of cravings.  I find that the cravings are when I'd generally step outside at work to smoke... once in the mid morning, once at lunch, once in the mid afternoon... and at night when I'm at home.  That's probably the worst time dealing with the cravings.  I've been trying to stay busy and keep my mind off of them and ride them out.

I've been waking up in the middle of the night with such anxiety, which seems to be decreasing with time.  I'm also super tired during the day, which I don't know if it's a result of not smoking.

In any case, I decided to come here during one of my cravings (it's lunch time) not to really get direct support, but just to read the thoughts and struggles and success stories from like minded people.

Here's to everyone's continuing success!  w

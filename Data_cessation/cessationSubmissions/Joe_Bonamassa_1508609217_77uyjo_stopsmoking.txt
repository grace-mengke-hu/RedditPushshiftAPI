10 days without a cigarette!

Hey guys!

It‘s the ten day mark and I‘ve never felt so confident about stopping. Yesterday I left my vape thingy at home for the day and didn‘t even notice until I came back home.
 
So far, everything‘s coming my way! I started doing thaiboxing and it‘s a great balance, so I guess sports are covered.

Hope you all are doing well !

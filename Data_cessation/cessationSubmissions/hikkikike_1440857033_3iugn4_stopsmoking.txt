Question to quitters

I've been smoking for almost 25 years and i've always wanted to quit smoking, but something really discourages me... I have a weak will and i keep thinking about people who have quit for not just a few months but YEARS (example, people in prison) and when they have a chance, they greedily puff on that cigarette after years of not smoking. Does the mental addiction stay forever? If i have not smoked in years, will i still feel like smoking in stressful situations or seeing people smoking?

Day 1 - 3rd attempt.

I've quit 3 times before. 

1st time was for 3 months after 5 years of tobacco use.
2nd time was for 3 years, after 8 years of combined tobacco use (when I first joined this sub)
3rd time will be ideally for 30 years, after 12 years of combined tobacco use.

This is my first time trying Allen Carr's method. The other 2 times was cold turkey with supplementing in THC - this time i'll attempt without any crutches.

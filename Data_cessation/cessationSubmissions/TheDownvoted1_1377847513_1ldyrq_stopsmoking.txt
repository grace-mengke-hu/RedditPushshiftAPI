decided finally to quit this nasty habit

 First and foremost.. congratulations for all who are here reading this.  Both to those who have kicked the habit,  and those who are trying.

 About me as a smoker:  started at 17.. just turned 28.. starting to see the major implications as I was playing around oitside with my soon to be step daughter. Lost breath, can't run long distances... couldn't keep up. As a former athletic type, I realized what has been holding me back.. my disgusting habit.  My fiance has been nagging at me too quit for some time now.. but finally recently took the first step.  

 SO.. long story short..Slipped up tonight.. had 1( first in 2 days).. so I look forward to hearing from reddit about what works..  begun working with electronic cigs ( did the trick.. but seems like a crutch)..  to the quitters (50 days+)  what worked for you?

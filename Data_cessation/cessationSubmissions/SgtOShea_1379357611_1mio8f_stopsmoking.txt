So I relapsed a few days ago but I'm coming up on 2 days smoke-free in a couple of hours

After I caved in and had that smoke I felt like crap; I was anxious and felt depressed. Now I'm coming up to two days smoke-free and I feel good about it, the first day was tough but today hasn't been too bad.

Only problem is I'm going to the pub with a couple of friends later tonight and one of them is a smoker who recently had a relative pass away sadly, so I'm positive he'll ask me out for a smoke and although I'll decline to have one I'll still go out with him while he does, so we'll so how that goes.

If every day is like today then I'm optimistic for the future, being able to breath and smell good is really nice. I hope you're all doing well.

1 Week and I can't make it through the day without a nap and can't focus at all. Advice needed

I'm a college student who just got fed up with being drowsy in the mornings and not being able to function without a cig. I slept through so many classes this semester just because I couldn't get out of bed or even think clearly until I'd smoked. So I quit exactly 7 days ago, and had no slip ups or drops in motivation.

However, finals week starts next monday for me, and I honestly haven't had one productive day since I quit except monday, when I took a vyvanse because I *HAD* to get work done. I'm scared I'm going into finals week with no ability to concentrate or stay awake, and I'm going to fuck myself. I don't want to start smoking again just for a week, since I really made it to this point fairly easy compared with previous attempts. Does anyone have any advice for my situation?

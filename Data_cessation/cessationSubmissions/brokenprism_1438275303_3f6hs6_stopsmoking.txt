First star, happy time. One Month!

Here I am at GenCon in Indianapolis. Smoke free. For an entire month!!! Thanks for being here r/stopsmoking It's a real boost to have place to shout into the wind. Thats part of why I started blogging about board games, its pretty cool to be able to enjoy my hobby without having to take smoke breaks, to really sit in and through a full 1-2 hour game uninterrupted. Thanks all, and if you're interested in my coverage of the event, it'll be up at brokenprismgames.com as the week progresses.

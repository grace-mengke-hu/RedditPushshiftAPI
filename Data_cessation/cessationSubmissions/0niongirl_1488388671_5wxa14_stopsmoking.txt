I quit today!

First off, I wanted to say that this sub is amazing. I wouldn't have been able to make the leap to quit without the support and advice here, thank you so much! 

A little background on myself.  I've been a smoker for over 20 years and most of those years were at a pack a day.  I only quit once before 3 years ago for about 3 months before a string of family losses sent me back to the cigs. I feel like I'm strong enough now and ready to quit again for good. 

I have a pretty good incentive aside from all the health benefits of quitting.  If I can quit for 30 days, the money I've saved from not buying cigarettes will go to a family gym membership.  This is something I've wanted for a while but never fit into the budget because of well... cigarettes.  This goal is really keeping me motiviated and I'm using it to help me get through the cravings I've had so far today.  

So to help keep me focused on the prize, what have you been able to buy/do with the extra money saved from quitting?

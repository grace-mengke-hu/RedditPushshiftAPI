Got drunk last night

And didn't smoke a cigarette :)  

First time in my whole life I did that.  I've tried to quit a handful of times and always cave when drinking.  I think I've got it this time.  I think it's really my time to quit:)  And it feels fucking awesome!

Something someone said on here a few days ago REALLY helped me with last night.  They said to turn it into a game.  Instead of pining for a cigarette just think of your cravings as things you have to beat and win.  From the small ones... Gotta beat that post Chipotle craving.... Gotta beat that when I start my car craving.... 

To the big one last night.... Oh.... you're piss drunk and on a patio downtown and everyone is smoking.  Fuck dat.  You don't smoke anymore.  Beat that craving.  

Time to get over it and get back to doing important things with your life.  Like texting your girlfriend who is asleep that you're going to come over and stick your wiener in her ear.  Or harassing all of these juiced up, jersey shore looking motherfuckers that could probably whoop your ass.

Fuck.  This is why I don't go downtown.  I forgot how gay it is.

I should probably just head home.  It's late anyway.  

Tyler.  Where you at?  Ready to bounce.  Cool man.

Here... pass that shit.  I'm trying to hit that ish before bed dawg.

zzzzzzzzzz.....

Oh fuck.  Where's the water?

Christ I'm getting too old for this shit.  I'm not used to feeling this shitty in the morning.  I can't drink like I used too.   Oh well.  At least I don't have to be at work till 5.  

Time to nurse a hangover and drink some water and watch some college football.  I wonder what time that LSU / Bama game is on.  

Probably late...

oh well.  Buckeyes on a bye.  Gotta be something decent on though.

Fuck... my girl really needs to get back from Germany.  I need to get some pussy.  Like FOR REAL.

December 17th.   Let's see.  That's like... 5 more weeks.

FUCK.  God fucking damnit.

It's too bad I like her so much.

It would have been easy to just pick up some tail last night.

But it's not worth it.

She's worth it.  Quitting smoking is worth it.  

Something about the shifting priorities of a 25 year old.

Now.... let's sell some fucking houses so I can quit this stupid fucking restaurant job.


EDIT:  Also... I just wanted to say.  Fuck nicotine patches.  Fuck gum.  Fuck electronic cigarettes.  Fuck snus.
I've tried 'em all as 'quitting strategies.'  It's all bullshit.  You know you're just looking to hold on to that crutch.  You want to quit?  Is it really time?  Cold turkey then motherfucker.  Be about that life!  Fuck nicotine!

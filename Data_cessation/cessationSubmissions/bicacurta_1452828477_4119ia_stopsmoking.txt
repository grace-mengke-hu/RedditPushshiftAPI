People who failed their NY resolution of quitting, what happened?

Because not every one is a case of sucess, and we know how hard it is.

I'm looking for your stories about what happened, specially the thought process as you smoked or bought that first pack. 

Looking to avoid those traps, 14 days free but starting to get weak... thanks in advance.

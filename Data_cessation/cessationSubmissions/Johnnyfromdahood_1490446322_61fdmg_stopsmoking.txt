Quit three days ago to impress a girl i like - how fucked am I?

Smoked for 4 years. Tried quitting many times, but relapsing every time because I feel like I don't really have a good reason to quit. I didn't even want to quit this time, I did it so I might have a tiny chance at hooking up with her. How do I turn this situation into a good thing?

Edit: I admit that I'm kind of a sleazeball for doing this ._.

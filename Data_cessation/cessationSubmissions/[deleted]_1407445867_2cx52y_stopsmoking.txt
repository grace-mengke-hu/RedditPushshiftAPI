After two weeks... I had a puff. :(

I am using a throwaway because I am far too ashamed to show you guys my normal /u/.

I was doing really well and was even around others who were smoking and resisted the 'urge'! In fact, I didn't have any urges to smoke what-so-ever. As soon as I lit the cigarette up and inhaled I felt gross, guilty, and smelly. Not to mention that it made my throat hurt. I immediately turned it off and threw it into the garbage.

Blergh. 

I am so ashamed, r/StopSmoking.

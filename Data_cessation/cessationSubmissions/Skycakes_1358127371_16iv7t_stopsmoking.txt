So many rewards!

It's been three days and I'm already reaping in the benefits of not smoking. My hands and feet are toasty warm. I have more energy. I can feel my lung capacity coming back. The cravings are dwindling and I'm feeling almost normal. Sure, I still want to smoke but it's manageable. I just keep imagining life without that nasty nicotine monkey on my back! Thanks for your support!

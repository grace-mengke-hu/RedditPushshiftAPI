Two weeks down!

So, it's been two weeks already! I won't lie, I cheated a tiny bit. Last Sunday I took a couple drags off (of all things) a Black and Mild cigar when I had had a few drinks (blech!). I decided that didn't merit restarting my day counter. I am confident it won't happen again, and it's not as if I smoked a whole pack or anything.

Overall, it's been easier than I had worked myself up for. I'm kind of mad I waited so long to do it. It's kind of weird, but quitting smoking marijuana was so much harder both psychologically and physically. When I quit marijuana, I couldn't eat or sleep for a week and a half, and my anxiety was through the roof. Quitting cigs has not been nearly so bad - a little sadness and a lot of hunger (aka cravings), but nothing debilitating.

It's been worth it already, and I'm so proud knowing that my body is getting healthier every minute I don't smoke. Keep it up, everyone! Fuck tobacco!

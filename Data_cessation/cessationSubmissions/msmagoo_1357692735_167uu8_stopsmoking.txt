32 days and feeling great!

I'm so proud and excited to have made it to 32 days! I forget about it more often then not. It's almost like it never happened :D I started back at the gym today and it felt great on the treadmill. I didn't feel like I was going to die after 2 mins of jogging! My lungs are starting to repair themselves and it feels wonderful. 

I also smell all the things. Which is good and bad. I can better smell my dog's shit when I have to clean up after her, which is unfortunate. I didn't realize how much her shit stank before... But I also can smell the rain and the trees and the grass! It's wonderful. 

At this point I have only saved about $114, but knowing this is just going to keep getting higher and higher makes me feel great. I need to buy myself a new bed and soon purchase flights and hotels for my trip to vegas for my mom's 50th birthday in April and I'm not that concerned about being able to afford it all. It's a great feeling. And this subreddit has been a huge help. Thank you all so much! I wish you all the best of luck with your quitting and I hope this subreddit helps you as much as it did me :)

Terrible Quit Smoking Advice

Before quitting I did some research on how to quit. Came across a lot of shitty advice. The worst \(in my opinion\) is the N.O.P.E. technique of "Not One Puff, Ever". Maybe it works for some people after they've gotten past the initial withdrawal.  I've never been one for the abstinence or no tolerance approach. The thought of N.O.P.E always made my mind panic even when I had a full pack.

So, I thought it be fun to list off terrible quit smoking advice you've either read or been told.

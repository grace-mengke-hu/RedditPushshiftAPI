Almost a week in. Worried about going out this weekend and blowing it.

Hi everyone! Thank you all for these encouraging posts. They are truly a huge help! I’m a relatively young (29 year old) woman who still goes out with friends for drinks on the weekend. I generally avoid alcohol this early in a quit, because it has failed me in the past, and I started smoking again.

I have a friends engagement party this weekend. What’s your advice? No alcohol? Less alcohol? Don’t go? It’s so crappy I’m thinking about avoiding a friends engagement party because I’m scared I will smoke in a social situation or drinking. 

My biggest inspo for quitting is my mother is a cancer survivor, but a few weeks ago she was diagnosed with COPD and it scared the crap out of me. I don’t want to end up this way. 

Any cravings tips are also a huge help. I’m first time on NRT (patches) and although they do help I still get cravings (especially after meals). 

Thank you and keep it up everyone!!

Intense dreams / dreams about smoking?

I just finished my third day nicotine and alcohol free and I had one of the most vivid, intense and just downright fucked up dreams I have ever had. At one point during the dream I had a cigarette, and it seemed so real that when I woke up for a few minutes I believed I had actually smoked the night before. Has this happened to anyone?

Side note: apart from the bit about smoking, the dream was actually super fun to experience :)

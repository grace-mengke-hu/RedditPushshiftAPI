Does weaning off work?

I've been a smoker for 11 years, started when I was fifteen. Up until the last year I was a pack a day + smoker. Then I cut down to a half a pack. Two weeks ago I cut down to 4 a day (2 on my drive into work, 1 at lunch, and 1 on my drive home). I know it's not much, but this is a pretty drastic reduction for me, and definitely have cravings for more. In a month I want to cut down to 2 a day and after a month of that stop all together. Has anyone tried this before with success? I don't think I can quit cold turkey, to anxiety and habit ridden.

Any Tips or Apps on your phone to help quit smoking?

I am trying to quit but I work in the service/music industry it seems like the only thing to do is drink and smoke really. Is there an app I can use that will send me daily reminders or something like that?  


Ive tried to quit about 6 times in the past. longest I made was about a month or two. Toothpicks and Gum don't work. I have an oral fixation. I also smoke marijuana and don't plan on quitting that. Vaping helped me quit smoking cigarettes but i got more nicotine than before and was more irritable all the time.   


I'm about to go on vacation and I plan to quit the day before I leave and not smoke the whole time.

My motivation

To be upfront, sorry for the long post. First time posting on this subreddit, and lurking/reading people's stories has given me hope. 17 days smoke free and looking forward to the 1-month milestone. Just wanted to share my experience thus far and what has kept me driven. This all started after going to the funeral of a co-worker, who died at her desk. She was not a smoker (at least not during the time I knew her) but she died of cardiac arrest. My habit was increasing my risk of the same such fate, among many other things. 

&amp;nbsp;

My mother was a smoker for 41 years and she recently quit. She has emphysema, and any time she got the flu it would develop into acute pneumonia...worse and worse each time, but always bouncing back. It was becoming a ticking time bomb, and she managed to wrest some control back of her health. She has been smoke free for nearly 7 months and is as spritely as ever. In this regard, and many others, she is a true role model.

&amp;nbsp;

There was also the shame/guilt every time an ad came on TV about quitting and then having to look at my wife. By way of unspoken agreement my wife and I both decided to make some changes. She began counting calories (as if she needed to anyway) and I began counting cigarettes (or lack thereof). Like many of you I use the Smoke Free app, and it helps me keep track of all the $$$ I am saving. I had some money saved up previously and put a 50% down-payment on a car for my wife, and the money I am saving more than covers the remaining loan payment and increased insurance. In addition, I have cut back and nearly eliminated my daily ritual of going out for breakfast on my way to work. That also saves money and is helping me shed pounds. I have a lot riding on my success in this venture, most importantly of all, the happiness of my wife.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking forward to hearing about everyone's success in quitting. Reading the dialogue about the ups and downs helps more than you know, so I hope to become engaged here if you'll have me.

TLDR - Funeral gave me fear of death. Saw the effects of smoking on my mom and her success after quitting. Want to be around for my wife and save money to give us a better life.

Not sure

I can say that I am quite confident of stopping smoking. I have had some success in the past. The reason I kept relapsing was that I had serious anxiety and depression. Smoking seemed like the only thing that helped back then. Now that I have taken care of that, I am quite sure of stopping very soon. I do not hope to buy any more packs from the store for myself. However, friends I know offer me smokes and I am perplexed as to how to react. How would you recommend that I handle such a situation? Also, I seem to need cigarettes when I drink. I drink only socially and drinking is not an issue. How would you guys suggest the way to go there?

Thanks.

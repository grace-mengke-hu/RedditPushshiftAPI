After Many Breaks and Short Lived Halts, Today was my First Day of Quitting Forever

Smoked consistently from 16-21 ~a pack/day. 21-22 marked a change where I broke from constant smoking to smoking only on the weekends, when I drank or went out. A social smoker I became. That is until recently when I started bartending. My mentor smoked and I fell back right back in to smoking. 1/2 - 1 pack/day for the past 2-3 weeks. Some days I didn't smoke at all, some days I smoked all day.

These past couple weeks have made me actually see and feel the difference that smoking has on my lungs, my odor, and my bank account. And I'm done with it. Forever. I never want to smoke another cigarette in my life and today was Day 1 of being done forever.

I also decided to quit drinking for 30 days to keep any urges at bay. Today was easy. I had a craving midway through work when my co-worker tapped me out for my turn in smoke break rotation and I told him I was ok. That was easy to get over. That more difficult craving was at the end of my shift walking to the bus stop. That I overcame with sunflower seeds and repeating in my head the reasons I'm not smoking anymore.

"You want that cigarette now but think of how tight your chest was this morning, you don't want that again."

"Cigarette would taste good right now, huh mate? Yeah it would! That shit you coughed up early didn't taste so good did it? You're right, Australian man who lives in my head, it was nasty. Fuck those cigs!"

So today was Day 1. It feels weird being a "non-smoker" for the first time since I was 15 years old, 22 now. But I like it and will continue to post my ups and downs with you guys here at /r/stopsmoking.

Cheers, and remember, mind over matter.

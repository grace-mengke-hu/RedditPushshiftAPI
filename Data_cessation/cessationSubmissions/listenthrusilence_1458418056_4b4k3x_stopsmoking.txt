17 days feeling depressed and sick

I've just been feeling sad and down. I also have an awful sore throat that won't let up. Any tips on getting passed this? I've been sleeping a lot more too and I feel like I'm wasting my time but I can't seem to will myself up in the morning. Probably because I can't get to sleep at night. Everything feels out of whack. I just want to be productive again but I'm having a hard time.

Quit Nicotine, Need Advice to Adjust

I am currently 22, I have been on and off smoking and vaping nicotine since 17. It kept me alert and sharp, often propelling my OCD habits as a consequence.  I actually quit by accident. My local vape shop gave me a 0% Nic bottle as opposed to my usual 3%. I used it for a week before reading the ingredients. First two days I had terrible headaches, the next five I felt better but tired. Currently 20 days clean from nicotine.
These are the current problems that I've experienced, I hope they will regulate automatically over time. 

- Inability to sleep through the night

- Difficulty to get moving in the morning

- Trememendous increase in hunger, leading to overeating

- Tremendous increase in sex drive, leading to too much time being consumed in pursuit of this

- Coffee does not have a strong effect upon my body anymore, regardless of quantity 

Any tips on habits, hobbies, natural vitamins, diet, or coping tools would be greatly appreciated!

Day 11 -- Nicotine Withdrawal Side Effects?

I had an amazing first week -- no cravings, no chance of turning back. I did use patches for several days (1-7) until I hit up Allen Carr and ditched those, too. 
But for approximately 72 hours now (days 9-12) I am unreasonably irritable, sensitive, and truthfully depressed. It really feels like it's inexplicably out of character and has no root cause, and I have a short fuse in almost all of my interactions. 

 I joined a CrossFit community 6 weeks prior to my quit, work out 5-6 days a week, quit drinking, track my eating an micros, attend bi-weekly therapy sessions, and life has been otherwise positive and healthy. 
I really don't even want a cigarette, I just need reassurance that mood and mental health issues are common or heard of this far into my quit -- it's breaking my spirit. :-(

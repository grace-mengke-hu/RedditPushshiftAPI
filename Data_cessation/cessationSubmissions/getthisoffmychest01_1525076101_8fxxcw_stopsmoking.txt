4 weeks in without smoking. Bought a pack, ready to give in. A cigarette on my left hand and lighter on my right hand. I'm glad I didn't light it up, today.

I have to say, this 3rd and 4th week are hard, but today is the hardest one yet. I walked myself to the supermarket 3 times today (2km each complete trip from my place). I bought a pack on the 3rd one. 

I walked for another 1km back to my place after I bought that pack of cigarettes. My mind went haywire.. I was fighting with myself so hard during that walk back. All those nasty rationalizations. I grabbed the lighter and the cigarette tightly in my pocket. 

I sat down in a bench, pulled out one cigarette out of the pack to my left hand, and lighter to my right hand, ready to fire at anytime.

But somehow, I just froze there for a good 20 minutes. Then all the bad memories of when I was smoking came flooded to my mind. The sore throat, wheezes, times when I can't smell or taste my food. 

Before I quit cold turkey, I forced myself to smoke a pack of 25s in 30 minutes, I've never felt so sick before. But somehow, I even managed to rationalize that horrible memory today. 

Writing this helped me bring back that nasty memory vividly again to me, and today is the day that I accepted myself as an addict. I hope I can quit for good.

A question regarding quitting.

I've been smoking for 5 yrs, and other than an odd 8-hours or day here and there, i've never been able to quit.
When asked by friends why I haven't been able to do it, I give the same answer every time.
I don't really want to, like in all honesty I dont.
I enjoy smoking, I enjoy the feeling of it, I don't WANT to quit.

My question is; How do I get past this mindset?

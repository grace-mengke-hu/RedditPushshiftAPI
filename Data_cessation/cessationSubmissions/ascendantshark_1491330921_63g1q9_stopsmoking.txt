You don't have to smoke

Resetting today... I can't keep doing this to myself. If I want to be healthy, and honest about being healthy, I need to stop smoking. I'm trying to lose weight and deal with chronic pain, and there is no way cigarettes can be helping. 

The thing I am focusing on lately is the concept that even if I want to smoke, I don't have to. That's pretty much it. I don't have to smoke.

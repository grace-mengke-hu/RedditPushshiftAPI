a HATE a DAY #4

4 days ago, I made a promise to post 1 thing I hate about smoking everyday....day 4

AAAHH Shiit!!

I hate that moment when your lip attaches itself to the cigarette butt, and without out knowing, you go to ash...and then...your fingers slide their way from the butt all the way up to the cherry. Setting ablaze everything as its pulled from its fiery roots. And there you are with a smoldering mess on your shirt feeling like a Jacko.

I've ruined a nice tattoo because of cherry burns, I hate Smoking!!!!

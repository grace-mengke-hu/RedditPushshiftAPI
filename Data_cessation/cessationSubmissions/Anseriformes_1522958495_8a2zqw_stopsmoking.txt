Last week it was white fingernails

This week it's noticeably less dark circles under my eyes and way less dry skin. I've never known my face without dark circles and just thought it was my genes. So awesome to have bright eyes and a bright complexion now. 

I'm also sleeping without melatonin for the first time in many years. Always had to pop one before bed due to that goodnight cigarette. Always thought I just have trouble sleeping because of an over-active brain at bedtime. Nope, once again, it was cigarettes. Haven't used a sleep aid since week 1. 

If you're still on the cusp of quitting these are just a few great things to look forward to!

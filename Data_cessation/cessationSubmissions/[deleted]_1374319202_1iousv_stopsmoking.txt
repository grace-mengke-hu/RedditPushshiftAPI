This is just a note to my future self. Maybe it will work for someone else, if not me

Right now, there is something that I want to accomplish. I will attempt to quit smoking entirely as of waking up sunday. 'Cutting down' has continually resulted in temporary  success, followed by desperate rationalization of more cigarettes here and there. I know what I want to do, and it's stop. So future sunday-me, if you're reading this, don't do it. For once, don't rationalize "just that one" cigarette. Use an ecig, or even buy a patch if you need to. Just give cigarette soberness a chance! I'm not asking you (myself) to never have a cigarette again, Im asking you to hold off on the urge, and reconsider from the state of mind of someone 20, maybe 30 days free of the mental influence of cigarettes

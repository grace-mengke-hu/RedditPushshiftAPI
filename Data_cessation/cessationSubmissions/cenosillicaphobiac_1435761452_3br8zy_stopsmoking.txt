No more smiley for 358 days

Got rid of smiley circle.  Won't see a smiley in my flair again for a good bit.

EDIT:  I'm not talking about relapsing, I'm talking about how for the first week you get a smiley circle then you don't see a smiley face again for 358 days!  Although I did relapse, that's not what I'm referencing.

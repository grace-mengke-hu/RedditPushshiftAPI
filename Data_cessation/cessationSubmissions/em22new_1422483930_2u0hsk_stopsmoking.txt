Back to square one...

Christmas was had, with all the boozing... I lapsed and smoked like a chimney. Well, now at the end of January I have put down the dreaded fags once and for all. 

These are the darkest hours, the roughest days. 

Stay strong, keep disciplined. I was 125 days deep. 

I've been here before and this will get easier.

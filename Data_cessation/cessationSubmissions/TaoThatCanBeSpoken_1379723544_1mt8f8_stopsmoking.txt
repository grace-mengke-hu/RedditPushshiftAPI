not smoking makes you more drunk

hey, i didn't know about this so i wanted to warn others, as well.

i quit smoking 5 days ago, but i still drink every day and go to bars. in my experience, i get much drunker now than before from the same amount of alcohol. last night i had my first real black out, i was at a bar with a girl. i woke up today at 3 pm and i don't remember going home or what happened with her, although they tell me we left together, it's kinda disturbing. (though i assume nothing happened)

so if you're a drinker like me, be careful after you quit...

p.s. no hangover when you're not smoking :)

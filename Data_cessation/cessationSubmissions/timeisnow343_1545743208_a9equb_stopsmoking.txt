30 days milestone

After multiple quit attempts, I have finally hit the one month milestone. After more than a decade of "Quit Smoking" new year resolutions, this is the year to finally cross it off the list. 

Somethings that worked for me
1.	Winter is the perfect time to quit. Toronto winters are cold enough to discourage going out for a smoke
2.	I tried cold turkey multiple times. Finally settled on patches as NRT. Currently on 14 mg patches after finishing 21mg for a month 
3.	First few days were brutal. Sleeplessness, headaches, irritability were unbearable. Now, those bad days are one of the reasons for staying quit. Can't bear the idea of picking and quitting again only to get those migraines. 
4.	Physical activity helps with the cravings. Started doing a 5 min physical activity whenever cravings became too much. Walks on the office stairwell, push-ups or jumping jacks at home etc. The improvement in stamina over a few days gives positive reinforcement to the quit.
5.	Spent tons of times on r/nosmoking. Reading experiences of other ppl going through the same process helped a lot.

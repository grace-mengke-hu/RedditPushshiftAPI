I just wanted to bring everyone a little encouragement.

I'm not sure how many of you are quitting smoking with help. i.e. patches, gums, someone to lean on, etc. But for those of you who are doing this all on their own (like me), I wanted to throw a little morning encouragement to you.  
I've come to realize that quitting smoking is nothing but mental. YOU can stop smoking anytime. All you have to do is free yourself from this horrible hold cigarettes have. But please, those of you are having trouble, just remember, PEOPLE ARE STRONG. STRONGER THAN YOU WOULD THINk. You can do this. Plus, you have all of us. We're all in the same boat. You're not alone, friend. :)

Quit on 14th Feb 14

Today is my third day without cigarettes and feels like that I will be miserable for the rest of my life (while i crave for cigarettes). Hope these cravings go away.....

EDIT1: Work days are the days I smoke maximum during the week. Today was the first work day without the cigarette and it wasn't that bad.

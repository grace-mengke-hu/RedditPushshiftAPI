Addiction is crazy.

I am a research technician at an major university doing pulmonary research. I work mainly on a lung cancer project and culture and treat A549 lung cancer cells whether in cell culture or in mice.

I was at my apartment a couple weeks ago looking over a paper thinking how fucking stupid would you have to be to smoke cigarettes. Then a voice in the back of my head says "You have a dip in your mouth you asshole!" I had been addicted to dip for the past 8 years and didn't even associate seeing the effects of tobacco use to what I was doing. I was dipping out of pure habit and not even realizing I had it in. Craziest part is that we have many researchers in our lab that smoke even after handling human lungs from people that just died of lung cancer. 

The point is that tobacco use is pure habit and addiction and that most of the time you smoke or dip without even thinking about it without even enjoying it or associating it with cancer and addiction. That's why I think it gets easier over time. It is because you break the habit and mental addiction and once those are gone you start to realize that you don't even like to do it.

50 days down.

Nothing interesting to share. 50 days in. Nothing profound to say as most of y'all. I decided to quit, weened off, and now 50 days pass. barely check in on smoke free app anymore, but starting to do so again today. i don't feel like a 'smoker' anymore so not smoking is pretty much the norm for me. continue to better yourself, we're rooting for you. thanks for sharing of your personal stories, they helped me for the first 2-3 weeks which were the hardest. you can do it.

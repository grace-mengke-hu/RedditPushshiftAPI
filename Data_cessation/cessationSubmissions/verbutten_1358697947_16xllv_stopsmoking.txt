One month thoughts

Like lots of people here, I feel a debt towards this subreddit for making a tough few weeks much easier. Thanks and good luck to everybody who's quitting, requitting, and thinking about how to quit. 

I've been surprised by how quickly I got used to the idea of being a non smoker. This happened within 48 hours of stopping, maybe because I'd carefully prepped with Allen Carr and flown to a new location when quitting.

On the other hand, I've also been surprised by how long some physical side effects just keep grinding on. Little aches, weird bowel stuff (especially the first 10 days), and a lingering un-ease at night. I don't think it's a craving, really-- I have those, too, and they only last a few minutes.

No turning back now of course! Any persistent annoyances are just the beautiful price to pay for health, better mood/concentration, and what I've already noticed is a  LOT more cash in my pocket.

good luck everyone! thanks r/smoking.

6 months today.

Cravings are long gone. It's hard to believe I used to do that shit every day. I would structure my time around being able to go smoke. The other day some lady stood next to me at a craft fair just reeking of smoke; I couldn't imagine that that used to be me. 

I tried this many, many times but this time it has stuck. Don't give up, keep trying things until you find the one that works for you. It's so, so worth it.

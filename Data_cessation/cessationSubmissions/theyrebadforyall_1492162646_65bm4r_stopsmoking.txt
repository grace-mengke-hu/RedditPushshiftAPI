I'm about to crack. Any tips ?

I haven't had a smoke in 35 days. But  tonight is friday night and since I'll be staying home and doing nothing, it's hard. Then the weekend will be even harder. I'm on the verge of buying a carton of cigarettes just to keep myself busy for the weekend. I don't know what to do.

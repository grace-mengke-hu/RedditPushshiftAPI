37 yr old smoker looking for help

On and off for 20 something years now, mainly on.

I did manage 8 months non smoking 3 years ago. 

I work outside now and I have always associated outside with smoking so I do it more frequently. 

Currently about 10 on an average day at work. It increases when I drink x3.

I do not smoke when I have my child on the weekends from his other parent as I don't want him to see me in that light.

I could do with a good app that tracks as I'm looking for help. 

Also any advice in general to start a new habit of stopping this addiction. 

Thank you

Day 18 complete

So, I survived the three days I stayed by myself at home. Haven't smoked, though the craving was there. It wasn't the craving of I have to smoke, but the craving of take advantage of being alone and smoke. Anyway, now that I didn't smoke, I don't have to reset my counter. I am still getting some phlegm in my throat, but I guess that is normal. Thanks for reading.

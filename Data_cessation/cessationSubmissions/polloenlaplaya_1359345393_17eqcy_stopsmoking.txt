First time actually making an effort to quit.

I love smoking. I really do. But it's so unhealthy and my health is all I have. I've been getting strep throat infections each month for the past five months. The doctors say that smoking definitely doesn't help. I'm getting a tonsillectomy on Wednesday, and I'm old enough for this procedure to be a pain in the ass. I'm hoping that since I won't want to smoke for the first week or so after the surgery, that I can just drop smoking from that point on. Is this a shitty strategy or could I actually make progress this way? I don't particularly want to quit, but the need to quit is becoming very present. I'd like to be able to run around and be more active once I'm healed. I'd like to quit before the effects on my body become too obvious. I want white teeth! Anyways, this is getting rant-y. Any advice, words of wisdom, etc. would be much appreciated, and congratulations to all of you already on your journeys.

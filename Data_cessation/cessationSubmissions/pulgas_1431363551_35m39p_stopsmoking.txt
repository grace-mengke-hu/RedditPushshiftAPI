6 days, depressed as fuck, and a dream vacation on my way... what should i do?

Hi fellow quitters, i've been smoking for 7 years, a package a day, never seriously tried to quit, So when a couple of friends from work start trying, i decided that was my time too and here i am, 2 kg heavier, depressed as hell, but without a cig for 6 days! 
 
I live in Brazil and never went to other country, in 6 days i will  be travelling to Berlin for vacation with my non smoking boyfriend, for 20 days... And i am so so sad because i will not be smoking in Berlin, all those beers, the nightlife, everything, is my dream trip and i am already sad because i will be suffering from absence of nicotine... Also if i smoke i fear that the addiction will comeback and i will be one of these ridiculous "weekend smokers". 

What should i do?
TL/DR: I'm 6 days without cigarretes, going to the trip of my dreams and depressed because i will not smoke there.

I quit 157 days ago on March 6th, 2016 at 7:42 am.

I just want to be encouraging to others who may take the time to read this. I started smoking at 18 while working at a call center. Seven years later, after losing my grandma (my person) to pneumonia, and wanting a better job I quit cold turkey. I smoked a pack a day, sometimes more sometimes less, for 7 years. I now how my dream job (Emergency Room RN) (good hospitals won't hire a nurse that smokes). I downloaded the app "smoke free" which tracks your quitting information. From there, I opened a savings account and added money in it weekly to save the money I'd normally burn. My account is currently at $860 which is crazy to me. It's only been 157 days. The biggest down side is now I can smell EVERYTHING. it's so awful having to smell people who hadn't bathed in a while. If I can do it, you can. I suffer from anxiety and depression and I was in my last semester of nursing school. It's possible you're awesome.

11 days- help, the anxiety is insane

Hello good people!

So, posting all over the place on reddit today, since after i quit smoking my anxiety level has gone crazy up- my tinnitus and other hearing disorders are flaring up - and i am generally depressed and fucking sad all the time. How to cope ? In certain ways this feels worse than when i stopped smoking weed , was addicted to that stuff too for 10 years as well. Now having quit cigarettes after smoking since i was 13 (31 now) , i have no way of "escaping" into my comfort zone, i am left naked and alone to deal with all my emotions. How to keep doing this ? Maybe smelling horrible and battling with possible cancer later in life is a small price to pay compared to the mental anguish coupled with physical symptoms i am experiencing at the moment (I know that sounds stupid, but i am very irrational these days, aaaargh!)  Sorry for bad english, am norwegian

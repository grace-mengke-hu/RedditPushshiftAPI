It's a life long battle

Hello everyone and thanks for reading. 

I just passed my 6 month smoke free mark. I'm pretty proud of myself. *holds for applause* lmao

I ran into a former coworker yesterday. We were talking for a bit I mentioned I quit and she said she just started again.. after 15 years of no smoking. 

I was flabbergasted.. 15years!! Why?! Why would you after 15 years?! I just cannot fathom it! She cited stress and emotional issues and such and it made me think.. I really am in for a life long battle with never picking up a cigarette again. I hope I never do. I say now I never will but man.... who knows I guess? 

It took a lot of courage to stop. And strength and I hope I can hold onto that forever.

If you just quit remember it will be tough. It ain't no cake walk. But be strong. Hold out! Just stop and dont do it anymore! 

Heres to having cravings for the rest of my life and telling those cravings to eff right off!!

I want to quit soon

I'm putting it off until after the 11th because I know I'm going to be super stressed and drunk during the national championship. But I've been reading through all the posts and y'all seem like a pretty awesome and supportive bunch. I also have a really good friend who quit pretty recently. I'd love to join y'all.

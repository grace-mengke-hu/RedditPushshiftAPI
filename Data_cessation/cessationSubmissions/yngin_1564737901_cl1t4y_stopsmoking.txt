Making this decision

I’ve been smoking for about 2 years now I’m in my early 20s. I never really disliked it but this year I started to see the side effect which is fairly soon I’d think. I can’t keep an erection no matter how hard I try. I eat very well not the average American diet by any means. Didn’t grow up on fast food and still don’t really eat it much (except chic-fil-a sometimes). I work out 3-4 times a day intense for 1-2 hours. I do not use steroids . It never made sense but I see now that I do smoke about 5 cigarettes a day. I feel terrible hitting the first one of the day even after two years and I just keep smoking throughout the day. I’ve smoked about maybe 1-2 packs a week since I’ve started. These things destroy us no matter how good we treat ourselves in other aspects of our lives. I don’t even know why I smoke, I don think of myself as a smoker I just saw It as something extra in my life ...I’m not sure how to explain it. It’s almost like I didn’t even know I smoked but I always remember to buy a pack and keep them on me like a wallet. Ive decided I want to quit smoking and I am going to start on Sunday this weekend. I’m still researching on what to do about cravings and the withdrawal but I know what to expect. Wish me luck

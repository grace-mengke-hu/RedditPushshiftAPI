I haven't tried quitting for years, this morning I decided to try again, and then by pure chance I found this sub. Joined. What advice for quitting worked for you?

Started smoking at 21 when I began college, just to be social and outside. It escalated quickly. I'm almost 31. I smoked between half to full pack a day(12-25, I'm Canadian) from then until now. I've become always wheezy and I'm waking up coughing every hour now and my physical endurance is next to nothing. To hell with this shit, I don't need it.

Questions for long time quitters.

I quit smoking March 1st 2012. It has been a while. My daughter started school a couple of weeks ago and when kids go back to school they get sick and bring home the germs. I also got sick.

The weird thing, the sickness has kind of gone into my lungs and I taste and smell cigarettes like I haven't quit smoking. Is this weird or am I cleaning old tar and crap out of my lungs? 

It is very weird and I am wondering if it is just me or if others have had this happen.

A year.

Hey guys. I lurked a lot here while quitting. Coming back when cravings were at their strongest. 3 days ago I hit a year. 


Cravings never go away but man is it easy to not go to the store for cigarettes every day. It's nice that smell is still working it's way back. Sometimes I catch myself doing just that. Stopping to smell something I hadn't smelled in 10 years. Thanks cigarettes. 


I can walk through bars and the smokers at work with about 80% disgust. Those neural pathways are still there. I guess they're always going to be. It's still romantic in a way I guess. That first cup of coffee. That first cigarette. 

Honestly, I've also gained 60 pounds after I quit. I guess my office job is more sedentary but man. I'm not happy in this body right now. But smoking and stopping has shown me that I can overcome this too. 

I can build that savings account. I can have that future. If I can string a year of this together after smoking for almost 10, hell I'm fucking invincible.

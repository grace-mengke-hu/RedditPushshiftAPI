Over 1 week (Again)!

Hey, he's back,
Back again,
Look, he's back,
Tell a friend.

Well, badge is updated to when I last had a smoke, and it's been much easier this time. Cravings are easier to deal with, the headaches are just annoyances. The worst part is the congestion and the coughing. Anybody got a solution for that?

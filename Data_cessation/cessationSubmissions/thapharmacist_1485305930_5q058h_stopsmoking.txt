Day 2 complete

Well technically it has only been 1d 12h 5 mins but I am counting it as two days. I had one Monday morning then Stopped and none today. The funny thing is I wasn't even plan on quitting, I just kinda wanted to see how long I can go. My mom just quit a month ago and my dad quit a few years ago, so if they can I can. I am 33 and have smoked for close to 20 years already and need to stop early and before it is too late. Would def like to play some sports or exercise without feeling like I am going to die during it. These cravings suck though

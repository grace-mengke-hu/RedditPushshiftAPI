6 months nicotine free

Hi everybody. I quit smoking on 20th August last year. That makes today 6 months since I quit. simply reaching this milestone makes me feel like a badass. Let alone it being worth every bit of effort. I can breathe well, I don't stink, my house doesn't stink, I have extra cash, my self confidence is better... I could go on. 

For all of you starting your journey or thinking of starting, I urge you to take that step in the right direction. Remind yourself that you are not giving up anything. There is nothing good about smoking. You are freeing yourself from addiction. Don't be scared of the withdrawal; face it with open arms and know that every craving resisted is a nail in the coffin of slavery. 

For all of you sharing your victories, hardships and failures... thank you. You have made my own journey easier. It is good to know that you are not alone. Keep sharing; it keeps us all going. 

Here's to six months of freedom. Cheers.

Smoking Is So Intertwined With My Social Life...

I've been smoking since I was 16. Picked up the habit as most do, because a majority of my friend group smoked. For the past 14 years almost every big social occasion (parties, weddings, group trips, etc) has involved smoking. It has become so intertwined with social interaction for me.

I am on day 17 and so far it's been kind of a breeze. But I just planned a trip to visit my best friend next month, and it suddenly occurred to me--we won't be doing the thing we've done together for over a decade. We won't sit on the porch and chain smoke while catching up on life. It seems so silly, I know. We can still sit on the porch and catch up on life. But for some reason it still feels like I will be missing out on that extra thing that connects us. It's the hardest thing for me to overcome in my mind--that I can still enjoy things just as much without smoking. I hope I will get there eventually.

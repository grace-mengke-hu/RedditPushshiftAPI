How to WANT to quit smoking?

I know smoking is bad for me but it just won't go in to my brain. I think I could handle the cravings pretty easily but I haven't even got to that stage yet. I don't want to quit smoking. I can watch all the pictures of black lungs and read about people passing away from lung cancer. I still don't want to quit, I just want to want to quit. Does this make any sense? Any advice?

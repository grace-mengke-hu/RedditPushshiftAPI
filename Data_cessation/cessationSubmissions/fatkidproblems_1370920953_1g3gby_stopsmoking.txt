you don't realize that you are an addict

this is probably the 20th time I have tried to quit smoking, I am not telling anyone because they all have heard the other 19 times that I thought it was going to be for good.. I have only been smoking for 5years (im 22) but I cant imagine my life without it. I have associated smoking with entertainment, with companionship, with stress release and its all second nature to me. Now I'm only a day in and already my brain is fogged, I can't focus, I want to sit here cry/scream until I get a cigarette, but we all know that the cigarette wont talk to me, it wont love me, it wont make everything be okay, but your brain in nicotine withdraw will tell you anything to get at drug... when your brain is screaming at you that you need a pack of cigs more than you need air, its completely scary.. you don't feel in control of your brain, its a constant battle and makes you feel crazy...

here's to over coming this hellish addiction that is wrongfully legal to do, hopefully it will get better from here. Any tips are much appreciated <3

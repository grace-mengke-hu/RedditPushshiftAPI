3 weeks smoke free after 16 years

I have no desire to ever smoke again. Around 2 weeks mark, I developed chest congestion, shortness of breath and bouts of coughing. I went to the ER because I felt like I was suffocating, I was diagnosed with acute bronchitis with bronchospasms and they prescribed me abuterol, iptrium bromide and montelukast (singulair). I'm slowly feeling better but has anybody else had health scares while quitting? Does it get better?

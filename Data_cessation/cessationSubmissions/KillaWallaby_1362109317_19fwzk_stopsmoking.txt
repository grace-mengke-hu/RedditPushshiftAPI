We need to talk r/stopsmoking...

There's alot of Allen Carr love on this sub, but Allen Carr isn't the end all be all.  

I just read a post where someone who had read Allen Carr's easy way many times and failed many times was just trying it again. 

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY TRY DIFFERENT THINGS IF ONE ISN'T WORKING!

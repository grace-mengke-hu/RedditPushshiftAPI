Can I quit by cutting back to JUST smoking in the car?

I don't smoke at work, or while I'm sleeping. That's 16 hours right there!  
I've been working out and I dont want to smoke before my work out anymore, or smoke at all, because of it!  
But its hard, especially on the way to and from work!!  
I got Allen Carrs book, I believe I'm on page 5 or something.  
So i'm gonna read that and, is smoking to and from work something I can manage into quitting completely?

Working on Day #12 :)

So here I am working on day #12.  Woke up filled with phlegm and can not stop sneezing this morning, from what I have researched is common with people who stop smoking.  

Also, interesting side note here, every thing I read said that people who stop smoking sleep less, I seem to sleep more, like 10+ hours.  I usually slept like 6-8 hours when I was smoking, just for comparison.

It is a crazy ride that I would not take back for anything :)

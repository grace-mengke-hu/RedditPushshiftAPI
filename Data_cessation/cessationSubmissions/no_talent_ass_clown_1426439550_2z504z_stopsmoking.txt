Woke up, made coffee, settled in with Reddit and *forgot* to pick up my vaporizer. Did I just win at quitting?

I put down cigarettes the day my vaporizer came in the mail (over two weeks ago). I started vaping 12mg (aka "light") nicotine liquid but stepped it down to 6mg (aka super light) within two days and I've been happy with that ever since.

Yesterday, I put down my vaporizer around noon and just never picked it up again. Today, I made my coffee and didn't even think about picking it up until just now.

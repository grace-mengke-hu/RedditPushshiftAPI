Quitting related to increase panic attacks?

I'm 5 days in my latest (and last) quitting attempt. This is the first attempt I've made since being over my last hump of anxiety.

So, yesterday I applied for a new job on my college campus. I went to work at my current job today and wondered if they'd replied. They hadn't.

Then I began to worry about having a job by the end of the month (I've been temping for my dad. His office is too small at the moment and another guy is returning from travelling so he's having his desk back). And that worry became a stress about that money, and that stress became a full blown panic attack. 

I had to leave work. I drove home in a daze. And although I've been so happy with my progress so far, all I could think is having a cigarette will make this whole thing go away.

I didn't stop, my 5 days is still 5 days, thankfully.

I just wanted to know if there's anyone else who has quit and who has anxiety. How did you deal with panic attacks without them? Did you/have you had more panic attacks since quitting?

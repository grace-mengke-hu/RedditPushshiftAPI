Quitting again

Here we go again. I've been smoking a pack a day or more for ten years. My worst period was two packs a day two years ago. I want to quit for good. I've tried countless times, but only twice made it past  two weeks. I need help. 

Going cold turkey, started at 4. Haven't been able to sleep and it's 7.

Day 2 and need help with the mindgames

So yesterday was a long day, Day 1 sucks so I made sure it was a Saturday full of sleep and tv with nothing to do. I made it through. But today is day 2 and all my  brain is saying "just smoke for today, then quit tomorrow." Any advice /tips to get through this is welcome

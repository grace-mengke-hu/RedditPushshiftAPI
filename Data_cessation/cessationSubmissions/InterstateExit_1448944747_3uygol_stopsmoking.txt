I'm in mourning.

Been posting a lot today and this sub is helping me more than any of you can know. Tonight I am in mourning. I've lost an old companion. I think I read something about this on the .gov website. You feel like you're missing out, or that you have a loss. I do have a loss, it's a loss of nicotine addiction. It's not a loss, though. There is no benefit. Thanks for listening, tonight is tough. I don't smoke anymore.

Yo fam, stay strong.

Just want to encourage everyone to stay in it. I quit about two and a half months ago. I’ve tried three times before and never made it past a week or two.

I only think about cigarettes once or so a day now, and usually it’s when I smell someone smoking. It has only gotten easier and easier with each passing day.

I smoked a pack a day for 15 years. Trust me when I say that YOU can do this. Every craving is temporary. All you have to do is get through that 10 or so minutes and you’ll be fine.

Cigarettes are dumb, and they do nothing but make you want another one. 

Good luck y’all. I believe in you.

Survived my first visit with friends

I went over to my friends house last night and was in an apartment with three smokers for the whole night. I took a shot early on then decided against drinking to keep a clear head about quitting. I also survived a walk with my best friend. We like to wander around late at night, smoke alot and talk about shit away from everyone else. Im having a hard time finding the words to convey how proud of myself I am.

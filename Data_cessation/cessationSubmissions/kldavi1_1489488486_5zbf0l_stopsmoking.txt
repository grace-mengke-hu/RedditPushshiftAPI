Finally Quit

Well it's been almost a week (6 days) since I quit smoking. I quit a few years ago for 5 years! And picked it back up again. I'm 46 so I must quit for good this time. I'm using nicotine gum currently, but I hear that's not such a good idea, so I'll have to stop that soon, but for now it's helping.

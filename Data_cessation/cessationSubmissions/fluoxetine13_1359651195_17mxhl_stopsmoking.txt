Went into my neighborhood 7-11 yesterday....

Been going there for years for beer and smokes...most of the employees know me... yesterday I just bought beer.  The guy behind the counter says "Camel Lights?" and I practically shouted "NOPE I QUIT".  He says "We wondered where you'd been!  I'm proud of you!"

You know that's the shit when the 7-11 guy is proud of you :)

Quitting soon, need NRT advice

Hey folks,

I've been smoking about half a pack daily since I was 18. Next Monday, 6/12,  is my 25th birthday so I'm holding myself to quitting on that date. I've been vaping and generally reducing my smoking for a couple months now. I'm curious what you all think of NRTs in general. Should they be avoided? Any types in particular that work well for people? Have any of you had success quitting but still vaping? 

Thanks in advance and wish me luck!

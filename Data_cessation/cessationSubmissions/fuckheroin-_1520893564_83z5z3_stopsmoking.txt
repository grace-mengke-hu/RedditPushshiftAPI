CAN YOU GIVE ME ADVICE?

I just found this sub and i’m at the point in my life where i’m ready to quit, i’m not letting this take over my life any longer. Some background i’m 20 years old about 110-115 pounds i smoke as soon as i wake up i smoke after i eat and basically all the time. i came here to ask everyone what’s helpful to quit? what has worked for you? what advice do YOU have? i give everyone who’s quit a huge round of applause wether it’s one day or twenty years!

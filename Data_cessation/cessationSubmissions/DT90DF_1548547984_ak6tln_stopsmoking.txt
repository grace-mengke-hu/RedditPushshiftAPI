Quit Zits!

Hey everyone! Day 14 here and I have been feeling good mostly. I had the blues for a couple of days but the cravings have been manageable with NRT. 

I have never had particularly good skin but what’s happening on my face right now is nothing I have ever experienced. Huge breakout, tons of sore pimples all over my face but really concentrated on my jawline. I did not connect this with my quitting smoking until I was chatting with my mom earlier. I googled it and “quit zits” does seem to be a thing that some quitters experience. 

I don’t have much to say about it but thought I would put it out there as it is a quit symptom that I was not previously aware of. I am looking forward to the healthier skin of a non-smoker once these pesky “quit zit” pimples clear up. 

It’s really incredible how sinister cigarettes are and how powerful addiction is isn’t it? 

Good luck to everyone quitting and suffering through these surprise minor indignities. Don’t give up! It’s all for the greater good! THE GREATER GOOD!

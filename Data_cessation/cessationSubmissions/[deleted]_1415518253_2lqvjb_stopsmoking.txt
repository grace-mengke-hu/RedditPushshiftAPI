Easiest & Sure shot way to quit smoking for good. No need of will power and constant battles with your mind. Read along.

**EDIT: Ignore my badge. It was a false start.**

I was  been addicted to smoking for years now. I tried to quit the cold turkey way, the 'Easy Way to Quit' and even the nicotine gum way.

6 months back I was having 15-20 per day. And since I'm a girl, there was a huge social stigma with it. ( I live in India)

I could get rid of the physical addiction but it was the mental addiction that I couldn't get rid of. Like I always missed the awesome feeling of first drag.

 Luckily the guy I'm seeing, also was an ex smoker. He told me a weird way to get rid of the habit.
I was sceptical at first but it's been 50 days since I touched a ciggerate and I'm confident that I'll never ever touch it. And it was soooo easy. So let's start

First of all it'll take 4-5 weeks for the program. What you need
>Tons of ciggerate

>Tons of Nicotine Gums

Now here's the trick: **Before you feel like smoking, pop in a nicotine gum. Wait for 15 minutes. Then go ahead and smoke.** You won't feel like it, but that's the trick.

Trust me it works. It works because popping a nicotine gum neutralises the effect of smoking. You don't get the awesome 'completion' feeling any more. But here's the important thing:  **Keep doing it for a month** .

**EDIT: Do it only 4-5 times/ day and not more. Not like you'll even want to do it more**

Keep doing it for some time. With time your brain will stop associating the good feeling with cigarettes . The link between cigarettes and good feeling will vanish over time.

Now, you'll still have one hurdle to cross. You'll get addicted to nicotine gums. At least I was. The guy I was seeing told me that he wasn't.

Keep popping it whenever you feel like. Reduce 1 gum per 3-4 days. I started out with 8-9 gums a day.

2 months later I was down to 2 gums/day. One after lunch and one after dinner.

I still pop 1 gum every week or so and it is still a hurdle I have to overcome. But never once do I miss smoking. I don't feel nauseating without a cigarettes. I don't go absent minded between a movie. I absolutely do not think about cigarettes in a positive way any more.

Cigarette addiction is like a romantic relationship where the other partner has always the upper hand. And when you stop being around them, you idolize their good qualities and miss them. You know they're bad and you know they're abusive, but you can't stay without them because you love them. Well, not any more. I don't hate cigarettes now, but I have an apathy towards it. 

Sometime I do feel craving for nicotine (maybe once a week at max) and I pop the nicotine gum. I'm sure I'll stop it quickly.

Try it. It's easy, tested (on two people atleast) and you don't need to fight yourself.

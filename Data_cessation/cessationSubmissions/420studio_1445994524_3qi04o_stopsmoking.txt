I am an asshole

Tomorrow marks a month of being smoke free (woot) but I feel like I have turned into a turd. I'm just on edge all the time and still crave a ton. I don't miss smoking and I believe in myself that I'm done with it. I don't want to smoke at all. I understand the addiction and shit but I still crave. I feel tense a lot and I have to watch myself because I feel like I'm one bad situation away from blowing up on someone. I feel like I have become a dick and I don't like that. But it comes out of no where and I'll stop and think "am I really freaking out over this?" Maybe I am just going crazy. Maybe I should start exercising...

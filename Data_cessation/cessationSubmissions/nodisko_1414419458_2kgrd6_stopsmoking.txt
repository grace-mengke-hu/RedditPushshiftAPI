Long time Lurker First time Poster

I've tried to quit a lot over the past two years. Its become something that I've messed up with and failed at that it's hard thinking it'll ever be able to do it for real. 

As a bit of background, I've smoked since I was 17, I'm now 24. I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 3 and a half years. I've been promising her over and over that I will quit once and for all and that I'm done smoking for the past two years. Things came to a head yesterday when she smelt smoke on my clothes, I denied it and things escalated from there. The general jist is that she called me out on lying, and about all the other times that I've lied. She know's how difficult this is, and despite being very angry at me (because I lied and not because I smoked) she's been pretty dam helpful. But having that conversation with her yesterday has given me a new sense of belief that I can actually do this. This morning before I went to work I went around the house and rounded up all the smoking stuff I had sitting around or stashed. 

This is my first day of really meaning it, and really trying to give up smoking once and for all. I'm terrified, it's scary, and I'm sorry if I've rambled, I just feel like I needed to get that all out there!

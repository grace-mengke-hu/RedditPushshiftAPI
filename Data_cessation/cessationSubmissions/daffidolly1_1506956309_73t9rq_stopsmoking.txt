Day 1

Hi All! After ten years smoking I have finally decided to quit! One thing I'm very concerned about though is the mood swings and irritability. I haven't exactly been the most stable person emotionally the past while and I'm worried that this along with the side effects of nicotine withdrawal will be too much for me. Anyone who has been through this before, did the withdrawal affect your mood drastically and how did you overcome it?

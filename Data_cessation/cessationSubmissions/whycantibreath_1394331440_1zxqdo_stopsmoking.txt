First post 2 months smoke free... is this normal

Ive been smoking pretty much every day since i was 15. I'm 22 now and after trying and failing to quit numinous times before i decided this was the year i will kick it for good... However I'm just over 2 months in and i always seem to have a blocked nose/It feels like my sinuses are swollen and i cant smell anything! going to see my G.P next week but i was just wondering is this is normal or should i be looking at other reasons behind it? any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

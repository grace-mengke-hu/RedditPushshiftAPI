Beat my personal record!

Was worried about a weekend vacation at 40 days.  That is exactly how I fell last time (went to a casino and simply collapsed into cravings).  That started a slow relapse back to full fledged smoking.

After a weekend of heavy drinking in a foreign city, did not give in.

Makes me feel like I'm going to make it.
Just wanted to encourage all my fellow quitters, this quit is better than last attempt, don't let any failures discourage you from trying again.
Without a random craving from time to time, I almost otherwise do not remember what being a smoker felt like.

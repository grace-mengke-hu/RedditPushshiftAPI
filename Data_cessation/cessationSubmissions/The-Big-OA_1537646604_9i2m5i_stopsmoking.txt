Looking to quit

I'm about a week from my 29th birthday and as a present for myself I want to quit cigarettes to give myself a healthier life. I've "quit" before a few times and only lasted from one day to three max before either buying a pack or just getting a black and mild for a quick fix that turned right into buying another pack hours later.

A friend of mine that's a bartender mentioned some of her regulars have used the Juul for a month or two and now don't even use the Juul or smoke at all.

About 3 years ago I had a cheap vaporizer but only lasted 3 or 4 weeks before I went back to cigarettes, granted at the time I was working night shifts at a restaurant and was constantly around other smokers so I fell back in quickly. Currently no one else I work with smokes, my girlfriend doesn't smoke, and I don't go to bars nearly as much, maybe 1-2 times a month so I don't have a "reason" to socially smoke like I used to. Even though I still light up on breaks and after work. In the past 2 years I've been around non smokers it's always some stressor that makes me go back to smoking when I've tried to quit so I guess I don't have the self discipline to just go cold turkey.

I don't want to be a dick from nicotine withdrawals because I'm already tired of others suffering from my addiction, from the smell to 2nd hand smoke. What has helped y'all with quitting? Get a Juul to cut down or just buckle down and quit then apologize for being an ass after the withdrawals are over?

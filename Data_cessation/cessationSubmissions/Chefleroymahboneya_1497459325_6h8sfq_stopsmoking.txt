Testimonial!

When I was 11 years old, my father whilst puffing heavily on a cigar, told me that he would beat me within an inch of my life if he ever caught me smoking. Now, I knew this was no idle threat. He would indeed give me 150 lashes with a leather strap if he caught me. However, I would most likely end up on the wrong side of that strap no matter what I did. So I didn't care about the threat. What I did care about was that ... Drumroll please.... Girls could smoke. I had had no idea up until that moment. I had seen men smoking but never a woman. My father was a strict Baptist minister and I had been sheltered quite a bit. And if it was worth a beating it must be wonderful. 
The next chance I got I stole one of his long cigar butts. That began a 27 year addiction. In the end I would be smoking 3 packs a day. Spending 20$ a day on a drug that wouldn't even get me high. Killing myself... And not so slowly anymore. 
For 10 years I was on and off the wagon. Quitting and then smoking, trying one quick fix after another. Until finally came the day I quit for good. I wore the patch for about 45 days. It helped me get past the hand to mouth compulsion. But eventually you gotta go cold turkey. No matter how you start quitting. You gotta quit. It was hell and crazy town. And I pushed thru to the other side. That was 2 years ago. 
Now I'm free! I rarely think about cigarettes. When I do it's with gratitude that I don't need them anymore. 
I am proof that anyone can quit. You have the power!

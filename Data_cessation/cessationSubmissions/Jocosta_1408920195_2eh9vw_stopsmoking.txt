Patches? Second class quitting or solid treatment?

I'm using patches to quit.  I've done it before and was successful until I dropped from 14mg to 7mg.  At this time I'm just staying at 21mg, I haven't dropped yet.  So the question is this:  Are the patches plus support and meditation I've been doing less effective over time?  Is no nicotine replacement better?

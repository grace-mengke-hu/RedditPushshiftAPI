Why is quitting cigarettes so hard?

So, I'm 20 in a few months, been smoking for 5 years, up to a little under a pack a day. About two years ago I decided to make positive changes to my lifestyle. 

I've been exercising five days a week, I have a pretty solid diet, don't drink alcohol, and quit smoking pot after ~4 years of doing that (which was actually really easy to walk away from cold turkey).

The only thing I can't do is stop smoking cigarettes. I've tried quitting multiple times before and failed every time within a few weeks or months. 

I've now not had a cigarette for 3 weeks and it's such bullshit. Every morning I want one, and I have thoughts about smoking one at least a few times a day. I bought an e-cig a week ago as a crutch and it just doesn't do the justice that real tobacco mixed with chemicals does.

Why is this so difficult? I swear to God cigarettes will be the reason that I die. I feel like within a month I'll be back at it. Why do I have the discipline to exercise and eat properly and restrain myself from other harmful stimulants but not death-sticks?

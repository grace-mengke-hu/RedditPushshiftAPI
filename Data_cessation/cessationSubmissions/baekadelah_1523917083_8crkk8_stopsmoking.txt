Help

I hadn't smoked or wanted to smoke in over a year. See my country thing beside my name.
But past three weeks I've been craving them so bad when I drink alcohol. Its not been that way before. Maybe it's because of who I'm around. But I don't think so because over the past year I've drank with them and others and not wanted to smoke. Now I'm struggling to stop myself from going outside and asking for a drag. Anyone else go through this craving relapse so long after?

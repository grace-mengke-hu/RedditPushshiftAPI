I'm quitting today, and honestly, I'm worried about it.

Here's a little back story. Started smoking when I was 12 (I'm almost 33 now). Had easy access to smokes...everyone in my house and family smoked. It wasn't peer pressure, it was just something I *thought* everyone did, so I did it. 

That's 21 years of smoking.

About a week ago, my 8 yr old daughter (who *ADAMANTLY* hates the fact that I smoke) left for a trip about 4 hours away. This is the first time she has ever been anywhere without me or her mother. I promised her that if she had fun and returned home safely, I'd quit smoking. 

Well she gets home tonight.

Honestly, I know the pitfalls of smoking. I know the addiction. I know the damage it does to my body, and I know it's bad. Here is South GA, smokes aren't expensive, relative to other areas of the country I've read about ( here, my brand costs $3.50 a pack) but I know it's still a waste of money, considering I smoke almost 2 packs daily.

I am just scared of ME after I quit. What will my mind do? How will I cope without something I've held onto, daily, without fail, for 21 years? What will I do on work breaks? When I'm bored? When I'm having a cold beer? I have NO idea what will take it's place, and all I can honestly see is a huge void, a vacuum of time where cigs once existed. Long car trips...after a good meal....after sex. 

I know I have to do this...for my health, and also to keep the promise I made. 

Can I get some help? Maybe someone to check in with that's going thru the same thing? I know it's better to do it with a friend, but unfortunately I have no one going thru this nearby. 

From what I've read on this subreddit so far, everyone sems very helpful..so I guess I'm asking if I can beg a little help for myself, and maybe help someone in the process.

Thanks for reading.

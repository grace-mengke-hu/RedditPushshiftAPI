After a beautiful, smokefree month I relapsed...

...about two weeks ago and since then I was struggeling for the last two weeks. Continuously buying anorher „last“ package, smoke a couple of cigarets, throw away the remaining packages. I just did it again:( I so desperately want to quit but it is difficult to trust myself anymore.

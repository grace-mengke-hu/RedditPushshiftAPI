need to finish this.

ive been smoking for 6 years now. i've only recently, maybe in hte past two years, began to smoke very heavily. ive come to a point where i have to stop though. im sick as a dog from something that im sure i would be fine from if i hadnt been smoking so much in the past year. i just want anyone to please tell me some ways to help or some motivating things that helped you when you quit. im sick and tired of feeling like a pile of shit. thanks.

I almost lost it.

Last night I went out to the bars and I got incredibly drunk. One of my friends is a social smoker (literally only when he's drunk, don't know how he does it). Anyways he bummed one from a dude and so I asked him for some drags. He looks at me and goes, "Are you sure that's what you want?" Once he said that I started doubting if I did want any. And then told me he wouldn't give me any because he knows where I'm at. Thank god for him. He saved my quit.

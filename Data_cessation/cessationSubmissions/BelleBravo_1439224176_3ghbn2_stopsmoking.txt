Just need a little support and encouragement.

I had one of those weekends were it started of fantastic and because of a slip in my mind and me saying something stupid out loud turned my good time around into a dark cloud.

In anycase I have managed somehow to ride these emotions smoke free even though I fought with my mind about purchasing a pack taking one out and throwing the rest away but have not caved into that thought.

So aside from drinking water and taking walks what else do you all do to help you get past these cravings in emotional times?

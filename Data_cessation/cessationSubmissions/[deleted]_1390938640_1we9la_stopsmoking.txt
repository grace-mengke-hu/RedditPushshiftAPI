My nose

barely works, but my functioning 1/4 of a nostril can smell someone smoking from across the street. The fuck?
I feel like I'm gonna gain 100 pounds. I can't stop eating. I will never make fun of obese people again; I totally understand what they go through! 
I keep throwing sugar and caffeine at myself as a reward, but it's no good.
My mind is racing, and I can't control it.
I'm on day 2. How's everybody else doing?

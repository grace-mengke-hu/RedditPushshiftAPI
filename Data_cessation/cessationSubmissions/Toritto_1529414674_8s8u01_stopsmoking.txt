Day 10 went by way easier. I've got this.

Made a post about how day 5 was incredibly hard. Now I can say day 10 went by easily. Had a few cravings, but they went away quickly.

This time I'll make it. Just hoping I didn't cause any permanent damage by smoking for 21 years. 

For those considering quitting, do it right now. We can do this. Hopefully those poison producing companies will go bankrupt and nobody will ever have to go through this again.

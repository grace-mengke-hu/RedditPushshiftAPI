I've been smoking since I was 15. Today, almost six years later, I say no more.

I went from 4 cigarettes a day in high school to a pack a day in college (started college almost 4 years ago). Once I moved out of the dorms and into my own house, it just got worse. Now I could sit on a comfy couch and light up a smoke!

Well, no more. I'm at much too high a risk for lung disease (several family members killed by it) and I'm too disgusted by the mental double think I engage in to feel like smoking is alright. I don't like lying, and I've been lying to myself for years, pretending that this smoke won't hurt me. 

So, here I am! When I feel an urge, I'm planning on chewing gum/drinking water...and posting here!

Thanks for taking the time to read.

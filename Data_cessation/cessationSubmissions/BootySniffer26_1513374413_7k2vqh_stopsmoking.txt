Weening off smoking with vaping - throat weirdness

Heyo, trying to quit cigs and so far doing fairly nicely. I've cut my cig consumption down almost completely and I plan on vaping exclusively in the coming days. 

So I don't think this is coincidental, I'm feeling good emotionally and breathing better, but I'm having some difficulty swallowing and I'm producing thicker-than-usual saliva. 

Just wondering if any of you experienced the same, and how long I should expect it to last. 

Thanks!

Had my last cigarette yesterday at 5pm

This is it guys. I've been smoking since I was 16, and have stopped once or twice. . .but always started back up again.

My first day is going good, I just keep saying "You don't smoke any more, Cgaunvy." And chewing gum like I did before.

Does anyone have some advice to keep up the streak?

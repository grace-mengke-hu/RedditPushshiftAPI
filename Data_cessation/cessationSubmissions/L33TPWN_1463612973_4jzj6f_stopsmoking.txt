It's been 71 days today, and I'm worried I'm hitting a wall

I quit by using nicotine lozenges and it was so much easier than I ever expected it to be, or than it's ever been before when I half-assed it in the past. People in my life still smoke and were all surprised when I quit, and it didn't really bother me to be around them while they smoked. But for the past couple of weeks, for some reason, I've really started to miss it. 

I could use some encouragement, guys. I'm worried I might slip up because now I know I'm capable of quitting, and know I could go through it again, if that makes any sense. I know it's all mental, but I can't shake it right now.

Thanks for any advice you can give--I'm probably going to go eat my weight in comfort food to distract myself from this feeling!

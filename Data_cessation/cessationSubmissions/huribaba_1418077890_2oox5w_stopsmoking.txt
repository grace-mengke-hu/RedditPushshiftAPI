I quit smoking without any withdraw effects! How?

I was a regular smoker for the past 4 years. One fine day I just quit and never smoked. Its been 2 months like this and I really did not feel any urge to smoke at all. Trust me no urge to get that one last smoke.

Why did I not feel any withdrawal symptoms or an urge.This has got nothing to do with my willpower or motivation because I did not even try , I just simply quit as simple as that.

Or maybe I experienced them and not aware of it?


Day: 74 days and not even a single urge. Have even started some intense breathing exercises!

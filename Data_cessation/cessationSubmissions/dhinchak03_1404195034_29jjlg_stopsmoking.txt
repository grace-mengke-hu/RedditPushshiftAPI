It's getting harder :|

I am in my second week. It's getting much harder now. I'm feeling very tired all the time. Anxiety level has increased. This morning, when coming to work, I had a huge craving - it was very hard not to give in. 

What's keeping me going? Knowledge that I'm not harming my body anymore.

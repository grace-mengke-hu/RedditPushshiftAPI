Today is my three months!

So I'm pretty excited to have made it this far without a cigarette.  It's gone really smoothly this time around and I'm in it for the long haul.  Previous quits I didn't really have my mind in it, I just knew I needed to quit...that didn't work for me.  Now that I've actually planned it out, it's been amazingly simple.  I'm able to be around my friends who smoke and drink with them, etc., without the thought of having one even crossing my mind.  On the rare occasion that the thought does pop into my head, it's gone as quickly as it appeared.  

Here's to three months down, life to go!  Congratulations to everyone else who is on this journey with me.  Keep it up friends!

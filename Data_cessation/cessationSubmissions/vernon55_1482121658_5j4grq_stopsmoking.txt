day five is over!And boy was it a day!

Had to go to the ER for Gastritus (probably butchered the spelling) Doc says, probably from quitting (just so everyone knows) because its an uncommon symptom and most people dont know the umcommon symptoms of quitting, It causes some light stomache bleeding and small faint sharp stomache pains, Lots of discomfort and belching. Anyhow, Day five is over, and even given all the stress, I managed to get through it without even having a craving! its my first day without a craving and it feels great!

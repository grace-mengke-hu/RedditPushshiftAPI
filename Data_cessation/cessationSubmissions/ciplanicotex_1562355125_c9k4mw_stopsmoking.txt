Vaping or use of e-cigarettes appears to be a great option to quit smoking but it is a bad option. The e-cigarettes don't use actual tobacco but they contain liquid nicotine and other flavoring agents which are more dangerous for health. Vaping also increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and other heart related diseases. So it is also not an reliable way to quit smoking.

Herbal cigarettes also called as tobacco or nicotine cigarettes are being used as a replacement to regular cigarettes. These cigarettes are made up of herbs or plant materials that are rolled up in a standard paper with a cigarette filter.

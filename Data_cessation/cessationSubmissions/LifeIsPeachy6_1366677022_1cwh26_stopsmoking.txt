4 days smoke free.. but i don't think it will last,

So I decided I had to quit for several reasons. For                1# I`m not suppose to smoke in my apt but I do.
 2# I lost my job and @ 8+$ pack I just can't afford it .. 
  3# I really don't like being addicted to Cig 

Now I have made it thru 3-6 days smoke free a few times in the past 2 months  But every time I get some money I end up going out and buying a pack.. 

And Tomorrow will be one of does days..

Kind of freaging out about second hand smoking

Guys, I've just had a quick ride home with a person that offered to take me, since my car broke down and he was smoking. The issue is that I am 5 weeks clean from both nicotine and alcohol and used to be quite a smoker. 
I am not sure what I mean to get from this post, but after the ride and all that smoke around I feel as if I "smoked a little", as if this somehow negates my streak of not smoking and it is bothering me. 
Now, I remember reading somewhere that it is possible to absorb nicotine from second hand smoking. Should I be concerned? Did it "get inside me" and do some damage? I don't wanna go through all the horrible withdrawal again. 
Anyways, this is it. Thanks for the attention. I am relatively aware that this is probably some mild hypocondria, but... 
(I am sorry about any spelling or other mistakes. I am brazilian.)

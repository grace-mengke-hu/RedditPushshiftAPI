Smoking, anxiety and me

I've smoked for 20 odd years

I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. 

3 weeks ago at the advice of my doctor I started taking anti anxiety medication. 

1 week ago I realised the number of cigarettes I smoked had halved. 

Tomorrow I'm aiming for no cigarettes at all.

 No anxiety about quitting, no unrealistic expectations, no expectations from friends or family (I haven't told them)

Just me beating my demons...

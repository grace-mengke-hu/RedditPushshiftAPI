Ugh relapse and anxiety

Uuuugh so I only quit 6 days ago and I’ve had a relapse. I’ve been feeling anxious ALL DAY and I succumbed to the pressure. I had anxiety before ever smoking too, so how do I deal with it? 
I felt so so much better these past few days without cigarettes though and I’m trying very hard to hold onto that. 
Relapse is very disheartening though. I’m going to quit quit QUIT tomorrow. I’m on summer break from college and I asked my mom if she would help me throw away all of my smoking stuff. 
One of the hardest parts is just keeping my damn mind occupied! Grrrrr just when my A.D.D. Would be helpful I can’t STOP focusing on something :/.

Im waiting for it to get hard

I finished my pack of smokes on the 1st and decided not to buy another packet.

Its day 4 and I havent really thought about smoking, I thought it would be harder.

I keep getting the feeling of forgetting something and realise that its just smoking and Im not doing that anymore.

Then last night i had a dream i was smoking and though OH fuck i've failed already then woke up thinking that i was still smoking.

My mother fucking brain was trying to trick me into smoking!

Anyway aside from this Im waiting for it to really hit me, I havent been around any of my mates that smoke and I've decided that drinking probably isnt a good idea for a while.  Its early days but I know its going to start to suck soon and I need some tips on how to stay strong.

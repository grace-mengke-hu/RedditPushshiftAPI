Making the leap...tonight...badge request please

Hi - so I'm ready to do this.  Almost 3 hours ago (5pm) I had my last smoke.  I'm now quitting.

My last smoke after doing the last stressful thing relating to getting our house ready to sell (filling out disclosure statements - ugh).

My husband pleaded for me not to smoke because I already have a cold.  But I was so anticipating that post-paperwork smoke.

While smoking, I thought, well, why not quit now.  I've been wanting to.  But...I can't quit for him.  As he struggles with alcoholism, I've learned a few things about addiction and recovery.  I know I can't quit for him because the second he drinks again, I'll think "fuck you" and smoke because it's my coping mechanism.  More important, I have to quit because I'm choosing to do it for myself.

And so that's what I'm doing.  I'm choosing to quit, and I'm doing it for myself.  I've let my smoking escalate into about 1/2 a pack a day...and after years of occasional smoking, let it escalate into an actual addiction.  I've used it far too long as a coping mechanism for dealing with the husband's alcoholism.  But I'm going to stop that now.

And quitting after I've done the last thing I needed for selling our house..not a bad way to quit.  It's a pretty big moment, really.  Also a motivator to keep that as a last day.  Waiting for it to sell is gonna be a bitch...and getting through the the next alcohol binge...no idea how I'm gonna do it.

But that's why I'm here.  So please, set me up with a badge (EDIT: oh - I can set it up myself :) ) and any advice or guidance you can offer. 

Thanks for listening, and thanks for being here.

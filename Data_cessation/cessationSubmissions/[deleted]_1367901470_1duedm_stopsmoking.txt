2nd time quitting, first time without pharmaceutical help

I quit previously using a combination of Bupropion, the Patch and Nicotrol.  This time, I'm just using Blu.  I really need to quit because I was up to almost 2 packs a day, and I have asthma and seasonal allergies, so smoking has been really hurting me a lot.  Any advice, suggestions, or just good will would be appreciated.  My former brand is Parliament Ultra Light.

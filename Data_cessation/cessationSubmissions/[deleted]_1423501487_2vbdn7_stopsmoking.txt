How to quit smoking when you don't even really want to... especially when it's made worse by having BPD? Please help.

Any tips for quitting smoking when you don't want to?

I'm almost 25 and I've been smoking since I was 15. I know it's killing me, and it's ruining my life. But I don't want to quit.

I have BPD and so I experience **SEVERE** boredom. Smoking gave me something to do. I would drive around, listen to music, and smoke. The boredom you experience as a person with BPD is like no other. It's almost like when I have nothing to do or occupy my mind/time that I'll come out of my skin. It's the most unnerving, pervasive feeling. 

How do I get past this?

I don't know what to do, and I'm at the end of my rope with this. 

Please help.

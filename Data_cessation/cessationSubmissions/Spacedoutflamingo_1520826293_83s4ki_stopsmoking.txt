Hey guys, I quit smoking. Got some questions.

So I can't actually remember the day I quit, some time last week.

I took up vaping which was 8% nicotine for 2 days I think? I then immediately got a nicotine free liquid which honestely didn't make a difference, it kept my mouth busy, I've now barely used my vape. 

The cravings are still there but I actually quit smoking. Can't believe it. 

I started smoking when I was 21, It started with weed and listening to music while high was amazing. Without a dealer, I turned to smoking for the nicotine rush to enhance the music. Ended up addicted. 3 years of an addiction.

I didn't have a pattern of when I smoked, I smoked when I wanted to and it felt good. I decided to change my ways when a pack of cigarettes was empty within 2-3 days. 

I'd definitely still smoke weed though.

How damaging is a nicotine free vape? From lungs, skin all the way down to semen quality?

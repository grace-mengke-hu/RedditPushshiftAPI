Big surprise today after 86 day's I've quit.

Hello everyone! This sub really helped me alot in the beginning, and I am very grateful. However, after 2-3 weeks I already felt like I dis not think about smoking, so I came less and less often, because this aub would be the only thing reminding me of cigarettes, ironically.

But, this is a good sign. At 1 pack a day for over 4 years, this means that you can also get to the position I am in!

Anyway, today I was driving for 3 hours amd I was singing to some of the songs on the radio, and then "take on me" by a-ha came on. I love this song, I love to sing it, but I have a deeper voice and I could never sing the very high pitch notes. I thought this was because of my puberty and that my vocal cords were just not able to go that high pitched.

Well, guess what? That was not the case. I had been smoking since I was 12. My vocal cords were just damaged by the smoke. When the famous "in a day or TWOOOOO" came, I just sang it like usual thinking I would hear the usual horrible unstable and gritty sound I had always heard. But it dis not happen, instead I sang a very clear, high pitched note, almost to the level of the singner. I was so surprised, I tried it again and the same result happened! I could not stop smiling for the rest of the song and even after.

So, to finish this long post : don't give up, you will make it. Also, you will get improvements you did not even think about! :)

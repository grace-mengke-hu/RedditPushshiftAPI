First day.

Been smoking for over 20 years now.  Went up to 2 packs a day for about 2 years.  Came down to 4-5 per day.  Tried stopping before but never quite made it past few days.

This time around my mindset is different.  I am done with substitution, and will power and everything else.  I done counting days.  This time around mindset is, "start something only if you are going to do it for the rest of your life."  I am applying this to being smoke free forever, and exercise.

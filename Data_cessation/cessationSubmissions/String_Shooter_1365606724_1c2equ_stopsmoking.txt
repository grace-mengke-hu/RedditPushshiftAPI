Just quit yesterday!

I have smoked on and off for 7 years, ever since I was 18. In my off times, I've been jogging and saying I was gonna enter a 5K, which has never happened. Now I'm ready to get for the last time and actually run that 5K! I quit smoking yesterday and starting training for my June 1st first 5K!!

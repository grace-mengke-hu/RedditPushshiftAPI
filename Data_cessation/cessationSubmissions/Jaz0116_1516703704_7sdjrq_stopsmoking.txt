Withdrawal Symptoms

I have been a smoker for almost a decade, I'm on day 10 of quitting. Though I did slip up and have one on day 4. But tonight seems to be there hardest thus far. I'm crying for no reason at all, my back aches like crazy, I have chills and am struggling to stay asleep. Any tips to over come these symptoms? The good news is that the cravings are starting to ease up. But these damn withdrawal symptoms are the worst.

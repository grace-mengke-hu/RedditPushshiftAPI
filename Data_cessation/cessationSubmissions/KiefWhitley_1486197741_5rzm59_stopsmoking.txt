22 Days - What Lies Ahead?

I have been doing some searching but I thought maybe I'd just straight up ask - can you guys throw me some links/information as to what I might expect to experience moving forward from here? Lots of great information on "the first week" or "the first two weeks" but I really would like to know more about the stuff you guys experience BEYOND the initial suck.

As far as my own experience? Day four was BY FAR the worst. Honestly, it may have been the worst day of my life, ever. I don't want to start again specifically because I don't ever want to have to go through that again.

I still experience cravings sometimes. Catch myself doing the whole "mental masturbation" thing, thinking about cigarettes or just grabbing that pack off the coworker's desk and firing one up....I think the main reason I haven't acted on these impulses is because I try to almost "annoy" people I meet with letting them know I just quit smoking, so they would be less inclined to "enable" any relapse on my part.

It just kinda scares me- the thinking about it even after over three weeks. I'm a gigging musician and tomorrow night I have to play a smoking bar (yes, we still have those here in the midwest).

I played this same bar on day 8 and did fine - even had a couple of beers. But for some reason some of the weird thoughts and cravings I have had the past few days has me worried about going in there tomorrow. I'm sure the secondhand smoke probably "helps" ie pacifies my craving from getting "too bad", but I just really want to make sure I have "not another puff", as they say.

Hell, maybe what I really need is just encouragement, idk. YOUR story.. how did you deal with the long game - the POST "withdrawal" phase?

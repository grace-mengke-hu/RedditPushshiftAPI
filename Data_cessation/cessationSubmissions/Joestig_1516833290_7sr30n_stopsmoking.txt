I relapsed for a few days after not smoking for 60 days. If I quit now, I will have not smoked for 40 days for my next triathlon!

I want to do many triathlons this year, and the first one is already early March, a winter triathlon (with ice skating). Not only do I want to participate, I want to try to WIN!

This is actually possible for me. My genes allow me to build muscle easily and I have a great lung capacity. I have been training for a few months now and I train hard, like 8-10 times per week. Picking up smoking is the stupidest thing I can do. I don't know why I did it. I smoked about 30-35 cigarettes in 5 days. I don't think that caused enough damage to reverse the lung regeneration that happened during the past 2 months, but it definitely set me back a few weeks.

And I am sure that if I quit now, and if I keep training, than 40 days will be enough to do great at the triathlon. I think I will need some time to fully regenerate that is possible (which I believe is almost completely - the regenerative capacity of the body is amazing).

Anyways, long story short: I failed for a few days and now I will stop failing, continue training and win a triathlon.

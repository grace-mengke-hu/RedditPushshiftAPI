Today feels so much better. Thank G-d. Thank you for all the support and helping me get through those couple of super tough days. I know there are hard days like that ahead, but for today I will enjoy the relief that I did not cave and will face the next hurdle as it comes. You guys are the best! If I could I'd give you each a big wet, sloppy kiss or a hug or a ^5!

Thank YOU!

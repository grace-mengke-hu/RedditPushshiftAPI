5 month check in

I have made it to my 5 month mark. This last month has not been easy. But I made it. I am super happy to be so close to half a year goal. And my stop smoking app let me know I have not smoked over 1000 smokes and saved over 600 dollars. Just makes me so happy to know that. I feel great. I just have other health issues that have me stress and honestly if I smoked everything would just be worse. I just have to stay positive. I am stronger than the cigarette. I got this. Now to hit 6 months and than I will be off to my 1 year goal!

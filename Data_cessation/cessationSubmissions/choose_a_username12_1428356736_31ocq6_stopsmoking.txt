Day 11 of cold turkey...does it get better?

I smoked half a pack a day for about 6 years or so. The first three days of quitting were bad for cravings, but overall pretty manageable. However, for a few days after that, I was extremely depressed/agitated and couldn't focus on anything. That calmed down a little, but I am still getting strong cravings where I end up pacing around the house, binge eating, whatever. If I'm given any job that requires concentration, I can't do it.

I understand quitting takes time, however I thought the whole point of cold turkey was the "make or break" 3 day point. If it's going to take weeks, then why not use a patch? Just to save money? I don't get it. 

I'm mentally at a point where I don't WANT to smoke and cigarettes seem kind of gross. But I'm getting tired of this anxious/restless feeling... maybe it's coffee? I seem to get it the worst after coffee (I drink about 4 cups a day), but I can't quit drinking coffee and smoking at the same time. I'd probably explode.

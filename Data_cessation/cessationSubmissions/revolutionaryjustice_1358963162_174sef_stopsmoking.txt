Still smoking: I would appreciate some help/advice for quitting after a foot-dragging NYE quit that was never really attempted!

Okay, so one NYE (2010-11?) I declare to my friends and my younger brother that I would quit smoking "by the end of the year". I said it in front of my younger brother because I figured that would pressure me, by virtue of my role-modeling, to actually be a role model. It did not.

So flash to this New Year's Eve: I had decided, with a friend (and primary smoking companion at the time) that we would both quit over winter break (we're in college/university). We figured there's always stressors and "reasons" to smoke while at school, so we quit while we're away and come back nicotine free & with dedication.

Anyway, many at the party were also "about to quit" so we were all very busy finishing our pack(s), since you don't have to quit til you finish the pack, duh! ... So as you can see, I did not quit, as I had some 3 packs on me that night, and someone actually gave me theirs as they left... 

So break ends, still smoking, and I return to school, still smoking...

I have been making some progress towards cutting down the amnt I smoke, in a system I call "PROGRESSIVE ARBITRARY DENIAL" or PAD. PAD is fun because it means I haven't quit yet, but also because it helps me train my brain: 

Say I have 15 "cravings" in a day, I might smoke my first cigarette, second, third, however many, but at some point, I note the desire, and say "denied" in my head. The arbitrary part is that it can be any cigarette, and can't count cigarettes not smoked due to weather or misplaced lighter. 

The denial must be *intentional* & arbitrary. The P in PAD is for progressive, because as time passes, I deny 2 out of every 15 "cravings" and then 3/15, etc. 

So that's what I've been doing. It's effective primarily because it keeps quitting on my mind in an active way... But I want the quitting part to happen in my hands, lungs, and throat "with great prejudice."

So here's where I'm asking for help and advice (though if you see something in the above text that compels you to advise me, please do so):

* I live in a smoking building, which I have taken full advantage of for the last two years. What can I do about the fact that my apartment is a trigger?

* The less I smoke, the more gum I chew. This just kind of happened on its own, but are there any more interesting rituals I can replace smoking with?

* All my buddies smoke, but I'm actually pretty good when it comes to resisting social invitations to smoke (like I said above, the apartment is the epicenter of my smoking), but I'm at a loss for an appropriate social alternative... like, should I join them outside? and if so, [what do I do with my hands?](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Not-Sure-What-to-do-With-Hands-Talladega-Nights-Ricky-Bobby.gif)

* Nicotine is FAR from being the only psychoactive substance that I put in my body w/ regularity, though it is the only one I consider a problem/challenging to my willpower... So maybe this is a niche, but can anyone share some insight on quitting cigarettes while not quitting other substances (psychedelics, stimulants, and opiates, but also others that don't compel me to smoke)*?

*these are listed in order of "how much I tend to smoke while on them" and not by frequency of use. 

ps: i put "craving" in quotes just because I personally don't perceive of my smoking as responsive to cravings. Rarely do I think to myself "oh my god I want a cigarette." Instead I'll think something like: "oh man, so-and-so class was brutal today, I have earned a cigarette!" or I'll smoke in the course of waiting for something/someone. 

But whenever smoking isn't an option, like if I'm at my family home, on vacation with family, or sick (I'm sure there are other scenarios as well), I literally do not think about it/notice ANY physical or psychological changes. I rarely stay in my family house anymore, but when we went on vacations they would be 2-3 weeks long, during which I never once noticed myself craving a cigarette. 

* I have had only one genuine craving in my life, and it was because I was "voluntarily" doing inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse for like 5 days, and when I got out I wanted a cigarette SO badly that I actually made my girlfriend get up at 7:30AM so that I could WATCH her smoke a cigarette before my mom got back from taking the kids to school. I myself did not smoke after I got out of the program for like 2 months, and then I got a job at a pharmacy and sure enough I bought a pack on my first day.

Yikes. I feel like I'm spamming reddit with a post this long... If you read the whole thing, thank you for your time and care! If not, thanks just the same.

**TL;DR: read the bulleted list & give me advice for quitting for good**

Good luck, Quitters, I hope to call myself the same very soon!

waves of sadness??

Just wondering when the big, emotional waves of sadness stop.

Nothing to be sad about here - in a very good place and aware that it's a known nicotine side effect - but coping mechanisms/tips and a timeframe would help greatly. 

Sat around drinking wine with housemates last night with three of them chainsmoking rollies and didn't cave! So feeling optimistic. 

Day 4 of quit, Smoked for 10 years with the last two being in phases (smoking every weekend but not during the week with bouts of full blown smoking).

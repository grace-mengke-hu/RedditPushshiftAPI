5 days free but side effects are rough

I've now done 5 days smoke free, using a vapour a couple of times a day.
Side effects are exhausting though, I feel happy to give up smoking and I'm mentally strong and ready.  However, I'm finding it really hard coping with the side effects. It's taking me 2 hours to get to sleep then I'm wide awake 4 hours later.  Anyone else struggling with side effects from quitting?

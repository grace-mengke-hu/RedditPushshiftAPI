Dreaming of smoking

I've heard it happens to people who quit sometimes.
I quit cold turkey 13 days ago (guess it's about the unlucky number :D). I've been dealing with cravings and withdrawal normal/easy.
But in that dream last night I had no choice or control at all. I just grabbed a cigg, went to the window, lighted up, started smoking.. and like 3-4 puffs later I remember "omg what am I doing?! I'm not a smoker anymore, why did I do that?". Then the cigarette started burning on both ends and I could't hold it anymore.
I woke up and was so glad that it was only a dream, and that we have so much more control in our real life.
I know this thread might not help anyone with anything, but I felt like sharing. :)

Just started to smoke casually. Should I be worried?

I am 30 years old and have never smoked before until 5 months ago. Before that I have smoked Hookah like 3-4 times. I had been in a lot of stress lately and some friends always offered me cigarettes and I used to reject. After watching Mad-men I was so tempted to smoke to get some stress relief, so now when I see my friends I take up on their offer to smoke a few cigarettes. I would say for the past 3 months I have not smoked  more than 30 cigarettes total. I never even bought my own pack, I would take one or two from friends who offer. I wonder if I continue like this would I get addicted? should I stop now or a few cigarettes in a week won't really get me addicted? I don't know how it starts?

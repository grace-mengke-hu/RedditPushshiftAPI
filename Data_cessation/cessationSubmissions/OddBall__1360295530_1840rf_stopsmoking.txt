How long should it take til my sense of taste returns? 

Ok, so, Ive been smoking for about a year now. Its been a rough three days without a cigarette and I'm looking forward to regaining my sense of taste (Along with my stamina and general heath.) Im Just wondering but how long should it take for it to return?

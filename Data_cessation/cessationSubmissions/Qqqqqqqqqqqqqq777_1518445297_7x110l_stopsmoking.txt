Quit for 1 year..

Than went on vacation to Hawaii for 2 weeks and decided that I would smoke only on vacation and quit when I get back. Worked like a charm and stayed quit for another 6 months. Tried this again on my next vacation and have been smoking ever since( close to a year now). Today is day 2 of my present quit. I will not make that mistake again. You can never smoke once quit. Doesn't work. GOD bless

Need a little advice.

I am in week 2 of a countless number of quit attempts. This one has been different. I weaned myself off smoking 20 + a day down to about 4 a day. 2 in the morning, using a step 2 patch during the day and smoking 2 at night. I eventually got to just 2 in the morning, used the patch all day and took it off before bed, and started again the next day. Now, at this point, I was pretty agitated with myself for smoking in the morning and basically undoing all of the good I had been able to do the previous day. So, on the 18th of December, I smoked my last 2, and that was it. I put the patch on after my shower, and have gone from there with little to no problems as far as craving goes. Don't get me wrong, I have had my share of sore throat, stuffed up nose, teeth achy as circulation improved, etc. 
However, I don't know if it is just that I am feeling better, or more confident or what, but I am getting to the point of being annoyed at myself for still using the patch. I would like to be completely rid of the nicotine addiction, but at the same time, I am hesitant to let it go. I hate that I can't trust myself to not fall back to smoking, and I guess that nagging feeling is something I should pay attention to? That I am not ready to be completely off of it, and I should be happy with the progress I have made at not smoking? I don't know. I haven't read the book you guys talk about, but I listened to Jason Vale's stop smoking in 2 hours app on my phone, and that was more than enlightening. It seems that it is similar to what Alan Carr's program is like. 
Anyway, maybe I just needed to write it down and get it out of my head. Any thoughts on stopping the patch before reaching step 3 following the "recommended" step down process on the box? Thanks in advance.

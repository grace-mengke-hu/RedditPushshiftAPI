Gone around sixty days without a cigarette, and my will-power is wearing thin. Any suggestions?

It's been around two months since my last cigarette, and I've used an electronic cigarette (ego-cig) since I quit, and it's served me well when cravings have come on hard, but lately it's just not doing it for me. To put it somewhat crudely it almost feels my lungs are having a lot of foreplay but never any sex. 

Any suggestions? I've thought about switching to nicorette, but I've always been more of a smoker than a dipper, so I'm not sure if my body would respond to that positively.

Officially made it to one week - breaking benefits down into steps

Today is 7 days since I stopped smoking and drinking. Its been very tough at points and my cravings are driving me insane at times but I am determined to push forwards this time for myself, my friends and my family.

One of the methods that I have found useful this time around is to break it down into smaller steps as opposed to an instant permanent thing.   
This link is very useful, it is the NHS page for stopping smoking that lists the benefits of not smoking over time:  
[https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/why-quit/what-happens-when-you-quit](https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/why-quit/what-happens-when-you-quit)  


Lastly, I have found it very useful to make lists of my motivations.  
1)I will be fitter and healthier  
2)I don't want to die young  
3)I will save so much money  
4)I will no longer smell of smoke  
5)I won't miss out on moments with friends by being that person who has to step outside to smoke all the time  
6)I have let people down by returning to smoking in the past. I don't want to let people down anymore.  
7)I refuse to believe that a small rolled up piece of tobacco leaves is stronger than me and has control over me.  


I realise that I have lasted longer than this before caving in the past, but I am determined to stop forever this time and I have found this group really helpful. I hope I can help anyone else to stop as well.

Reminder To Self:

"Wait, I don't do that any more."

Six weeks in. I can't even say how many times I've reminded myself on a daily basis that lighting up is no longer part of my coping plan. 

First staff meeting at my new job the other night, we were given a "break" halfway through. At my former job, I'd've been outside sucking down nicotine fast as i could in 10 minutes. This time? I spent the time mingling and chatting with my new co-workers. None of them ran out for a smoke. 

What worked for me this time was deep breathing techniques (and oh, i do so enjoy being able to take a deep breath!), and the desire to meet my new co-workers in a social context.

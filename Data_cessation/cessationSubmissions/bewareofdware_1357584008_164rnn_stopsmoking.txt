Day 1. Struggling.

So today is Day 1 for me. I've been planning on quitting for a while now, and set today as the target date to stop. I usually smoke 10-15 cigarettes per day. The most difficult thing to give up is my morning cigarette. I usually get up around 7 for work and then have a cigarette with my coffee once I get to my office around 8:45. 
It has now been 2 hours since then, and my body is not handling this well. My arms are all itchy and I can't see straight. I can't focus on anything at work. 
Have I made a mistake in doing this cold turkey without any medication ?

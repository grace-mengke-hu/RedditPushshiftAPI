$1200- How much I've saved since I quit.

I've spent it on other things and I didn't collect it in a piggy bank, but that number is amazing to me. The health benefits are much better than the 1200$. I can smell and taste, I don't snore anymore, and my beard smells much better:) Keep with it and fight those urges, friends!

Cigarettes, you my only friend.

Sometimes I feel that way.  They've brought me a lot of pleasure over the years and some great times with friends.  I've quit before, and I'm quitting again.  But I know I'm much less social and much more reclusive when I don't smoke.  Anyone know of any good social crutches that work as well and don't kill you?

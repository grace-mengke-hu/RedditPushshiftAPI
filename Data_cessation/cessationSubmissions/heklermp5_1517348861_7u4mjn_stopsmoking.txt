12 days and 21 hours smoke free.

I am 20. Been heavy smoker since 16. Smoked 1-2 packs mostly. I could eat cigarettes, thats how much I loved them. Nothing better than a cigarette combined with a cup of coffee, with friends. Economy wasnt the problem since a pack of Marlboro here is 2.5 EUR.

What made me quit is false alarm that blood that was coming out of my mouth one morning indicated serious lung disease. It wasnt from lungs. Thank God. The only thing I remember very well at that point is me thinking “I am so fking stupid, this could mean cancer and Im gonna die young because of useless smoke!!”  

Tbh dont have balls to light anymore so absolutely no cravings because I was scared to death and still have panic attack when I remember the moment I spat blood.


The ONE and ONLY thing I miss is when I find a good song, go on a balcony in my apartment, put headphones in and light a cig. Even coffee isnt attracting the cigs anymore. 


Hope yall quit before its too late.
Peace

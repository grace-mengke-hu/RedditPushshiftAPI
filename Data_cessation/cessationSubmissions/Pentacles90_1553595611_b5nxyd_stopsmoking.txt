I read Allen Carr's book. The dude was a genius, R.I.P.

Not only did he manage to quit a hundred cigs a day, he also saw smoking for what is was: Not something that GIVES pleasure but something that literally hi-jacks your reward circuitry, TAKES away your pleasure and brings the baseline temporarily back to normal whenever you smoke one, only to find your baseline dropping again after.

There is an awful truth to the statement that the reason people fail to quit is because they are afraid. The fear that a part of them will be gone forever. A part that can only be fixed with a cigarette. But thats not true! You were complete when you were born! You can be complete again. You just have to believe. Believe that you're not a victim and that you've lost nothing! Its all a f...king illusion. 

Btw, I've picked up meditation recently. Taking about 10 minutes each day to be conscious of my emotional state and to just sit back and observe the thoughts racing through my mind. I can really recommend it! It will help sort out all thoughts and cravings you might have about smoking and put them in perspective. Also it will lower stress and anxiety. Try Headspace --&gt; really cool. 

Stay clean y'all!

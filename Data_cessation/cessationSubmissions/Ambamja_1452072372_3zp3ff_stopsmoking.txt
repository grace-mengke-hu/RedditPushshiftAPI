I too made it a year smoke-free! Keep it up people, this feels amazing!

I quit a year ago without planning it in advance. Never thought I'd ever make it to this day! Thanks /r/stopsmoking for all the inspiration! And to all people who quit in the new year or are thinking about quitting: you can do it and don't get yourself down if you are having problems, it happens to the best of us! Stay awesome people.

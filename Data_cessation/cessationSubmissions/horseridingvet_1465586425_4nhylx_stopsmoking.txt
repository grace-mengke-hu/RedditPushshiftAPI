In the process of quitting, need motivation

I'm using an app on Android called SmokeFree. It's basically tracking my wheening  off of smoke. I was smoking a pack a day and now I'm at 14, 13 tomorrow. I can already tell the cravings are getting more intense. My biggest motivation to quit is to save money and be healthy. I've smoked for the last 15 years, about a pack a day, at one point 2 per day. I tried quitting and did good for about a month before life happened and I got drawn back in.  Thanks in advance for any support.

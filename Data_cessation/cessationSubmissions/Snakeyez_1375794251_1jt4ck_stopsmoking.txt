4 Days, :) Want motivational audio for the car

I've gone four days and think I can already start to feel an improvement. This is more of a recovery from a relapse than a quit, prior to this time I went almost a month. As many have experienced I think, for some, the crucial part is not the initial quit but ensuring that we never start again, and avoiding the temptation day to day when our guard drops. I have been listening to an Allen Carr on CD in the car, and wondering if anyone else has suggestions for similar motivational audio recordings, preferably related to smoking. Thanks

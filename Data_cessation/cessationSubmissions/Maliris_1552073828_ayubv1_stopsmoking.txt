7 days smoke free and I'm struggling

Disregard my flair. I relapsed about an year ago.

So I'm on 7th day of my quit (still using ecig though) and I have been really struggling with depression and anhedonia. I have no motivation to do anything and nothing really brings me pleasure. I can't cum when having sex and I'm just bored with everything. I have also been extremely tired. I wonder when is this going to pass. I read that tobacco has maoi's which have antidepressant effects so this is probably because I'm withdrawing from that? I've been vaping non-stop since my quit but it doesn't seem to do it the same way actual tobacco does and I've still experienced lots of cravings (much less than going cold turkey though).

I plan on dropping the nicotine too, but I'm hoping to stabilize with my mood before that. Any advice on dealing with this anhedonia?

Should I be avoiding people who smoke?

I used to have a pack a day habit and now I haven't bought a pack of cigarettes in over a couple months. But lots of my friends smoke and my brother who I live with smokes and I find myself bumming cigs when im out drinking or around people who are smoking. This has amounted to me smoking almost one cigarette a day. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to handle this?  I don't want to tell my friends not to smoke around me because this is my problem not theirs and I dont want to tell my brother he cant leave his ash trays lying around even though the thought and temptation these things posses is what keeps getting to me. 

I know one cigarette a day is a lot better then where I was, but every time I smoke a cigarette I regret it and feel like shit later, but I keep doing it for some reason.

TLDR: Im starting to think I just need to avoid my smoker friends for at least a few weeks until the nicotine is totally out of my system. What does reddit think?

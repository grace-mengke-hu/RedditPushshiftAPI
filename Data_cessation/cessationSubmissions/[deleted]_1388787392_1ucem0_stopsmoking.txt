That was pretty easy! And here's my mindset

So I did the cliche new years resolution. Quit smoking. I am still using an e cig, but my main focus is to get off tobacco, and down the road I can put down my e cig.

I am currently on my 3rd day, and I have had 0 thoughts of smoking this entire time. Idk what clicked in my brain, but I think this all boils down to self control, which is something I have just recently learned. The only way to stop smoking, is to literally, not have a cigarette. If you give in to your cravings, you aren't quitting. It's as simple as that to me.

I am making a personal decision to quit. I am almost 21, and I have been smoking for over 5 years. The health effects have kicked in. I developed acne at 19, gained weight, lost endurance, the usual. I have tried to quit probably like 10 times, and during the first week or two, I saw improvement in my health, but I always relapsed. Now, I want to do it for myself, because future me doesn't want to smoke.

We'll see how this goes, hopefully it sticks. My advice? Get an e-cig with very low or no nicotine, and that will help with getting the nicotine out of your system.

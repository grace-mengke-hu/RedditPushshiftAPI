Day 4. Any opinions on the patch?

Hi! I've just found this amazing sub. I've been smoke free for 4 days. I'm on the patch so, technically, I haven't really left nicotine addiction behind. To be honest I have't  hardly felt any withdrawal symptoms. I was smoking a pack and a half a day for 10 years :S. This is my first real attempt at quitting and I didn't know much about the patch I just went and bought a pack of patches. I found out later that some people are sort of "against" the use of the patch, since this nicotine replacement option delivers a constant dose of nicotine into your system, however as we smoke cigarettes  the level of nicotine in our system rises and falls naturally... So, Could you help me with an opinion here? I took it off last night at 10 p.m...I usually put a new one on by 7 a.m... but I haven't put on a new one today  it's 8:15 and I am over the morning craving... should I try to go without a patch or should I follow the instruction booklet and continue to be a nicotine slave for the next 10 weeks? I was thinking that I could try and go a day without the patch, I worst come to worst, I could just put on the patch and count my losses. Oh, by the way, I can't get my hands on gum or any other nicotine replacements. It was hard to get the patches as it is. and the e-Cig thing is out of the question....

Please help my expert quitters :)

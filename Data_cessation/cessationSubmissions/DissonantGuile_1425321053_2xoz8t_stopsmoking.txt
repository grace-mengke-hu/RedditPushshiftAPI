Lungs hurt after quitting and moving to vaping?

So, I quit smoking on Valentine's Day by switching over to vaping. Started with 18mg nicotine juice and am down to 6mg, going down to 3mg with this next order.

Anyways, since I've quit, I feel better in all aspects except one. My lungs hurt! They feel sore and every now and then, I get a stitch right under my heart or the bottom of my left lung. Is this common? Or a side effect from vaping?

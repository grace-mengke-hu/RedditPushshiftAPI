Hello! Second week ?

Dear All...
               Few months back, I quit cold turkey for two months and then started again. This is second week of my second attempt (again cold turkey).....Unlike first attempt which was not that hard, this time I'm having extreme difficult second week...anger, rage and chest feel like all wounded and cravings touching the sky....(1 week was not that bad)...Though I'm still enjoying the cold turkey, just wondering how the hell second week can be so difficult...it should be first three days or a week...anyone with second week experience? How long will it go?
Thanks

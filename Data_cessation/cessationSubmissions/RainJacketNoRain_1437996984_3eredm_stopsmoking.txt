Discovered my mom has been secretly smoking. Should I confront her?

I've suspected it for a while but recently confirmed that my mom has taken up smoking again. I'm 22 and she hasn't smoked since before she had kids (22+ years). She's a saint, doesn't drink, is in good shape, etc. but I'm worried about the smoking affecting her health. 

I don't know whether or not to confront her about it. She recently started a new job and also has had to take out loans for my brother and I's schooling so I really sympathize with her stress. What would you guys do? Thanks in advance.

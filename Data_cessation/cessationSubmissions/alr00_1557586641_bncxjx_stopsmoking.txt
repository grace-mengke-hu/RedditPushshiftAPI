Day 10

I smoked for 25 years, 1/2 - 3/4 packs a day.  My mom was recently diagnosed with COPD from smoking and watching her struggle to breathe after 20 steps was enough for me.  I don’t want my kids to see me struggle.  I set my quit date for May 1, and stuck to it.  This is by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  I used NRT patches for the first 5 days and now am done with those.  I don’t feel that I need them anymore.  Most of the cravings come from the habit I think, more so than the addiction.  I feel much better, have improved energy...  I do pretty well through the day and then when evening/nighttime comes - OMG it’s like I woke the monster.  Irritable, bitchy, irrational and just nasty.  I don’t want to be a jerk to my family anymore!  Anyone have any insight as to how long this is going to persist?  I can barely stand to be around myself...

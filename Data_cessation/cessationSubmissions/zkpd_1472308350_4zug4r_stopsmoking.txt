Day 1; Thought it'd be a good idea to get involved

For the past 3 weeks or so, I've been trying to quit with attempts lasting less than 24 hours. I've never had a reason to quit other than the well known fact that it's not a good idea to smoke. Allen Carr helped me reach 3 months at the beginning of the year (I was busy with my internship and didn't have time to think about smoking, these days I'm just at home studying), but I let temptation get the better of me after seeing a pack of my relatives' cigarettes laying around during a family dinner (they were making a big deal out of not smoking near me that night too, oh well). 

These past 3 weeks were not with waste though, at least I hope so, because I've noticed how I let the addiction take over my actions. I've got a huge exam coming up in 3 months and I'd like the health benefits to give me a boost in both the studying and the exam in the coming months, so I'd really like to have my body start recovering asap. 

I'm generally a laid back guy, so there's no fire or emotions of inspiration that I can ride for the first few days. When I relapse, it's when I decide after waking up and think "Ehhh, I'll smoke today". This time I want to try being a little more active and involved, at least for the first 3 days, hence the post. This way I can wake up tomorrow to my stopsmoking comrades instead of a walk to the convenience store : ).

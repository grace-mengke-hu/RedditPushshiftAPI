What is your biggest tip in quitting smoking?

I'm 28, have been smoking a pack a day for 10 years.  I quit for 2 years after doing a laser treatment for smoking cessation.  It worked fine and then one night at a bachelor party I smoked a cigar and within a week I was smoking cigarettes.

I want to quit, and then somewhere in the back of my mind, I'm telling my self it's no big deal.  My dad had to have quadruple bypass surgery 8 years ago and my grandmother died of emphysema when she was 55.  

I don't want to look like my grandmother did when she was 55, she suffered and so did my father.

MY QUESTION TO YOU REDDIT:  What is the best advice/tips you can give me to successfully do this and live a healthy life?

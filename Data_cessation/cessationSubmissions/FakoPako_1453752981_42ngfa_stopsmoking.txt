Cravings

Seems like they are pretty much gone for me. I can't think of a recent strong craving that I had. I am still removed from my smoking friends and going over their homes for drinks. It's still too risky for me I think. But I am very very happy that I don't have crazy cravings. Just more of the "I would smoke right now before" thinking. Driving doesn't bother me, eating a good meal doesn't bother me...I had a RedBull this morning, that didn't bother me.  Hopefully this is it!

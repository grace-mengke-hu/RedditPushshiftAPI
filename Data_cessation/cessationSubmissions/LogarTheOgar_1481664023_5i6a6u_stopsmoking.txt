Day 15. The first few days I felt great. Now I feel like total garbage.

My chest hurts.
My back hurts.
My sides hurt.
My head hurts.
My knees hurt. 
My entire body feels like it's giving up. 

Not that smoking was much better feeling. Too many cigarettes gave me a headache and chest pains anyway, a slightly different feeling kind of pain but pain all the same.

Day 15. Not even one little tiny cigarette. Not even at all.

PS am i dying?

Relapse after one month

Yesterday was my one month mark and also a very difficult, anxiety-riddled day so I went out and bought a pack of cigarettes. Today I got some rolled tobacco. I'm 25 and decided to quit after waking up unable to breathe properly, but I have been going through a very stressful time: I am a student at la Sorbonne in Paris and it has been blocked for a month and a half and I have a lot of work and revisions to do on my own. I've also been having a difficult time with my mother, who I live with and who smokes indoors. 
I hate the taste of cigarettes now but I think it would be better for my anxiety and my relationship with my mother for me to continue smoking for a while, until things calm down and I am more at peace with myself and the world around me.
I thought I'd share because this page is as good as any support group. 
Good luck to everyone and congratulations to those who managed to quit definitely!

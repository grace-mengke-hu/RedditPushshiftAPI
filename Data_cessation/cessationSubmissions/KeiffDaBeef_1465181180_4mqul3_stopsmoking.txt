It's been 3 days. I think I'm going to make it.

I've tried to quit smoking before. I've smoked an average of a pack a day for the last five years, and on Friday morning I smoked one last cig before work. It's been rough, the anxiety is the worst part. I feel like my heart is beating to fast or not fast enough and it's hard to concentrate. I got a can of dip to help with the withdrawls, just a little pinch to hold me over. I know I'm trading one slow death for another but already I feel like it's easier to breathe. My sinuses are clearing up. I finally wanted to stop because I felt like I was starting to develop asthma and sleep apnea. I've used about a quarter of the can of dip over the weekend and I only plan on using a small amount when the cravings are too strong. Alot of my freinds smoke, and socializing has alaways been hard for me. I think that's why I started in the first place. Should I give up on the dip or keep it around as a safety net? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

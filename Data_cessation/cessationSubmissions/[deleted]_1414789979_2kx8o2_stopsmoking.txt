Nicotine and hair loss. Why is this not talked about more?

There are so many screwed up things nicotine does to your body (at least, my body!) that it amazes me there isn't more information out there about it. One idea that I've been pondering is whether or not nicotine was causing my ridiculous hair loss (basically I've been losing clumps of hair since I started smoking 5 or so years ago). 

I'm in my early 30s now so I wasn't quite sure if I was losing my hair because of age or because of nicotine. I noticed that the days where I used less nicotine my hair fell out less. And the days where I used more it fell out more. 

Well, I'm on day 3 now of no nicotine, and as I run my hand through my hair, I'm noticing that none of it is falling out. None! Normally I'd get big chunks of hair on my hand if I even touched my head. I am so utterly thrilled about this that it's given me even more motivation to quit smoking. 

Now I don't want to say if you're losing your hair that it could be smoking or nicotine (yes, just plain ole' nicotine, I tried quitting using snus and that made my hair loss 10x worse). And I know not everyone loses their hair at ridiculous rates because of smoking and nicotine. But it's worth a shot. 

I've come to the conclusion that nicotine is poison - e-cigs = poison. Snus = poison. Anything that involves nicotine = poison. I know that's a little agitprop, but this stuff is nasty and is totally worth doing whatever it takes to get rid of its influence on you. Withdrawal for a week to 10 days? That's nothing considering the long-term benefits you'll get overcoming this addiction (that's what I'm telling myself right now, and so far it's working!).

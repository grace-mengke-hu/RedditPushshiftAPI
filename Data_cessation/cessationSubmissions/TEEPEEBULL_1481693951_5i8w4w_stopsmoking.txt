899 days...will I make it to 900?

The hardest day for me was day 1. Second hardest day was deciding when day 1 was gonna be. After that, there was challenges, but, I decided I wanted day 1 so bad...that nothing was gonna make me surrender it once I got it. 
I got it 899 days ago.
Ever since then I been holding on to my same decision and the day 1 success. But day 2 does not happen without day 1. and day 100 does not happen without day 1 and fer damn sure , day 899 does not happen either.
  Grab day 1 and don't let go !!

All the day 1 people are my heroes.

Here goes nothing

I quit smoking actual cigarettes about 2 months ago (after a life-threatening incident where I was physically unable to run very far to get medical help even though I'm in great athletic shape) but I've been using an e-cigarette ever since. Extra-high nicotine concentration e-liquid and ease of access + indoor smoking and my nicotine dependence is higher than ever. And now I'm going to stop.

I threw away all my cartomizers (they hold and vaporize the nicotine), and all I have left are batteries. I've got a few packs of clove cigarettes in my drawer but I'm not touching them. Hopefully I can manage to stay smoke-free but being on a college campus surrounded by smokers (many of which are friends), it will be hard. I might relapse a few times, but I want to leave here without an addiction. Wish me luck. 

And yes, I know it is somewhat futile to "quit" in the manner I'm going about, and giving myself slack is a sure way to relapse, but I'm already in a good position to quit. Ever since I started using e-cigs, I grew to hate the feel and taste of real cigarettes, even my favorite ones (American Spirit mellow menthol), and I feel physically sick after taking a few drags. So I'm REALLY starting now, small steps. My main struggle will be to resist buying more cartomizers for my e-cig, but with a week away on spring break without any nicotine, I think I'll be able to shake it off.

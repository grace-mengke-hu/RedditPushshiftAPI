Will this pass?

I started smoking when I was 13 and now I am 16 and I put out my last cigarette 35 days ago, but I still feel like a slave. I really regret ever starting, I hate how much I loved my first cigarette, I hate that every moment feels incomplete without a cigarette in my fingers. I know this is somewhat of an illusion but my greatest fear is these cravings never stopping.
I have read Allen Carrs book but I still have trouble fully relating to what he says, I agree and understand fully with the things he talks about but I don't feel as though I truly feel it.
I still spend every other night pacing around my room and feeling like I'm on the verge of tears.
I guess I just feel pretty depressed, will I ever be free from the wicked clutches of nicotine?
oh well, I guess time will tell ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

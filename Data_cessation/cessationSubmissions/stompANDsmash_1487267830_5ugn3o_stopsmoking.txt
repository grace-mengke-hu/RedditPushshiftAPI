I just got laid off

I just got laid off and its also the first day I'm using Step 3 of the Nicoderm CQ patch.  I walked by some now former coworkers on my way out and almost bummed a cigarette.  But I didn't.

I've never been let go from a job before.  I can't stop crying.  I've been unhappy with my job for quite awhile now so I'm sure it's somehow a blessing in disguise.  But all I can think about is how a cigarette is really good at calming my nerves.

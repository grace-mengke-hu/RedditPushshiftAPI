2 days and 14 hours...

The cravings are constant and I'm definitely feeling like a war is going on in my brain. I've stayed very strong and I have no desire to actually smoke but damn this is hard. I'll just keep chewing my gum feverishly and refreshing this feed a million times... whatever works, right?

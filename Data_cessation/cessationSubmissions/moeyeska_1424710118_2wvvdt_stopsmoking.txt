One of my triggers

I'm off to school and at the bus stop. One of my many triggers I haven't faced in the past 5 days. I used to smoke at the bus stop, when I got off the bus and even when I got to school. My thought process used to be, there's no one here I know so it doesn't matter if I stink or smoke no one is going to know. But I am feeling better after I watched the video link people have been posting up about how to stop smoking. So thanks everyone for posting that. I'm just venting so I don't have to think about the cravings. Wish me luck.

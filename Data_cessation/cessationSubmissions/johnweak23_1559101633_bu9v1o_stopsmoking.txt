I NEED HELP

I have been smoking for 4 years now. I am 20 years old and when me and my girlfriend were about to have sex I couldn't get it up. I hate myself. I have ED at such a young age and I fucking hate myself. I want to quit. Please help me out. How do I start with quitting. I feel like crying my heart out. Cannot satisfy my girlfriend. Cannot do anything basically without running out of breath. Please help me out guys, I feel so embarrassed, I want to kill myself.

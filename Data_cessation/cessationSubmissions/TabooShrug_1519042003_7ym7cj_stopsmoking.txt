First week over but now very low mood. Normal?

I have sailed through the first week cold turkey with only a few rough seas but now I feel as though I am serverly depressed. I cry all the time, I feel worthless, irritable, and hopeless, and am extremely scathing towards myself. I have found it alarming because it is such a juxtaposition from the experience of my first week, where I felt more confident, my hair was shinier and my skin brighter. Now I feel stupid, ugly, fat. Itâ€™s horrible.

Rationally, I know this most likely is nicotine withdrawal and coupled with sleeplessness, which can be volatile. I know I have to just solider on but battling these emotions is tough. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if so how did you overcome it?

What happens to your body chemically once nicotine leaves?

And is the tingly feeling in arms and legs due to carbon monoxide leaving the body...? I'm sorry, I'm not really good at science but if anyone who is would like to explain what happens to the brain, blood, all facets of the body after physical withdrawal/detox it would be much appreciated, thanks!

One Month

Finally did it, made it one month without smoking. My other best attempt ended at 24 days so I am feeling pretty good about this one. Helps that i lost 15 lbs and got my abs back, just working out and running has become so much easier. To everyone going on less than a month, keep at it, nothing can match the feeling I have going on and can't wait to see the results after 2 months.

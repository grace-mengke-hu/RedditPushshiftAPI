here goes something

So I've been a semi-lurker on this sub for a few weeks now. I'm finally ready to quit for good after halfassing it for a couple months now. Hopefully posting here will give me the needed determination and also keep me accountable. Good news is a lot of my friends are also in the process of quitting. Wish me luck.

Day three...I got in a huge arguement with my wife and ended up taking 4 puffs...Just want to Take accountability for that.

Hi, my name is Vernon and 3 days ago I was a smoker of almost 10 years...Feel bad because I lapsed today and had a total of 4 puffs after an arguement with the wife I caused, Im just owning up to lapsing and causing the lapse, Taking accountability, And Im already back on the road to quit again! Wish me luck and I hope to soon join the ranks of all of you that are smoke-free.

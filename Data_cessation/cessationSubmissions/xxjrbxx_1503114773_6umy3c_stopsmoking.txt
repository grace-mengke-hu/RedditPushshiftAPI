Quitting Tonight After Smoking a Pack a Day For 10 years.

I've been wanting to quit smoking for quite some time now.  I battle with anxiety and panic attacks and I've been scared to death of how quitting is going to affect that.  So, I've delayed, delayed, delayed...  Tonight, as I sit here looking at my full ash tray, feeling the anxiety of my heart racing after smoking a cigarette, I realize it's time to be brave and quit.

I've done a lot of research online, for some people it's really hard and for others it's easy.  I don't know what to expect for me.  Part of me expects the worst, but I know I need to stay positive.  Therefore...

Sweeping Declaration!:  Tonight was my last smoke.  I will quit and in a not so distant future I will thank myself.

Because I have a really hard time with motivation, I would like to post an update here daily for the first week or so.  I just need something to look forward to.  That way when I think, "I sure would like a smoke,"  I can just tell myself, "Don't do that! I wanna write good news to the people of Stopsmoking."

So here it goes!  I completely acknowledge that I'm going to feel like balls, but I will do this anyway.

Also, I really hope that my story will help motivate some of you, as well.  I wanna live and I want all of you to live too :)

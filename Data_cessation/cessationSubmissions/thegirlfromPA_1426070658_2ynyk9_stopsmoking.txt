bad cravings this a.m.

Brain keeps telling me it's ok to get a pack and only smoke in the car. I don't know where this is coming from, as not smoking in the car has been super easy so far...  it's the other triggers that are the tough ones. But this morning the cravings don't want to pass like usual. That's why I am here typing. I will not smoke today. I refuse to. I have almost 9 days under my belt and I am not going to return to smoking. I have worked too hard and been though the hardest parts of this already to go back. This will pass. I will beat this.

Thing is, I have been here before. I know the game my mind is playing with me. I know even a single cigarette will lead me back to 2 packs a day. There is no such thing as "just one" or only in the car or only with a beer or only after a meal. I am a non smoker. I like being able to breathe and not smell like an ashtray. I like save that almost $400 a month. I want my health. 

Yes, I know... I sound like I am typing out all my mantras. I am doing just that. In public. Accountability helps me.

FUCK you cigarettes. I do not need you and I do not want you.

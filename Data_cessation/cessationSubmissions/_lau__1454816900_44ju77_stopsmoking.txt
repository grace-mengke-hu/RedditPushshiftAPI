Facing big trigger succesfully :)

Hello! It is almost 5 am here and I havent been able to fall asleep yet >_< this happens to me once of twice every couple of months and I was fearing when it happened as a non smoker. Well, this is it! One month ago I'd be smoking A LOT but thanks to you all nice people I am happily having a cup of hot milk with honey and thinking about going back to bed and not about smoking!
 I couldn have dime this without your help so I can just say thank you to you all!you're great!

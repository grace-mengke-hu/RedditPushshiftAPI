1000 days today!

I am 1000 days smoke free today! I can't say it's been easy and there are still days, especially when under lots of stress, etc., that it goes through my mind. I am confident in who I am, but always, always aware of how quickly it can slip away. As Alan Carr refers to the little monster inside, it never goes away and the thought of 'just one smoke'  crosses my mind every now and then. 

The thought of who I was when I smoked vs who I am now always brings me back to make the right choice. I lied to a lot of people about my smoking, including my wife, but lying to myself about it was the worst. Making up excuses to 'go out' or to be alone so I could get a quick smoke or two in. I was so busy thinking about how I was going to get my next buzz that I missed out on opportunities with my kids and family. 

This subreddit continues to provide me inspiration. Best of luck to everyone on their journey. 

Cheers!

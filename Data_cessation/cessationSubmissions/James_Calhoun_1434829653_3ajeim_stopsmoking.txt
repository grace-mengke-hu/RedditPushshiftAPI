I'm little over 72 hours smoke-free

It's been great this far, really, it feels like an accomplishment. Never thought I'd make it for more than three days. I used to be a pack a day smoker for several years.

But since today, the cravings for a cigarette are really terrible. It's like I'm more receptive to anything smoke-related. I see people smoke everywhere, I smell smoke everywhere, and the only thing I can think if is to buy a pack and light that cigarette. Actually, to be completely honest, everything reminds me of smoking in some way.

This night I had a little chat with my roommate, and we always smoke a cigarette during these little chats, and as he was lighting one up, he noticed I didn't and thought I might left my cigarettes in my room, so he offered me one.
Luckily enough I had enough willpower remaining for today to say 'No', but it was a close call. 
Cancelled my friends who wanted to come over tonight, I think I won't stand a chance when I've had a few drinks. Pfew. Just wanted to share this with you guys :)

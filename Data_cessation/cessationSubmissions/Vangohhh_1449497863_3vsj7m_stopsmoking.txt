What prevents me from lighting up

It's been about 6 months since I decide to quit after smoking a pack every two days for ten years. Three months into it I got super drunk (big mistake) smoked two cigarettes and threw the rest out. Now whenever I have an urge I think about how disgusting those two cigarettes tasted. Between that and finally realizing what it smells like to be around a smoker are two strong reasons among many for not lighting up.

Randomly threw my cigarettes, Juul, and lighters out the window.

I’ve been struggling a lot personally and professionally, and I’ve been really looking for a breakthrough and on a long drive I just decided I couldn’t keep doing the same things I was doing and expecting things to change. There was no plan of stopping, I just got this really strong urge, and I’m really proud of myself. I decided to come join this sub because I want this shit to stop. I’ve tried quitting before, but I took half measures. Now I’m determined to make gradual improvements to be the best version of myself. What are some coping techniques you guys use?

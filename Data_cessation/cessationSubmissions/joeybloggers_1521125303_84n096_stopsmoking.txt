Advise for not smoking when drinking.

Im 20 and have been smoking for 4 years. Quit fully for a week now and have been going outside with my friends for cigarette breaks at college but without smoking. My cravings have pretty much died and I don't feel an urge to smoke when sober, but I am going out at the weekend and I know in pubs and bars it will be very very difficult for me. Any tips on how to not smoke on nights out?

2014 - smoke free year

Hey guys,

I have been smoking for about 2 years. I tried to quit a couple of times, but it did not work. I guess I did not really want it back then. Last month I decided it was time to quit the shit. It was fun smoking while drinking beer with my buddies, after meals, after I have finished some work, while waiting for the bus and so on. I have not smoked since the new year party, and I am doing alright so far. I have occasionally triggers, but these do not last much, not even 5 minutes. Always when I feel like smoking, I am telling me: "It's a smoke free years. I can do it, I wanna do it, I will do it". It seems to help. The funny thing is, I do not smoke even in my dreams. When I am offered a cigarette in my dream, I also say "It's a smoke free year". I guess my subconscious mind tells me I am doing it fine. I plan on quitting weed too(have not smoked it either this year). I thought that after quitting both tobacco and weed I would feel so much better that I won't event want to smoke anything again.


I wish you all a smoke free year!

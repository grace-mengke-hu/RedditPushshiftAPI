Dad died of smoking in 2011. I started when I was 14. Tonight I think I smoked my last cigarette at age 21.

After seven years of smoking I think I've had enough. I went on a great run tonight (I used to run a lot between the ages of 16 and 18, and even more when I played football). I grew up always being the kid who was in shape, one of the best kids at football, super endurant. When I was 18 I started smoking like a chimney and partying all the time, my friends know me as a guy who always has smokes.

Now an app calculated that if I stay smoke free for 8 weeks I will have saved up enough money to go see my girlfriend in Italy. That's on a 3000 Swedish crowns budget. 52 crowns a day, that's a lot of money! This and the running is enough to convince me. And hopefully my future kids won't have to find me dead on the couch.

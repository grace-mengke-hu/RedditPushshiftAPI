Question about vaping

Lurker on mobile here.

Former pack a day smoker, recently switched to vaping. I find that it works well for the nicotine cravings so far, but a lot of people are smoking at my work and we cannot vape except at the smoking corner. I still find myself wanting a cigarette.

How long did it take you to not want an actual cigarette?

I'm approximately 3 weeks into quitting (cold turkey) and my friend's dad gave me the BEST motivational slogan for not smoking again.

He said, "1 is too many and 1 million isn't enough"
That shit sunk in. 
This is my 8th time trying to quit and my second time doing it cold turkey. This is the one. I feel it. I just discovered this subreddit and seeing you guys on my feed everyday is keeping me motivated. Thanks everyone. Stay strong!

Day 5 and I'm a bitch.

I'm new to this subreddit and I'm struggling at only day 5, so I was looking for some motivation as to why I should stay strong, when I'm feeling pretty weak..

My problem is, I love smoking.  I miss it and I can't stop thinking about it.  I made a deal with my SO to quit, because I know I need to, but I'm not quite sure that I'm fully ready to.. My first few days were quite easy.  I chewed some gum and kept my mind off of the need, distracted myself. So far, day 4 has been my worst, although there were other factors that affected the day. I was just a bitch, plain and simple. Mainly my SO took the brunt of it, which he doesn't deserve at all because he's been so encouraging and he doesn't even get mad when I am a bitch to him, so than I feel even worse.  We went to the Red Wings game, which is something we both love, and I still couldn't manage to relax and have fun.  I was snippy and rude about things that weren't even his fault and I just brought down the whole night.

Now today I feel like a bitch. I apologized to him yesterday for the way I was acting, but I don't know if its me being emotional or the not smoking that's just got my mind all mucked up.  

Anyone have tips as to not be such a bitch?

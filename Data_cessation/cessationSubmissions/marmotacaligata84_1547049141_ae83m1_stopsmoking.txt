Day 018. No time for a walk. No time for photography. Nothing really to help curb the cravings. Yesterday was rough, but I'm still here.

Loosing the flow of my routine was horrible. 

On top of the horribleness of general.

On top of depression? Like, hardcore depression. 

I've struggled with depression my whole life, but this stuff is nasssttttyyyy. Pulls you down into the hole towards suicidal thoughts very quickly. 

I just kept figuring... maybe if I smoked, life would be better.


But that's bull shit. 


P.S. on a positive note, the hardcore bloat (that's made me look 6 months pregnant) that I've had since day 004 finally broke this morning. All cleared out ;)  Magical feeling.  So there's that. 


Wish me luck on today, guys. My job is really stressful (in process of leaving but I still have a 6 months I have to finish there) and I'm terrified at the thought of even going in today. My mind's racing and begging for a pack of smokes. I refuse I refuse I refuse but DAMN. 


I'm just a mess, huh. 

Take care everyone &lt;3

8 days later

Its been 8 days and although i still crave the cigarette here and there, i try to remind myself how much better I've been feeling mentally without the added anxiety I feel after lighting up and enjoying those puffs. I hope to continue on this route and i know now easy it is to just start again. Damn you tobacco, and your addiction.

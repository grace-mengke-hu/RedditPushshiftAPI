Help me woth some advice please

I have a chaotic lifestyle, that's clear. I smoke about  two packs a day, in my best days only one. The thing is, after experiencing withdrawal for a lot of times, I have developed the thoughts that if I quit smoking I can't perform in my job, I will be stressed, feel bad and will waste my time. Can you tell me if this happens to you too, and if so, how to get over it? Thanks

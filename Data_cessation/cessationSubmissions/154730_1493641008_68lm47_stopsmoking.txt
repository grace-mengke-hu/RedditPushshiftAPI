How to concentrate while quitting?

I feel like my concentration level has really gone down. I have lots of work to take care of but have no energy or concentration. I tried exercising already, it helped for like an hour now it feels like that high has come down. I just want to either go to bed or just relax and watch some tv. Should I skip my work while I go through withdrawal? Or should I push myself? How is the second day harder than the first...

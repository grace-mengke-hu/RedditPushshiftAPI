72 hours in, need advice for the coming week

The grueling hard first days are easy for me because the pain and discomfort is feedback, and I feel like im getting a lot better physically because of the discomfort. Once I feel normal I start getting bored and my mind wanders and I start to smoke again. This is my 10th quit in as many years.

I want to quit smoking. I don't want to be a smoker anymore. I'm also using this time to cut down on my drinking so I guess its an overall detox and lifestyle change so I need things to keep in mind to remind me of why I'm doing this.

I appreciate any feedback.

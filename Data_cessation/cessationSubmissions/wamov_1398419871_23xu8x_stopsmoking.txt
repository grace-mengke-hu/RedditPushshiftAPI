Its time to finish it

I've been smoking for almost 3 years now.  
It all started with a stressfull indecisive relationship.  
And it had grown from smoking 2 cigarettes to a pack a day now. Resulting in rough voice, sleeplessness and more stress.  
Finally I got closure over the relationship and decided to move on. With that, I have decided to put an end to my smoking habit.  
Wish me luck guys....

Anxiety

I noticed a benefit I honestly didn't see coming with quitting. While I smoked, I always had mild anxiety. I used to smoke to control it (or so I thought). 

Since quitting, that anxiety is completely gone. It's amazing. I used to think I was an anxious person but in reality, it was the cigarettes causing the anxiety the whole time.

Anyone else have the same thing? I've never been more calm or together.

First day going well so far!

I am going for a complete lifestyle change rather than quitting, so no more booze or cigs. More healthy food and exercise.
I want to have more energy for my kids and for the million projects I would like to work on but never seem to have enough energy.

Taking the Alan Carr approach btw, it helped me go a few months once before, not gonna screw it up this time. If you haven't read that book - seriously do it, gives you a whole different mindset.

Let's do this!

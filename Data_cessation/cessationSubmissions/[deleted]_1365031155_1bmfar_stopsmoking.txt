Almost at one week, question about saliva.

So I am using the patch to help curb my moodiness and irritability, so I'm not truly nicotine free yet. Anyway, lately I've been salivating like crazy and it tastes super salty.  Is this pretty standard, is it just my taste buds returning to normal function or what?

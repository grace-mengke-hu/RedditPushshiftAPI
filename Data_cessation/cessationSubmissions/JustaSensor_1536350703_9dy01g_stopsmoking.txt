How long until you weren't pissed about everything?

I've held off quitting for a while due to the anger it makes me have. I've tried vaping then stopping, got angry, bought smokes.

Tried chew then quitting, got angry, bought smokes. Nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, all the same.

A couple days ago I had a tooth pulled and smoking was a no-no due to suction potentially dislodging the clot.

So I said f-it and flushed my smokes. Had nicotine gum around, still do but haven't touched it. It's only here for if I become a super dickhead to my family and feel guilty about it.

Oddly this time around going cold turkey I'm not as angry as usual but I'm still kind of snappy and really spaced the hell out. Spacey I can deal with, anger makes me feel like a dick.

I'm honestly not really caring about smokes now. It's nice. I mean I get the craving at times but before stopping I was sick of them. I could hardly get through half of one without tossing it making me buy more packs than needed. I just couldn't stand the taste anymore, and the dry mouth.

How long did it take you guys to lose the anger? I keep reminding myself this should end soon, just wondering how soon. I feel like I'm high but not in a good way.

I've only just taken off but there's already a lot of turbulence.

Only 10 hours into this quit and time distortion is horrible and the agitation and depression are terrible already. It feels frustrating and demoralising that it feels like i've gone through a lot of hell, when really it's ONLY been 10 hours. 
My previous attempt lasted 5 days - silly relapse. But the first 3 days were not a huge misery to me that time. 
I guess the misery which I suffer now will be good, to scare me away from relapsing and having to go through this again.

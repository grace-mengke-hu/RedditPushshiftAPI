Resisted the biggest craving of my life. I guess now that's it

Long story short, I went to a wedding and literally all of friends were smoking. We started drinking and I got really drunk but the smoke around me never stopped. The strong smell of nicotine hit my brain and reminded me that I used to smoke cigarettes before. Though drunk, I got out of the company for fresh air, remembered the reason I quit smoking and how far I've come along without it. Yesterday, I resisted the biggest craving of my life and I am very proud of myself.

Thank you. I will update when I reach 200 days as promised before. Keep fighting. Cheers!

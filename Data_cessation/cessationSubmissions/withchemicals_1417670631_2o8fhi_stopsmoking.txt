10-15 cigarettes a day to 1 cigarette... I feel guilty, but should I?

Hi all. I went from smoking 10-15 cigarettes a day, usually 3 in one sitting, to smoking just one a day at the end of my day to relax or before I do some nighttime paperwork. I've maintained this for a week so far.

When I first decided to quit, I was already having dry coughs, asthma from smoking, and just generally terrible health. What really woke me up was the realization that poor health caused by smoking would be so costly later in the future.

However, I feel like I just cannot stop smoking. The 1 cigarette a day is like my life-line when I do stressful work. I work in science research, and when I do things that require my hand to be steady, I use the single cigarette as a way to steady my hand. When I need to write during the night, I save the 1 cigarette of the day for right before I start. It's something I look forward to everyday.

I really want to quit, but I feel that if I quit altogether, it might interfere with my work. I don't know if this is an excuse or not, but I was wondering if I should feel guilty about it. Should I be proud that I was able to cut down?

Now this strange feeling!!!!!

3 months since my last puff.
I should be happy!! But I'm not!!

Sometimes the boredom is grasping me, I am not sure whether I am missing my smoking or not. But I do feel some hollowness, for sure it's not craving again... I do not know what is that....

Experienced people, please help me out if you have encountered similar incidents!

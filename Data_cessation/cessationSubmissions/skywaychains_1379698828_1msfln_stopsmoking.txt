Shisha pen stopped working?? Flashing light instead of constant light, no vapour produced [EGO CE4]

Hi guys, not sure if this is the right place to post this. I recently bought a shisha pen to help with cravings, and it seems to have broken. Normally, when I press the button and take a drag on it there is a blue LED which gives a constant light. Now, however, the light flashes and no vapour is produced. The battery is fully charged (I charged it overnight the night before). Has anyone else had this issue? Can anyone help?

Any Quit Date Buddies Out There? DAY 1

This is my first Reddit post ever! My husband sent me the link to this thread as today is DAY 1 of my journey to quitting smoking. 

First off, is there anyone out there quitting today as well? Quit date buddies, unite! If this is your quit date anniversary, I'd love to know that too. How long has it been? How do you feel? Any advice? 

I smoked for 10 years. I haven't been motivated to quit until now because I lacked the maturity/will power to do this for myself. Finally, I realize just how much I'm missing out on (I am a closet smoker and only my close family and friends know I smoke) and I'm motivated and determined to be free of the shame/stinky clothes and car/poor health/all other side effects of smoking! 

I'm nervous. But I am inspired by those out there trying/succeeding in this journey! Congrats to you all for being bigger than your addiction -- whether you've just quit, been smoke-free for 20 years, or are even just exploring the idea of quitting!! You all inspire me. I look forward to reading your posts and being a part of this kick ass community! 

Let hell week commence!

I try to quit, but I keep relapsing.Reddit, please help me out.

Hey guys

I am now making my 10th attempt at quitting. The maximum I have gone is 5 days.I have not smoked in the past 24 hours and I hope this can continue for the rest of my life. 

Please any tips regarding how not to relapse would be immensely helpful. 

Thanks in advance

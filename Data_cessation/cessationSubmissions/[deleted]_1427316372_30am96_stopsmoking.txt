Summmmertiiiiiiime.... aaand qutting is eaaasyyyyyy.

2 weeks ago I thought "wow. It really isn't that bad anymore. I could live like this until the rest of my life". 

Today I think "w.o.w. It became even easier not to smoke and not to think about."


How will I feel in two more weeks? In two more months? I can't wait to find out.

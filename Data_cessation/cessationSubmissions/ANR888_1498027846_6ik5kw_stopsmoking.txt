Thank you ...

Today my mission on smokefree app this : who is the person that's most proud about your non-smoking?send them a message or give them a call to to thank them for how their support has helped...  
 Well, when i read this mission i realize that there is nobody around me proud about my non-smoking or support me for dont smoke!!! Almost all my friends are still smoker,if my mom is alive she feels proud surely but she she is not .so I realized that I stop smoking thanks to you ,the people on stop smoking, commented to my posts or no - doesn't matter, i read your experiences ,I see the days months years past since you stop ,i see your willpower...so all these sported me...
So I'm the one most proud about my non-smoking and you are the people who their support helped me....
THANK YOU.

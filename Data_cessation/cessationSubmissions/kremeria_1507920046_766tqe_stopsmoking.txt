Day 5, all my friends smoke.

I’m getting ready to meet some friends at a pub. I’m planning on drinking a few beers. All of them know i quit smoking (Although i only told one). 

The cravings are kinda strong now, coming in waves.
We know each other since the age of 16. Today we are 29 years old, cigarettes always felt like some sort of bondage between us, although i know that it’s in my head. If they are my true friends,(which they are) they will understand.

One more thing is the weed.

It is very common in my country to mix cannabis with tobacco, which i can’t smoke.

That means that while everyones passing a joint, i’ll be rolling my own tiny pure weed joint (i already ordered a vaporizer online, so i wont have to smoke at all in the future).

I feel like tonight is having a-lot of mental and physical tests for me. I love my friends very much and i don’t want to give up on this friendship because i changed my habits.  I’ll try to go easy on the drinks, so my willpower won’t change. And i’m feel confident, yet anxious about this evening.

Thank you for reading this, it helped a-lot for me to write this down. I’m heading out. Taking my wallet, phone, weed, keys and.... thats about it :D

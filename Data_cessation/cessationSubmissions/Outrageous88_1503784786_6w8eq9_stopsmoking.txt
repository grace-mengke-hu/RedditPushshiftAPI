Just thinking

I am at day 26, I feel okay. My biggest concern is that  I live with a smoker who smokes inside. Who also refuses to go outside to smoke, but has left my office as smoke free. However, I am not in my office at all times, so I am getting second hand smoke.

Sometimes this idea makes my mind start rationalizing, or trying to rationalize. I don't want to smoke, I also don't want to leave my SO because of smoking. So that is not an option. She is not ready to quit and I am certain she will smoke until it kills her.

I guess I just wanted to vent a little, I look at it as - I use to be the one forcing second-hand smoke on my guest, now the tables have turned - only it is against me in my own home - the one I share with a smoker. 

AYEE

I am staying strong and stubborn though. I do not and will not smoke because I do not want to go back to being a slave to nicotine, nor do I want the expense and health hazard I was causing myself. 

One day at a time.

Stay strong!

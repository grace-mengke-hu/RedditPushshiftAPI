Went two days, and just had one and I feel fucking horrible.

So, I went two days. Then, after a very long day at work I had a beer. As you all know, alcohol can make it very hard for someone like me to not smoke. But, I didnt have any and was proud of that and I wasn't going to drive to the store because I had been drinking. Once I finished the beer, I went into the garage to throw away the bottle, and didn't even think about smoking... until i saw it. Almost a full cigarette at the top of the trash. Without thinking I took it and ran outside before I could stop myself. I lit it up and for a few minutes it felt great. Then I realized what I just did. I promised my girlfriend I would quit for her birthday and made it this far. My dad even told me I was deceiving her before I lit it up. Im such a fucking retard and withdrawal is going to begin all over again as well as the guilt for ruining her birthday present. I need tips for quitting for good because I will be back at square one tomorrow. Will the withdrawal be as bad as it was two days ago? Will this destroy the willpower I have built up? I want that to be my last cigarette ever, not for her, not for my dad, but for me. For my wallet. For my life.

I think i'll give it a try

I've been smoking for nine years... Started at 20... Not entirely sure why... Im at about a pack and a half to two packs a day now

I was just sitting inside at work breathing those shallow heavy breaths you get after a day of smoking... Thinking about the kinds of emotions i had before starting and the blunted emotions i experience now... Not sure if its the nicotine or aging responsible for that... I hope it's the nicotine

I guess im writing on here for some sense of accountability... I dont really feel a tremendous desire to quit but enough of a desire to at least try

Did you guys experience blunted emotions that improved when you quit? Its like, ive dealt with depression anxiety and all that my whole life, but it used to have teeth... The teeth have been removed from those negative feelings, but its the same with the positive feelings and i kinda miss it... Depletion of energy levels perhaps?

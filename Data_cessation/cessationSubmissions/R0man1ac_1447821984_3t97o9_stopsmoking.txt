225 hours.

Almost ten days in! I'm feeling good. 

I think it helps that's I was changing the setting in my life at the same time I quit smoking. I know it seems like quitting is hardest to do when you're going through stressful changes in life, however I found it easier to avoid triggers this way. 

I'm not giving in this time for sure. Last time was two years, this time will be forever.

I need some help in prevention

 Throughout my life I have smoked 13 cigarettes. Doesn't seem like a lot, right? I agree, but I want that number to stay there. I just got done smoking a doobie, which I managed to snuff out halfway. These 13 have accumulated over the past months. One day when I was partying with my friends, I smoked a total of 4 cigarettes. After that, I smoked one cigarette for 2 days straight. I noticed the trend, and proceeded to tear up all the cigarettes in my drawer, leaving only the tobacco, making them unsmokable unless I'm mixing them with cannabis. Smoking cannabis doesn't give me an urge to smoke cigarettes, and contrary to smoking cigarettes, it actually makes me feel good, whereas smoking tobacco gives me a headache, a sick feeling in my stomach and overall makes me want to die, but that hasn't stopped me.

 My father smoked himself into dentures at middle age, his is a fate that I don't want for myself. Making this post helps me by establishing in my mind that this is a thing I want to actively fight. Maybe you guys can give me some encouraging words or a smoker's horror story or two. I have to admit my willpower isn't the strongest, and I have a ''treat yourself'' attitude, but this is a thing that I can see harming myself if I let it take over.

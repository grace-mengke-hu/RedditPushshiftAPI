100 days smoke free!

100 days since my last cigarette, that's roughly 2000 cigarettes and $540 saved.  To anyone who is just now quitting good luck, and look at that badge every day. Whenever I got the urge to smoke I felt like I would be letting myself and the others here down.  It was one extra motivator to not light up that cigarette.

Keep up the good work guys.

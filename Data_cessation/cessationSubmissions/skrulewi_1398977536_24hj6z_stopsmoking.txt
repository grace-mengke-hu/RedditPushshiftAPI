One Month Today

I got it. Part of me wanted to celebrate with a smoke last night.

Again, as someone who's quit other substances, it's endlessly amusing how *absolutely no amount of self-knowledge* makes the cravings go away. I know exactly what they are, what they are feeling like, and I *still* occasionally want to smoke. The anxiety I posted about yesterday has gotten a little bit better. I took care of a bunch of odd chores I had been postponing. One by one, as I take care of the little things in my life, the anxiety goes away. Chain smoking will also remove the anxiety, but it will replace it with the dull, repetitious cloud of slow death, and smelly self-esteem.

Thanks for your help, everyone here.

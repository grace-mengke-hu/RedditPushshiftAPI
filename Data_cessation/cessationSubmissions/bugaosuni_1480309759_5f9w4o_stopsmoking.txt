My only regret in quitting

.... is that I didn't do it sooner.  I am so happy in so many ways to not be a slave to nicotine.  I'm closing in on 2 years and know I will never touch the stuff again but when I think about it I often lament 'why didn't I stop sooner?'.  And it was so easy; sure, you get cravings, but you get them as a smoker too.  Only difference is you feed them in one case and keep the addiction alive, and you starve them in the other and kill the addiction for good.  I hope that helps someone.

So, I had a cigar last weekend...

So, as of today, I've been cigarette free for 860 days and was, until last Saturday, completely tobacco/nicotine free for that same amount of time.

My friend had a bachelor party and, during the festivities, cigars were broken out and I chose to have one KNOWING that I may very well fall off of the wagon after doing so and buying a pack of cigarettes. After a few puffs (and no inhaling, yay me!) of the cigar, I knew that I wasn't getting back on the tobacco train. It tasted GROSS and stank. *How did I live for 22 years smelling like smoke?*

Anyway, I just wanted to share this win with a group of people who know (or will know) the challenge and the fact that I can finally call myself an EX-SMOKER!

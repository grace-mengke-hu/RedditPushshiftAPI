New here-Day 3

I am a new mom, i quit for a whole year. I was so excited. I made it though my whole pregnancy with out smoking one cigg. Then after she was born, i lost a father figure, and stress just got to me and i failed. Now  9 months back into i woke up and i was done. I want to save money my health and my child's health. So here I day 3 and working on getting my shit together. Goal one is ciggs and goal two is pot. I need to live a clean life.

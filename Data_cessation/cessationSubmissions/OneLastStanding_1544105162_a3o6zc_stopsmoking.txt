Tips for an 19 year old on how to help his parents stop smoking?

My parents have been smoking for as long as I can remember. My and my little sister have been doing almost everything imagineable around the age of 14 years to make them stop smoking: posting propagenda around the house, stole their ciggarets, go on a "affection strike." We've had some really big fights due to it and a dent in the floor to prove it. My dad got into smoking because of stress from work (his work-stress has been far less now, luckily) and my mom just got stuck into the habit.

Both of my parents have been able to get clean for around a year before they fell back into the rabbit hole. This was around 5 years ago. They've decreased their amount of ciggarets substantially and don't smoke in the house anymore but they're still not clean. 

It really doesn't help that when my dad had to do a health check on his work and he got really positive results for both his general health and his lung-capacity. 

Me and my sister really want them to stop because they're just fucking up their bodies and we hate to see our parents die at the age of 68 due to smoking (my dad doesn't really get enough excercise or has a good eating habit to top it off). Do any of you have any tips to help them quit smoking?



PS. 
Me and my sister don't smoke. I myself blow sometimes. I always try to smoke without tabacco and only smoke with friends to keep me from getting addicted. Right now I'm only smoke one joint around every 1,5 month for recreational use. My parents are aware of this and although not happy with it they allow it.

I've stopped blowing for 3 months at a certain point on request of my parents (to show I can stop at any time and I'm not addicted). Don't know if this is relevant but I feel like I had to mention it.

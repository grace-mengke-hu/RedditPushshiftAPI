Help stopping smoking

Hey
I started smoking at age 14, smoked for like 6 months intensively, like, at the end I was smoking like  a pack in 2 days...
Than at the time I changed school and stopped. I remember I was clean for like 2 years, till one day I smoked again, got clean another year, smoked again...
But I actually never stopped smoking, my father was smoking all the time and I realized that I was inhaling the smoke, so I actually never stopped.
Last year my father went working abroad, and soon enough I started to feel the dependency...
So I started smoking again, I smoke some cigars every like 3 months or something...
But I also have one problem: when I have nothing to do, I start thinking about smoking... And I do...

So I find my self, buying a pack, buying a lighter, and than I smoke like 4 or 6 cigars and than I throw the pack on the garbage... I actually start feeling bad if I smoke too many, like my stomach feels weird...

So anyway, most of my smoking days come because I have nothing to do, only a couple of times I really felt the addiction honestly...
Besides, I am a military, so I get a lot of pressure sometimes, that also make me smoke...

Any tips on things I can do to distract myself from smoking? In majority, I just need to keep my hands occupied basically, or my brain focused on something, like a game or something...

So I can't like do things that make people stare at me, do discrete things basically...

But anyway, any tip would be appreciated.

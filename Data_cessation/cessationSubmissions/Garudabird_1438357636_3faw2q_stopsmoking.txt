3 weeks and feeling committed.

I can't believe how quickly the past 3 weeks have gone. When I first made my decision, the idea of a 21 day badge seemed so far in the future and yet here I am, feeling great! So many benefits - I can run without being so out of breath, I can taste and smell things, I don't smell! And I no longer have that fear of running out of cigarettes. It has been really helpful to read other people's stories here too.  Let's not smoke today ðŸ˜Š

Tips on not smoking whilst drinking alcohol

I gave up, cold turkey, three weeks ago, and it's going (sort of) well. I feel like I'm over the worst of the mental addiction when I'm sober. I can easily overcome the usual smoking after a meal, the smoking at certain points on my walk to work, or when I walk to the shops to buy groceries.

However, most of my social life revolves around going to the pub, sinking a few pints, and going home. My issue is that after two pints or so, I immediately begin craving a cigarette, and I always relent and end up smoking. I hate waking up, smelling the stale smoke on the clothes I wore the night before, and knowing that my resistance was not strong enough to resist. Not to mention the horrible smell.

Now, I'd really prefer to retain this aspect of my social life. I really enjoy going out for a few drinks with friends. I was wondering if any of you more experienced ex-smokers had any advice on how to resist the temptation of smoking when you're out drinking with friends.

I could quit drinking alcohol when I'm out with friends for the foreseeable future, however, I would still be worried that, once I return to it, I would be tempted again. Any advice would be much appreciated.

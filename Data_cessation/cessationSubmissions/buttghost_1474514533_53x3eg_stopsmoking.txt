Day 4!

So I had (still do) serious anxiety and hypochondria. I met up with a friend that I haven't seen in a few years and told him about my problems (I said I was going crazy).

He told me: "Hypochondria doesn't mean your crazy, if you're smoking cigs, eating unhealthy and not exercising, I'd be worried about dying too".

He gave me my epiphany. I stopped smoking 4 days ago; no hyphochondria, no anxiety, very pissed off at everything, but I'm finally happy and relaxed again.

Edit/P.S.: Quitting smoking is the bee's knees, I forgot how nice everything smells!

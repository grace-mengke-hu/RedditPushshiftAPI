It's been 15 hours since I put out my last cigarette

This is the first time I've been serious about quitting. I was at almost a pack a day. I leave for work in an hour and I know the car ride for me is going to be toughest part. I have an electronic cigg just in case but I really don't want to become dependent on that too. I feel sick, nauseous, a bit dizzy, very emotional. Is this normal? I don't have people around me who are very supportive, so I'm glad I found this Subreddit.

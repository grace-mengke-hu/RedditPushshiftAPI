I'm exhausted and I can't breathe. I just want to quit. Please wish me luck.

No pictures of a pack being flushed down the toilet or anything, I apologize

I hate this feeling. I'm always tired, and breathing can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. I've tried to gather the courage to stop so fucking many times, and I keep pussying out. 

I want this time to be the last time I quit. Any encouragement is appreciated.

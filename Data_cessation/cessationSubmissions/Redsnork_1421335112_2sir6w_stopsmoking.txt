Just crossed the border into addiction, what now?

I recently got out of a long term relationship that ended very poorly. I had just had the occasional cigarette before, never having cravings; but in dealing with the breakup, I would chain-smoke up to 5 cigs in one sitting. I'm now trying to kindle a new relationship, and now I can't shake the cravings. My triggers are seeing people smoke outside, as my campus is full of smokers who smoke outside the dining hall and my dorm building. What can I do now so this doesn't become worse?

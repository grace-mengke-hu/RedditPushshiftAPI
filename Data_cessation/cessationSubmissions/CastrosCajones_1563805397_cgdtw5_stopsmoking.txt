Thanks Jaw Surgery

Had a jaw surgery on thursday evening to correct my troglodyte overbite. Got discharged friday and have been semi  bedridden, unable to eat solid food, in constant agonising pain ever since. And I have to say, no cravings what so ever. It may be the shit tons of pain meds but usually I would start fiending hard by now.

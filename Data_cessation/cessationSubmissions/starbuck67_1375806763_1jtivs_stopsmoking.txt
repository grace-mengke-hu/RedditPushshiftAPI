Just quit (again), this time feels like the real deal. Any advice would be welcome.

I have been struggling to quit for some time, I tried going cold turkey without any sort of help a number of times that didn't work. 

A few months ago I made another attempt with this time nicotine patches but I found that after some time the effect starts to wear out and I gave into my cravings.

This time I am using nicotine patches and gum (for when I get cravings) and it feels much better, I have also stopped drinking heavily as that was a massive trigger.

I am only a couple of days in but I don't feel nearly as bad as I did on my last attempts. If you are thinking about quitting, or have tried and failed keep trying and find a method that works for you.

If any of you have some tips and tricks that worked for you, I would be very interested in hearing them. Bloody cigarettes are the bane of my life and I have to kick the damn things.Edit: i also found a great app for my phone (windows phone 8) called kick smoking it tells you how much money you are saving, uses health benefits as milestone and has a craving timer

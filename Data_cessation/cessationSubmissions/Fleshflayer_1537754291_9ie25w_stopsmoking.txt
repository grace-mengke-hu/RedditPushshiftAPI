A man approaches you...

&amp;#x200B;

and  says, "I'm running a training camp. It's like a boot-camp that is going  to be both physically and mentally challenging, perhaps more than  you've ever experienced before. During this time, you can continue to  work, be with your family, etc. The hardest part will last anywhere from  a few weeks to a few months. You can drop out whenever you want.  However, if you succeed, I will pay you â‚¬15 per week for the rest of  your life. You will also permanently gain an increased sense of smell  and sense of taste. You will smell better for the rest of your life.  Your teeth will no longer be stained yellow. You will feel and be  healthier. Finally, your physical endurance will significantly increase.  You just need to make it through. Are you in?"

This  is how I'm looking at quitting smoking. If someone randomly approached  me with this offer, I'd take it in a heartbeat. All the benefits are  there (more payment for you if you smoke more than I do, of course),  plus many that I've probably overlooked.

I've  never tried quitting before. I've been a smoker for the last 4 years  and dipped for about 3 years before that. I hope this logic will keep me  strong enough to see it through. 24 hours, so far so good.

All the best to you all. Give 'em hell

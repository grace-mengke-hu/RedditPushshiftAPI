status update

After reading some of the posts on this forum, I found the balls to start this journey again, and finally after a year i was able to leave my house without buying any cancer sticks on my way.
One of the pieces of advice that helped most, was the dont worry about the over eating. I think i spent about 15$ on crackers, which i kept within arms reach, and also a lot of sun flower/pumpkin seeds. 
A while back I also heard that playing Tetris is a great way for dealing with cravings. which also helped out a lot. not only to deal with cravings but also procrastinate at work for a good reason.
 
the 4th day had been the toughest so far, not so many cravings but the anxiety has been crazy! pretty sure I had terrible sleep as well... I am writing this post to keep my self motivated, and to remind my self how much of a bitch these cancer sticks really are.

thanks to everyone updating this forum!

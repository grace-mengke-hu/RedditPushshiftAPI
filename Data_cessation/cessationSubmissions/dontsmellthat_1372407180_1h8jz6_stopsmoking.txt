Well, here it goes. Day 1. 3rd month of fighting with SO as well. Also question about a party environment.

Today marks the first day of me really trying to quit smoking. But maybe the 2nd to 3rd month of me fighting with my girlfriend. It started with me asking for her to help me through it bout 5 months back, i was doing good, no smokes during the weekdays, a pack on the weekend at parties. And thats when the constant fighting started. I realized 3 weeks ago that im going through withdrawals the entire week untill the parties, and it was stupid to only be happy during the weekends. Constant dick mode everyday. 

So i asked her to help me again, but my weak willed mind tried to reason with my addiction by "weening" off it, but we all know how that is. Its good to say that and know people know exactly what im talking about, she has no idea how hard it actually is, and it sucks in a way. So just constant fights, ignoring eachother, and attitudes everywhere. 

Today my sinuses started beating the shit out of my lungs, the smoke just makes me feel like i cant breathe more than ever. So i figured nows the day, my congestion will heal faster than the normal month, and maybe itll be good for the mindset to show the benefits to my health. Now itd be nice for some words of wisdom, but i really want someone to answer this next question for me

I am a party guy, i love the friend environment, tomorrow i have to go to a bar for a work party/ someone leaving party rolled into 1, lotta people smoke where i work. So please please please, tips to stop myself from wanting to "get some air" will be appreciated. Especially with a few drinks involved.

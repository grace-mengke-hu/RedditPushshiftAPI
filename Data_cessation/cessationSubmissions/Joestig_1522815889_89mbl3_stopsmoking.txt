Running with quitter's flu

Is it a bad idea? I have to cough a lot while doing it. Like a LOT! People were probably wondering if I was dying. Perhaps I risk getting more ill.

Or is it actually good? All the coughing, movement and increased circulation may actually help the body cleaning up. Also, I really notice how bad smoking is, seeing how much my lungs are affected by it (for now), and that may help me keep going.

I am not a doctor, I have no idea what is best. Anyone know?

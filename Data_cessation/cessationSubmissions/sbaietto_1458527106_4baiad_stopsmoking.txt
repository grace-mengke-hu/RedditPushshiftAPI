ugh I failed again

Day 1 failure again. I got angry, and went to the store and bought a pack. The dog chewed up my favorite shoes. I thought I was doing well. I hadn't smoked much since I have the flu. I fail every time. I don't know why I suck at this so much. I think anger is one of the worst triggers for me.

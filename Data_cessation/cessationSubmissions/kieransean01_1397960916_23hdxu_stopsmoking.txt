Made it 30 days/1 month!!! Feels like I've been freed from the shackles of a sick and horrible life, now I'm free and there's no going back! Here's dramatic changes Ive faced within 30 days :^)

Just within 30 days, here is how much my life has improved!!

-Sense of smell and taste are amazing completely back to normal!
-Never ever cough or wheeze (used to cough all the time- every day) 
-energy levels amazing! everything is less of a struggle, much more breath, agility, work performance, gym ability! 
- no longer smell like an ash-tray, and now cant stand the smell on people
- skin is clearer and cleaner 
- mouth/teeth feel better and cleaner 
- more of a calm/reserved person, stress levels depleted ten-fold! 
- sex life improved dramatically 
- the bliss of seeing myself as a non-smoker, being back to normal is by far the best feeling of all, and knowing that I think of smoking less and less as the days go on! 
-saved over $380, 400+ cigarettes not smoked in just one month (Australian cigarettes are second or first highest priced in the world!!) 

Hope this motivates and helps others, as Alan Carr said try support and  help inspire others as much as you can. I managed to get a work colleague of mine to quit- she was on the verge of a breakup because of it. Hugged me to say she quit, gave me a feeling of complete happiness! We're all on a journey here to the greener side of the hill, and those who are standing on the greener side, it's your duty to help those still struggling to climb! This community has been amazing, thank you all for your kind spirit and help for one another, 
Happy Easter and stay strong!!!!

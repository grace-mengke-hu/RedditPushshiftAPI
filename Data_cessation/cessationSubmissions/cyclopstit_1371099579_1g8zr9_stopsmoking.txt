I went to a bar and didn't smoke. Cool.

My new roommate randomly came in with two friends and said "Hey we're going to the bar in a little bit." After having two beers with them I decided to get the first bar experience out of the way. So I went to the bar with three smokers. I just got back and when I was taking my shirt off I realized I reeked of their smoke, not mine. It was pretty cool. I didn't have to worry about smoking at all. I just got to be a non smoker at the bar. Cool.

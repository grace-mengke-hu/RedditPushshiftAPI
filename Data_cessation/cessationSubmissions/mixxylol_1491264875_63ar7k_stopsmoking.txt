4 days on the patch - needing some reassurance

So for the past 2 days I've had irrational outbursts of emotions, crying and my anxiety has gone through the roof. I normally suffer from chronic anxiety and depression but I feel like they are heightened. Is this just withdrawals? Am I losing my mind? I feel so hopeless. I still don't want a cigarette.

Smoke free for 5 days! Can't sleep since.

I smoked my last cigarette at 9am on Sunday 1/1. After 18 years of smoking pretty much a pack a day I was just done...Done with the coughing and wheezing...Done with the smell... Just done with it all! I have to say I am feeling better but I'm having a hard time sleeping since I quit. Anyone else having this problem? I'll sleep for 3-4 hours then wake up and have a hard time going back to sleep and staying asleep.

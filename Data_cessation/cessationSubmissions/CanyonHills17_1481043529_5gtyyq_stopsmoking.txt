24 Hours Smoke-free and counting

I went to my first smoking Cessation class yesterday which happened to be On my quit date. I use Wellbutrin SR 200 mg twice a day as prescribed by a physician and the Nicotrol Inhaler but by my physician's instructions I use it every 4 hours on a  regular schedule not when a craving hits. Even though I was smoking over a pack and a half a day and should be using it every 1.5 hours I am unable to due to sensitive stomach issues. Nonetheless I have been able to use coping strategies to help with cravings and emotional ups and downs.

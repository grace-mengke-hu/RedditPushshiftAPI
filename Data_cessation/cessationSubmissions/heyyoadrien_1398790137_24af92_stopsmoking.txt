Thoughts on quitting by vaping

Friday my husband bought me a vaping mechanism (i'm not sure what proper terminology I should use). At first I was skeptical since he had tried a blue e CIG last year with no luck but I haven't had a single cigarette since. I know that it's just nicotine replacement but my goal is to wean myself down and now that I've been over 72 hours without I really think I can do this. What are your thoughts on vaping?

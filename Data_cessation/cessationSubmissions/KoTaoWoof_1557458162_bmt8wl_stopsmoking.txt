Quit smoking.. time to get off the vape.

I sort of quit once, vaping that is. While traveling I didn't smoke or vape for almost a month and perhaps the euphoria of seeing my partner and breaking the routine helped me greatly but this time it's different.

I'll be giving the vape away tomorrow, a small unit that uses 5% nic-salts. I'm worried about cravings and withdrawals this time since I'm in my regular routine but my past experiences indicate that I should be at least moderately okay with the process. 

Any advice if you've been in my shoes?

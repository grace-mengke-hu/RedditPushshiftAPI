I want a cigarette.  I don't want to start back up again but i feel like if i could get away with smoking one i would.  I grew some tobacco last year and have it around.  Im thinking of smoking some but then it will put me in the pit and ill be back smoking.  I've lost my way on thinking about it mentally.  I don't feel like putting any effort in anymore.  I didn't even really want to write this post.  I was so ready to go smoke one.  The tobacco is in my brothers car and i have a spare to it.  I walked to get the tobacco but i forgot the keys in the house and changed my mind when i got back in.  But if i didnt forget those keys i would of smoked.  Now im on edge about it.  Last time i stopped and started again it took me 2 years to stop again and i "stuck my head in the sand"  which is what i want to do now.

Words of encouragement please!

I'm at a party with my old smoking buddies,  my bf who quit soon after me has folded & smoked. I'm really tempted to as well. If anyone could remind me why smoking would be a bad life choice right now that'd be great... The beer's making it hard to recall. Thanks in advance for your support guys, big help!

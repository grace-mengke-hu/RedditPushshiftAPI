Here Goes Again

Alright, I have quit smoking. I had five previous attempts of varying lengths ... anywhere from four days to four weeks. I had two failed attempts using Chantix (I was one of the lucky ones to get all of the nasty side effects), three attempts cold-turkey.

Through a work program, I am now taking Wellbutrin and nicotine patches. I never liked the thought of the patch, as I definitely took Carr's advice to heart. But thus far, things are going well.

Let's do this!

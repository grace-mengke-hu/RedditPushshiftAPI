Can skin tone improve in just a little over a week of quitting?

People have been complimenting my skin since yesterday (more like three people). They say I'm no longer as "zombie' pale. Can this be real or is it just psychosomatic? This is sort of a big deal to me since I've been so bugged for a while by the skin discoloration on my legs.

On another note: is it bad that I didn't experience any craving? Will cravings suddenly creep up on me eventually?

Edit: grammar

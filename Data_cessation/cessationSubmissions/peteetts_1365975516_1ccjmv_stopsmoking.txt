Turned 25 today and quit smoking.

I've been smoking about 3 packs a week for 3 years. I've tried to quit once before, but I fell off the wagon two months in. This time I feel more determined. I've made a promise to myself to see 26 without having another cigarette. Wish me luck.

I'm using nicorette- anyone else have recommendations?

I've decided to stop killing myself.

Today, I quit drinking and doing drugs. 24 hours sober as of right now. I went to an AA meeting tonight for the first time in years, going to NA tomorrow. 12-step isn't for everyone, but I'm out of options. 

Tomorrow, I will quit smoking. I have three cigarettes left, and I will not go back. I've been abusing my body in every way possible for the past 14 years and I finally just don't want to die anymore.

I realize it's risky and difficult to quit everything at once, but I'm out of time. I need to be free of these chains once and for all, and I need to prove to myself that I'm the one at the wheel.

I have too much to live for and I've been neglecting myself for far too long. I'll update along the way of anyone cares to read it, but I'm really just posting this to reaffirm to myself that I'm actually going through with this.

Best of luck to all of you and thanks for being awesome to each other, this community is truly inspiring. I'm going to *try* to get some sleep... tomorrow's a big day. We got this, y'all.

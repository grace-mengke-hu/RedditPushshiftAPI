Been a week since I quit, not feeling too sure of myself

I've been smoking consistently over the last 6 years, having at least one or two cigarettes pretty much every day, and decided to stop last Saturday after having the last cigarette in my pack. So far it hasn't been difficult, as I'm not having any cravings, but I've never been able to kick a bad habit in my life so I don't have much hope that this'll last past another week or so. Is there any way to have more confidence in myself or is this just something you have to tough out?

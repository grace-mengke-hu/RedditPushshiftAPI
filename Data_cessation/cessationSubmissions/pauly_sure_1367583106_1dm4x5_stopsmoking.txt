TIL my former smoking costs are slightly higher than the total of all my undergrad loans...

[this site](http://www.endthehabit.com/content/calculator.htm) showed me that during my 14 years as a smoker, I spent over $22,000. I know the cost of packs has gone up about $3/pack in the last 14 years where I live, but if prices had stayed static at about $5/pack, I'd still have spent around $15,000. HOLY MOLY. I'm at 3 weeks, 4 days and seeing these dollar amounts has made my resolve to stay quit stronger than ever!

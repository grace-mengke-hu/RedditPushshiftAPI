I keep "relapsing" and it's super frustrating...

I can go 3 or 4 days being "okay" (as okay as I can be with extreme anxiety, anyways) but after that, I just really need the hand-to-mouth (giggity) repitition..is this part of the habit that needs to be broken or something?

Edit: that badge is wrong wrong wrong. It says 22 days but I just sent badgebot todays date so its only day 1.....again....

Edit 2: yay my badge changed!

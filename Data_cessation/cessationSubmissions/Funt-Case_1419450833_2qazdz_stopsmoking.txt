Been trying to quit for years. Want some advice.

Little backstory: I'm 24, started when I was 16. Had a peak at 19-21/22. 24 now and have slowed down. 

Almost dont smoke completely through the week. Dont buy packs ever. Dont get cravings unless I'm drinking. I'm on vacation with family so wont be having any cigarettes for 10 days. Thats the longest it's been in  over a year. Since I've got the upper hand i want to continue this but it will be VERY difficult on New Years. As well as after New Years I'll be going to vegas with 2 friends. 1 is a casual smoker and one does not smoke. 

I'm also curious as to those who quit and continued to drink how they fought the urges.

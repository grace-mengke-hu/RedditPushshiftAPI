That's it. I gotta quit right now

I quit smoking cold turkey in May 2009. Then I randomly started smoking again about a year and a half ago. Went through something really stressful and the smoking calmed me. One thing I found since starting back up is that smoking is a social thing my husband and I enjoy doing together. He gets home from work, we go outside and talk about his day over a smoke. We have a few drinks and smoke. When I was not smoking I was generally left out of socially when everyone went out for a cigarette.  All of our friends smoke, it horrible I know lol. But now I have to quit. I have a cough that I can't seem to kick. Had it last time and it went away after I quit. I do nothink really have the money for the habit. I am always self conscious of my breath. I do not even smoke in front of many other people. Won't smoke in front of my father or in-laws. So this should be easy right? Anyways, I quit. Again....
I get a drink of water when I feel like I want a cigarette. The worst time ever is after eating. I would kill for a cigarette fter eating something lol. Also when I need a quiet moment way from screaming children I am used to stepping put on to the porch to have a cigarette.  Now I am just sitting on the back porch writing  this. Lol

It's almost 5pm and I have stayed busy all day helping my dad with stuff. Have not had a cigarette yet but now that things are slowing down and my husband is going to be home I can feel the craving kicking in. Luckily my dad forgot his stuff here so I offered to take it to him. That should keep me busy. Then I will go brush my horse or something lol.

Yay I got through the first day and did not slip. By bed time I was ready to cry, but just decided to sleep. Did not sleep well. Very restless so I am pretty tired.

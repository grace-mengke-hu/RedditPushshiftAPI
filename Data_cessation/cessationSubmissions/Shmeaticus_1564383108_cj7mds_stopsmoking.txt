Fuck nicotine amd all vices, it makes you weak and anxious

I decided to quit nicotine a year ago, ive quit and relapsed probly 100 times the past 12 months. Everytime i see a friend they ask if im quitting smoking again lol. 11 days ago i decided to quit again. More determined than ever. I went 3 days, relapsed , 3 days relapsed then 2 then 3 or something like that. Ive been consuming very little nic but im on day 2 again. I truly believe every time you relapse it starts the entire process over again but even harder. I also believe during the quitting process you go through the 5 stages of grief. I think ive been at stage 3-bargaining for this past year. "Ill only buy a pack a week" "ill only bum from friends" ill only have 1 cig a day" 
I realized what ive been doing and im finally done. Im drinking coffee and a little wine to make the withdrawals about 10 times stronger amd,facing these demons head on. Tomorrow morning eill start the final day 2. I will never consume nicotine again. Im now at stage 4, depression. Soon i will enter stage 5, acceptance. This is the most depressed and angry i think ive ever felt, but ive never been mkre determined. Im gonna keep drinking coffee to make the withdrawals hurt more and let the pain sink in. Nicotine did this to me. FUCK NICOTINE. IM DONE.

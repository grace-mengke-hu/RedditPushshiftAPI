Quitting for a reason, my dream job

I'm a nursing student set to graduate in May of this year. I'm also a pack a day smoker of about 14 years. Or I should say I was a smoker. Today is day 1, cold turkey. It's been tough, but I have a pretty big incentive. I have an interview for an RN position at the ICU at the best (and most high paying) hospital in town. This one has a no-nicotine policy. They don't hire smokers, or any nicotine users, for that matter. 


We have three healthcare systems in my town of about 150,000, which is pretty damn unheard of. Anyways, this particular system starts RNs at about $3/hour more than the others. I did the math. That's over $3,500 take home over a year. I've wanted to be an ICU RN since I started healthcare, and now I have a shot at landing the most ideal gig in town for me right now. I can't allow cigarettes to take this opportunity from me. It's just not an option.
 

Thanks for the read. Just wanted to share my story.

10 days, 12 Hours, 50 minutes.

419 cigarettes not smoked.

This is the first time I have ever made it this far in a quit without a single cheat. It amazes me when I think about how much money I have spent in my 30 years as a smoker... not to mention the damage to my health. But I think the financial gets to me more, only because it's something I can see... whereas my health is not something I had noticed as much. Though I am breathing a ton better... and my skin looks better.

2 Packs per day (ish)  at $6.50 a pack adds up so fast. 

Had a couple of really rough days, but I got through it... seems like the cravings are settling down a little bit again. I expect they will come back with a vengeance though. Staying on guard this time.

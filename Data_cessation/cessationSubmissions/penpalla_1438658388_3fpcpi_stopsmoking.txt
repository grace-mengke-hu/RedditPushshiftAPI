47 days in... and I just miss them.

After 16 years of smoking I finally quit cold turkey. The cravings have subsided, I think about them less and less, and for the most part I'm used to no longer having them as a big part of my daily routine. 

I know they were no friend to me. I'm aware and grateful that my quality of life, current health, and long term health have improved greatly. That being said, I guess I just miss smoking. In spite of all its negatives, I just loved doing it.

 As insane as it sounds, I look back on smoking with some sore of bizarro nostalgia and wish we could get together one more time.

Is this feeling common? If so, does this go away?

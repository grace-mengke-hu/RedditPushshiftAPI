Smoke Dreaming Again

I haven't had a smoking dream in a long time. I dreamed I bought a pack just for one and I was super angry with myself in the dream for cracking....but alas it was only a dream - and on the eve of my two month smoke free anniversary. It's always nice to wake up knowing you didn't crack at all. Hurrah!!!

Need food or snack suggestions.

I work from home, IT. I go outside every hour or so (sometimes 30 minutes) to have a cigarette/break. I think differently/clearly outside. Cigarette became a sort of  food for the brains gearchange. I need something to replace this habit, at least temporarily. On day 4 of a pre-quit patch program. I found myself outside and halfway through a cigarette while on the phone before realising it. It was so automatic. I am not the sole smoker in the house. There will always be tobacco by the back door. Long story, sorry but i just want some ideas of things that could take 2-5 minutes to consume but not preparing. Please understand i dont want meditate or exercise for that time.

To long-time ex-smokers : How do you feel when you go into a smoking-allowed bar?

Hey all. This thread made me continue not to smoke. I haven't had any cigarettes this year ( 5 years back - 1 pack per day ) but I went to a bar where smoking was allowed and it was an awful experience. My head started to pump more blood and I had waves of hot and cold air on my body. I left without smoking, but I did got drunk fast on purpose.

I guess it's normal, because it's only my third week, but I was wondering did such an event become a problem in your life after let's say one year ex-smoking?

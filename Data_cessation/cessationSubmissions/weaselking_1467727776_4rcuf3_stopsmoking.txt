OK, 100% nicotine free badge reset

I just did a badge reset, I am no longer going to be turning to any nicotine aids during times of stress. It felt a little like a lie having a number on there even though I had scratched the itch, be it lozenge, gum, or vape. Nicorette has been helpful and I highly recommend it, it is akin to dipping, for me it was only useful during the first few days, but it helped me get to sleep and was far enough removed from the ritual of smoking that it didn't keep that alive in me. Vaping is too much the same ritual for me.
I am glad I am able to do this now, even though Im going to miss those triple digit numbers.

Today is the day.

I have been quitting and starting again for two years. Usually I'll go a week without then a week on, rinse, repeat. Last week I started running and hitting the gym. After running 100 yards I'm struggling to breath. I was all state cross country ten years ago. I'm taking back my life, my clothes, my sense of smell and my breath. I'm done. I just hit 24 hours smoke free. Wish me luck!

I lost my vape over the weekend.

I have quit smoking at least a hundred times in the past seventeen years.  Sometimes I'd make it for a year, sometimes for week, or only a day.  Ever since vaping came to be, I used that method, gradually reducing to 0 nic level.  I found it useful, but I still would screw up and smoke after a few months.  

I lost my vape setup on a recent trip.  I've decided not to replace it.  I was vaping 0 nicotine anyway, and I feel like it's time to break all ties to the habit of smoking.  I ordered some fancy organic breath spray that I'm going to spray into my mouth when I have intense cravings.  It tastes better than cigarettes for sure.  

I am going to beat this addiction.  I'm fucking tired of fighting.  It's time to win and not look back.

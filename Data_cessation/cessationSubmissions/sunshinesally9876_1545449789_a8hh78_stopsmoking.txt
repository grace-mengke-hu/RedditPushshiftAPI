34 days and self doubt ðŸ˜«

Ok so I am on day 34 and the self doubt that I can really do this has been a constant thought for the last week. Why!! 

I am using NRT, half a 21mg patch for 12 hours a day and 2mg lozenges (4 a day). Why when the first 30 days seemed really good am I now doubting? 

I am constantly thinking about smoking and have started unconsciously heading outside to have a smoke at times I had before. I have also started to feel upset that I canâ€™t have one, and wake in the morning with my first thought being, another day I canâ€™t have a smoke. Having said that, I know I donâ€™t want one, I know I donâ€™t want to start smoking again, I know that smoking doesnâ€™t make anything better. But I am scared I am regressing rather than advancing! 

Anyone know if this psychological regression is normal? Feeling a bit defeated today and just needed to get my thoughts down.

For those just getting started, here's another post to help you stick with it!

I've been clean for almost a year now. So far there have been no relapses, no "just one pull" exeptions and no cheating like "it's just a cigar, I won't inhale". My last cigarette was smoked 319 days ago and I have not consumed tobacco since.

By now I only occasionally have to argue with that inner demon that's trying to convince me to pick it back up again and I win those arguments easily by imagining myself coughing up blood while I'm cursing my nicotine addiction. Apart from the quick hunger fix, (feeling hungry but no time/don't feel like cooking) so I'll just smoke and the (negligible) lack of extra social interaction between smokers at work or when going out, I do not miss anything from my life as a smoker. 

I feel stronger, more focussed, can handle hangovers much better, sleep better and wake up more easily, my food tastes better, my sense of taste/smell has increased by 300%, my skin looks healthy (had minor psoriasis that magically disappeared after I quit ;) and I basically feel liberated from that horrible and pointless addiction.

Fuck the habit, you deserve more form drugs that demand that much from you. Just say "maybe later".

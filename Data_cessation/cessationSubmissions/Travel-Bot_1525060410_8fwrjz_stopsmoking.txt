Dear Smoking

You have been a troubling companion over the last 11 years. At one time I thought you were a cool thing to do. That was a long time ago. Now you just disgust me that I still use you. I don't enjoy you when I use you, and it is only your chemicals that trick me into thinking I want you. The truth is, I never really liked you to begin with. You taste gross.

You make me feel worse whenever I use you. My chest hurts, my teeth and gums are permanently damaged, you make me feel weak and less energetic, you make me smell terrible and give me bad breath.

I hide it whenever I use you, because the people I truly care about think less of me when we're together. Even though I hide it, they always know though and I feel bad lying about it. These people really care about me. I want to be there for them a long time, and that means giving you up.

Sometimes I can go months without you. But your good friend alcohol always drags me back to you. You trick me into thinking that using you once won't hurt me, but it always does.

Today I am leaving you forever. I know that you will tempt me for the rest of my life, but I am stronger than your influence on me. I know that every day that I say no to you, the next day will be easier. But I will never let me guard down and let you back into my life. I have given you too much of my life already, but you won't take one second more. Goodbye smoking, forever.

Sincerely,

A very happy ex-smoker

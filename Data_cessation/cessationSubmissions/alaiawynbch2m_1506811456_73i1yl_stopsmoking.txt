Why don't we just rename this the 'Alan Carr Fan Club' site?

Seriously. So many posts refer to him and his book and how it helped them. I have nothing against that, nothing at all. In fact, I am glad when I read about how how many people have benefitted from his experience and wisdom. And yes, I read it and yes, I got it from a friend who successfully quit after reading it. Grrr. 
Yeah, I'm being cranky and bitchy.
Maybe my mistake was handing it back to the guy who gave it to me the I finished reading it. Maybe I broke some sort of magical karma thread by doing that. LOL. I'm laughing at myself now, hope you are laughing at me too. WTF. 
I just lit one- there are two left in the pack which I bought on Monday. 'Oh, good for you, you made a pack last almost a week!!'
Why why why can't I do this? Because I keep letting myself fail. Over and over. It's all me. 
Is this it? Dare I say I'm done as of tomorrow? I'm 57. How many tomorrows do I have? My dad died at 57.5. While I say that scares the crap out of me, I do nothing to stop that train. 
I live with a smoker who supports me when I say 'keep your pack out of my sight'. He does right up until I ask for one. I'm learning that I can't depend on him to help me- it has to come from me. Crap, this sucks. 
It feels good just to rant here. Thanks again for listening.  Am crushing those last two in the pack. Now. Now. Now.

Help my friend stop smoking.

I had no problem stopping myself. But what worked for me won't work for a friend of mine. 

What are some tips you have for someone who has struggled to stop? This guy always starts up again during social outings & summer seasons. I keep telling him if he can just get through it once (a night of drinking, a summer getaway, etc) it'll be easy the next time.

My biggest accomplishment

In July, I will be 28 years old. My greatest accomplishment thus far is definitely beating my addiction to cigarettes. I had an addictive personality and a vice like smoking should have held on forever.

I have my dear friend to thank for helping me beat this habit.

I tried to quit a couple of different ways. Cinnamon sticks and gum. Cold turkey. Both failed but I kept trying.

In the end, the reason that I quit was clear.

We, as humans, have a weakness for things that comfort us. However, when it comes to failing, our tolerance is minimal.

So I say to you all, smokers and quitters alike, keep trying. Don't give up. Eventually, you **will** succeed.

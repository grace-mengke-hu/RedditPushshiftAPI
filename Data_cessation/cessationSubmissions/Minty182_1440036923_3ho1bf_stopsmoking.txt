I Had no problems quitting...can you help me with my partner?

I've been an 8 yr smoker and have gone cold turkey, and loving it. What helps me to stop is all the money I would usually spend on a packet ($28.50 au) I am saving to go and travel. I couldn't think of a better way to quit! 
I need help trying to get my bf to quit, he says he wants to but he also says he likes to smoke and I get that, and I'm not going to be an angry girlfriend when he does. 
It's just so hard to help him, he is pack a day smoker which includes weed to keep a calm mental state (diagnosed with insomnia and high stress levels). Would anyone here have some KIND, professional advice?

This site rocks by the way, I never thought quitiing smokes could make me feel so happy :)

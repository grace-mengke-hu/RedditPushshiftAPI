It's been 1004 days..

That's over 24 000 hours.. Insane when I think about it.

It feels weird when people remind me that I used to be a smoker. I never feel like I miss it, or that I need it.

You can do it guys, I believe in you! And feel free to ask if you need some guidance. I might not know it all but I want to help you as much as I can.

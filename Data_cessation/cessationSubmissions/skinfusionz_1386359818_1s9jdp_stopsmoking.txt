Oops. Two years, two days

I'm a non smoker now.  I never crave cigarettes, not even for a second, ever.  I'm even starting to feel like I never was a smoker.  

I even started running in June and will have ran over 200 miles by year's end.

I post this, not to brag, but to hopefully motivate.  I still visit this subreddit daily to read and upvote others on their journey.

It feels awesome on this side of recovery and I hope all of you can join me as nonsmokers.

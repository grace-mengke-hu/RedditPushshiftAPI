Day 3, fuck you cigarettes.

just felt like saying that. 

Anyone else hate when people are 'super encouraging', i havent told anyone, even my wife, that i quit for that reason. I dont want someone asking me constantly if i'm ok, or have you smoked today...

Im going cold turkey, drinking lots of water and trying to occupy my mind when i get cravings, so far so good.

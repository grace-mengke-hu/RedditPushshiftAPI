Smokey work place

I quit smoking 3 1/2 weeks ago. My major struggle, though, is the 2 nights a week I work in a very smokey bar. I've gotten past the point of cravings, but now have what I consider a genuine resentment towards the customers blowing smoke directly at me all night. I feel I'm going through withdrawals after each shift. Smoking ban takes place in my city in 6 weeks, so I know relief is coming. Sad, though, as I realize how few non smokers I know.

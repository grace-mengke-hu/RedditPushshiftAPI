Tomorrow’s the day. Just picked up a box of patches and I’m dedicated to quit.

I’ve been smoking for a long time, truth be told I didn’t think I’d ever quit. But a few months back I realized how much better my life would be without smoking, and I set a date to finally quit. I’ve attempted to quit 10 or so times before, but it was always a impulsive decision and I never made it long. I tried using an E Cigarette and it worked for awhile but eventually just brought me back to smoking because I’d run out of juice or the battery would die. So this time I’m going with the patch, and I think I’m finally ready to say goodbye to the nails. Wish me luck everybody!

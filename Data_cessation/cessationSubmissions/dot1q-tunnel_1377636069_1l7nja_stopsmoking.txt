Seasonal Triggers

I've not smoked for a while now.  I initially used chantix for 3 weeks this time.. felt like shit, gave up but continued not smoking.

It's been almost 6 months and my biggest trigger has been the weather.  It's not summer anymore, fall is here, and I just want to stand outside with a brisk breeze, stare at clouds, and smoke a goddamn cigarette.

I'm mostly venting but if anyone has any advice with this particular trigger I'm all ears.

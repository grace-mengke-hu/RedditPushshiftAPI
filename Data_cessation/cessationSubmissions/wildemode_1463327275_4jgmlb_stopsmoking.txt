Went for a run on day 3...

Hi everyone! I'm new here, 9 years a smoker. Never really attempted to quit before, and quite honestly haven't gone more than 12 hours without a smoke in...well, 9 years. But in the last two years, my desire to be free from this has grown and grown, and here I am, finally giving it my absolute all. I promised myself I wouldn't let it reach a decade, so here we go.

I've only completed three smoke-free days, so I have a longgggg way to go. But I did want to share a bit of encouragement to any newbies out there, or anyone else, really!

I've always been into exercise/fitness/running as stress relief, even throughout my smoking. But yesterday I was getting antsy and cravings were intense, so I decided to go for a run. And OH MY. Easiest 5k run of my life! I was cruising! I couldn't believe how much easier it felt to breathe, how much more natural running felt. I know it takes a lot longer for everything to reach full capacity after quitting, but damn did I notice a difference (maybe all in my head...but still!). It really helped me strengthen my resolve.

Thanks to everyone on this sub! I've been lurking here for a few months trying to muster up the courage. You've all been a great inspiration! Wish me luck!

E-Cig and my first week...

Today will be day 6 without a cigarette! I made it through Day 3 without any form of nicotine, and it was tough. Now I realized that I've started using my E-Cig which is filled with the lowest level nicotine fluid...and I am on vacation and it's almost empty and I don't know where I could find more. It's making me a bit anxious and I wonder if I should just dump it altogether and push through, as I feel like I'm just getting hooked on it instead. On the plus side, I have absolutely 0 desire to ever smoke a cigarette again, so I guess that's something!

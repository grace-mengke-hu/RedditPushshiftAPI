8 Days Smoke Free

Hi Fellow Non-smokers! I had bad cravings today but didn't cave... I still have nicotine gum 4mg but only 4 pieces per day. Going down to 2mg then none eventually. It's been tough. I actually feel very tired. Did anyone else feel tired after quitting? For how long and did you try anything to help you feel less tired? I am walking the dogs and fairly active. Sleeping fine... I started taking CoQ10 and activated charcoal. I have been smoking for a while so I probably have high cadmium levels. Has anyone elimated cadmium successfully? TIA.

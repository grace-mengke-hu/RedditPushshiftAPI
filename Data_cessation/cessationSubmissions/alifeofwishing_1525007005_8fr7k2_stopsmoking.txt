Yesterday was the first birthday in 10 years that I have not smoked.

It may not seem like much for some people, but yesterday was my 25th birthday, and it was the first birthday in 10yrs (since I started smoking) that I did not have a cigarette. 
It was also a week from when I decided to put out my last one and not buy another pack. 
This has been one of the hardest weekends for me, because I didn't typically smoke during the week because I work in an office of women and you're basically shunned if you smell like cigarette smoke (which I did not learn as quickly as I wish I had when I started there).  Anyhow, I would usually smoke on the weekends if I was drinking, so last night I had only one wine cooler, since my fianc√© was grilling out and we had the whole family and some friends over, and I had to consciously make the decision to not drink because I would end up smoking.
Part of me feels so sad and depressed because I feel like I'm just kicking part of who I am to the curb and leaving her behind (this is the only way to explain the feeling, so hopefully it makes sense).  
Yet another part of me is SO happy that I'm finally sticking to this and not giving in like I usually do. 

Thanks for reading my ramble, I just had to put this in writing somewhere and get it out of my head. 
Hope everyone has a wonderful day! :)

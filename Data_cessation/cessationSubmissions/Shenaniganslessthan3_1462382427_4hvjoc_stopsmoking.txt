All it takes is one

I lost both of my parents and broke up with my fiancee in the last four months. In the end, I thought that if I had any excuse to have that first one this year was it. Here I am a week later, back to where I was when I last smoked. One thousand days down the drain. No matter how bad things seem, a cig is not going to make them better. 

I refuse to let this addiction rule me.

Tomorrow is day 1 again.

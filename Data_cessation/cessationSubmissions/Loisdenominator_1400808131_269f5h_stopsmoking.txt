Where's your badge?!

I've been seeing a lot of new people on this sub who have quit recently and have no badge. 

While I can understand some people see no value in it, do not underestimate the almighty badge. I feel it helped me in the early days when time would go by sooooo slowly. I would just look at that badge as a testament to my focus and determination. Later on and even today, it keeps me accountable and makes me proud.

So yeah, I have an app and all that. I don't open it nearly as often as reddit and also, I don't get to show off my achievement (joking on that last one, or am I?)

Finally, without my badge I would've had to do too much thinking to figure out that today I have officially started the 1 month countdown to my 1 year anniversary. Who would've thought?!

So I highly recommend you get a badge, yeah?

**Edit**: thanks to /u/serbrian for the instructions on how to get one, which should have been on my original post! 

>Otherwise, simply compose a message to badgebot with the subject "stopsmoking" and the message body containing the date you quit smoking. The message body should contain your quit date in YYYY-MM-DD format only. Be extra careful that your message does not contain extra spaces or characters in the subject or message body fields. If you have any existing entries on the calendar, they will be overwritten with the date you entered.

>I believe that a moderator will do it if you message them - say /u/JeepChick (she's pretty active here).

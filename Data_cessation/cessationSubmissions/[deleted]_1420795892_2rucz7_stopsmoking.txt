As of 5:00am (Est) I am officially a non smoker Reading Alan Carr and FFN-TJH

Im done, I am quitting. Could anyone help me structure a plan? Small things that help when cravings come up and such. Its a stressful time, but theres never going to be the perfect time to quit, because its always the perfect time to quit...

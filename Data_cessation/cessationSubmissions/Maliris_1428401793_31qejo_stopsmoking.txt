Today I'm going to quit nicotine

I haven't been smoking for about a month but today I filled my tank for my vape for the last time I hope. It's an expensive habit and my main motivator is saving some money. I'm kind of nervous since it's going to be the first time ever in my smoking career to be one day without nicotine. Morning coffee will never be the same without my vape sadly. Wish me luck!

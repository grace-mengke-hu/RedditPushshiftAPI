7 weeks in and it feels like week 1 all over again

I've made it this far before and failed around this time. It's like the 2 month mark is really tough. Cravings come back with a vengeance... out of nowhere man. Damn. This is normal right? 

I need some veterans to tell me I won't even think about it in the future! I still feel triggered seeing other smokers.

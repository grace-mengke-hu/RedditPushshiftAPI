Two weeks and doubt is setting in :(

I quit two weeks ago. I had been running myself ragged and ended up with eosinophilic pneumonia. Basically, my body was so stressed out that my lungs attacked themselves. I ended up bedridden for almost a week. When I first started getting sick, it hurt so much to breathe that I wasn’t even inhaling my cigarettes. After spending four days in bed, with a crazy fever and not having left my room to smoke once, I decided ‘what the hell? Why not just quit? I’m four days in already!’

While at the pharmacy picking up meds, I grabbed a little two pack of patches to see if it helped with the irritability. I wasn’t sure if I was irritable because I was sick or if it was the lack of smoking, but the patches have helped. 

I kinda cleaned out the car and I’ve done a crap ton of laundry, but my husband still smokes. He’s not ready to quit and I’m not going to push him. He’s been kind enough not to smoke around me, but I still smell it all the time. 

My biggest trigger is just night time and boredom. So I’ve gotten in the habit of going to bed early or napping when I’ve had horrible cravings. 

Some days it’s not so bad. Or it’s a minor annoyance, like leaving your phone at home. 

Other days, like today, I’ve spent most of it in bed, avoiding anything that could trigger me and playing games on my phone. 
Which I know is not healthy, but it’s better than smoking, right?

I feel like I’ve gone off on this attempt half-cocked and unplanned. I thought that quitting spontaneously would stick better for me. 
It’s been my most successful attempt by far, but I’m starting to feel like it’s just too hard right now. 
Part of me knows that it’s just my nicotine monster making excuses to get some more. 
Part of me feels like it’s only a matter of time before I slip up. 

I’m torn, friends. I’m happy and sad at the same time. 
Thanks for letting me rant.

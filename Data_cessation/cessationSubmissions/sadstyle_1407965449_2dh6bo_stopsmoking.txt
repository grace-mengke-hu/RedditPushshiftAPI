Still well and going strong a week later

Few hours ago I entered the 8th day and I have to say I am a bit surprised a week has gone by. It certainly didn't feel that way. Sometimes it felt like it was such a long time since my last cigarette. 

I had my first real temptation to light up yesterday before I had to travel abroad. I found myself rationalizing and trying to reason why I should have this one, like some kind of "reward" for quitting for "so long"! It was so bizarre and intense. I actually had a hard time resisting but I pulled through. I told myself "if you buy a pack, you'll have one and then throw the rest away. That's 10 quid out of the window." So walking around trying my best to put the thoughts to bed, I sat next to a woman who was smoking and just about everything seemed to put me off it. What I used to "enjoy", like the whole hand-to-mouth motion, the exhale and the cloud didn't seem appealing at all. And the smell was awful. I was able to put it behind me and carry on as usual. 

Here is to another week.

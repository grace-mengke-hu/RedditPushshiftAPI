Anyone here use Chantix or another drug to quit?  What were your experiences? 

I made a post in a thread on here about how I'm talking to my doctor about Chantix on Friday and got somewhat positive reviews.  I'm turning 21 next month and would like to stop destroying my body.  We've all heard the horror stories, but what are your experiences?  And are there better alternatives?

19 year old here,been smoking for 5 years,wish me luck

It has become ridiculous and it's gotten out of hand
 
I can barely spend a day without smoking a cigarette,and I'm tired of it

It's interfering in my weight gain(been hitting the gym for 3 months) and my stamina is pretty horrible 

Wish me luck reddit,tomorrow I'm about to write a new chapter in my life

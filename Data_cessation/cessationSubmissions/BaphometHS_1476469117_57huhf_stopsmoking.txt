Hit 7 days smoke free today, but I'm back to work tonight...

Hey guys, just looking for a little bit of help here.

I was never a heavy smoker, and recently I was able to ween myself down to 5 a day. I went on vacation last week and went totally cold turkey, and I returned last night. I did great during my time away, but now I have to go back to work tonight and I'm honestly very nervous of how I'm going to be without my usual routine. (Have a smoke at the train station, outside the office, mid-shift, end of shift and at the train station headed home). 

I'm just looking for any tips on maybe how I could break up my routine, or methods of distracting myself? Help would be greatly appreciated, as I'm very committed to quitting this time around.

Day 5

I'm feeling better, my lungs are starting to get better , I'm still coughing alot today. But the infection is clearing, I have no urges to smoke today, my fidgety hands and thoughts have passed, my headache I had on day 1-3 have gone, a mate of mine lot a smoke up in front of me today, I told him it stinks and that I'm trying to quit as it has made me sick, he was cool with it, I walked away (15 metres away) until he finished smoking it. He wants to quit also, but for me this is it, i feel a hell of alot better Than i did on day 0-1.. Have a nice day people, i won't smoke today.

When you smoke again: Expectation vs Reality

Im 26 days smoke free. Until then I only had mild cravings as I vaped, but yesterday I had that real craving about how good it would be to just be young and non caring and just go smoke. A nice good cigarette, nothing bothers me right? It made me thinking what would happen to me if I went and smoked again.

Expectation: You go to the store, buy your favorite pack, its fresh, you tear off the seal, take out that attractive cig, light up and smoke. It feels good, you forget about everything because you are enjoying life and you laugh off how stupid it was to deny yourself something that you really love.

&amp;#x200B;

Reality: You go to the store very excited, choose your pack, and you feel something weird as your payment is complete. In excitement filled with anxiety, you take off the cigarette, and as soon as you light it up all the magic is gone. You remember why you hated it but its even worse because you are not used to smoking: it smells like shit, you cough, you feel sick. You went there missing something, wanting to be satisfied but it leaves you empty. You clearly remember how hard it was to quit and why you wanted in the first place. Now you're stuck with an almost full pack of cigarettes choosing whether to smoke them later because of sunken cost fallacy, or eat the frog and put the pack in the trash.

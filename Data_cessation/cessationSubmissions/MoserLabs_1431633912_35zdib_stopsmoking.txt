Almost my "buck and a quarter" day...

It's still something I think about on occasion.  I read somewhere about it only taking a single cigarette to refill the nicotine receptors and it would be another 3 days to get rid of the nicotine...  I think that knowledge is keeping me from relapsing.  

I was speaking with my step-father over the weekend (solid pack and a half camel non filter smoker) and he agreed that smoking just one would put him back as a smoker.  He's quit for 10 years now...

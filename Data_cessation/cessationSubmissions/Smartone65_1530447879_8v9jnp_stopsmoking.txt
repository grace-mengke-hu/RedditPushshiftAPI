Needing support

For the umpteenth and, hopefully, last time, I will be throwing my cigarettes away at midnight tonight! I work in healthcare, I know what smoking does, my grandmother and my father died from smoking complications - its time to shut the door on this beast and never open it again! I'll be using the patch, as it has worked for me in the past. Please give me some encouragement from those of you who have gone through this battle! I CAN DO THIS!

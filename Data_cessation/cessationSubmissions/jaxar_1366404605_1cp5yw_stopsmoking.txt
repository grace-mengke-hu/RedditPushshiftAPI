Second Day

I'm feeling extremely tired. I can barely keep my eyes open even though I have been sleeping pretty well. I have not had any major mood swings like I thought I would by this point. I can feel the headaches are going to start soon though. Every time I get in my car, I roll my window down out of habit. I reach for my cigarettes after I eat and when I get in my car but obviously, they aren't there. My face is already a lot clearer and brighter than I thought it would be at this point. I haven't coughed at all but I'm assuming that is coming. My mouth is sore from tearing up lollipops and sun flower seeds. I could actually smell my perfume today (before I didn't know I couldn't smell it) and It smells amazing. I told my four year old that I am quitting so there is no going back or relapsing. My first true test will be coming up tomorrow (4/20) when I will be going to girls night in at my aunts house with lots of drinking going on. I think I'll be okay though because I don't really drink that much anyway but it is still going to be a trigger. I still go on daily walks but I can feel better oxygen flow and I can move at a faster pace. One day at a time. Feels good to write this out. Thanks for the support guys!

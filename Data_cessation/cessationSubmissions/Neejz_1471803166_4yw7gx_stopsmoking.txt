I did quit smoking tobacco, now I feel strange, worst feeling of my life.

8 days I quitted smoking tobacco, after a migraine attack I caught the occasion to quit that habit.
I took a medication, toradol, a really strong painkiller and since then I feel like shit. The most disturbing thing are my eyes, they don't focus well, I feel they are dry as the hell and I feel like out of my body, It's terrible, I think I'm getting crazy, I'm really scared.
What I want to know is: Are these symptoms here because I quitted smoking or because I'm still under this painkiller? I'm really, really scared guys, even because I will have to transfer to London in 15 days and I want to be normal for that time, what should I do? I feel like out of my body, my eyes are heavy and my head with them. I'm hating that. :(

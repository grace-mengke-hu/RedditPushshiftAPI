5 Years today

I smoked for 25 years. Stopped for about 4 months once in the late 90's. I tried gum in 2002 or so. Nothing worked. In June of 2011 I got an e-cig. Did the research, ordered it online and it arrived on Saturday the 11th. I smoked a few cigarettes that morning, took the e-cig to work and smoked a few more cigarettes when I got home. Sunday was the same as Saturday, cigarettes in the morning and late at night, e-cig all day long. Monday the 13th I smoked my last 2 or 3 cigarettes and then went fully e-cig. I used the e-cig for about a month, stopped using it sometime in July and have been nicotine free since.

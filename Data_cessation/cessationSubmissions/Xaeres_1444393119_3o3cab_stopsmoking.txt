Day 3 and I feel like I'm going to explode.

It's been three days since i quit smoking cigarettes and 5 since I quit smoking pot and this has to be the worst feeling ever. The first day I quit smoking cigs I had to use dip because the withdrawl feeling from both cigs and weed was too intense. I only used once and then once again on Wednesday but Thursday I used three times.  I'm throwing out the dip today and going completely cold turkey. 

Honestly this wouldn't be so bad if my lungs didn't feel like they were going to burst.  God I just want a cig so bad right now. Everything I do almost reminds me of smoking.  First thing I do when I wake up is want a cig. When I'm done setting things up at work I want a cig because that's what I would do before.  The car ride to and from work also make me want to smoke to but the feelings only last a few minutes. 

I just want to go to the store right now and get a pack of cigs and make all this pain and irritability and anxiety go away. But I know if I do that then I'll just be causing even more damage that I wont feel till later in life.  I did this to myself and I just need to tough it out for a month or two till I start getting better. 

I just want to know why my lungs hurt so much. :(

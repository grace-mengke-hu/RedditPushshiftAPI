Having a real tough go....

I’ve been trying to quit for about a month, the longest I’ve gone is 4 days before I say fuck it. I even went to roll up cigs once cuz I thought it’d be better?? I’ve read Allen Carr twice, somehow I can’t get it to click and the associations I’ve made with smoking are so strong, I lose it when an occurrence comes up. What’s up?? 

I think I’m just wishy washy: I want to quit but never set a concrete date and can’t always act on mindfulness exercises. Any ideas would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks folks

Can I ever drink without smoking???

I have been trying to fully quit smoking for years and have not been a full time smoker for a long time. However I cannot seem to be around smokers in a drinking situation and it’s getting to be a problem! I’m in a long term relationship and live with a non smoker, I don’t even think about smoking unless I am around friends who smoke. I am not tempted in any other situation but after 3 drinks or so any resolve goes out the window and I’m happily puffing away.

My smoking pals have expressed jealousy that I am able to limit my smoking like this...one said the other week that if he could control it like that he’d ‘never need to quit’. Trouble is, the next day I’ll be gripped by dismay and self-loathing, guilt at smoking in front of my partner (or behind his back), and having the ever present worries about the affect on my health. 

I am a regular gym goer and my partner is a trainer. I lead a healthy lifestyle the rest of the time so the smoking is the issue. As I get up early for the gym I never drink midweek, only on weekends.

I can be slightly obsessive about things which results in an all or nothing attitude e.g. ‘well I’m binge drinking which is unhealthy, so I may as well smoke’ or ‘I know I’m going to smoke later in the evening so what’s the point even trying not to, I’ll buy a pack’. It sounds stupid as I type it but makes sense at the time!

I associate smoking with good memories, fun times, deep conversations, parties and friendship. It’s got to the point where I feel I am not looking forward to a night out due to having to try not to smoke, or failing miserably.

I’ve tried vaping and didn’t find it realistic enough and a bit of a hassle.

Sorry for the long post....has anyone got any tips on how to still go out and have fun....but without this relentless feeling of missing out???

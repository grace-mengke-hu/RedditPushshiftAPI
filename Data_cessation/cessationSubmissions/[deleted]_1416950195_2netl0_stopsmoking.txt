Am i about to be addicted?

Been a party smoker since i was 12 (im 19 now) so skipping the first 6 years, im sure i was never addicted but i did smoke at parties and when with smoker friends, i enjoyed the social aspect of smoking (not the taste)

#fast foward; im 19 out of gymnasium (danish for extended school age-16 to 19 -/+)

and this month i've smoked 1.5 pack 1 pack last month and a 1/4 the month before that. So what do i do? i really need to kill this before it becomes a real thing. At them moment i use smoking to cope with being un-employed and having bills to pay.

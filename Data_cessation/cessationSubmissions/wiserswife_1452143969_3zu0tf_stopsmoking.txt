I'm new! I've got it. Feel like I'm getting a cold, insatiable thirst and dry mouth. And itchy hands.

How long does this unpleasantness last? I know it's worth it, and I'm actually taking a break from work so I'm holed up at home. 
I've been drinking lots of water, taking deep breaths, getting fresh air every few hours because I'm a hermit and the only reason is for my dog... Showers....baths....fidgeting a lot. Can't take my mind off cigarettes, it's incessant! This is pretty intense. Ive smoked since July 2011, and today is my second full day without it. I'm using the patch. I just hope this doesn't last too long. I want to be a non smoker again! 
Hope you're all having a lovely day!

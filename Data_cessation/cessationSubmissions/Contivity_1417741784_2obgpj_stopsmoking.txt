Replaced Smoke Break with Dribble Break

At work we are usually lax with breaks. There are times when I'm stressed out and chain-smoked 3-4 sticks during a smoke break. Today I had some discomforting chest pain and decided to take a break. Take a ball out of my truck and do a dribbling-break instead. Chest pain was gone.

I know chest pain needs to be checked out, but I have been having this random chest pain for years and every time my doctor check them out, EKG, x-ray, or whatever scan they run, results are always negative. So I attribute this chest pain as withdrawal symptom.

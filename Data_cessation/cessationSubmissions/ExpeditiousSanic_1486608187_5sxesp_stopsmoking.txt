I'm begging you to help me. Please.

Hey guys. So I've been clean for 16 days now, which I am very happy about and have to thank many of you for the help you provided. My grandfather passed away this morning after a few months of decline, and during the phone call with my mom (his daughter), I brought up the fact that because she is already 62, and I am only 19, that if she does not quit smoking she will never see grandchildren. She has been smoking since she was 13, has gone on and off of it but has probably smoked half a pack a day for the past 15 years. She has tried patches, Allen Carr's book, prescription, and nothing has worked lately. Please, I don't want to lose my mom to something I can help prevent, especially within the next few years. What can I do? How do I approach this?

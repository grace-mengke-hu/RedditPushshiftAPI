Just a quick question for anyone that is farther along than I am, does the feeling of wanting to smoke ever actually go away? I'm coming up on three days without nicotine and I feel like I have beat the worst of it and overcome the harder aspects of my body hating me for it, and I feel like I don't *need* to smoke anymore, but the issue I'm having is I still *want* to smoke.

Seems like even though I have gotten over the anger and the cold sweats and that feeling in my throat I still think about it a lot. Just wondering if that feeling of wanting a smoke ever actually goes away or if that's just something I'm going to live with now.

Also another question, did anyone have trouble sleeping after they first started trying to quit? I am finding that when I get in bed to go to sleep I have a really tough time and my anxiety flares up along with my heart rate. That might be unrelated, but I was just curious if anyone else had a similar issue.

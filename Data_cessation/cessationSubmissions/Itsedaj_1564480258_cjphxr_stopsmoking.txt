Today is the day!

I joined this sub a few weeks ago when I decided I was going to quit.

You’ve all made me feel like I can really do it this time. Especially the person who is drawing pokemon each day!

So far I have resisted my usual two cigarettes of the day. Nearly 4 hours in!

I am using nicotine gum which is helping slightly but the cravings are still strong.

I’m worried that I won’t be able to sleep tonight. Any advice??

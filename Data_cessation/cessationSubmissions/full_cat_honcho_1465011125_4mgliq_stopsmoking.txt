Return of ADHD

So, I had pretty severe ADHD when I was a child, and I took medication for it until I was about 16 or 17. I then slowly started drunk smoking when I was 18 and it became a regular habit when I was 19. I have had no problems with my ADHD my entire adult life, but I am slowly starting to realize that this was probably due to the self-medication with nicotine. So here is my current issue. Every time I try to quit, my symptoms come roaring back. I can't concentrate, my attention span goes to zero, and I start getting all twitchy, just like when I was a kid. And this can last for months, so it feels like it is beyond the normal problems with concentration that happen when quitting. Now, I am currently in a situation where I will not be able to get any official medical help for the ADHD, but I really need to stop smoking now. So does anyone here with ADHD have any particular tricks to do it without resorting to medication? That is what I have to do at the moment. It may simply be an issue of just trying extra hard, but I was just curious if anyone else has gone through the same thing.

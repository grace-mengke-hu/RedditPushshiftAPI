30 Days Smoke Free

I made it 30 days.  Vaping the entire time, but only at 4 mg and going down this week to 2.  My daughter was born August 29th, so that's my reason for quitting.  Never thought I'd be able to do it honestly.  Vaping feels like cheating, but it works and I'd highly recommend it.  Good luck to all you other quitters out there!

I quit smoking cigarettes about 3 months ago. (Thank you Chantex!)

And I wasn’t interested in vamping. For me, quit means quit. Anyway, I’m in a lot of pain for the past few years due to a back 
Injury. And of course no doctors give pain pills anymore so I really suffer. So, it was brought to my attention today that you can
Buy CBD oil legally here and vape it. Of course I drove to the nearest store I could find that actually did that. Well, after about 
A 30 minute instruction (I have never vaped and haven’t smoked pot in decades) she let me try it.omg,
I haven’t coughed that hard in forever! Just goes to show how much our lungs can heal in a relatively short time. 
Still, I love the cbd vape now and think it will help with my pain.

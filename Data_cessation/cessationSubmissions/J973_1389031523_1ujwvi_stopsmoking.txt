What to do when being around smokers?

My husband and I quit on New Years Day and we are doing great.  I'm most worried when I am out and about with other people and the herd is going out to smoke and comes back in smelling all smokey?   Especially if we are all drinking?  

For the past 6 months I have really only smoked while drinking, but I really love to smoke when I am drinking.   I'm not quitting drinking and though I miss smoking and drinking at home, when the smokes aren't around.... they aren't around.   I am just really really scared of "bumming" cigarettes when we are out with smokers. 

Any thoughts?

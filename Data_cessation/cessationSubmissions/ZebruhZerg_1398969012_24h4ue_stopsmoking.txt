Here is my plan.

As a motivational tool to quit smoking I've come up with a way to better myself as somewhat of a reward to me for quitting. I use to have super white teeth before I started smoking and after 4 years and a couple thousand dollars my teeth are not what I used to be so proud of. So now with the money I'm saving from not smoking I'm gonna get my teeth whitened at the end of next month!

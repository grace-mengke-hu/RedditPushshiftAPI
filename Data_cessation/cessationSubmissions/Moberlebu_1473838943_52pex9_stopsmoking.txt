If your nicotine monster was a person...

This morning I had a revelation: 

My nicotine monster is Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction! You know when she lies in the bathtub, drowned/strangulated/dead/defeated and then BOOM her eyes pop open. That's my nicotine monster. 

If your nicotine monster (addiction+withdrawal+craving) was a person, who would it be?

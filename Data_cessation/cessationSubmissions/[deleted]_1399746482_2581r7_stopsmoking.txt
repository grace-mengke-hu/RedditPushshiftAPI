I need to stop making excuses to smoke, but I'm not too sure how to prepare myself mentally.

So after 7 days, I unfortunately relapsed last night. But it was because I was making excuses, which has been the reason I have always relapsed in the past. "Everyone else is smoking, might as well have one too" and "I'm just doing it tonight, I'll quit in the morning" are typical reasons of mine. I really don't know how to stop making excuses or overcoming temptation. Any sort of guidance would be great!

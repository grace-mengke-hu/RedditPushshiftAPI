Stumbled after 8 months

Broke up with my g.f. and smoked about a pack over the last week. Two days back on the wagon now, but man it's annoying. The urge kind of came out of nowhere and in the heat of the moment I embraced it because I just wanted to have something make me feel better. Gotta stay vigilant.

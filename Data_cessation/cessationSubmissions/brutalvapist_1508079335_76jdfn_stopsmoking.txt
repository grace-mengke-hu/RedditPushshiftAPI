3 days, 16 hours in.. is this what a real craving feels like?

These past 3 days of zero nicotine intake has honestly been a breeze.. No cravings AT ALL! I'm experiencing weird feelings all over and I can see this subreddit being the right place to post this..

About 5 minutes ago (I'm still feeling it while typing this up), I'm fully craving a cigarette. It feels like my throat is lacking a good tobacco hit and it feels like my lungs are missing something so much that the general area of my chest feels 'incomplete'. I sort of feel a weird sense of hunger but no food seems to satiate me.
My brain seems to only think of the positives of a nicotine fix such as all the creative benefits, the dopamine etc. 

I'm also feeling extremely fidgety and confused at everything which really isn't helping my assignment :s

I just want to say that I actually feel much better than when I was smoking a few days ago, but I feel so good that everything seems just fine and dandy; smoking a cigarette in this nice weather included.. 

HELP.

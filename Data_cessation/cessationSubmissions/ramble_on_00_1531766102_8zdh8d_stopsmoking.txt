Weekend on the lake- Best way to keep patches on?

On Day 36 of NRT quit (smoked one on day 7, clean since then). On the plus side, I am quite enjoying the dreams I get every night. When I apply the patches, I use two strips of athletic tape  (half inch wide) and tape up the patch like an X. This helps with showering, sweating during workout etc. 

Next weekend, going to a friends lake house, where lots of beer and bbqing will be involved along with several hours in the water. I don't think the tape will be sufficient for that. Has anyone ever had success with certain types of heavy duty tapes or techniques that will keep the patch intact several hours in the water?

Day 1 for the last time.

I have probably quit more times last/this year than I have in my life before. I got to 3 months in April last year, followed by months of agonizing attempts that failed.

Finished Allan Carr's book last night. Had my last smoke last night. I am over it. I feel okay this morning, just had my first coffee at work (usually by this time cig #3-5).

The first smoker colleague just arrived, and I'm still good. Feeling a pange of pressure, but it's cool. I know what it is, and I am better than that.

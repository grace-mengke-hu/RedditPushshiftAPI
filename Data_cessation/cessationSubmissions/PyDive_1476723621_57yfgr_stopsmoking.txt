Bad decisions catch up quick.

I started smoking when I was 17. At first it was a couple smokes here and there. Then when I turned 18, and was able to buy them for myself, I started smoking at least 10-14 cigarettes a day.  

Now, at 20, I developed a few serious sores in my mouth, I have sharp pains in my lungs from time to time, can barely taste anything, and only God knows what I smell like. 2 weeks ago, I broke down and nearly cried from the made up streaa of not smoking for almost a day. If it has that much control on me, I thought, then it is definitely time to quit.  

Over the past week, I have smoked less and less, jumping from about half a pack down to maybe 2-3 a day. As of yesterday, though, I am cigarette free, minus a drag or two of a co-workers smoke during shift.  

I know I'm not 100%, but my steps are taking me down the right path. My mouth is healing up, I'm eating more, it's getting easier and easier to breath.  

I've only smoked about 3 or so years, but my decisions definitely caught up to me. Make the change now, or these things will continue to control most aspects of your life.

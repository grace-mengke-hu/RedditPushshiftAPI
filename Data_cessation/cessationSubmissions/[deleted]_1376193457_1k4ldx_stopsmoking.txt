Went cold turkey. Now on day 6

I only smoked for about 6 months.  Ran out of cigarettes at 6pm on August 3rd, but went to replenish my supply on the 4th.  For whatever reason, my debit card had been deactivated.  My bank couldn't explain it, and it was a Sunday, so I had no way to get money out of my account.  I decided that this was fate and I needed to quit, and so began my cold turkey adventure.  After only smoking 6 months, I could not believe the withdrawals I went through.  Nausea, anxiousness, headaches, etc.  Well, now on day 6 I can say that my cravings are very low.  I am so glad that I did it.  The first 72 hours were hell, but totally worth it on the other side.

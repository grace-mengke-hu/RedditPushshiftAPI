Approaching the 200 day mark and feel the body settling down....

Here's to my first post on this forum, felt I needed to share this here!!! I have seen and felt my body change and improve everyday since I decided to quit after almost 13 years of smoking, and boy has it been a roller coaster ride!
Initially the usual headaches, lack of concentration and mood swings were a pain to handle, but once those guys settled down after the 10 day mark, I felt my body was really low on immunity!!
I kept falling sick every 2 weeks, cold, flu and what not!
I started working out better after the quitting but recently on the treadmill it just been an awesome feeling!! My lungs feel like theyve opened up and breathing soo much easier....the lungs felt like a deflated balloon that just got a ton of air swimming inside them....Running has never been easier. 
After the initial binge eating and sweet cravings and putting on a little bit of weight, at the 6 month mark I feel like yes, we're back on track, working out hard, eating well and yes motivating couple of friends to quit the white sticks too!!! 
I wonder how many people out here have felt this way or similar...
Cheers!!!

Club 31, and a slip

Welp, I was at a concert last night, wasn't drinking (10 months sober), had 48 days without cigarettes under my belt...you can see where this is going.

That pack of cigarettes felt so good in my hand. They smelled good. Then I lit up...

IT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED IT TO BE. Up to this point I'd chosen only to remember the things I loved about smoking. I wanted to get those back. I wanted it to be just like the old days, standing in line for a concert in the freezing cold, not caring because I had my pack of smokes and could toke away.

EVERYTHING I THOUGHT WAS GOOD ABOUT SMOKING IS NOW WRONG. I couldn't find what I was seeking. The cigarettes tasted like shit. They gave me a headache. They tickled my throat in a bad way. I did not feel good, and I did not like it. Yet I continued to smoke for the night and smoked 5 cigarettes before throwing in the towel (please, no comments on the number...I'm an addict like you're an addict like we are addicts, etc.).

I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH MYSELF. As a recovering alcoholic, I KNOW that cravings pass. If I just reminded myself of that each time I wanted to smoke, like I do when I want a drink, I would have ridden out the craving and soon found myself on the other side. I know better, but I consciously chose to smoke.

I LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON. I love the idea of smoking, but I don't love doing it. I no longer enjoy smoking, and it doesn't feel good. This was highly disappointing in the moment but is very satisfying now.

Thanks for listening, everyone. It's good to be back in the saddle. Have a great day! I'm not smoking today, so please join me! We'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow.

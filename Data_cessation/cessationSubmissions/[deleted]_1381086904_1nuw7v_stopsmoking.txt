It's my 1,000th day smoke free

It's been so long since I've been on this sub, but after seeing that it's 1000 days since my last, I figured I just had to post. 

To people in the first real stages of quitting: I know it's tough, but it gets waaaaaay easier.  

When I first started to really put an effort into quitting, I was certain I would have to cut out some of the things I enjoyed to do. After celebrating a very festive Oktoberfest outdoors, smelling the tinges of smoke of others, I was not tempted even once.  

No matter where you are in your quitting, just keep going and eventually you'll lose track of trying to quit smoking in the first place, because you'll have done it.

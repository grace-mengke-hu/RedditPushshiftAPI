Exactly two weeks smoke free but never felt worse.

So I've been smoke free for two weeks, almost to the minute but as the title says I've never felt worse! 

I've smoked since I was 17 (now 29) and this is the longest I've been without a cigarette! 
I was a relatively heavy smoker on about 10 - 20 roll ups a day. 

To help me quit I've been using my vape pen which I've had for about a year, although before now I have been using it on and off alongside smoking. I've been using the same flavoured juice at 12mg since I've had it so no changes there. 

Up until today I've felt great. I've been so proud of myself for not caving and even managed to get my fiance to quit along with me. 

However today I have noticed I have the WORST headache, boarding on a migraine and my chest feels so tight, like its full again with tar and all the other crap. 

I've also felt pretty down this last few days (long history of depression although I've been stable for about a year now)  and I'm not sure why really.

Can I ask what your experiences were two weeks in? 

Everyone talks about the first 72 hours so you prepare yourself for that but no one talks about a few weeks in and all the sneaky side effects that catch you out!

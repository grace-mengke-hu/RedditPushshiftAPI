It does get easier!

When I decided to quit, I could never picture going more than a couple days without a cigarette.  I can't believe I've come this far ( I know I still have a long way to go)! I really don't get cravings anymore other than when I drink but even those aren't overpowering.  

Last night I went out with my best friend who is still a smoker.  Usually, in the past, when I have tried to quit, going out with her was my downfall.  I would tell myself, "oh you can just have one with her.... you can't let her smoke by herself!  Just ONE and you'll be fine.  You really want to!"  

But for some reason it was different this time.  I didn't want to smoke at all.  Of course, it's a habit so I thought about it but, it was more of a realization like "oh, I would usually have a cigarette right now but I don't smoke anymore"  It's hard to describe but SO empowering! 

I will say that driving in her car while she was smoking was not comfortable for me.  Not because I'm afraid to be around smoke or that I feared I would crack and have one but, I didn't like the smell.  I just kept thinking "ugh, I hope this doesn't make me smell like smoke.  It smells so bad!" 

I just felt the need to share this because I know that when I quit there were situations that I was afraid of.  I mean, she's my BEST friend and I hadn't seen her in 20 days because I was afraid it would break me.  But, it's not impossible.  You will enjoy your life more when you quit.  Remember, smoking doesn't make any situation better.  You aren't going to have more fun because you had a cigarette.  That was something that really helped me early on.  

On a related note, I love how my hair always smells so good now.  It was something I didn't even really consider when I decided to quit.

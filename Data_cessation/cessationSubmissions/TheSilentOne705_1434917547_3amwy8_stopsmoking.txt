Rewards for Quitting

Hey, all, because it worked well the last time I quit, I'd like to start up a reward-based schedule to support my motivation. I'm doing OK, and while I'm not at risk of relapsing, I'd like to find some sort of reward for continuing. 

Things I SHOULDN'T reward myself with:

* Sweets and other sugary delights
* Alcohol - this almost seems like trading one addiction for another....

* Buying any clothes, since I'm aiming to lose weight

Things I'm considering:

* Greeblies for my Mandalorian cosplay

* The vidya, although I want to take it easy on that...

* Home improvements, home furnishings, and some art; I moved into a post-college apartment and I'm working on putting my home together.... Ish.

I'd appreciate any kind of general suggestions, and thanks for being there!

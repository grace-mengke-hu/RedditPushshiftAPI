Tomorrow is the day.

I'm 30, I turn 31 next month. Smoker for ten years. Quit twice for a few months but I vaped. But now I'm going to do it. Cold turkey. 

I downloaded the Smoke Free App. I set the date. I got rid of all lighters and ash trays. I washed my car. I bought lots of healthy snacks. I bought lots of (regular) gum. Been smoking for ten years this summer. It's time. 

I'm terrified. I'm nervous. I'm anxious. I'm worried. I don't want to fail. But I'm oddly looking forward to it. I know physically, chemically, mentally it is going to suck. But I have to do it. I'm tired of smoking. I'm tired of shelling out $9 a day. I'm tired of being a "smoker". I've let my friends, family, and coworkers know. 

So here goes!

Day 21 without smoking

Heloo all this is my first time posting..and my first time quitting
I had all the withdrawals,anxiety,irritability,sore throat,depression etc....in the day time I m ok the smoke cravings i can deal whit them...but the insomnia is killing me the first week i quit i could sleep normally but these last 14 days are are pure hell....there have been times that I did not sleep for over 48 hours i was tired but my brain did not want to go to sleep i used some sleeping pills they did help.
Is it normal to have such a bad insomnia?

As someone who tried quitting many times in the past, the thing that finally got me to quit was...

my partner. They hated the smell, they hated the taste, and I kept telling them that I had tried in the past to quit but was never able to. I finally gave it another shot and while I'm still using a vaporizer, and still addicted to nicotine, I haven't had a cigarette in 4 months. Every time I wanted to smoke, I thought about them and how the last thing I wanted was for them to think I'm unattractive or be grossed out of me.

It got me thinking about missed opportunities. How many people have I met who were into me until they discovered it smoked? How many potential relationships have I missed out on because of my nasty habit? There are tons of people out there who find smoking absolutely disgusting, and would never date a smoker. 

I've been thinking about this recently and figured I would post it incase it helps anyone out there. If you're craving a smoke, think about the fact that by smoking another cigarette, you may be  throwing away your chance at happiness with a special person.

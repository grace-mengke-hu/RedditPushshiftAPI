Quit right now. Don't push it off.

 Definitely was a long journey. It kept going back to it time and time again and before this my best quit time was 2 weeks but went back to it because I smoked my cousin's vape pen. So i told myself that the only way I can do this if  I go cold turkey, not a single spec of nicotine in my system for the rest of my life. I'm now 4 months off and smoking and vaping is less tempting now than ever (sometimes yes but it's more like a mild annoyance than life threatening craves that lasts for 2 minutes).  The way I quit was a surprise to me as well, I was travelling on the bus one day and out of nowhere I threw away my new pack of cigarettes and went on from there.

One thing that definitely helped me was my dad quit along side me. He quit the same time as me but at that time I went back to it but he stuck to the quit. 2 months later I started my journey again and now I'm 4 months off. That did help massively. Another thing that helped was distancing myself from smoker friends. It's hard for me to say this but at a certain point you have to move away from the things that are holding you back and smoker friends are my triggers so I distance myself from them for a long while before I can talk to them again. Martial art is something I love, so I focused heavily on that. After work I go to a pad session or a sparring session, and hang out around my non-smoking martial arts gang.

3 Months!

Longest I've ever quit for, so happy about it. I know that I will never smoke again, this attempt just feels different, I truly believe I have changed the way I think and feel about cigarettes. It is no longer a case of thinking I'm missing out, I'm happy that I don't smoke and I have no problems being around smokers. 

Just to say, even if you don't quit on your current attempt, do not give up! I would highly reccommend doing some reading about addiction to gain a better understanding of why you think you need cigarettes, it has helped me massively.

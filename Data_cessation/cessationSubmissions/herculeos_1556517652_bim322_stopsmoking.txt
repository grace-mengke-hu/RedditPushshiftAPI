8 days - thought of today!

It's getting easier to not smoke. I had zero cravings in the past days. It helped that I exercised a lot. I did 5 kilometers of walking, 3 hours of climbing, 15 minutes of strenght exercises and 25 kilometers of cycling. I loved it. Today I plan to go running (8 kilometers) and do another 4-5 km walk.

Although many other areas of my life improved, my priority in the last 8 days was to quit smoking. I realize now that it was really good to focus on changing one habit at a time, especially if it is one that has affects on lots of other areas of your life, like smoking had on me (as I further explained in yesterday's post). Now I feel I have got this quitting smoking thing largely done, I feel ready shift my attention elsewhere. I want to change another aspect of my life that has consequences everywhere, and so I have decided that the next habit that I will pay close attention to is making sure that my house is in order, and stays in order. 

This is something I have never managed to do on the long term. I have organized my home a few times, but then went into disorder within a few weeks.

If my home is in order, than I will be able to relax better here. I will lose less stuff, I won't have to worry about unexpected guests and I can make this place really my own.

So, that is what I will do, all while not smoking. When I feel like I can easily maintain the newfound order, then I will move on to the next change.

All the best on your own journey! It's really worth it!

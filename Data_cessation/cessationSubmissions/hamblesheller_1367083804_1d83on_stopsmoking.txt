After 46 years, 100 days a non smoker!

And I could not have done it without you redditors watching my back. I love seeing my flair,hearing what everyone else is going through, getting strength from those who succeed, and a gentle reminder from those who (temporarily) don't. Until I did it, I never thought it possible to quit. Just goes to show you how the mind pays tricks. Thanks again!

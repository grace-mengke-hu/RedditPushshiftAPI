Thank You!!!

I've been a silent observer here for quite a while now and as you can see from my badge am about to hit 100 days nicotine free.  I couldn't have done it without this sub-reddit!  From recommending Alan Carr's book to just being here for me to read through your successes and failures I can't thank you enough for giving me the support I needed to kick this awful habit!  

You just may have saved my life.  You sure as hell have helped to improve the quality of it!  Thanks You!

So I'm on my first full day of quitting.

Observations are:

1. I... Was... A pack a day smoker. My life revolves around ducking outside for smoke breaks. My subconscious keeps trying to get me to go outside.

2. Thank god I got home to find out that my dog had eaten the remnants of my last deck of smokes. I probably would have "just finished them before I quit."

3. I'm currently sick with an entirely preventable throat infection. I won't miss this at all.

4. I'm really glad I have four days off now, because last time I quit smoking I started to get panic attacks and ended up with a bipolar diagnosis.

5. Did you know that Australian cigarettes are almost up to a dollar per cigarette now? I'm going to be rolling in money soon.

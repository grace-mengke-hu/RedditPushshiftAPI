Im back with Nicorette and a new girl

Hey guys,

I'm 18 years old. This is my first night. There is a girl I'm trying to impress, and I can't let her know that I am a smoker yet. She's absolutely everything I could ask for. Anyways, I want to be alive and well when I'm 65. I want to make it, and I'm using Nicorette gum. I have a card that lists the reasons why im quitting smoking, and I just put a sticker down for my first week. Much love and good luck.

Ps. I'm going to rely on my faith in God to help me also. Let's go do something amazing!

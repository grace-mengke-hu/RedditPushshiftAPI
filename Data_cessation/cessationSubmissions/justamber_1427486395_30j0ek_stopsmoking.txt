Hi - Day 1

Today is my day 1. I finished my last pack last night around 9:30 and I decided I really want to be done this time. It's been almost 16 hours and I feel fine. I feel like the only reason I want to smoke is because I'm bored, not because I have an intense craving. Maybe I'm wrong?

I haven't thrown my butt can away from my porch or my car and that's kind of stressing me out. I need to let go of it all. I'm worried about the car, driving is my biggest trigger. I would chain smoke in the car, it was so subconscious... Get it the car, light up. I don't know what to do to replace that. Any suggestions? Advice? 

Thanks for letting me babble! :)

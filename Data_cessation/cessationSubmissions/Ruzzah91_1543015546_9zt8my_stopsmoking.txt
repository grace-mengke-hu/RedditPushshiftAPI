Silly advice thst might help the cravings!

I have been nicotine free for almost 10 days! (Hurray!) But yeah, as you all know sometimes cravings can hit you badly. 

A came up with the following "tactic" : 

When I start craving a smoke, I try to compare it to a soda. Yes sounds silly, I know. But I just ask myself, would an ice cold (insert favorite beverage) be nice right now? 
- yes definitely!!! 
Can I survive with this awesome beverage? 
- yes. It would be nice to have it, but I also know I can manage without. 

And then I kinda trick myself to think the same way about a cigarette. 

Hope this can help you guys!

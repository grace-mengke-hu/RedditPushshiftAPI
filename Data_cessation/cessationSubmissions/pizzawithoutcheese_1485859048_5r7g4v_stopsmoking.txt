Saying goodbye

I'm ready. I don't want early onset cancer, heart disease, or stroke. I need to find something to replace these sweets in my life--something to fill the hole they complete me with(as weird as that sounds). I've only been smoking for about two years, but that's two too many. I seemingly became a pack-a-day smoker overnight, inhaling cigarette after cigarette of the first carton I purchased on a particularly gloomy night. They love me, but I'm trying to love myself more to release the chains of this crippling addiction. I didn't NEED them before I started smoking, and I definitely don't need them now. They want me so so bad, but I don't want them just the slightest bit more. I'm done.

Can someone fill me in on how yall support each other, I just finished reading an article about how this sub helped someone stop cold turkey. I'm desperate and #FUCKCIGS

Mardi Gras

Hey all, it's my first post here. I've been clean for 15 day, 6 more before that but I broke and had a cigarette. I'm at Mardi gras with some friends and am really enjoying myself just drinking and partying; but the temptation to smoke is everywhere. I feel invigorated by turning offers down but it's still hard. Any tips on staying clean while getting really drunk?

Really struggling

Hey all. So heading toward my first star, been OK till now, but damn, am I having a tough time not smoking today. All that's on my mind. Decided that if it's still so tough tomorrow, I'll get a vape with 0mg juice and see if it helps. Really font want to give my brain more nicotine now. Extinction burst maybe?

I had one :(

Today i woke up hungover, sick, and depressed. Today was a "fuck it" day.

Last night i had some quit-induced nightmares and they really fucked with me. Every time i quit they seem to get worse.

Last night in my dream i work up from a dream. It was some inception shit. 

Long story short, i feel pretty shitty today. All i want is another cigarette because the last one actually helped.

Damn it.

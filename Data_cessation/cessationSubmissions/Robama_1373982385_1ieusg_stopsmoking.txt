Encouraging moment in the Emergency Room

So I've tried quitting a number of times, but I've always given up on quitting because I've chalked my addiction up to just being a casual smoker. I'm sure you've all heard that crap before. However, I quit 3 weeks ago due to the onset of mononucleosis, otherwise known as glandular fever. Well yesterday my tonsils were so swollen I couldn't talk. My girlfriend took me to the GP, who referred me to the Emergency Room due to various dangerous factors.

One of the nurses was filling out my file when she asked "are you a smoker, Mr. Robama?" to which I replied "I've quit on and off for the past year and haven't touched one in 3 weeks". She grinned at me and said "you're making the right decision for your health. If you were still smoking, you'd be in a bad way, so keep it up".

I've never had any doubts about the positive effects of quitting. It's just the encouragement from a complete stranger in a time of need that has really made me feel good.

Sorry if this story is irrelevant, but it was really important to me and I wanted to share it with people who understand the difficulties of quitting and the people who guided me through my strongest (not longest yet!) attempt at quitting. So thanks :)

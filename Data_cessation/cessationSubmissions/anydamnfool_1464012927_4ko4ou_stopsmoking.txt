Could you tell me about second hand smoke and it's power to cause harm?

Hi, thanks for reading. I apologise if this is in the wrong subreddit, it seemed the closest I can think of.

I quit smoking about two months ago, it's great! Forgot life was like this without. I'm only 21, but had been smoking reasonably heavily since 14, feel like I was lucky to get away aha. 

Sadly, none  of my mates are on this path at all. I go to uni as a smoker, make friends with all the smokers, now 90% of the people I know smoke,  and  I'm about to move into a house with three of them. They'll be smoking in the living room, in the kitchen, in the sun porch, on the stairs, in the bath, everywhere, they just love smokin'! 

And who can blame them? I'd have been the same, and who am I to ask them to stop?

While quitting smoking, I pretty much turned my life around, I cut back massively on drinking, just about managed to quit the drugs, started eating better, and exercising. I started noticing massive differences in my confidence, overall outlook towards life, and general health. 

Will being around smokers as often as I am (already spending an evening in my mates house when they're smoking gives me an inflamed throat in the morning) cause me a great detriment over time?

Thanks!

Also I doubt I'll stick about here, but it was actually a two week residential visit to a monastic community that helped me quit smoking and turn my life around. They don't allow smoking, and most of the food there is healthy. That coupled with the  good vibes from the place helped me fill the hole I was filling with addiction. I wanted a cigarette when I left that place, but the feeling soon began to subside, and times still pop up when I want one, but they're certainly rare, perhaps this information could be as helpful to you as it was to me.

Take care guys!

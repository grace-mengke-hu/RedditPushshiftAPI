I got a star!

It's been....well....interesting.  Having been through quitting several times before, you'd think I would've learned that each attempt would only get harder and harder...and, it indeed was.

While the first week was hell; this time around seems to have been quite the mental fuck for me (and Yes, I read Allen Carr's book...twice). I made it through the first week of physical cravings, but I was the type of smoker that really enjoyed the act of smoking, more specifically, the throat burn - which is why I ALWAYS smoked full-flavored and/or non-filtered smokes.  I found myself longing for that throat burn more than anything else - as deplorable as it sounds.

Aside from the strange separation anxiety and excess nervous energy - I really do feel fantastic now.  30 days in, I find myself enjoying the many renewed facets of good health.  Taste, smell, deep breathing, and [most importantly] my [greatly improved bloodflow](http://healthland.time.com/2011/09/15/guys-quitting-smoking-makes-it-bigger-really/) (insert sheepish grin).  

I've realized that I never really had a problem quitting before......I just sucked at staying quit.  Not anymore.  I'm done being nicotine's bitch.  I am now finding better ways to deal with stress, enjoying exercising daily, and really like not having those fleeting thoughts & worries about destroying my health anymore.

**TL;DR: Quitting ain't a picnic, but it is SO very doable.**

EDIT: For those wondering, I was a pack-per-day smoker on and off for the last 15+ years.

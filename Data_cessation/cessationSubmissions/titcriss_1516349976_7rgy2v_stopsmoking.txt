Increased in size of penis after you quit smoking

Hi guys, there doesn't seem to be any data available on the subject and I was curious to know if the fact you stopped smoking actually increased the size of your penis. If you guys have precise measurement that would be highly appreciated.


For myself, I've been using 14mg nicotine patch for 2 week, then 7mg nicotine patch for 2 weeks. So no smoking for 1 month (before that I had been vaping for 1 year).


Circumference : 117mm to 127mm (4,6 inch to 5 inch)

Length : 145mm to 150mm (5,7 inch to 5.9 inch)


So the goal of this thread is to alleviate my fear that it will keep growing too much. Since I read in 1 study that penis size is suppose to only increase when you're not using nicotine.


Allright, thanks for your time.

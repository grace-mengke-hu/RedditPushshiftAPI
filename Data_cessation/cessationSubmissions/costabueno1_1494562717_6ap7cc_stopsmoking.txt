"Social Smoking"

I've smoked for 2 years and I really don't remember why I started, I guess maybe because I thought it was cool and as some kind of self-destructive behavior because of how my life and mind was at the time. I stopped for a while in that timeline, but always relapsed eventually, and now I've spend more time without smoking then ever, although, whenever I'm in college (which is the only thing I do in life actually) feeling stressed after classes I smoke with colleagues - and only then - I smoke one or two. Some people smoke there and the all the sensorial-related stimulae makes me crave it in that specific moment. So the point is: It's TOO SUBTLE. To the point where I'm not exactly experiencing withdrawal, but I CAN'T deny a cigarrette when I'm offered one!! Harder for me to buy packs for myself though, I think the addiction still won't beat the effort and money, although I still did it many times.

Your thoughts in this? How badly am I addicted? I know there's no such thing as social smoking, only pointed it out for title purposes.

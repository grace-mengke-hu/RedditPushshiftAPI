Smoking helps my disease. How ironic.

I'm 18 years old and I have been smoking for atleast 3 years now. I've been wanting to quit for a while. Another important thing is that I have Ulcerative colitis and it has been mostly in remission for the past while. The problem is that cigarettes actually help UC. Anytime I try to quit I find my UC flares up which essentially puts me on a leash to the bathroom. How do I quit smoking when its like medicine for UC?

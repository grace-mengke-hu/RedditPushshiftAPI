Tomorrow is 80 days.

I haven't posted here since the day I quit, but it was due to this sub (and my fiancee) that I threw away my smokes and got through the first month of hell.  
I haven't looked back since then, and have been sticking my money in a jar to spend on something I want.

Looking back, those first 4 weeks were horrible. I don't ever want to repeat it, and I think that's part of what keeps me from picking up a cigarette, though I rarely if ever have cravings.

Interestingly, I've become one of those militant ex-smokers who would happily see smoking banned, and I've ended up absolutely hating the stench of acrid smoke as I walk down the street. Makes me feel guilty for being one of those people once.

Anyway, I just wanted to blow my own trumpet I guess, and tell everyone who's working through the first month of hell that it rapidly gets better once you're through that. :)

Thanks for being such an inspiration everyone!

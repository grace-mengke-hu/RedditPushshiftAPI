Weird symptoms in mouth

Has anyone else experienced bleeding gums... almost like they’re shedding a layer? They look white and gross. Also, I developed a blood blister on the inside of my mouth yesterday! I couldn’t sleep, maybe I was grinding my teeth and bit my inner cheek, but I’ve never EVER had this before!! I read that it’s common for quitters to experience more mouth ulcers/leisons! Though it’s frickin scary! Gonna go see a doc, but just wondering what you all have experienced? I’m only on day 6!

Five days of fun.

I never thought I'd be here, but I've been smoke free for four days and 13 hour + change.

I've had a patch since day one (I've changed it though, duh). And I used nicotine gum for the first three days. I have two patches left unless I buy some more, but I'm thinking about either halving the last one or just not putting it on tomorrow. Any ideas on this one?

I'm doing fine, this is kind of a pointless post in that regard. The cravings still come, but they are noticeably easier to ignore. I've been keeping myself busy and that has helped a lot!

Stuff I've noticed

* Breathing is pretty easy now. I never had any issues with it while smoking, but it's still gotten easier.
* Stuff smells, there's a whole bunch of smells in the world that I have kinda forgotten.
* Taste, there are more tastes around than I thought there'd be.
* I feel like there's a weird void in my life now that I don't smoke. It's weird, but it's there.

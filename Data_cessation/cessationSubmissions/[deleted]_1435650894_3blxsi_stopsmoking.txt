Govt subsidies for nicotine patch?

Does your government subsidise nicotine patches?

I'm from NZ and I can buy three months worth of patches for $5.00 because of government subsidies. I have found quitting with patches exponentially easier than quitting without (granted, I am only six days in). Curious as to whether patches are as cheap an option abroad.

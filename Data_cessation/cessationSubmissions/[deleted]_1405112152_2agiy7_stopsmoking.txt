someone you care about smokes, is there anything you can do to nudge them?

My SO smokes, progressively more and more. She uses it as a crutch for stress but she also enjoys the social aspect of it. She says she is going to quit, but she has also said she doesn't want to quit right now. I can see a few years ahead and I don't think this attitude is any indication that it's going to happen. Is there anything I can do, from a place of sincerity, to move her in the right direction? Or is she going to have to see it for herself?

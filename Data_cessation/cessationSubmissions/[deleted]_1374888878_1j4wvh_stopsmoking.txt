7 days and counting!

Landed a job offer (IT work) within a Hospital group; and they require no smoking (have to take random nicotine tests).  As such, it was a helpful little kick and incentive to finally commit to quitting.  We talked and all agreed that after I signed the official offer, I would have one last cigarette (after 15 years) and be done.  Offer letter came, and it included a slightly higher bump in salary than was originally discussed.  For the kind of money I'm about to make, but especially a job that I actually WANT and enjoy... this is good.  Hard.  Very hard.  But good.

I lurk here, so thanks everyone for sharing, for supporting.  Keep it up.

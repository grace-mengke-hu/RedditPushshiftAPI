Day 3- Thanks to all your stories, I've finally quit

First time posting here and I've been encouraged to post. I've seen alot of really great posts and it made me think I can do it too. I started smoking when I was 17 and now I'm 26. I'm 3 days without a cigarette. I quit cold turkey and I already feel healthier. I still want smoke, sooooo badly, but I shouldn't. I can actually breathe easier. I even get lightheaded from the extra oxygen my body can now absorb. Thank you all for posting your stories. I am evidence that they do help random strangers, all over the world. Keep it up, everyone:)

Over 70 days without a "cigarette" but have had a Black and Mild the past 2 nights.

I feel like I have failed myself. Like I was watching myself from behind my own eyes, knowing I show not light up ANY tobacco, but I did it.

I have smoked since I was 16, I am 28 now. After 73 days, I feel amazing, but a fear a relapse is going to spiral me into smoking again.

I haven't posted on reddit in a long while, but reading posts has helped me re-center myself, and typing it out, even if nobody hears, helps alot.

This quote hit home the most (from a recent post on this sub): "He is the light of my life and we are not going to grow old together". That is so fucking sad....ugh....

Good luck to everyone. We can all do this!

Social smoker for 18 years - if I smoke again, Focus on the Family gets my money.

I have changed many other aspects of my life recently and have worked on being a healthier person. I watch what I eat and drink, I'm exercising more, and I lost 25lbs. And yet all the while, I've continued to smoke. Somehow, being mindful about what I put into my body doesn't include not inhaling carcinogens on purpose. I'm primarily a social smoker, but lately, I've found myself smoking by myself at night, too. That's how I knew it was time to quit this on-again, off-again habit forever.

To aid my quitting process, I'm writing a $250 donation check to Focus on the Family, a group I despise with every fiber of my being. It will be made out in honor of my partner. If I smoke again, my partner has to mail it. Not only will I be filled with self-loathing, but she will be REALLY PISSED at me. I think it's the only way I can do this for the long-term. If I don't have something hanging over my head, I'll just take a break and go right back to cigarettes next time I'm hanging out with my few friends who still smoke.

I'm already on day two of being a real non-smoker, and this seems like a good place to get additional support. Here goes!

EDIT: last night this was the only thing stopping me from picking up a pack of cigarettes. I'd had two glasses of wine (definite trigger) and was having a terrible craving. It worked! I knew I'd be horrified about the donation and in the dog house with my partner if I smoked. Day 5 without a cigarette now.

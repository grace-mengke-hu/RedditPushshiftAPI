One month! Easy peasy

I'm honestly surprised... smoking three years, smoke free for a month now and I know there is no longer a good chance I will cave. I knew it would be tough for some of it (honestly, only day 4 was rough) but on a scale of 1-10, it never got above a 3 or 4 in terms of unpleasantness. 

I was in close dialogue with my medical provider during which made it easier and more "professional", in the sense that I'm paying someone to help me quit so I better fucking get my money's worth. 

At this point the benefits are so clear to me that I can happily say I used to smoke. 

Edit: apps such as QuitNow were also super helpful, they would give you a daily reminder to reasons that you pick that you'd like to quit. The savings calculator is lovely too!

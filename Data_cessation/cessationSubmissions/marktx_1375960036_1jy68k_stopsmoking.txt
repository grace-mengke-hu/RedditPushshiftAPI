I got sick for the first time since quitting..

I've been sick the last few days, my 3 year old daughter got me.. But that was bound to happen eventually, I can't not give her hugs and kisses, even if she is snotty and sick :-P


But the difference this time is that I'm handling it so well. I've got a cough, but it's not that bad.. Every other time I've had a cold cough it's hurt. Probably because my lungs couldn't handle the slightest bit of irritation, so I would cough and cough and cough.. But now it's so much easier.


I never really thought of this benefit when stopping smoking, but it's definitely a good one for those of us that have young children who are getting us sick all the time, or those of you prone to getting sick.

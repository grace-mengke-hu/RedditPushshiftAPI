I hope this is encouraging?

What helped me is repeating the phrase “this craving will pass whether you smoke or not”. Also SUNFLOWER SEEDS. Don’t stop eating them. I quit last April and smoked for 15 years. You can do it. Be kind to yourself. I know you can do it!

I moved into my old place last year with 2 Doctors who were non-smokers and in order to live there I couldn’t smoke either. Also, this will probably be the most difficult for some people, but you gotta stay away from friends that smoke for a few months. Or jobs like in the restaurant industry where breaks are smoke filled.

All of this came together for me to quit today I realized it’s been (over) a whole year. I promise the cravings will stop or at least be increasingly infrequent. Make sure you have back up bags of sunflower seeds at your house.

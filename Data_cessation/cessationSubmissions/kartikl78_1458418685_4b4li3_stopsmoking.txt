Quitting smoking withdrawal symptoms

So... iv been smoking for about a year and am now seeing how long  can go without lighting up. It's been 7 days and the withdrawal symptoms aren't that bad, just a bit of little irritability , fidgety. The worst one is the fatigue and drowsyness. Even after getting 8 9 hours of sleep every night I still doze off during the day and feel tired the whole . Oh and I have probaby the most important exams of my uni in 20 days so I'm thinking should I start smoking now just so that my exams don't get messed up and risk the fact that quitting will be even harder of that or just bear the withdrawal symptoms. ..

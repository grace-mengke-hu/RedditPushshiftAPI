Back to day 1

Smoked 1-2 packs a day for 14 years. Was on week 8 and I don't know what happened. Got in an argument with my girlfriend and just had to get out of the room. I know it's just excuses. I could've just gone around the block, dunno I just really wanted one I guess. Oh well, back to day one. My god did my throat hurt when I woke up, mouth felt gross,  nose is all stuffed up. I can't believe I did that x 20 every day.

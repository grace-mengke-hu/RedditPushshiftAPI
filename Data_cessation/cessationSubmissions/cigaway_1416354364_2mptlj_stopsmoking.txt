I need a reason to stop smoking.

Howdy folks, I'm the seventeen year old kid of a smoker and a former smoker. I've had three cigarettes in my life over the span of maybe six months, and I can feel myself getting addicted e.g. cravings, dragging on my pens, toothpicks to feel like I have something in my mouth. How do I convince myself that it's a stupid thing to do?

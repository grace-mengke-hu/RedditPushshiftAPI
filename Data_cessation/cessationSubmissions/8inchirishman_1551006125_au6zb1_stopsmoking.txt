I need help!!

Hi guys. I'm recently single again and I need to stop smoking! I've tried so many times over the years and noting seems to work for me. I smoke around 15 to 20 a day and I've recently gone to the doctor who prescribed me Champex which I got some bad side effects from so I had to stop. I really wanted it to work for me and I'm devastated it didn't.

I feel like I smoke out of boredom and habit. If I'm bored I'll smoke, when I wake up in the morning I'll have a smoke while I wait for the kettle to boil for my coffee. I hate smoking but I can't seem to stop. I need to get fit again and take control of my life but I'm finding if very hard especially with having alot more extra time being single I find myself bored alot more.

Can anyone who's been in a similar situation as morning please give me some advice as to what you did to help you quit?

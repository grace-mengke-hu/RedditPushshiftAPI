Oops! missed my 300 days mark - and that's kind of the point

So, I just discovered, that I missed my 300 day mark of beeing smoke free. That was only possible, because I usually don't think about smoking anymore, not even when friends are going outside for a cigarette. Basically the only time I think about that I once smoked is, when I'm waiting at the checkout line in the grocery store and somebody else grabs a pack right next to me.

What is probably more interesting for most of you quitters or about to be quitters, though, is my personal **timeline of quitting**.

**The beginning:** The fist 2 days were easier than I thought. I made sure I started on a friday, so I could look forward to the weekend. Because I used to smoke a lot at work. I also smoked 2 packs on thursday, more than 3 times I would smoke daily, so smoking on friday was a real turnoff. And on monday the physical withdrawal was indeed over, just as planned. I felt kind a dizzy during that time because of nicotine withdrawal. And I didn't know what to do with my hands. Tip: Try to find things to do.

**The next two weeks** were kinda hard. Especially at work. The habit really didn't want to break. But I made it because of this thought: Any craving only lasts for up to 3 minutes, usually less. If you keep that in your head you can keep beating the craving. Also, no stinking cloths anymore is seriously underrated.

**The first three months:** The habit was relly hard to break. Over time the cravings got a bit easier, but were still there multiple times a day. Also the dreams about me smoking again started. But every time I woke up I was relly glad I didn't smoke again. The bad news: I gained at least 10 Kilos in these three months. What really helped me during that time was the following: I once quit for about 5 weeks. I started again and I felt physically sick after the first cigarette. So I reminded myself, that the next cigartette I would be smoking would be no fun, but make me feel really bad and sick.

**Around day 50:** I became frustrated, because the health benefits didn't really start to kick in. But around day 50 I finally felt better. The problems to concentrate started to vanish and climbing stairs became easier.

**About day 100:** The habit was mostly beaten. Cravings were still there, but not daly. I would say one craving about every three days. I finally started sleeping better. But still was reminded of smoking everywhere. I was not save yet, especially when friends were smoking, who I knew would give me a cigarette.

**Around day 200:** It was done. Around day 200 cravings were completely gone and I kinda stopped thinking about smoking at all.

**Day 306:** Here we are. And it's a good place. Now it's time to start losing weight...

I hope that helps someone. At least for me reading success stories in this subreddit was a good and motivating thing. And now I'm in the fortunate situation to give back.

Stopping to smoke is harder for me than when I dropped my coke habit

Not even joking. Stopped doing coke cold turkey and its fine. Stopped smoking cold turkey and the urge to smoke is overwhelming. Its just so hardwired to moments like taking a break from work, sitting down with a friend for a talk, amazing with alcohol, after sex... It really doesn't help that where I live you can smoke in most bars and clubs.
Two months now and fuck it if I break.

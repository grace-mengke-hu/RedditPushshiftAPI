After a relapse yesterday, I decided to try something new and finally read Alan Carr's book. It completely changed my perception of quitting.

Whenever I used to get a craving, I thought “*I* need a smoke. Me, the person, wants and needs a cigarette". now I see it completely differently. It isn’t me that wants one, it’s the addiction. The little black ball of evil thats got its tendrils all through my body. I read about half the book before heading to work without my pack, and I got a craving or two. The best part is, I didn’t feel like I was suffering. I didn’t go “Man, I really want a cigarette, it’ll make me feel better”. I saw it for what it is. The addiction monster rearing its head.

It’s been less than a day, but it feels entirely different to when I’ve tried before. It used to be all about *resisting* my own cravings, and with that comes the expectation of suffering, When I get cravings now, I laugh. I laugh because that little black blob is suffering, not me. It’s throwing a tantrum because it wants a smoke, not because *I* want one. Ignoring these cravings felt like I was taking the addiction and squishing it under my boot, and I enjoyed it.

I'll definitely proceed with caution through this first week, but I'm exceedingly confident, and actually look forward to ignoring my cravings.

This monster will die, and good riddance to it.

Day one

Right, I'm getting sick of this smoking/stop smoking business. If you wanna smoke, just smoke, otherwise just stop (my mentality towards this). No point beating around the bush with ecigs etc. Rid yourself with the nicotine and man the fuck up. Nothing is impossible if you put you mind to it and that's all this is. Yes my mind will play tricks on me but you know what, my mind always plays tricks on me and I think I'm used it. Some days I feel like crap, other days I feel like I'm king. Maybe it's the chemical imbalances caused by smoking. Who's knows.. 

Also, come Monday. I will be starting my bulk. Time to get shredded. 

Right, I'm going to go make some tea.

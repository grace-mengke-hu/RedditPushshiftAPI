Just gave away all my vapes and juices...here goes (tips / advice ?)

Gave away all my vape stuff. 
The nicotine was making me so anxious and ... feeling like utter crap. For a long time. But I decided now was a good time to quit it. This shit was making me weaker, more anxious, less stable, and constant fast heart. 
Can’t believe I believed it relaxed me... it never did. 
Literally was addicted to vaping to relieve withdrawal symptoms but at the same time it was making my anxiety fucking terrible. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. 
I’m also quitting caffeine after tomorrow. I expect to feel like crap for a minimum of 1 month after quitting both. But am tired of addiction and the lack of stability mentally or energetically. Just tired of it. 
At least my sobriety will be a victory for each day I make it. Not planning on counting the days... just plan on taking it 1 day at a time and know that things will get better eventually. 
Any tips from those who were successful in stopping tobacco and then switching to vape and then stopping vaping?

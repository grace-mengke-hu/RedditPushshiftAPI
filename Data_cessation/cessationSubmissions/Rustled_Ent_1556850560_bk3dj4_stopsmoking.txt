So nervous I made myself sick

I picked tonight after work as my quit day so I can suffer through work tomorrow and have the weekend to bang my head against the wall and try out a few coping tactics. I wish it weren't going to be so rainy... Welp, 9PM came and I gave myself another hour because I was anxious and didn't feel ready to lay down and face this. 10 got closer and closer and I vaped and vaped and vaped non stop afraid to say this is it. I vaped so much so fast I had to run to the bathroom violently nauseous. Heartburn from dinner didn't help matters much. I'm so miserably sick of this addiction that it's pushed me deeper into the depression I'm already dealing with. I've got a plan, though it's going to take some serious willpower to stick to it. Living with another smoker isn't going to help, but I'll be largely alone for day one. And I can put on my rain gear and get out for day two and three. I'm venting for the sake of it. Wish me luck, and keep on keeping on you beautiful bastards.

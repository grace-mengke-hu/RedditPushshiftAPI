Hi, I am a non smoker, and have some questions.

How addicting is smoking? And how can people break this addiction?

Today I was at the doctor, to get some eyedrops, and saw a man asking for liquid medicine, as he had recently had a stroke, and could nolonger eat solids. He then went outside and when I left, I saw him smoking.

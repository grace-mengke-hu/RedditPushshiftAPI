I stopped smoking 9 days and 17 hours ago...feeling uneasy

Hi everyone. I finally decided to join this forum today, looking for support. I've been smoke free for almost ten days, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. That being said, it's a hard decision, and I have had a pretty difficult time over the past several days. I need to remember that I'm better than smoking, but it was such a huge part of my day for ten years, it's hard to let it go. It doesn't even seem to be the uncontrollable cravings that are getting me. It's more that my brain is fixated on smoking, and I find it incredibly difficult to change the "mental" subject.

I've tried to replace smoking with exercise, healthier foods, and golf (whoops - good excuse to play more), but I still can't seem to let my mind forget about smoking. Any mental tips on how to suppress these urges? Do they go away any time soon?

I'm committed to making this work, I would just like to give myself a few more tools. Thank you.

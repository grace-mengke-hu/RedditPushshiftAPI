Faced my greatest challenge so far, resisted

I spent a weekend in Berlin, where it's allowed to smoke inside bars. It crossed my mind to bum a cigarette, but I gave it a good thought with the conclusion that the stench is bad enough with all the people around me smoking, I don't want to inhale it any more than that. When I got back to my hotel, the smell was in my hair and the first thing I did was go and have a good shower. I can't believe I used to stink like that all the time.

Guys, I used to be all disgusting when I smoked, I'm so glad to be a non-smoker.

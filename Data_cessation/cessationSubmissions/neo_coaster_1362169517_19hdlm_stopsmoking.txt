Chantix and bupropin quitting play by play

I thought others might be interested in reading a day by day look at how chantix works so here it goes.

Its day one, I've just taken the starter .5 mg dose and I've already smoked 6 cigarettes.

 I also take bupropin (aka zyban or wellbutrin) 150 mg xr for depression but have found that it doesnt help me stop smoking.

Ill update with more tomorrow or if there's any notable changes.

Day 1 is going awesome

I had quit smoking for almost 10 years, and during a really traumatic event last May I started again. So ridiculous. So last night at 10 I smashed up the rest of my pack and I'm doing my best to power through. I woke up at 6 and took a brisk walk, am drinking tons of water, and in looking through this sub saw some good advice about not eating heavy meals so I'm all prepared to eat 200-250 calorie light meals more frequently throughout the day. Got a lil cranky earlier but let's face it I'm a cranky bitch anyway. 

Good luck, I hope everyone keeps it together today with me!!

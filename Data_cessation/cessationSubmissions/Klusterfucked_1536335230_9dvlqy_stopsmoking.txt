Smoking to cope with mental illness. What are some better alternatives?

So today will be my 3rd attempt to quit smoking. I have 2 cigs left and plan to smoking them up as I write this so I can go ahead and start pushing through this. 

Did anyone else use cigs to cope with depression/anxiety? Did you find anything else that helped you cope with these issues? 

I have severe social anxiety and hardly ever want to leave my house. What are some things I can do indoors that will help me keep my mind off of smoking ? What should I be expecting in the first week? (Sadly never made it further than a few days) but I'm pregnant now and have more motivation than ever to quit. 

Thanks for any help.

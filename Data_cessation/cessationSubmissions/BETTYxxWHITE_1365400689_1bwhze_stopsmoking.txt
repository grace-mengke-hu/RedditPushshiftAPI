What is the best way to quit smoking at work?

I have tried quitting before and I usually do pretty well for a while because I just resist the urge to stop and buy a pack and use my laziness of not wanting to go drive and buy one to my advantage.  This works for a while but when I relapse is after going to work, I work as a server/cook at a restaurant and basically EVERYONE smokes.  The times we get as smoke breaks can be awesome especially on a busy/stressful night.  What is the best way I can get past wanting to smoke on these breaks?

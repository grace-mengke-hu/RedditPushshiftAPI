Coming off patches - what to expect?

So, I still have 5 weeks left on my patches, but I want to be prepared for what happens after I stop using them. 

Has anyone come off them before? I’m worried about my anger getting worse, although I know it will be temporary. I also know that everyone is different, but at least I’d know what’s normal or not hahha. 

Any tips, suggestions and coming off patches stories will be amazing! 

Thanks everyone!

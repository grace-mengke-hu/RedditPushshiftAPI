The myth that nicotine withdrawals are over in 72 hours must be stopped.

There is widespread myth that withdrawals are over 72 hours after your last administration of nicotine. Many people and a surprising number of quit smoking authors perpetuate the myth that since you no longer have nicotine in your body, then the cravings and withdrawals are over.

Not only is this far from the truth but new quitters that are still suffering in their second, third weeks and so on believe there is something wrong with them not being cured by day 4 and if the way they are feeling is the best they will ever fell without smoking relapse.

e temporarily elevated pool of β2*-nACh receptors may explain why the first months of smoking cessation are difficult for many people. The researchers surmise that smokers' larger complement of β2*-nACh receptors indicate that their brains have adapted to nicotine, so normal operation requires high levels of stimulation. When a smoker quits and nicotine no longer floods the brain, the reduced stimulation might disrupt the receptors' regulation of dopamine and other neurochemicals involved in the reinforcing effects of smoking. Dopamine depletion in the reward system has been linked to lethargy, moodiness, and other symptoms seen in smoking cessation. Also, research by Dr. Arthur Brody at the University of California, Los Angeles has associated the α4β2*-nACh receptor—a subset of the β2*-nACh receptors measured by Dr. Staley's team—with craving

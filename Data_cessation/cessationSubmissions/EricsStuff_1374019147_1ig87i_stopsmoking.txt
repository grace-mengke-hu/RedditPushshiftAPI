Help on getting my parents to stop smoking?

Okay. Both my parents are full time smokers. Seriously, they'd smoke for a living if they could. I'm 17 and they've been smoking for as long as I can remember.

I've been making serious efforts talking to them about it. The straight up "Please stop, it's going to kill you" hasn't worked. I constantly try to make sly digs at my dad like when he'd say "we need (whatever) but we can't afford it" I'd say "you could if you stopped smoking.".

I tried logical reasoning. "You're paying thousands of euro per year for something that **will** kill you. Think of all the positive things you could have done with that money instead.". No dice.
I've seriously considered paying for hypnotherapy sessions for them (because I've heard positive testimonials from people I know).

They've tried quitting before; my dad made it for 4 years or so. My mother's max is like 3 weeks.
They're stubborn as hell. Neither seem interested in quitting and just shrug off my efforts. They don't seem to care about the ramifications of smoking: Health, money, time, **my** health, and my sisters' also.

I'm in desperate need of advice because I'm genuinely concerned. I figured this sub was the best place to go to. Please help! Thanks in advance!

Quitted Yesterday

I was smoking my first with 16 years (now im 19 yo). However it was just at a party and I didn't enjoy it. After a while a friend of mine got from Partysmoker to frequently Smoker and that influenced me. At 
Parties when I was drunk I got cigarettes from him. With 18 years I
bought my first Tobacco ("not for smoking, only for mixing with marijuana") this was the first step into a Smokerlife. Half a year later I was done with School and went to the Army. I started to smoke more and more often, however some of you don't think that
3 cigarettes a day is much I realize that slowly my daily amount of cigarettes rises. 
So now (once again) I quit smoking :D

My Tactic: Whenever I want to smoke I eat a chewing Gum (preferably Peppermint) because for me its the complete opposite
thing to Smoking. Its flavour helps me to cool down me desire to smoke. So you might try this too :)

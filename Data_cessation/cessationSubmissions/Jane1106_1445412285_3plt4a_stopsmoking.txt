Stopped smoking for a week... Smoked again today.

I got a pretty strong flu last week, so i decided to stop it for good, but today was a very though day for me, it's been 8 years since my dad passed away, and it was a pretty shitty day in general... And i smoked again, and now i feel even worse 'cause i believed it would be easier =(

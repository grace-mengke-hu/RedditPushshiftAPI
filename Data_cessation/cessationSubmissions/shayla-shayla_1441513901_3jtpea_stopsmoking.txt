3 years!

I quit cold turkey 3 years ago when I decided to start getting fit. I was lucky that I soon started dating a guy who doesn't smoke and never has, so it was much easier to quit. In that 3 years I have only had one puff of a smoke and it was really gross, not enjoyable at all. 

Unfortunately, the country I live in still allows smoking in bars and clubs, so I still have to be around it a lot. 

Three years in I am SO SO SO happy that I quit, I feel really grossed out by the waste of money, the smell, the need. 

The only wierd thing is that I still get cravings sometimes. It used to be much more often, but now it's like once every few months now. 

Just wanted to share my experience!

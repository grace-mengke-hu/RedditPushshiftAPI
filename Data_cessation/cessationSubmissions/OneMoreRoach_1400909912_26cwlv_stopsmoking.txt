I finally have a reason

Okay maybe more than one. I'm tired of my fingers and nails being stained, I'm tired of not smelling spring when it comes, I'm tired of smelling horrible and being unaware, but most of all, I have to buy a car this weekend and I need my cigarette money to go to my new car payment. I've wanted to quit for a while now, hopefully this time sticks.

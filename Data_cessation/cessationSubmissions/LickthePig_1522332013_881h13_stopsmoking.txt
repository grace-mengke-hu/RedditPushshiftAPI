How long did it take for motivation and energy to come back to you?

I know this question has prob been asked a bunch of times but talking to people on here and constantly coming back to check for responses is giving me something to do and really helping me get through. I have no motivation or energy to do anything really. I have a bunch of things that need to get done and I feel like ugh I just want to lay in bed, so how long did it take for energy to come back to you?

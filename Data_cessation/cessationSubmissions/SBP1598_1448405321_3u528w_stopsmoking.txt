Clearing Out Lungs: Time Frame?

I quit smoking cold turkey 34 days ago as of now.  Aside from one person smoking near me outdoors a couple of times, I haven't even been around second-hand smoke.

That said, I'm still waking up in the morning with phlegm that needs clearing from my throat, and there will occasionally be greyish bits in it like when I was smoking.  The phlegm is certainly reduced from before, but I'm wondering when I can expect my throat and lungs to be "cleaned out."  

Additionally, how long before I can exhale sharply without making a wheezing sound?  

Is the above tied into the several months it takes for cilia to regrow?

Thanks, looking forward to others' experiences.

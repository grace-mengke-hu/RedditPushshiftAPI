1 month &amp; 1 week smoke free!

Wahoo! I started exercising this week and I was astonished by how much stamina I actually had. I still have a ways to go, but it felt good to be able to run. I can also sing again! 

I have had bad breath the last week or so though, any insights on if that will clear up or is something unrelated?

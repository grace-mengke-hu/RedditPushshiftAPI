I'm Done!

I had my first smoke when I was 11, I am now about to be 29! It has to end! I'm getting married next summer and want to be around in the future to watch my children grow up! I've tried quitting in the past with no success. I found this subreddit a while ago and tonight is the night. I have officially smoked my last one. I want to do this on my own will power without the use of meds.
Have any of you had success going "Cold Turkey", or am I fighting a losing battle? Any advice is MORE than welcome.

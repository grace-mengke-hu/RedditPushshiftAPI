Benefits of quitting that you don't usually hear about

I quit 5 days ago and I'm noticing some strange things happening that you don't usually hear about. For instance, my fingernails are growing crazy fast now. I actually feel more confident too. Like I can have a conversation more easily than I could before. It's logical really though. I'm less concious of the smell of my breath and clothes, less yellow on my teeth (so I smile more), more energy/enthusiasm, don't get out of breath so easily so I don't stumble over my words. The fingernails thing though? Not so sure.

One negative thing is I feel super tired in the morning. I'd say this is because my body is in mass repair mode which saps my energy. Also I'm probably not used to sleeping so deeply. I hear that smoking affects your sleep quality.

I find paying attention to all the little biological changes that happen and figuring out why they do that is really helpful for me.

Have you guys noticed any effects of quitting that you weren't expecting?

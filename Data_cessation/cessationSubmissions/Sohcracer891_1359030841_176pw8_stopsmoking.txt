Quit Yesterday! 

I smoked my last one last night at about 10:30 pm. For a little background, I have smoked for about 6 years (roughly a pack a day give or take). In the beginning, I started out on some cloves just for fun(big mistake), and that eventually turned into a pack a day of the real thing. I am in my late twenties and overweight. I enjoy mountain biking, kayaking, and all sorts of other stuff, but getting out on the trails and running out of steam in 30 minutes is no fun. I cant wait to get to feeling better and stronger so that I can do the things I love (and hopefully be able to do them for more than 30 minutes so I can drop some weight as well)

I love reading all of your stories, they are so motivating(most of the time, lol)

Also, this is not a standalone thing either. I am going for a whole life change. I am very happy the way I am, but I think its time to make things better, elevate myself as they say. I am not upset because I smoke, I just like smoking. I am not unhappy that I'm overweight, I just love food and most of the time not the best ones. And finally, I make a good living and have always put a little aside for later, but I'm going to be taking care of the financial side of things to make everything that much better. I guess this is what they call "growing up".

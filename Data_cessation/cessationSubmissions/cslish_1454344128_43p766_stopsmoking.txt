Going outside

Hi Quitters, 

Today is quit day  for me and it is going quite well. Cravings aren't bad, and emotions are in check.  Reminding myself that I am a non-smoker is working well. (Thanks Alan Carr)

Although, the thing I am really missing is getting up from my desk and going outside.  I generally like being outside, and going outside for a break from work, but I am fearful that going outside will be a trigger that I won't be able to handle.  

Anyone else in the same boat, and how did you overcome this?

Hi lovers. I'm about 25 days in cold turkey really doing great. (Millionth "attempt" + premature reality check) Just celebrating THIS reality: had a huge huge emotional PMS and alcohol induced fight with my boyfriend last night. Never even thought that stupid, destructive thought of smoking. Never even came into my mind and we had been out at a bar drinking! Winning!!! Haha :) keep it up this can be you in 25 days or ANY DAY

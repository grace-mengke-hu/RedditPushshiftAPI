diminished sense of smell after quitting

So I've quit smoking for a couple of months now.  I feel a lot better but I've noticed I still can't smell things half as well as some friends.  I work in a hospital and it has to be pretty strong before I notice.  So could it be a permanent loss or how long should it take?

Quitting during a stressful time?

Hello! I guess im just looking for advice here.

So i want to quit smoking. I want to so fucking badly. I went 1 day without a cigarette and cracked and bought a pack on day 2.

Initally i wanted to be smoke free by the time i start studying again. But it seems im finding it extremely difficult to quit while im just at home doing nothing. Im trying so hard to keep myself busy and in fact its been getting better since ive quit weed as well. But i still crave a cig.

So now ive convinced myself its impossible to quit while i have nothing going on. I genuinely feel it would be easier to just quit when university starts so ill be better distracted and have more to do. But another part of me feels like this is just "junkie talk" trying to rationalise my smoking habits. 

So i dont know. Should i wait for a better time when i have more to do or would it be more difficult with the added stress of study and its better to quit sooner rather than later??

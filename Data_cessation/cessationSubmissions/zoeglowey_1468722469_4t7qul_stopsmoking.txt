Is it hard to quit if you're a new smoker?

I recently started dating a smoker, and he probably goes through almost a pack a day. I smoke with him because I enjoy the nicotine high, but I've started buying my own. Will quitting be as hard for me as it would be for a regular smoker or would this be a good time to knock it off? I have only been seeing him for about a month now.

Ranty rant

i had a tooth pulled yesterday. i'm not supposed to smoke for a week and i totally get \*why\*. but it was like...hey! we aren't going to tell you this until 5 minutes before you have your tooth pulled -- but you gotta quit smoking now. Right now. Or else you will have extensive issues with your dental surgery.

OK jerks at the dental office: that's easier said than done. You just can't turn this addiction on and off. Geez if I could I would. I told them I smoked. People just don't understand addiction. Even if they have a bazillion letters after their name and go to high-end universities. Health experts, my a@@.

I probably smoked like 5 in the past 36 hours, which is better than 30.

I've decided that I'm not going to bother with quitting counters and all of that. I'm just going one day at a time, an hour at a time, or a minute at a time. If I feel like figuring out how many days I have quit I'll figure it out myself.

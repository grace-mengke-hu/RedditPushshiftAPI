Golf and smoking

So last time I tried to quit (and failed) I failed as soon as I set foot on a golf course... I play at least twice a week and it has become synonymous with smoking.. 

Anyway so I quit again last Sunday.. and so far so good I guess..

I've got rounds planned for Friday, Sat and Sunday and sadly play with others who smoke. 

Anyway I played 9 holes on Wednesday and 11 on Thursday and that went ok. Usual cravings but manageable. So I guess this week end will be a big test. But I'm quietly confident. Thought I'd share.

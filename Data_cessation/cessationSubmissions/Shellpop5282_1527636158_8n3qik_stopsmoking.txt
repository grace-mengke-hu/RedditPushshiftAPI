Vaping not doing the trick

It has been three days and I am finding myself craving an actually cigarette. The vape is much smoother and less harsh but for some reason I have this overwhelming urge to inhale real smoke, the gross toxic smoke. What is wrong with me? I have had this problem in the past when I've quit  just craving the nastiness of smoke. I would substitute with weed or even a cigar. Anyone else ever had this problem? I know i need to do it but smoking from a box shaped thing is just not the same.

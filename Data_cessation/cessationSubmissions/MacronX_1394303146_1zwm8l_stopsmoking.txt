12 hours without a cigarette after being a heavy smoker for some time. Just thought I'd say hi to you all!

So yeah, title explains it all. I've been smoking for many years and recently found myself smoking 20+ a day. I was starting to get out of breath just walking up hills and finally got fed up with it. I had my last cig at 5:30am and it's now nearly 6:30pm here in the UK. I just went for a long power walk to take my mind off things and picked up the new South Park game while I was out :) I'm finding it really hard right now and can't stop thinking about having a smoke. Any words of encouragement, tips or general advice would be much appreciated. I plan to spend the evening playing my new game and trying to relax. It would be easier if I didn't live right next door to a corner shop full if cigarettes lol, I can't wait for it to close...

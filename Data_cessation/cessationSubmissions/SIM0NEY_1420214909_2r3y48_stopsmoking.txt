Quitting today... Not yesterday.

Reading the title you are probably assuming that I had a new years resolution and broke it quickly. This is not the case. I have never been big on new years resolutions. The road to smoking related death is paved with broken new years resolutions. No, I have a much bigger milestone on which I am basing this latest **and final attempt**.

Today is my human cake day, but it isn't just a normal cake day that happens once a year. Today, my twenties are officially in my rear view. As of midnight last night, I am a 30 year old man. As of midnight last night I had smoked like last cigarette.

30 years from now, I want to be able to look back on my life, and say that I quit smoking in my twenties, and never smoked again. I know this is how it has to be if I'm going to improve my health.

I have experimented on myself before and went nicotine free for long bouts of time (6 months at the longest before), and didn't call it quitting, because I was conducting experiments. Can I purge myself of physical cravings, and then transition into a social smoker, someone who only smokes on weekends when having drinks with friends? I have learned from these experiments that I will never be that person, and that's okay.

So this is the way it must be, and I am looking forward to feeling much better physically in my 30s than I did my 20s. 

I may be a prick on here in the future. 

I may need to vent on here. 

I may need someone to tell me to quit my bitching, but I will not break. I smoked in my twenties, and that's over now. 


**EDIT** If you do actually go through the effort to read through my proclamation here, thank you for that. I really do appreciate it.

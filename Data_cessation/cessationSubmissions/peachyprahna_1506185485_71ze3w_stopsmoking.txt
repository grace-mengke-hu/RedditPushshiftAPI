Conflicting thoughts

Hey guys, I've been lurking on here for some time now. The positivity and encouragement from everyone is so incredibly uplifting, so shout out to all of you warriors! 

&amp;without further ado let me share my story..I've been dabbling and seriously contemplating the idea of quitting for the past few months. The will and the drive to succeed are strong, but something is holding me back each time I get through however many hours without nicotine. Have read Carr several times &amp; implemented knowledge from whyquit.com on the addict brain. And yet, primal instinct is overriding this armour of information somehow. I struggle with anxiety esp the social kind and the only plausible explanation would be that my brain still views this false coping mechanism as a crutch, as a simple and quick fix despite it doing the opposite...it's honestly so belittling and such a waste of energy feeling bad about each smoke I have. 

Just wondering if any of you have had a similar experience or some insight into how to get through &amp; lead a happy smoke free life in general?

I am in a weird situation, please explain.

I've been smoking for last 3 years, but I don't think I ever felt addicted. I never felt the urge to physically go and smoke. 

Sometimes I smoke 2 packs a week, some times I don't smoke completely for a week, but most of the time I usually have 3-4 cigarettes a day. 

Whenever I stopped smoking for a while I never felt any of the "withdrawal" symptoms, I would just kind of forget about it. I never tried to quit smoking. I also never have an urge to go smoke, it's more like "I could smoke one right now, I have the time" or "Out of cigs, hmm, too lazy to go to the store, I'll buy new pack tomorrow after work". 

Basically I want to know what it feels like when you want to go have a cigarette, and what withdrawal feels like, and how long after you quit it to start feeling withdrawal.

Difficulty getting a deep breath after quitting?

Hi all,

I am off cigarettes 27 days now. After about 3 weeks off them I started to develop trouble catching a deep breath. I used to smoke 10-14 a day, using a vape now but finding myself less reliant on it. 

Does anyone know if this trouble of catching a deep breath goes away or whats causing it? Anyone else have experience with it? 

I've been actually okay otherwise being off the cigs, the vape helps, but this is very uncomfortable.

Anyone have any knowledge of this?

Thank you!

Edit: Since the people in this thread stated the vape might be to cause, I have changed the vape liquid to a 50/50 PG/VG base now and have seen a noticeable improvement in my breathing thankfully. So I guess it's the PG stuff that clogs my breathing. Thanks to everyone for their help its much appreciated! Hopefully if I lower the PG even more the breathing will get even better.

Almost 4 days!

In 4 hours, it will officially be 4 days. I'm hanging in there but omg sometimes the cravings are so strong. Every so often the though crosses my mind that tomorrow I could go buy a pack and enjoy my old habit. Then I remind myself that I don't do that anymore. Tell me these mind tricks stop eventually? I am so sick of it already but I know I will not smoke today.

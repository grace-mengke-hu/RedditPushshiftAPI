Help me never start again

I really never smoked (only a rare cigar with friends) but now that Im feeling shitty, college isnt all its cracked up to be, I cant do shit right, and I cant stop thinking about how much I suck due to my ADD. Whenever I go through a rough patch for some reason I will get an urge to go out and smoke. 

I know every single reason why its stupid and a worthless habit yet whenever Im down I just want a cigarette (funny enough I've never even smoked a whole cigarette in my life). 

Please I need some reinforcement to stop me from buying a pack of American Spirits in my spot of depression. 

I know I dont need this yet the urge exists.

It's my turn! Today Cold Turkey!

This is like the whatever time it is I'm going to stop smoking but in the first attempts I wasn't part of a community where I can share how I feel and how are the best way to deal with the process. 

I'm 29 M and it was hard for me to stop it because I'm not a hard smoker, just like 4 cigarettes a day so in my mind I was like "Why quit if I'm not a hardcore?" So I kept smoking and smoking and in the weekends I noticed how much I smoked everytime I went to a reunion or party, tons of it. It was a shitty feeling the day after with the mouth destroyed and the smell in all my clothes that make me feel angry with myself. So I don't want to do things and then regret it, I want to reach freedom with my body and mind so here I am in my last attempt. Yesterday at night I smoked the last cigarette. 

IF YOU HAVE any tips of how to deal with the struggles, would me awesome, let's the count begins!

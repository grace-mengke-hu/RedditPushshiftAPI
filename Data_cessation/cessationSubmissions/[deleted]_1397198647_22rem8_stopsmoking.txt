I'm not going to reset my badge...

The other night I had half of a cigarette. It made me sick for 20 hours, no joke. I felt like I was going to vomit, and actually fell down and almost passed out. The next day my mouth tasted like I had vomited (I'm willing to bet it also had something to do with the blood vessels constricting or somehting)... Anyways. I still crave cigarettes every day, multiple times a day. I thought I would enjoy it. I was stressed. 


It has only further cemented the fact that there is no choice but for me to live smoke free.

It was fucking disgusting and I still don't feel 100% some days later. I had a violent reaction to it, and I'm glad. I know now that the cravings are here to stay, but there is no "answer." Smoking won't actually feel good.

I don't regret it, and I'm not going to change my badge since that is the day I quit being a smoker. 

I'm only sharing in case you decide to try one more 6 weeks later, I sinderely hope it makes you as sick as it made me! I would have **never** expected this reaction. I smoked a pack a day for 8 years and it felt AWFUL. 

In case anyone wonders, I had 5 cigs left from my last pack 6 weeks ago. They have since been thrown out and destroyed. 

No more reservations. 

Take it from me guys, there is no "one last one." It won't do the trick anymore.

How long did your withdrawals last?

This is not my first time to start quitting. I have been smoking for 2 years and I stopped for a couple months before the first year mark. I came back a few months ago. Now I am at the 7th day of being smoke-free.

I remember my withdrawals were bad but for the nicotine to get out of my system.. my lungs hurt and I coughed too much phlegm. Every cough was a struggle. The duration of getting sick was around 2 months but if I remember correctly.. quitting smoking wasn't the only factor.

I moved to a new country and it was autumn when I started getting sick. The second day I went to this place I was sick and I think it's because of the new place too. After a week of getting well.. I got sick again. It might be kind of stupid to say this but compared to my first sickness I knew this was my lungs cleaning the shit out(maybe again since I was coughy too the first time and new place might not be the only reason) because it hurts so much compared to the first time I got sick. The phlegm was so bad.

So to you quitters how long did this natural cleaning of your lungs last? Did you get sick too like so bad? Was my natural process of removing nicotine unusual?

I have been reading about quitting smoking and opinions are much appreciated.

Thank you! :)

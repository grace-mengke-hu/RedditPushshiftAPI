My predicament.

I'll start off with a little background. I graduated HS in '11 and since then I've gone from 205 pounds to about 172. I've always wanted a better body, and now that the weight is gone, all I need to do is get in shape. I want to quit because I can tell after 3.5 years it's starting to take its toll on my breathing and because I've never been this close to looking the way I've always wanted too. The biggest problem for me is that I just really really like the act of smoking (oral fixation kind of thing). I've tried the e-cigs and they don't do it for me. I was wondering if anyone had the same problem as me, and if so, how you overcame/suppressed it?

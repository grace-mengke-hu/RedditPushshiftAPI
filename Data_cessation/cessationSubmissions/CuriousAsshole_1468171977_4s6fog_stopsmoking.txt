I honestly like the confidence boost it gives me

So I've been a smoker for a good 7 years and I stopped smoking completely some 4 years ago. I was a chain smoker, like 2 packs a day in the last months leading to me completely stooping. So in the last four years I had maybe several smokes (less than 5 cigs), you know "to see if Ill get hooked", which I didnt.

But! something happened like 4 months ago when I suddenly started smoking when going out, when alcohol is in the picture something comes over me and I simply enjoy it very much. In the beginning I hated myself for doing it and later (by now) I simply dismiss it as whatever makes me happy. I just like the confidence boost it gives me while I am talking or flirting with people.

So what I am trying to see here is if anyone else experiences anything similar? And if so how do you substitute and not use cigarettes as your weapon?

**I should emphasize that during the workdays when Im sober I have no need whatsoever to smoke one...

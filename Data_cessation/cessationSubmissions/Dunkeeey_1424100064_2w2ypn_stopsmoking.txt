17 years old and wants to quit

I've only been smoking for 4 months. 3-4 packs a week. 

Before I begun smoking, I was smoking hookah/shisha for a year.

My girlfriend broke up with me recently etc and I dont want to drown my sorrows in cigarettes. 

I have a pack left and I think I will finish the pack and then quit it forever.

Could you guys give me some tips?

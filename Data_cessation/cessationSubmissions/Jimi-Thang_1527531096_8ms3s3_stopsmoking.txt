Thoughts on Vaping to Quit Smoking

I started smoking at 12 or 13, and by 16, I was smoking a pack a day. I continued smoking into my 30’s. I just turned 34 and am about to celebrate my first year of being cigarette in over 20 years. I have done this by using a vape, so I am still using nicotine. I am personally OK with that. 

For me, vaping was the only method of quitting that worked. I tried prescription medication, patches, gum, and cold turkey. I know it’s not for everyone, but it does work for a lot of people.

My reason for this post was that I’m curious as to how others few vaping as a smoking cessation tool. Is it viewed as another tool in the arsenal or as cheating aka replacing the addiction with another?

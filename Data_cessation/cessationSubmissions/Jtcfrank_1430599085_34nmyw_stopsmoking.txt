Sorry have to vent! Need help

My mom and dad were hospitalized with in 2 days of each other  and in 2 different hospitals.  For a week I spent my time in between both. I got my mom home first the other night and she couldn't spend the night alone so I spent the night with her so I could help her.  Then I got my dad home yesterday,   while my twin sister was sick also. I understand that she couldn't help, but today my first day being off. my sister felt better today so she she went out and partied while I helped my parents and cooked them dinner. I'm at my wits end. I really want to smoke.  Can't deal with it anymore. Need help!

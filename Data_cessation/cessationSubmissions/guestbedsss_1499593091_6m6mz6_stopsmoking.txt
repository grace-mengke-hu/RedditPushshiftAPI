quitting smoking is easy, i do it all the time

i've had some pretty successful periods of quitting smoking after 16 years as a heavy smoker (half my life) however - i have a habit of getting myself into , and out of very dramatic relationships

and every time i go through a break up i start smoking again 

one time i quit for an entire year and thought i was done for good but then bam
breakup - smoking again 

i think i start as a way to deal with the stress and also as a way find some pleasure in life - i hate eating and have had an eating disorder and dislike most of the normal shit that people indulge in - so smoking has always been a good way to treat myself and to do something that is 'just for me' because i enjoy it so much 

anyway i'm trying to not do that this time 

i've been quit for 4 weeks and this is day 1 of post breakup quit - and it's proving very difficult 

so i guess i'm writing this post because i feel like stating my intentions publicly will help and that admitting my weakness publicly will help 

i intend to do all i can to not start smoking again during this stressful and emotional time 

i'd definitely appreciate any tips or solidarity 

thanks friends

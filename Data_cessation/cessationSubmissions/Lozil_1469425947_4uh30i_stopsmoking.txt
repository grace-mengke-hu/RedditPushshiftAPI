4 Months today

After ~10 Years of smoking managed to quit on 10+ Cig a day habit. Completed 4 months of being smoke free. It was hard for some time, but now I feel it's totally worth it. I Feel fresh,Have more time, Much less irritations, Smell far better too. Special thanks to my wife for bearing with me listening to my rant for the initial week.

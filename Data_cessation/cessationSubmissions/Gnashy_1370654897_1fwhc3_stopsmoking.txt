Today I smelled cigarette smoke

and it did not smell good to me.  This is the first time that's happened since I quit, and it made me feel pretty awesome.  

Quitting smoking has its rough moments, but it definitely has some great ones too, and those are the ones it's really good to focus on.  I love it when I get to feel really excited about things like this.

222 days!

My girlfriend and I were hanging out in the backyard last night and i was reminded of our relationship with each other (and the backyard) when we used to smoke. It was less than 7 months ago, but it feels like forever! 

We used to sit in the backyard and chain-smoke for HOURS. We would also drink a ton out there, working our way through an entire pack of smokes and most of a 12 pack of beer in less than 2 hours.  I look back on it, and I can't believe we did that to ourselves.  It was nice to hang out and talk, but we were killing ourselves.  

Two weeks ago, we got back from a 3 day, 30 mile hike thorough some fairly high elevation and very rugged terrain.   We never would have been able to do that while smoking.   

Taking care of your health the best you can is a great gift you can give your partner and family.  For people who are just starting: its totally worth it.

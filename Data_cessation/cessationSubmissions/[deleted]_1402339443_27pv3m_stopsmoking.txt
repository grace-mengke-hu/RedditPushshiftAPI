It's been over 6 weeks since I've quit, still really tired.

I find that I get exhausted very easily still, it's to the point of being completely debilitating. Like, I wake up in the morning sometimes and I just can't get moving, especially if I've been busy the day before. It's been 48 days since I've quit and I stopped taking Champix 46 days ago.


Has anyone else experienced this kind of problem, this long after quitting?

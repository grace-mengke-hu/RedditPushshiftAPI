I'm under so much stress

Without using you guys as a therapist, I just want to say I'm hitting my biggest stumbling block in almost 90 days. I'm almost in tears I'm under so much stress right now, and its bringing back my cravings for cigarettes. Send some support my way? Share a relatable story maybe?

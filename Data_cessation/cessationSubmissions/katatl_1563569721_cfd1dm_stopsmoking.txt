One week!!!!

No juul or cigarettes for one week. Wow. Longest I’ve gone without smoking something in like 8 years. I’ve tried to quit so many times with gum or patches or programs or apps and it never worked. Someone in another community recommended going to a steam room every day for the first week of quitting and that’s what I’ve been doing at my gym - it has worked amazingly. Good luck to all of ya!

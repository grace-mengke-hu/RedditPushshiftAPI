Trigger help

Yesterday was day 1 and I found all sorts of triggers! I slipped up at the end of the night. My toughest trigger by far is being tired. At the end of a long night at work I was tired and bummed a smoke from a friend I hadn't seen in a while. (There's a pile of triggers there anyways) but how do I get deal with the tired trigger? Of course being well rested and hydrated and just general preparedness but I think being tired is going to happen so I could use any tips you all have! 
I really appreciate it! Everyone posting their badges has made me so envious! It really really helps when I'm having a super cranky moment, so thank you all!!

Spent the last 10 years “quitting”

25 year old smoker and dipper here for ~10 years and going strong.

I quit both when I was about 19 and went 2 years without dip and 1 year without cigarettes. When I did this, I had a low stress job working in the AC. First day in the oil field I had a dip and a cigarette and I really haven’t “quit” since after many many attempts. 

I don’t have cravings for them whenever I’m at home, just when I’m working or drinking. Drinking I can control, but idk how to quit these nasty habits out here in the field, being surrounded by it all the time.

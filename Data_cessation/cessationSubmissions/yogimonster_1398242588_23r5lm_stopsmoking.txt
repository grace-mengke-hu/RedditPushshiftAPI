Help with not smoking in environments that you usually smoke in?

So I hadn't planned on quitting (still not sure if I'm ready too) but I've spent this weekend at my parents house and I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days.  These past 3 days I haven't had any cravings or head aches or moodiness or anything that happens when people quit.  

I don't really understand why this is because I've been smoking for 7 years anywhere from 5 smokes to a pack a day just depending on the day.  I've tried to quit before and I have always had the annoying withdraws that everyone has.

I think whats different about this time is that I haven't been out with my friends, gone to a bar, or even been around anyone smoking for these 3 days.  I flying back to where I live tomorrow so I'll be around cigarettes again and I know that as soon as one is offered to me or if i'm just around one that I'm going to smoke.

I don't think I'm going to try to quit right now but I do want to start smoking less.  Like down to 1 pack a week before I quit for reals.  So what helps you guess not smoke in social smoking situations?

TL/DR: How do I not smoke in social situations?

I'm real mad...

I'm really mad because I was a slave to a drug. I'm mad at the damage it has done to me and I'm mad that I want a cigarette every day. I'm mad that withdrawal has made it hard to sleep, has messed up my moods, and given me anxiety. 

but you know what? I am mostly mad at myself. every time I lit a cigarette I knew what I was doing. sure, it felt good at the time but I realize now how much of a lie that is. it's disgusting, it's poison, it's stupid.

there is always a consequence to the bad shit we choose to do. if quitting and going through some hell for a while is that consequence, then so be it. I deserve it but I do not deserve the toxic waste I keep putting in my lungs. this is a far better consequence to deal with than being 5, 10, 20+ years down the road, gasping for air from COPD, lung cancer, or suffering from another one of the many cancers smoking can cause. strokes, heart attacks, you name it.

anger is helpful. be angry for a while.

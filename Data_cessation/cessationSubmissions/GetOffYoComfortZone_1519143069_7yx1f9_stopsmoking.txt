50 DAYS! I feel so damn proud!

I still can't believe it has been 50 days already. I don't get any cravings or whatsoever now. Whenever I feel stressed, I drink tea and whenever I used to get cravings, I would just drink some cranberry juice. Those things have really helped me. 

Hope to see you guys soon with 100 days mark.
Keep fighting!

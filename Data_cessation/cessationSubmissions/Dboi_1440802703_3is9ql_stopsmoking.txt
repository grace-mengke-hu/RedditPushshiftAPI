Can you feel fine and then all of a sudden feel sick?

Been smoking the equal of ~112 cigs of nicotine a day in the form of ecig juice. .5 ohms @ 18mg @ 3-6+ml a day. For.. over a year, maybe years. Anyway just constantly puffing away never actually taking account into how much I was consuming.

I'm at walmart today. It's been maybe over a week now maybe two. Who really knows everything is just a blur. I can't remember.

I felt bad for a few days for sure. I thought it had gone away. While walking around in walmart I all of a sudden felt full retard. Foggy head, all of a sudden that feeling like a nicotine rush.. wut?! Then I felt shaky and started sweating. I felt actually sick. My knees, legs(hurt), whole body straight from feeling great to feeling like I came down with the flu.

Is this for real? I don't actually have cancer or something?

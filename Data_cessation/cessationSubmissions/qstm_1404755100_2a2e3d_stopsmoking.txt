Really difficult week 2, week three is getting better

I really struggled every single day of the second week, from extreme mood swings and chest pains to trying to convince myself that since I've made it 2 weeks I can have just one even though I know better. Now on to the third week and all of those seem to be subsiding, anyone else struggling stay strong!

Quitting has left a bad taste in my mouth...

...which is good! I woke up this morning and could tell I had morning breath. Gross, sure, but not something I would even notice a week ago when I'm sure it was much worse. It made me feel sorry for my wife and is helping to motivate me to stay the course. I suspect that quitting is going to reveal numerous ways that smoking is unattractive, and highlight why not smoking makes so much sense. It's just one more benefit to keep in mind.

Happy new year everyone!

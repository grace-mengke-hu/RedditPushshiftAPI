Can't run away for habbit

I've stopped smoking for a day and a half already from being pack and half a day to none and now I can't get away from its urges cause I work outside all day so I used to smoke outside. Or that I used to smoke while I drove home or when I came home and went on computer more cigs. Finally every night after I had sex I would smoke but now I can't I want to smoke this habit but Soo much of my life involves it. Last night I slept in my roommates room on his couch. idk how to stop these urges my bed just makes the urges worse.

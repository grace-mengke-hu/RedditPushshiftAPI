A reason you may not have heard to quit...

Hi guys, I'm 8 weeks and a bit in, and I have been sick. For a little backstory, I have been doing /r/C25K and also just started weight training again last week (I think pushing my body a bit hard ight have had something to do with getting sick!)

I got the dreaded man-flu and was laid up in bed from Friday night until Tuesday night. Not a great reason to give up you say?

Well the MASSIVE difference this time was I have had ZERO chest infection/bronchitis, ZERO wheezing (I smoked for 20+ years) and not a cough in sight!

On top of that - I did a 5K this afternoon and followed that up with a weights session AND did an Abs session on top of it! No way known I would have done that as a smoker, let alone AFTER I'd just been sick for days!

People keep asking me if I notice the health benefits, and I tell them it's probably more to do with perspective. Comparing how I feel today to how I felt yesterday is different to how I felt 8 weeks ago, although I can't quite recall what "normal" used to feel like... Until now I hadn't really been able to give definitive feedback on feeling heaps better than before!

Just putting to bed my first day not smoking...

... thinking while I for sure wouldn’t give up my first born for a cigarette maybe I could just lend him out for like 10min to some friendly people for one. 
All joking aside I’m feeling grossly desperate to figure out a way to smoke right this second. All I got left is hoping that what they say is true, and the intense right this second must have feeling... won’t last very long...

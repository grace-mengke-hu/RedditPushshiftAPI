Long, steep, hike

Yesterday I took a very long, steep, hike with my sister. I'm a bit out of shape, and boy was I tired last night, but not once did I gasp for air. My legs are aching, my body spent, but not my lungs. 

When we got off the mountain and I realized this, I was thinking "hm, it must be around 10 months now." So I just checked it, and wouldn't you know, I took a 4 hour, 7 mile, rough terrian hike to a beautiful waterfall on my 10 month anniversary. Hurray! I know a year ago I would have been gasping for air at least half the time. It feels so good to be smoke-free.

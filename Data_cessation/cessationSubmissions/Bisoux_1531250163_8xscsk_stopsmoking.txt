Relapse Restart

I tried to go without the patch on day 4. Completely wrecked me mentally and I nearly had a breakdown. 

I ended up relapsing. Today is a write off. My mind is all over the place and I canâ€™t even think straight let alone resist cravings. 

Tomorrow I will put on a patch and start fresh because I am determined that I will quit.

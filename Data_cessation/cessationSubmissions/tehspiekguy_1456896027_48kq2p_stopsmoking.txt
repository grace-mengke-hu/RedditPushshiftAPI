Not as impressive as a lot of the other threads, but 100 hours since my last smoke!

We've all gotta start somewhere and hopefully I'll be with the year+ crew soon. I've decided to go completely cold turkey. I've tried quitting before via vaping, but I found that it only increased my nicotine intake and when I ran out of fluid, it wasn't long before I went back to the gas station for a pack. More than just the terrible habit, I want to kick the addiction so all nicotine is gone.

I've been sating the oral fixation by chewing on coffee stirrers. My friend at my usual bar gave me a styrofoam cup full of them when I told him that they were helping me quit. So far, so good! Speaking of, that was something that also felt like a huge accomplishment: Going to the bar, socializing, and having a drink without a smoke. I knew if I could get through that, the rest would be doable as well.

I've been telling everyone, even though I'm less than a week in. I don't want to brag or fish for encouragement; rather, I'm doing it to put pressure on myself to succeed. I know if I cave, I've failed and that's not an admission I want to make to anyone. By telling everyone, including you /r/stopsmoking, I'm just increasing the number of people expecting me to get this right. May be a bit narcissistic, but if it works.

I'm also keeping my half pack of remaining cigarettes in my car. In previous attempts I've thrown them out or given them away. In almost every case, that only increases the desire as I find myself focusing on the fact that I can't light one rather than the fact that I don't want to. By keeping them readily available, I can light one any time the desire to smoke overwhelms the desire to quit. That's not happened yet, and I don't think it will.

If any of you veteran quitters have any additional advice or suggestions, or any critiques of my current methods, please let me know. I'm kicking this thing in the ass for realsies this time, wish me luck!

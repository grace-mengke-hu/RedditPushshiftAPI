Using Supplementation (ie Alpha Brain) during Quit

Watup wit it,
When I stop smoking the worst thing for me is my lack of focus and concentration - I feel foggy and disoriented as shit. I stopped 5 days ago and decided to combat the mind fog by using the supplement, Alpha Brain. I've been taking three pills a day. Its been a huge help for my focus and motivation at work - this quit has felt unlike any ive done before. The only difference bw this and others I've done is the Alpha Brain. I'd assume that some of the benefits I'm experiencing are placebo effect, but I'll take any help I can get. One negative effect is that last night I had the most wildly terrifying dream I've ever had. I usually get crazy dreams when I quit smoking but this one was in a class all its own. Anyone else used supplementation to help with a quit?

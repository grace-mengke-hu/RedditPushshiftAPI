Troubles

Just found this subreddit while browsing, looking for tips...

I haven't had a cigarette in 10 weeks, I smoked for 7 years.  I made a conscious decision to quit and stuck with it.  I wasn't having any cravings for a while until recently, stress from life is destroying me and all I can think about is a cigarette, I actually bought a pack yesterday.  I haven't opened it but I really want to, I know it won't but in my head I feel like smoking a cigarette would fix everything.  Any tips on distracting myself from this?

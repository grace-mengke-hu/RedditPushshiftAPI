So I quit 6 days ago... It was far easier than I had anticipated.

I started smoking at AIT (Advanced Individual Training in the Army), and I never thought I would be addicted. It started with one cig a day, as we were only allowed to smoke after 8 pm every day. By the end of AIT, I was chain-smoking 4 cigs every day at that time. I got home, and kept going. I started in November of 2012. I had been smoking for 7 months, and I finally quit on June 19. I went from half a pack a day to 0, cold turkey. If you want to quit cigarettes, all you need to do is hate them. Find a good reason to get them out of your life. Mine was being able to run faster, and not smell like shit. I failed my last run test in the Army, and I figured I could improve marginally by quitting smoking. The results, even after only 6 days, have been amazing. I breathe better, I can smell things, and I can run faster.

TL;DR - To those of you trying to quit, you can do it if you just find some good reasons.

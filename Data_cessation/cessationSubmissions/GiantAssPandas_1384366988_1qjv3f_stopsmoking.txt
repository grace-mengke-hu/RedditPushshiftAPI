Sudden Urge to Quit Smoking. Day 2.

I woke up yesterday and got on Reddit, and somehow stumbled on to this subreddit.  I am a pack a day smoker, and I decided yesterday to quit cold turkey.  To be honest, I have not experienced cravings yet for it.  I have thought about it, but nothing serious.  I have just convinced myself that I DON'T need it anymore.  It is only Day 2, but I WILL stop smoking.

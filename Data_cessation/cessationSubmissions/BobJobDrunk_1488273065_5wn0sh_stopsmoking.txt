Little encouragement to people quitting.

Going to fart out some thoughts of my journey of quitting once and for all.  Here's how I did cold turkey.  If this helps even one person, fuck yeah.  I'll be five years this year and I barely even remember that I smoked, but I'll go down memory lane and share what finally worked for me.  Incoming choppy tidbits:

* When I smoked, I was under the impression that I was screwed.  I had heard that even people who had quit for years still think about smoking every single day.  Bullshit.  That may happen to some people, but don't worry.  Not the case for everyone.

* Be motivated on purpose. Or don't? Quit smoking because it's disgusting, makes you smell bad and is expensive.  Makes you have to take breaks at work over and over.

* Keep your hands busy.  I scoured the internet for cookie recipes and set a goal to make the best cookies that my friends would die for.  So instead of smoking, I baked two or three batches of cookies a night just practicing my technique.  

* I put myself on alcohol probation for six months until I felt confident I wouldn't wrestle with the urge to smoke.  All the money I saved went toward baking cookies.  

* Gingerbread cookies, chocolate chip cookies, double-chocolate chip cookies with bits of toffee.  I even made home made oreos.  I got to a point where I was taking the best part of one recipe and adding it to this other thing you do with this other recipe and had my own thing going.  Quitting smoking was the tastiest time of my life.  Because after your hands were busy making the cookies, you're hands are busy putting them in your mouth.  I'd rather put a cookie in my mouth than a butt.  Tastes better.

* While I was at work and doing stuff that wasn't baking cookies, I would count how many times I thought about smoking.  First few days, too many to count.  After a while it gets to ... you know 20 times ... 15 times ... the strength of those cravings went down and became less frequent.  And the cookies were consistent and amazing.

* After a couple months, I started having days here and there where I didn't think about cigarettes at all.  Sometimes the only reason I thought about them was to ask myself if I thought about them.  

Sorry if this post was stupid.  Totally forgot this subreddit exists and I thought, "What the hell, I'll drop a line here."

It gets better guys.  Have fun with it.  Use the money to go towards a hobbies that keeps you busy.  Draw or something with a pot of earl grey.

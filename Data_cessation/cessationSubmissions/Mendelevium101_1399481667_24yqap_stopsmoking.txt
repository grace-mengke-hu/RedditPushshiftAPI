Slightly different approach

I just wanted to share this book...

Maximum Willpower by Kelly Mcgonogal 

It's a slightly different approach to Alan Carr and gives good understanding on how willpower works and how to increase it. I've found it has some useful, practical tips on making better decisions and may explain why some days are harder when quitting than others. For example, apparently those with low blood sugar are much more likely to make instant gratification decisions, which I didn't know before. This could perhaps explain why many find the hardest day to be 3 or 4 days into quitting - just happens to be a day where you didn't eat as well. 

It also discusses the different parts of the brain who's functions deal with different aspects of willpower. For example, I had wondered often why I find the drive to quit at times, but have trouble sustaining this motivation. Well, apparently there is a specific part of the brain which deals specifically with maintaining long term conviction for future decisions. I guess it sometimes helps to know that there is actually a reason for these 'bad' decisions I often make, rather than simply 'I'm not strong enough'. 

Anyway, hope it helps.

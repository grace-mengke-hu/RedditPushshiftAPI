DAY 3 RAGE - the struggle is real

To my great surprise I manged to walk through the first 2 days without any problems whatsoever. 

On the 3rd day however, all of the symptoms came back with a vengeance to bite me in the ass...

Got into an argument with my wife, wanted to choke my dog, so much anger...

Anyhoo, I had to film my confession straight after a walk and I finally felt better after saying some stuff out loud, definitely recommend as personal therapy! :D

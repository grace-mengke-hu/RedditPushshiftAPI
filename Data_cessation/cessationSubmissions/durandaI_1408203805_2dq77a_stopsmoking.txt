Realized it's been over a week. Don't miss it at all.

That's all. Man, I had to meet my sister at 9 at her hotel in Montmartre. I live about 2 km away from her. I ran, yes ran, the whole way there. Haven't run that much in three years.

When I got there, I was out of breath, but it was awesome that I could do if.


Thanks for the support guys and gals!

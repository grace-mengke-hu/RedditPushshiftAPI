15.10 hours in and all I want to go do is buy a pack

I know this is my crazy brain talking, but right now, after quitting for the past 15.10 hours all I can think of is that I want to go buy a pack and just chain it away.  I am not of course, but the thought keeps coming back.  Drinking water to help.

What is also helping is that it is hotter than 3 shades of hell out there today and I, being pasty white, have no intentions of going out in it.

Un-Subbing....am a nonsmoker

Greetings and happy 2017!

I am un-subscribing but love y'all so much I wanted to offer the "why"

I find myself really only having cravings mostly when I read on here.  I use the word "crave" with license because the cravings have, essentially, stopped. 

It seems I am not a prolific champion like some....I do post the occasional congrats or cheers....but it seems it's time to close this chapter of my life. 

After 24 years and 1 (sometimes 2) packs a day....I am a non-smoker today. 

I am sure I will be the occasional lurkey-loo....

There are so so many thank you so have to some on this sub and mostly I got strength from seeing your numbers in your flare. 

For those who are joining the non-smokers club this New Years....this group is the best. Also get one of the apps (I used quit now pro) 

Thank you all. Thank you in so many ways for just writing on here. 

Hi.....my name is ECU....I am a non-smoker......

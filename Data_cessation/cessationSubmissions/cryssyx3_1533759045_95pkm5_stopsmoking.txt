I want to quit...

so, I'm 28. I've been smoking for about 5 years now, probably about a pack and a half a day. I wake up in the middle of the night to smoke, I smoke 3 and 4 cigarettes back to back. I took Wellbutrin very briefly, and it helped but I started smoking again when I stopped taking them. tried it again and the pills were different and just didn't work the same. when I wake up my throat and chest feel so tight like I'm being choked or something, for a solid half hour. I'm a homemaker of sorts so I've got nothing to do but smoke. and as much as I hate it, I love smoking. 

I have some patches that I got from my doctor. I try one every once in a while, but I get such anxiety thinking about not having cigarettes, especially y'know, "what if." I kicked a drug habit 3Â½ years ago, I know planning for "what if" is just setting myself up for failure.  

I'm at the point, I mentioned to my boyfriend I want a baby, and had the "hey stop being an idiot, get your shit together, and try to be a healthy adult." talk with myself. 

any tips or tricks or advice in dealing with feeling anxious about not having cigarettes?

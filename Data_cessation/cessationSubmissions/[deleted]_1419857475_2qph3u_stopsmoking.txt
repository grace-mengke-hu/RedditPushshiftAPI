Alright, damn it.

Just two days go I posted that I was going to use a personal vaporizer as a means to assist me in quitting. After two days, I've come to the realization that doesn't work. Using the PV when you really want a cigarette only does half the job. So, what happens? I feel unfulfilled, so I light a real cigarette.

The best way to do this is all or nothing. I have no cigarettes or lights in my possession, and I've left my PV at home. I am so f-cking tired of smoking. I'm also tired of making excuses for the continuous relapses.


Edit: words.

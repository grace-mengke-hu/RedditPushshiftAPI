Question for all patch users!

So this is day 2 that I quit smoking and I have been using the patch. After I put it on, the spot that it's under gets EXTREMELY itchy. I don't know if it's a psychological thing because I know I can't scratch it? Did anyone else have this problem? I've been trying to pinch my skin under the patch to help but it won't go away. I just want to make sure I'm not having an unnatural reaction to it. My skin hasn't been irritated or anything when I take it off though. Thanks in advance for your answers!

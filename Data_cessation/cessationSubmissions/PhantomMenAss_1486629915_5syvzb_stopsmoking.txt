Looking for tips

Hey guys I'm looking for any advice on quitting. I've been smoking for a few years now and my attempts to quit haven't paid off. I get a lot of stress at work (70 hour weeks doesn't help me quit) but I really need to stop. My girlfriend has terrible asthma and the smoke on my clothes is enough to make her cough. I owe this girl the world I was a alcoholic living in my car when we started dating and thanks to her I got out of my hometown and went to college to do what I love, I just feel like a failure not being able to do this one little thing to repay her. So any advice or tips you guys have I would love to hear. Thanks so much.

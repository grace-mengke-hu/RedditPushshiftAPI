Android app to alert when is the "time to smoke"?

6 months ago I tried to quit. Without success. My dad keeps telling me: "I quit without using nothing. Only with my willpower".

Nice. But... **I want to quite smoking but I want without the pain of anxiety.**.

I wrote about this [6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/384v5x/generalized_anxiety_disorder_i_want_to_stop/) (some wonderful people replied me), but I still didn't quit.

I just went to a otolaryngologist. I have labyrinthitis and it is worse now because the cigs. 

I was thinking about a program/app, to stop smoking (like weaning a medicament). For example:

Instead of 1 cig each hour, I'll increase (actually the app will do) the time between cigs.

I remember an app about this, but the last time I tried didn't worked on Android.

**The question is: Anyone know a good app to help stop smoking??**

I don't want an app to count cigarettes, I want one to alert me "when is time to smoke".

UPDATE: The app I told was this one - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nochinodigital.smokerreducer but it's outdated (the last update was 5 years ago).

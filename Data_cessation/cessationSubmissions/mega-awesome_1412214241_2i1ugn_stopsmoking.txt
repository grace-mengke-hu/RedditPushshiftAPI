Dealing with the stress trigger

It's been a pretty stressful last few weeks at work. More so then normal.  I find when I leave work every day, I walk out that door, take a deep breath, and realize how badly I want a smoke... to "unwind".  It's not bad enough to make me relapse, but it's always followed by a small sadness that I don't get to have one.

Thoughts?

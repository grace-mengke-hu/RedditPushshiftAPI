Only 4 hours into my bagillionth time trying to quit and ready to give up.

I feel like I have exactly zero willpower.does anyone ever think that maybe if you're just "not ready" to quit you won't be able to?

It's very important to my boyfriend that I quit and yet that still doesn't seem to be enough motivation. 

Please help!

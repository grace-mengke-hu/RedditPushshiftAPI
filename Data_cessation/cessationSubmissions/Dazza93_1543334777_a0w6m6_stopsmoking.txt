Am I sick? Or is this normal?

I've been clean for 6 weeks and I'm really happy about that. 

I just want to ask if what I should go to the doctor because the cost is something to consider.

I quit cold turkey after one night I woke up gasping for air. Every night I get pins and needles in my arms and legs, I get pinches just left of my sternum and breathing becomes an issue in the evening. 

I'm sure I'm just experiencing anxiety, but how much longer will I suffer if anyone has some guidance for me.

I am terrified of smoking because it feels like the next one will kill me. I was smoking for 7 years, just under a box a day

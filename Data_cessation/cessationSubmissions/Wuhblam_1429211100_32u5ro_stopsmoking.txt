I'm on the verge of giving up.

I'm on my 3rd day, and I can't even begin to explain how I feel. I've been yelling at the cat and rocking back and forth in my chair. 

My thoughts have been "Just one cigarette and the aches and irritability will go away" but then something tells me not to. I've already told my mom I quit and she's so proud. I'm not really doing this so much for me, but for my family. I don't want to let them down. I mean, not getting cancer and all is gonna be cool, but them not having to see me go through cancer is even better. 

Edit: Thanks for all your help, guys. I ate a habanero to get rid of the urge.

It helped..

Tough week

I have been 49 days smoke fee. I have been through all the cravings 
When waking up, after meals, driving, boredom and on and on. This week was The toughest. I am partners in a dealership group. I semi retired 2 years ago but still own 25% of the group. One of the items that works great for me is I am still involved but not in the daily operations. The one downfall is I have given up decision making with management. This year  business has been bad, which is increasing the stress ten fold. Last night I went thru all the Reddit posts and today I read all the missions I completed. Plain and simple if I had broke and smoked it would not have made the business any better and I would have been pissed that I smoked. Thank you all for the postings. Without the smoke free app and the great posting on this site I would have broke 
THANKS and by the way
I DONâ€™T SMOKE

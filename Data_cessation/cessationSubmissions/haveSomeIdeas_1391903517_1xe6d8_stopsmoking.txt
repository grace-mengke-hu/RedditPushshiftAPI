Anyone tried DMAE or sardines?

"Reward deficiency syndrome" is a shortage of dopamine receptors in a part of the brain that deals with rewards, leading to a number of behaviours such as ADHD and a tendency towards addictive behaviour (smoking, alcohol, gambling, etc.) according to various articles. Some things I read somewhere said that DMAE, a substance in sardines, can help with this. Has anyone tried this, and did it help? I don't smoke but have had some trouble with insomnia and with addiction to using the Internet. (DMAE is also supposed to help with insomnia.) I try to eat sardines regularly and they may be helping; it's hard to tell. At least, I'm doing a lot better with both the insomnia and the Internet addiction.

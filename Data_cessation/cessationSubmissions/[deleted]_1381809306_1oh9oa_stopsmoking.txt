can't seem to motivate

hey /r/stopsmoking. i'm mike. i'm 22 and have been a smoker for 9 years. not as long as most smokers i know, but long enough to reap the consequences of smoking. i'm posting here b/c i need to stop being such a shem and quit, but no matter how hard i try, 2 days into quitting, 1 week into quitting i manage to find myself purchasing an incredibly over-priced pack of smokes(i live in NY where taxes are fucking preposterous). i was hoping i could gain some support from anyone willing to grace me with some and also hear some suggestions that may help me quit. my biggest fear with smoking is that i'll end up like my father who, also WAS a smoker for 40+ yrs and has recently been diagnosed with C.O.P.D. My and my father's health aside, the price of smokes is the most obvious reason to quit, but has yet to strike my intellect until now. thanks for hearing me out guys/gals.

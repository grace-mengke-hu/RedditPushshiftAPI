1 YEAR!!

Holy cow! I cant believe its been a year. I hardly think of it now, nearly forgetting that today was the day. It obviously hasn't been easy, but it sure is a breeze now. I know everyone on this sub has heard it before, but it does get easier as the days go by. Everyone knows the first week, month, quarter of a year is rough, but the benefits are worth it and the cravings subside. It can be done! This sub is just one of the many resources that are out there; for me, just reading the struggles and constant support helped in its own. Thank you all and happy quitting!

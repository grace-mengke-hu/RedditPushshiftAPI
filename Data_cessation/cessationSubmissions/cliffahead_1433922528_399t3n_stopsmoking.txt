day 24. would like to share.

Dear fellow quitters,

today's my 24th day of quitting cigarettes, or more specifically, all forms of nicotine/burning/inhaling. I went cold turkey after a 15-year pack/day addiction.

like everyone who made it through the 1st week, the physical withdrawal was bad. i thought i'd accidentally snorted some rat poison or whatnot cos suddenly, i'm coughing and sneezing and experiencing all sorts of dietary changes, my sleeping habits changed drastically. 

i thought it'll be over, the worst phase of it.

i was wrong.

the mental withdrawal got me in a moody and murderous rage constantly. i was snappy, unfocused, easily distracted, and constantly looking to pick a fight. 

i had to relearn stuff like a fucking baby:

* not smoking after a meal
* not smoking first thing out of bed
* not smoking last thing before bed
* not smoking with my first cup of coffee
* not smoking with my colleagues / friends
* not smoking while doing mundane and boring paperwork
* not smoking while preparing for fieldwork
* not smoking while taking a dump
* not smoking during stressful times
* not smoking while having a cup of coffee with friends, just chilling and relaxing and talking shit
* not smoking AND drinking

week 2 was horrible. i kept waiting for the worst to be over, but it never came. the worst got worse like a fucking torture device.

it's like getting thrown into an Iron Maiden and having it tightening around you, and when you thought it couldn't get anymore closer, it does and stabs into your skin and body and muscles. and it repeats, every day.

i kept staring at people smoking, staring at the stick of white; the colour of innocence and purity. i see a pack of cigs and i envision the whole process from start to finish: 

* the opening of the pack, 

* flipping the lid, 

* taking a stick between my fingers, 

* the flick of my zippo, 

* the scent of zippo fluid as a fucking preview of what is to come,

* the spark from the flint lighting up the world around me for that fraction of a second, 

* the first breath of sick sweet smoke as i inhale,

* holding my breath as i close my eyes and wait for the magic to work,

* the big exhale, and the cloud of smoke escaping from my lips.

i missed that process, all of it. every, single, fucking, day.

there were so many times i stood 3 steps away from a shop, knowing that all i had to do, was to close my eyes, and put one foot in front of the other, one, two, three. and i'll have a pack in my hand.

so many times my friends and colleagues took my quitting as a fucking challenge and did everything they could to tempt me to pick up a stick and join them "just for tonight". 

they've done almost everything short of a mouth-to-mouth-kiss-full-of-smoke.

but i stayed strong. i jogged, i swam, i played basketball, i stayed in my room where it's strictly a smoke-free zone, i did weights, i binged on so much junk food.

and i came here. to read and to find solace in our common struggle. i read as day 1s posted, full of vigour and hope and enthusiasm, i read as those with triple digits posted to encourage everyone. i read as those that quitted the same time as i did shared their stories. and i didn't smoke.

beating the physical cravings is a walk in the park. it's day 24, and my body no longer craves the nicotine, but the body's self-purge system is still working hard. i've read that it'll take up to 4-6 months for the body to fully recover from all the shit toxins i've willingly and idiotically injected into myself.

it is the mental cravings, the habits, the reflex-like associations (how many times did you have a stick in your hand without realising it?) that will kick your ass if you're not careful.

but it's not all bad.

* my physical fitness has improved tremendously now. where previously i could hardly run half a mile before panting, i can do a mile and half with relative ease now, and i know i can push myself harder with the days to come.

* i don't stink like a motherfucking chimney now. at all. when i walk past someone that smokes and catch a whiff of that ~~sick, sweet smoke~~ disgusting smell, i retch and stay away.

* my teeth are no longer brown-yellow; my bad breath is gone.

* food tastes great now.

* i feel like i've grown a third hand. where previously i'd only have one hand free, now i have both hands free to carry stuff.

* i no longer have to schedule my small tasks at work to coincide with my smoke breaks

* i no longer have to time myself to finish my food during lunch/dinner so i "have time to smoke ***2 sticks -fist pump-***!"

* a pack/day at $10/pack (averaged out and accounting for inflation), times 365 days, times 15 years
* ?????
* profit

* my mind is clearer now, my focus is sharper. i feel like i have too much brainpower now (quantity, not quality, so i'm nowhere near Stephen Hawkings *yet*)

* which in turn led me to a fulfilling journey of self-discovery. with the fixation on smoking, the mind is alot freer to think, plan, plot, extrapolate. i've learnt so much about myself in these 24 days than i have my entire life.

i want to thank this subreddit, for everything i've read, posted, and replied. for everything this sub stood for.

i wanna thank the fucking badge beside my name. Many a times, it was this badge that stopped me from giving in, the fear of resetting the days. this badge is a true hero to me.

as of today, i will say: i was a smoker, but i'll always be an addict. for each day poses a new challenge for me, and each day i'll have to learn to say NO.

thank you, /r/stopsmoking ,for giving me my 24 days.

to all my fellow quitters, please, stay strong and carry on.

edit: new motto: Don't give up giving up.

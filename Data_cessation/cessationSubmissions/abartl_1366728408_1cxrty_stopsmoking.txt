Strangely easy to quit

Yesterday I decided it was my time to quit smoking. I've been smoking for 3 or 4 years now, between half a pack to a pack a day. The reason I decided to quit is I just realized that for the last few weeks, smoking has done absolutely nothing for me. I don't get a buzz from it, it doesn't calm me down -- I just did it because it's something I'd been doing for years. I caved and tried to smoke one after dinner last night (after meals is when my cravings hit the hardest), but I couldn't even finish it. It tasted disgusting and I threw 3/4 of it away. Haven't touched one since, including the hardest one the first thing in the morning on the way to work.
 
Unfortunately my two roommates also smoke, but I had no problem going outside and hanging out with them last night without having another overwhelming urge to smoke. I obviously had a little craving, but just reminding myself that is provides me absolutely no benefit was enough for me. I'm hoping in the next couple of weeks I can convince them to stop with me.
 
Wish me luck in this journey to a new, healthier me!

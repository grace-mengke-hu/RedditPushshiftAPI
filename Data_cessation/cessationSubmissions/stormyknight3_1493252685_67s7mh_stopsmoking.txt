Reducing Hostility

Anyone have good recommendations for how to cope with the hostility/anger/overall-"blerg"-feelings?
This time around, I feel really irritated... I already hated my job, so that's not helping, but I'm especially hostile at work. 
There's a pretty resounding thought of "what's the point" while seeking distractions from what i need to do even while at home. Cravings aren't actually bad at all at this point, but I've been left feeling very off my game, all around.

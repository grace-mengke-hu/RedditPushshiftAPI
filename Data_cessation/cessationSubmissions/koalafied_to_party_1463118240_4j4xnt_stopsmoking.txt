Oh, well, hello!

So... It's been 100+ days since I have pursed my lips around a cigarette. Never thought I'd get here. In fact, all the 100, 365, 1000 day posts used to irritate the shit outta me... Now I see them and I'm all "yeah! We're fuckin doin this!"

For anyone who reads this and is in the early stages, it gets easier. I pinky swear. Soon, you won't even think about how you used to let nicotine control your life until a friend or SO mentions it and then you'll be all "yeahhh... That was a stupid thing I used to be obsessed with, thank god *that's* over

Just wanted to check in at a milestone. Keep on keepin on, guyz! And congrats! <3

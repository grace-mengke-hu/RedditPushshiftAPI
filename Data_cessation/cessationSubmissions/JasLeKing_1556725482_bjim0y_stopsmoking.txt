Brain Games - Please Stop

I am on day 18. Not one puff. Yet, these brain games bubble gum BS is getting irritating. Please help me ... does it truly get easier?  When ?  I got to ccoonncceennttrraattee!

At times it feels as all I can concentrate on is my brain trying to justify that having one smoke will be "ok" to take the edge off. I know this is a lie. One will lead to two. Then three. And then I am smoking again. Dont want that. I want to be a non-smoker.

This is probably one of my best efforts in attempting to quit. Have made it a few days before and then cave. I truly do want to quit smoking for my health. But this is getting difficult. I believe I am an undiagnosed case of this f**** sucks holy crap bat man. 

I so appreciate this reddit. I have posted a few times and read others comments to help me. I have the quit smoking app and am proud of my accomplishments when I review. 

Thanks for reading and listening to me. May God grant me the strength to continue on this life changing journey ... and be a non-smoker. Peace !

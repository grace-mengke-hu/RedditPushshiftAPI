Unexpected Nic Fit

I quit 12 weeks ago and I'm at the stage where the "foggy haze" I was in has lifted. In other words, I'm more myself and everything is coming up flowers and shit and I'm not a walking pissed off POS douche canoe. I realized I hadn't had withdrawal symptoms in days, maybe a couple of weeks, so last night was unexpected. I had a prolonged nicotine fit that legit lasted 2 hours as if it was day 9. For those long time quitters, is this normal? I thought I was over the physical part.

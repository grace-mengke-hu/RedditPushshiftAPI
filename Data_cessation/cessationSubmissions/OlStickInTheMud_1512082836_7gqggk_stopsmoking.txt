4 days smoke free

I decided enough was enough. Pack a day for about 4 years. My teeth are yellow, gums bleed from brushing, everything smells and the last time I had sex was a sweaty gasping for breath embarassment.

Sunday afternoon was my last cig. So far not smoking has been pretty easy, been sucking down dum dum suckers and has helped alot.

However, going into day five my cravings are much stronger and my throat and lumgs burn. Im coughing a whole bunch too. Its almost unbearable!

I have never tried to really quit before and the 10 years Ive been a smoker have never actuall gone more than a day without a cig.

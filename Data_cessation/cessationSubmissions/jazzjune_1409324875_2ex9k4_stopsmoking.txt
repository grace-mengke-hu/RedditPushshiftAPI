It's been awhile

I've had the worst summer.  Lost a job, ended a relationship and a few friendships,  injury, moved across country, spent a lot of time alone.  Pretty much every major stressor one person can go through at once. 

Now I didn't come here to bitch.  I'm super happy.   New job.  Moving to a different country soon.  One door closes,  another opens... or so it goes.

I just wanted to say I DIDN'T SMOKE ONCE.   Not a single puff.  Not a drunken mistake.   Nothing.   I don't miss it.  I don't even think about it anymore :)  

Even though things have been hard, that makes me smile.

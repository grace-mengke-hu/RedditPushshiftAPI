Today is the 14th from where I lived :)

I think It would be great to break up with this (cigarette smoking)relationship that's killing me. I will be hanging around here from now on.

I have been smoking for around 10 - 11 years now. And I have some questions before I get started.

Is it okay to smoke less from what I used to or quit smoking instantly?

If I quit instantly how will I resist cravings?

I had this experience before I was really sick that time and my parents doesn't even know that I smoke, and I was bedridden at that time and I haven't been smoking for almost a week I guess. I was coughing real bad and the color of my pleghm was kind of yellowish and every time I cough I feel like my lungs will get ripped apart. How will I get rid of that experience? I mean the lung part.

Well I guess that's it. hope for sincere advices and encouragements from you guys.

P.S
Sorry for the bad english, grammar, spelling etc etc etc.

I've quit smoking and now I've quit vaping...

And if I'm being honest I absolutely hate it... I could really use some encouragement.

I'm a 28 year old man, I began smoking in my early 20's. It was fairly casual. Maybe like a pack a week? Maybe like 2 or 3 cigarettes a day. Switched to e-cigs in 2015. Never even really craved normal cigarettes afterwards. In 2016 I quit vaping for about a year. No real cravings to speak of.

A year later I went through a stressful point in my life and started vaping again. About 2-3 weeks ago I quit again and have been clean since. I had no real withdrawal symptoms to speak of. Though I found it hard to breath for maybe a day or two after cause I'd always vape mint flavours.

Here's my problem... I really like vaping... It was just something to do and had a nice little kick to it. The other problem was I found it way to way to quit (most likely because I've smoked/vaped for less than a decade). Because of these two problems, my liar of a brain keeps trying to get me to buy more vape juice, even though I'm not physically craving it.

Is that all withdrawal is? Like a mental thing where you just want it? If I were to compare it to anything it's like a mental itch I can't scratch.

Anyways, anyone here have any similar experiences? Any encouragement? How do you tell your brain to piss off? Or do you just ignore it for long enough that it gives up?

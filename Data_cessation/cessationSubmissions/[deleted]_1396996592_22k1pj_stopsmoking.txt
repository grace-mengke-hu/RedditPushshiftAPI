Its been a slow progression from only smoking when i drink, to only at parties, to only at parties and before work or school, to.... I think you get the point. But im now smoking 4-5 a day for any excuse i can find. I want to quit before it gets out of hand and im smoking a pack a day. I cant go more than a few days withought just getting anxious and irritated (or maybe i tell myself that so i can have an excuse to smoke) PLEASE HELP ME.

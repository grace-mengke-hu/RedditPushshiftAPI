9 days in...

So, I'm 9 days in and the cravings aren't that bad.  However, the stress and anxiety are.  I am flipping out over nothing and am constantly getting in bad moods toward my girlfriend.  Does this eventually pass?  It's starting to feel like the stress and constant flipping out is never going to go away.

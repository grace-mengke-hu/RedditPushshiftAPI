Hahaha, I can't believe it...

I really have not smoked a cigarette for 311 days!! Omg this is too epic, I didn't think I had it in me! Wow, I'm really happy. 10 months! I've bought a friend a pack, pretended I was gonna smoke to appease a drunk friend and even put yet another friend's cigarette to my lips just to remember what it felt like...and in all of this I never lit one.

I still think about smoking quite a bit...but unlike before, I don't think about smoking when I'm not fine anymore. I usually just think about cigarettes when I'm bored. And that makes a world of difference since boredom is not nearly as strong as anxiety/stress in terms of motivation to seek escape.

I don't come to this reddit as often as I used to. But on the first 3-4 months you guys were my come to for support and for that I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. From the people with 3000 days of no cigarettes to the people who are struggling with day 1. All of you provided me with enough insight to keep my lungs safe and never lose faith in myself.


...now please excuse me, my ceiling appears to be leaking.

**edit:** Oh I almost forgot, a rapper I sort of enjoy listening to dropped this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y0Zjxu4V6c) about cigarettes...could be a very relatable song for those who just quit recently.

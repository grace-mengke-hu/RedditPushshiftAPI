Not smoking when out with friends?

I kicked the habit on Sunday evening last. Currently 5 days and 7 hours smoke free and it's been easier than I had imagined. I keep expecting it to suddenly overwhelm me and that i'll fail and smoke. 

My big fear is going for a pint. I'm not sure how to approach it. Many of my friends only smoke when they drink and as a friend put it the other day I'm synonymous with smoking.

Whats the best way to deal with this?

I've waited too long to do this.

I've been lurking here ever since my wife gave me the link to this subreddit.  It's honestly so inspiring to see how well so many of you have done with this.  I've continued to make excuses and put off the inevitable truth that I must quit smoking.

I love my life way too much to keep throwing it away doing this.  So here is my public announcement that I'm done.  I threw the remainder of my last pack out and tomorrow will mark the beginning of a beautiful new day.

If she happens to read this: I'm doing it for me this time.  Mostly because I'm a greedy bastard and want to spend as much time with you as I can.  I love you.

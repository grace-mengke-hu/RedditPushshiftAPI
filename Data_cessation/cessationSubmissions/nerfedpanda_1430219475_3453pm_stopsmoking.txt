I'm done for good.

I hate this habit. I know how terrible it is for my health (especially given my family's history of cancer and weak lungs).

I've "quit" on multiple occasions going for weeks and sometimes months without a cigarette, yet I inevitably go back for one reason or another (usually social smoking on the weekends).

But this time, I swear I want to be done. For good. Forever. This is the first (and hopefully last) time I've ever proclaimed that I'm done for good.

I'll try to update every few days to keep myself accountable.

Wish me luck!

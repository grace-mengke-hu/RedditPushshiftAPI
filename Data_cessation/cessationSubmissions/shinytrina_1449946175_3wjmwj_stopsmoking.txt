And so it starts

So I smoked my last cigarette last night just before midnight and it is currently 1:45pm.  I am working on a website and trying to keep my mind busy and fingers.

A bit of a history on my smoking.  I started when I was 13 and am now 38.  I was 1ppd - 1 1/2ppd smoker.  I am so tired of trying to plan everything around having my next smoke.  I would also love to be able to run and workout without running out of breath.

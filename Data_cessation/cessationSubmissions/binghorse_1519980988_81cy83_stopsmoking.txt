Cigarettes are bullshit

It's been about a week since I've smoked a cigarette. In that time I've stopped smelling of smoke, my breath has improved significantly, I've started running again, my skin is looking better, I can take a deep breath again, I'm less prone to distraction, I'm less irritable...

But I still want to smoke one. I can't help romanticizing it, even when the good part lasts about two to three puffs, and then I feel disgusting afterwards. Nicotine addiction is seriously no joke. My dad, who used to smoke three packs a day and has now cut down to """just""" one, still to this day hounds me never smoke a single cigarette, and while I definitely didn't listen to him, I can why he was so adamant now. What a surefire way to reduce your quality of life.

I've heard so many times, "nothing beats a cigarette after ____". You know what's better than having a cigarette with a coffee as you watch the sun come up on a clear morning? Or after a stressful day? Or as you drink a cold 40 out of a paper bag with your friends? Not being a smoker. Cigarettes are bullshit.

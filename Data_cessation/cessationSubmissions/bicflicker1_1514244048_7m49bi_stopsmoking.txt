9 months tomorrow!

I could have had a baby by now! 

As a guy that sounds rather terrifying but I am overcome with joy. My anxiety has gotten so much better even though I have my moments! I still have very real dreams that I smoke and wake up upset, but I feel so free!

Sometimes I miss the aesthetics as I think smoking looks edgy or cool (bad I know), but I have NO desire to start back ever at this point! 

Woohoo! 

Keep pushing everybody! This Christmas give your body the gift of improving your health and the love it gives back will be immeasurable!

Stay free my beautiful people!

Day one will be tomorrow, after many relapses this past week

This subreddit is amazing, and has helped me through my first few quit attempts.  I stopped coming here once I started having a few at night. I got off the band wagon, and now I'm back on, mostly thanks to r/stopsmoking.  Thank you everyone! 

Sorry if this is so random...

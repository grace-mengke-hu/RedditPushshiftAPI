I messed up and it is stressing me out.

So I am about 50 days without a cigarette and about 28 days without nicotine. (I still smoke a vape but the vape has 0 nicotine). 

I was just helping a friend learn how to use his new vape. I gave him all my old juices that had high levels of nicotine. (12mg - 18 mg). As I was getting it setup for him, I tested the vape and took abut 3 big hits to make sure it was working correctly. 

I didn't even realize until after that I just took three hits of 18mg nicotine ejuice. Now I feel like I have failed. Like I can't say that I am 28 days without nicotine anymore. I am super stressed about it. 

My withdrawal has been pretty ugly and I have recently been feeling better. Is this going to throw me off? Are some of my symptoms going to come back? Did I just fail my quit in some way?

I know I may sound irrational about this honest mistake but it is seriously stressing me out right now. I am really unhappy with myself.

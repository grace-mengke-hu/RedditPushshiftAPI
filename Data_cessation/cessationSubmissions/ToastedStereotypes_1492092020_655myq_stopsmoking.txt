1 month in the process!

Its been now one month that I'm a non-smoker. I have to admit, I had a relapse 2 days ago. I'm not proud of it, but i did learn form it. Cigarettes are not the solution to my problems, they brings me nothing. I was not relaxed or stress free after one, I just still felt like shit. On the app that I use, I pass the count of 500 cigarettes not smoke, I can't belive how numbers go high so quickly! It makes me realize how much it had take such a big part in my life. I'm glad its gone now. I also decide yesterday to stop weed and alcool too, at least when I'm alone. Just reserve it for time with friends.
Just love how I can smell the spring today.
Thanks for all, this community is AWSOME!!!

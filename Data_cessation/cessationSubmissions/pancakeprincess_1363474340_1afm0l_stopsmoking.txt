Your thoughts on quitting with an e-cig?

I've been smoking a pack a day for 5 years, since I was 15. All of my previous attempts to quit (cold turkey, nicotine patch, acupuncture) have failed, but it's starting to seriously affect my health to the point where I can't justify keeping the habit anymore. I smoked my last cigarette a little over 48 hours ago, but I've been using an e-cig sporadically since then, for when the cravings get overwhelming and as a replacement during times I would normally smoke, like driving or doing homework. I know this isn't a long term solution and will probably prolong my cravings, but I've failed miserably with numerous other methods. Is this an awful idea or an acceptable crutch? Is it comparable to a nicotine gum or patch, or are there different health effects? Has anyone had success using an e-cig to help them quit? Thanks in advance!

Important milestone.

I managed 5 months from October 2017 through into March of 2019 and I fell down when I had a major work project that put a tremendous amount of pressure and spotlight on me. This year I am only into my second week when I found myself in the same pitfall as the previous year. I got through everything and just as I calmed down, I felt my mind go "Well done, let's go for a nice smoke to celebrate being done." Then I caught myself, realized what I had a achieved, stood a little taller and enjoy how smooth my breath felt without having smoked. Thanks for reading! Not one more, no matter what!

This metaphore helped a couple of people deal with their cravings, perhaps it will help you too.

I posted a response to someone struggling with their cravings in the moment and it helped a couple of people to get through the cravings. So I added a couple of things and hopefully it will get you through as well: 

Have you watched Terminator 2? 

Remember how in the end, when T1000 was melting and he was in this agony, turning into all the people he imitated and there was this screeching scream that he was making as he was melting. Unable to escape, he was a dying creature - going through all the possible scenarios and characters trying to grab onto something to make it out alive. 

That's what your cravings are now - they are trying to survive. Your cravings will have a tantrum, they will screech and make you sleepless, they will try to act like a different person. They will try a lot of things. Sweet talk and harsh talk, cursing and screaming in your ear, begging, pleading, making logical arguments, they will do and say anything to live. 

When you look at your cravings this way, you can almost enjoy them - watch them from aside screeching and screaming and trying to figure out how to escape that lava. Watch them and laugh, because you know that all you have to do is wait for it to drown. 

EDIT: That would be an analogy and not a metaphor. It should still help though :)

Help - in danger of relapsing (305 days)

It seems I am no longer able to cope with my life. 

I am realising that I want to smoke and instead I am avoiding all forms of social gatherings, getting into intense fits of violent rage (including one incident where I blew up in front of all my work colleagues at the big boss), binge drinking every night (dono when I started but its been over a month), masturbating multiple times a day and over-eating (especially sweets like chocolate - goddamn fucking Oreos ). 

I have been free from cigarettes for 305 days (without nicotine supplement) and I really want to try manage 360 days. But it seems like I've gone back 300 days and I am salivating at the sight of cigarette packets at the shop counter.

Any tips? Something to stop me from destroying myself - sorry if I am not entirely coherent as I am very drunk.
Should I start smoking again to prevent alcoholism and stop some other time?

I was always in control of my alcohol in take, but I have been binge drinking every night for an unknown number of days and I dont know what I am going to do. 
I am at a loss, because here I am, with a stomach bug, drunk alone  at home with a ,... I can barely see straight.

Again, I'd appreciate any form of advice, help and maybe it would help others in the same circumstances.  Or maybe I should start agina and quit when I am more stable in order to prevent alcoholism.

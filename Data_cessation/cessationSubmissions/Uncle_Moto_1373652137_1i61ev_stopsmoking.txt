Today is my 1 year anniversary of the ol' cold turkey...

1 year ago today I was half way through a cigarette when an overwhelming urge to quit hit me. I put out the cigarette, and threw the rest of my cigs in the dumpster.  21 years of smoking ended like that, cold turkey.   A year later, there are still days I want to smoke.  Sometimes out of no where I briefly reach for my non-existent smokes and lighter.  Here's the kicker, though, and why I'm probably a bit different than most who have quit:  I don't feel any better.  I can't breathe better, I can't taste better, I can't smell things better, and I don't have any other physical improvements to mention.  With that said, there are a couple things I have found to be better, like I don't smell like smoke all the time, which is great... and even better, I've saved about $2000 in the last year by not smoking.  Now, I know there's all the reduced chance of heart attack and all that stuff, and that's all great, but it would just be nice to actually feel some tangeable benefits a bit more ;)
Anyways, figured I'd make a quick bragging post, we don't get to legitimately do that very often, do we?

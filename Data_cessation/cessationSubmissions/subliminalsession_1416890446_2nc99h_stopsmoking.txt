still having the dreams

when i'm stressed and down, i have dreams at night where i'm smoking and it fixes all my problems and i'm 'happy again'. then i wake up with that, 'oh no, it was all just a dream' feeling and feel shit for a few days for the fact i don't smoke. does this ever go away? god damn

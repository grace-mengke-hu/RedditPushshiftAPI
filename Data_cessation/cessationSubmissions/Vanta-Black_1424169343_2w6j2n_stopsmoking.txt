I want to quit smoking.. Some questions inside.

Hello, everyone!

I recently started exercise. I am smoking for around 9 years now, but in light of my recent change of heart, i want to quit.

Is it better if i just quit smoking now. Or would it be better for it to be gradual? Like 1 cig less per day until i don't smoke at all?

Mind you i smoke around 20 cigs a day. Maybe more.

Any other tips?

Thank you for your time! I really appreciate it.

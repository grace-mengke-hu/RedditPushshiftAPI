Anybody suffer from some sort of depression / lack of motivation after quitting ?

Smoking has this huge positive effect on me, I feel strong, calm and able to take one step towards my goals and the rest follows. Without it, I have the hardest time getting the first step out... I feel overwhelmed and procrastinate, then feel anxious... naturally. 

Its like I have no motivation. I know there's tons of dopamine/serotonine boost from cigs. I get mental clarity and can sustain longer efforts from cigs. Feel cloudy without. 

This is what gets me to go back to it... My life gets too overwhelming and then i go buy a pack and everything is fine with the world.. except that I smoke, stink and am not proud of myself. But i work. have success and everything goes well... 

I kind of hate my state.. need a solution. I feel there is more than nicotine itself. I have terrible IBS and when i smoke I'm fine, when i don't I'm sick. 

Rencently stumbled upon [this blog](https://www.supergoodstuff.com/news/why-quitting-smoking-can-kill-you09255542078.html) I would say its not super scientifically based but I feel this is my case. I poop normaly, can eat most things, don't have as much pain when I smoke.. 

Could be all in my head but can it really ?

Delaying, Delaying, Delaying

I think what's holding me back from finally quitting is the fear of withdrawal...like, there's never a good time to quit because withdrawal symptoms are going to interfere with what's going on in my life...and an assumption of "well, I'm going to want to smoke at this event or with this group of people, so..."

I'm so ready to be done with this.
I just want to take the leap and commit to it, no matter what happens.

Two years, having cravings

I stopped two years ago with smoking after a life changing panic attack. As many of you know, it seems that you never lose the 'occasional' craving. I can manage those, although they're getting worse. Even more so now that I'm starting to feel better (mental health). At this moment the cravings are killing, because I just drank a few (8) beers after not drinking for two years. I can't think of nothing else than a fine cigarette. 
But even without the alcohol, I miss smoking; the taste, the act, the image, the excuses to leave whenever you want, the "every smoker is your friend" feeling, I really miss it. 
I keep weighing the consequences. I can die in an accident tomorrow, or not.. I can meet the woman of my life because of smoking, or maybe I'll never meet that woman because she hates cigarettes (I know, with billions of women, there are millions that fall into the category of perfect matches). 

I'm not sure what I'm looking/asking for. Not so much a pro or con response, but I don't have anybody to say this to. At least not at this moment.

how do I make myself want to stop?

My girlfriend really wants me to stop smoking and I do too but every time I get stressed or scared I think I'll just have 1... which later turns into 3 and so on. I've significantly cut back recently but the cravings keep getting to me and I begin to crack under stress (which my life is currently filled with). I feel like the main thing stopping me is some major motivation but I just can't seem to find it. Does anyone here have advice on kick starting quitting before it's too late? I also feel weak since everyone in my family who has quit managed to do it cold turkey, which doesn't seem to work for me. It also doesn't help that I suffer from major depression and anxiety and seem to use smoking as an escape. Does anyone here have helpful advice on how to start? Also sorry if this is covered in the sidebar, I'm on mobile.

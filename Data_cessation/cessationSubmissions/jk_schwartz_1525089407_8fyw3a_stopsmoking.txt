Helpful quitting / cessation app with focus on mindfulness...I wish I found it sooner, maybe it will help you

To any future non\-smokers who are practicing or curious about mindfulness and how it can help you with your process, check out the [Craving to Quit! app](https://www.cravingtoquit.com/).  It is free.  It is a 21 day program \(i.e., start it at least 21 days before your quit date\) that includes daily lessons \(video content\) and goals, as well as a cigarette tracker, pretty cool "want\-o\-meter" for registering cravings with the option of deciding to smoke in response or deciding to ride it out \(with quick 1\-2 minute guided thought exercises for whatever choice you make in that particular moment\), and some other interesting features.  

I'm not associated with the app at all\-\-I wanted to highlight it here because I found it too late in my process and wouldn't want anyone in the process of quitting and interested in something like this to miss it.  The issue with me "finding it too late" is this: the app doesn't let you binge lessons from prior days to "catch up".  So I stumbled upon the app with about 5 days left to go before my quit date but couldn't crank through days 1 \- 16 and potentially benefit from catching some pearls of wisdom or way of thinking about becoming a non\-smoker that might have set a lightbulb off or otherwise resonated with me.  That said, you have access to some of the general video content and lessons, as well as the "want\-o\-meter" at any time.  Just not each day's particular set of lessons and goals.  I understand the company's thinking behind a "forced runway" leading up to quitting so you don't try too soon and get frustrated or fail \(there's a little pop up in the app that says as much when you try to click ahead without completing a prior day's lesson\).  Personally, I needed \(and gave myself\) a runway of about a month between deciding to quit and my quit date.  I just wish I had this along the way!  

I wish I would have known about this app sooner in my process.  This forum has been a great resource for me, and if this post resonates with just one person in this forum I'll consider this tiny contribution time well spent!

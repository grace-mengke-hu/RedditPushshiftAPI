Does anyone get sensitive teeth since quitting?

I’m now 3 weeks quit (using Champix) and I’ve noticed over the last few days that my teeth are getting particularly sensitive.

I’ve always had excellent oral hygiene and other than a problem filling, I’ve never had sensitive teeth. Now I find that even breathing outside in the cold is really sensitive!

Could it be where my teeth aren’t getting a constant build up of tar (or whatever it is) or could it be a side effect of the Champix?

If so, has anyone else experienced this and how long did it last for?

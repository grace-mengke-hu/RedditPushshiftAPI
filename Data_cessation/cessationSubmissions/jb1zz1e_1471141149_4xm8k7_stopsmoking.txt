13 days strong!

I've been trying to quit smoking for the last two months and fail everytime the weekend comes around. I like to blame it on beer and my smoker friends. I'll literally go Sunday night through Friday night without smoking and will have to relive the terrible withdraws all week. I finally decided two weeks ago that I want to be done for good! It's not beers fault (I love beer, it's not fair to blame it on beer) lol and it's not my friends fault, it has been all on me. For the last two weeks I have had a different approach. I'm just not going to smoke one, idc, bring on the withdraws, bring on the cravings, let's do it, cause I'm going to beat it. I've been pretty buzzed 3 times the last two weeks and have said no to cigarettes every time.

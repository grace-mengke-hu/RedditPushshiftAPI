My turn

I've considered quitting in the past and just kept making excuses.  I'd be pumped, ready to go, then wake up in the morning having lost the motivation quit. I've read Alan Carr's book, I know the benefits of quitting, I know how terrible for me it was, but for some reason, just could not get myself in the mindset to do so.
  
Well, idk what it is, but that didn't happen today.  I made the decision last night.  I went to the bar to kill what was left of the pack I had.  Finished it off around 1am.  I went home and had one left there. It might sound lame, but I wanted to smoke the last one by myself.  I went out on my roof deck, lit up that last one, and said good bye to the worst things I've ever picked up.  
  
Just reading the posts you all have put up has helped give me that push in the right direction. I'm excited to smell things again, to taste things properly again, to get a good night's sleep, and to be free of this crap!  

*edit: When I said I killed my last one last night, Im currently on hour 11!
  
Thanks for listening. Happy to join the team :)

Don't feel motivated to quit

Hey guys.

So, I've been against smoking for all my life, as my dad and my brother are really addicteds and that made me a passive smoker ever since I was born. My dad is actually recovering from lung cancer after all the smoking he's done during his life. 

But since july 2016 I started smoking because I was really depressed (due to my dad's cancer and other stuff), so I met this girl (who is now my gf) that made me feel better, but she smokes, and then I started smoking casually when I was with her cause I thought I needed to so she would stay with me. 

When I realized, I was addicted to it and was smoking 2 packs a week. 
I can't go to a party without it anymore, cause I feel like I need a cigarette while talking to someone and stuff like that. I know how bad it is for me, and the fact that I'm a passive smoker during all my life (I'm 22 now) makes everything worse. 

I fear that smoking is affecting my sex life cause I get so tired during it, and that's my biggest motivation to quit, but there's situations like when I have an argument with my gf and stuff like that I smoke to "relax", if that makes sense. 

I really want to stop, but some situations like those I mentioned above makes it really hard for me. Any advices/opinions would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading this, and sorry for the bad english.

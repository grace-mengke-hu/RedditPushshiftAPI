Forced to quit smoking

Recently went through some financial trouble and basically won't have any money to buy vape juice until my next paycheck which is two weeks away.. I was vaping all the time and just vaped the last bit of my juice. I'm currently trying to figure out how to deal with the cravings with no other way to obtain nicotine. Work is going to be stressful and it is a customer service job so I'm concerned about flipping my shit on a customer.. (won't do that, but it'll be hard not to show how irritated I am)  So guess it's cold turkey for me. It's been on my mind for a few days to quit and now I can't even smoke at the moment.. so I guess I'll have to suffer through this. Any tips to help me out with urges, and how did you end up staying quit?

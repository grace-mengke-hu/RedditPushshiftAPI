About seven weeks in...does it get any easier?

My first thirty days weren't that bad, which surprised me, because I drive for a living and I used to smoke constantly in the car. I was a little bit irritable, but I really only got cravings when doing homework. I used to chain smoke when I did homework and, after quitting, it's difficult to concentrate on my work. Besides that, however, I felt like I was adjusting relatively well to whole thing.

In the past four or five days, though, I've been craving cigarettes like a motherfucker. I've not caved thus far, but I've had multiple dreams that I have, which all result in immediate shame and guilt as though I really had. I regularly get drunk enough to make my memory fuzzy, so I've had to ask my roommates to confirm that I didn't smoke the night before a couple times before my memory settled and I realized it had been a dream.

For the majority of my time having quit so far, I've felt perfectly fine about it, but this sudden change has got me anxious. I'm going through a lot of shit in my life right now. My brother died three months ago, which was actually the impetus for my decision to quit. So, I'm trying to balance work and school--both of which I attend full-time--with taking more time to visit my parents, and I'm feeling overwhelmed. I've spread myself too thin, and now I'm concerned that my decision to quit has come at the worst time possible for my mental health. On the other hand, that is such a chicken-shit excuse to give up quitting, and I've come too far to turn back.

I was talking to my boss a couple weeks ago, once I was confident enough to tell anyone I was quitting. He said that he quit in 2008, and he STILL gets cravings sometimes. That terrifies me. Doesn't it ever go away?

At this point I'm rambling, but I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Sorry for the wall of text, but thanks for reading.

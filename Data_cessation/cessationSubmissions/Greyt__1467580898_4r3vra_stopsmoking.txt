Stop me from starting

Recently took a trip down to middle of nowhere Georgia. All people do is smoke, so I joined. When I got back to Minnesota I've been craving and picked up a pack. I don't want to start and it's becoming a source of anxiety. I'm also going to basic in a couple weeks and I know all you do in the infantry is smoke. What are some motivations to stop me from starting? Also, how do you get around smoking in the military?

I thought it would be easy to quit again after a relapse

My relationship with cigarettes had changed, I felt. I wouldn't ever feel like I needed them again after going nearly 6 months without. Then I went through a breakup, relapsed and now I'm totally addicted again. I've wasted about Â£60, first on buying tobacco, then on nicotine lozenges and another vape pen. Lesson learnt. NOT ONE PUFF GUYS

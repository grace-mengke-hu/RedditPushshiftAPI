Smoke-free summer, but school starts this week...also, Adderall?

I've been feeling so great recently. 36 days without a cigarette after smoking a pack a day for five years. I quit using a vape, which is now at a low nicotine level and I don't even use it most days.

Classes start for me in a few days. I'm so nervous. My school has a *lot* of smokers, everywhere. I used to spend hours on campus with friends chain smoking. I can't imagine going without that before class/after class cigarette. How will I know it's time to chill out between classes?!

There's also the dilemma of Adderall. It's by far the thing that makes me smoke the most. It turned my 5 cigarette a day addiction to 25 cigarettes a day addiction. If it's the end of the day, I've taken Adderall, and drink a few beers... I'll easily smoke an entire pack in one night. If there's one thing that'll break me, it's that. The smell and taste of cigarettes is disgusting to me now, but I'm worried that that won't be enough to deter my caving.

I'm wondering if being smoke-free means I'll have to be Adderall-free. I've been prescribed for years, but I don't even really like taking it. It makes me feel crazy. But I just got into a super competitive academic program and I'm worried my grades will suffer.

Best case scenario, I'll end up chain-vaping, which will feel like a huge step back for me.

Gahhhhh.

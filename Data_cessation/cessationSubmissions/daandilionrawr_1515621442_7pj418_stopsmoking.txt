I'm back... My old badge read 592 - too bad I relapsed.

592 days ago, I went cold turkey. I made it approximately 2 weeks and then went to the store at 3am because I couldn't sleep and I was tired of feeling the way I felt. 

I just wanted to post again that I'm back and this time I'm trying something a little bit different. The thought of never having another cigarette ever just really sent me into a panic and actually caused me to chain smoke. So I'm giving myself 1 cigarette a day. I quit on Sunday (01/07/2018) and so far.... This might just be the method I've been needing. I find myself pushing and pushing that 1 smoke later and later in the day... Pretty soon I'm hoping to just push it so late that it's bedtime and I've gone a full day without one. We'll see. 

The hard part is that there are no apps for this kind of quitting... and everyone focuses on "cold turkey" so much that it feels like I'm cheating... but if it helps me to quit, it's the right way, right? 

I just... wanted to say that cold turkey doesn't work for everyone and it isn't the only way.... find what works for you. Good luck, y'all. We're all in this together.

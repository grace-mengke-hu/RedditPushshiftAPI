Quitting smoking and exercise

Just curious on what to expect for my recovery.  I have smoked for about 12 years total.  I used to be a 3 pack/day smoker, then I cut back after starting to vape.  Now I use vaping to control my smoking, but  I still do both and that has lasted for around 5 of the 12 years.  I smoke less then a pack per day.  I used to get bronchitus every year, but now I have only had it once in the past several years.  I do have other issues though:

Shortness of breath, I get super tired easily even going up a couple flights of stairs (I'm 34 this year), and this year my winter allergies and smoking habits have produced the worst asthma I have ever had.

For folks who may have had the problems I have had, what has exercise been like after a year of quitting?  Do you feel like you are still able to get in the best shape of your life?  I realize there is going to be a huge struggle in between, but did you get to a point where you could outperform the average person by working hard enough and continuing to abstain?

Just curious what my limits will be after this.  Thank you,

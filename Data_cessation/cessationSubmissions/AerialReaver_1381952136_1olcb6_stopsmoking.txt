Day one, E-Cigarette

So today is the day. I went to my local vape shop a week ago and bought the [cheapest starter kit](http://www.eastcoastvape.ca/Kanger-EVOD-Starter-Kit-BCC-Bottom-Coil-Changeable-System_p_338.html) they have and 50 ml of caramel tobacco flavored vape. Then I started vaping, smoking the odd cigarette here and there, gradually cutting down bit by bit. I think the time has come to where I can go without regular cigarettes. I noticed yesterday after vaping all day, I had one or two analogs, that regular cigarettes now make me almost sick to my stomach, they taste like shit, and smell even worse. I used to smoke about a half pack a day, probably even more if I was rolling my own. So here's to day one, and thanks to the E-Cigarette, will let you all know how it goes. I  eventually want to do the same thing gradually cut down the E-cigarette to so I can be completely free of nicotine, but I'm off to a good start.

I'm still sure I want to quit, but I still want to smoke so bad.

This sucks. I'm on beer no. 2 for the night, my first since Saturday (which was also my last day smoking) and I've been entertaining the idea of having a cigarette or two. Man, I've been working like crazy at my job this week. This is tough. I know I shouldn't, but I want to. How's it going for my fellow first-weekers?

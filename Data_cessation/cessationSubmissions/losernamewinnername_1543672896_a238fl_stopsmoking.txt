Cheers !!! Day 3

You fucking idiots! If you have doubts then fuck you, haha joking we all have sometimes !!! You're doing one of the best choices ever to yourself and society, even if you're not a spiritualist you're setting a fine example for others and kids  both spiritually and materially!

And you're stopping to feed the vultures who make these chemicals more addicted and put our thinking inside of autistic boxes.

And if you ever doubt you're going to light up another one, just remember that the same feeling was 

CAUSED BY THE CIGARETTE ITSELF and that what you're feeling now is nothing compared to what you could feel in future.  So be logical, of course it's better to be clean than to be die out in first 5-10 minutes of basketball, running or whatever you're doing because your lungs, heart and whole system is being polluted by something that stinks like death but your brain got used to it so it masks the smell a little but the smell and effects are so fucked up it cannot even mask it completely.   It's like cutting yourself just to feel normal but even worse because you're affecting the brain with bunch of weird added chemicals, I mean if you cut your arms in public you would look like insane, but it's perfectly fine if we do it in a slow and masked way. Maya (Godly illusion which runs this world, we are drunk with our ignorance, passion and virtue, things that aren't normal seem normal until they blow up)

Go box the air, run, make hot teas, eat well and healthy, chant, meditate, whatever you like, just vent that energy and try to love and give (at least a little) because it cures even if your energy is low, if you want sleep it off too until you feel you can vent your feelings...  You are fucking awesome and so am I.

 It's saturday and I'm staying at home. Whatever the fuck. Even if it takes a month alone, I think it's way better than to be stuck in friendships where people prioritize substances over people and yet act as if they don't. 

What's funny I feel less alone while I'm alone than with bunch of stoners and people who don't understand me and who live in circles and do things just to regain their sense of normality while not even knowing it.

 And you're also making a decision that your +1,+2+,3,+n year old would thank you for doing it! But if you don't feel like staying at home I don't know. Everyone has their own way, but either we tame the mind or it tames us!

One week

I made it to a week, and let me tell you -- I am goddammed proud. I wanted it and I am doing it.


Just one little thing... It's not over. I guess I had it somewhere in my mind that if I could make it X number of days (one week, two weeks, a month, 6 months, a year, whatever), this nightmare would just end, like the switch was flipped, or I reached the top of a mountain. It's sinking in that that's not the case -- the fight is a long, grinding war with lots of attrition mixed in with small, important victories.


Anyeays, been a lousy mental block today (one of many insidious mind tricks), keeping me up in the middle of the night, and wanted to get this off my chest. thanks all

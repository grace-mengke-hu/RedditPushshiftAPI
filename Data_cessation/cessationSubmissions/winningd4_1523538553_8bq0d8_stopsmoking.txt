Tobacco

Im on my 7 day smoke free. Its been hard. I am doing daily push ups to try to exhale my internal rage. I plan to start running. I sleep less, and awake without alarm. I am angry with my weakness in relation with this stupid substance. I strongly BELIEVE that ex smokers and smokers that actually want to try quit this habit must unite to make tobacco ILLEGAL. There are ZERO medical applications for substances contained in cigarretes. Non smokers know nothing about this but we, that try to quit, know its real dark side. I am angry because while i struggle to quit many people are laughing and happy with tobacco money. Even state generate money from us. Alcohool is different. Other substances are different because some might have some benefits in some cases. I dont know. What i know is that tobacco gives us nothing good and its addictive and does makes us illnesses. I think we should not be free to choose it because it is harmfull and its explointing adiction. I cannot drive without safety belt. Its ILLEGAL. Because i might be hurt and hurt others, right?

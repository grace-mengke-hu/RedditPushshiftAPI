I'm hungry .. all the time

On day 2. Is this normal? I feel like my appetite has gone through the roof.      
       
I rarely used to eat breakfast. Today I had cereal before work. Then stopped by the cafe and had a bacon buttie.             
Now it's lunch, I have popcorn chicken & chips and subway.       
I'm drinking alot of water to try and help but it's not stopping me from feeling hungry.          

I have never eaten so much in such a short space of time. At this rate, I'll gain alot of weight

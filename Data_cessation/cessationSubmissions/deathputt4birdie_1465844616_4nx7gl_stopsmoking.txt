Getting tested?

So I had a checkup with a new doctor today and she mentioned that I might be a good candidate (30+ pack-years, smoke-free for 4 years) for a low-dose CT scan.  I have to admit that my first thought was that I wouldn't really want to know the results since I didn't know if there was any treatment.  The doctor assured me that early detection should help.  Anyone else done one?

One Week Hurdle

It's been a week. I am finding the cravings getting worse as time progresses. I have had an awful last few days and it is taking every part of me not to go buy a pack.    

When I get stressed and overwhelmed all I want to do is turn to that crutch of coping with a cigarette. What tools did you successful non-smokers use when facing a tough time?    

All I keep telling myself is that buying a pack makes these last seven days a wasted effort and that I am not ready to compromise that. That stopped working and I turn to you all.     

Any advice is much appreciated.

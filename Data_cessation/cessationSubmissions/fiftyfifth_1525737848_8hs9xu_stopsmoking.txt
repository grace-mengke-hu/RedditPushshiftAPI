Day Zero

To be honest, nothing special to see here, just another new non-smoker.

I've been down this road before. In fact as of writing this, I still have my flair from my last journey... 2129 days! I made a good run but that number was never updated and is not accurate by any means; I've been on and off about 3 times since. Crazy to think it could be real though.

I hope that doesn't discourage anyone here, it really shouldn't. I deviated because I stopped caring. The times I decided to start smoking again was a dumb, but conscious decision, not an overwhelming craving. I could go into all that, but the bottom line is I let myself start up again. Turns out it still sucks, so don't bother finding out yourself. It's the same odors, the same congested feeling in your lungs, the same constant chase, the same beating yourself up over it, the same fearing-the-worst for your health, the same guilt over paying big tobacco to poison you, the same cash out of your pocket (well actually it's even more with prices going up up up). Even vaping was an expensive pain in the ass that left me feeling gross and dependent on nicotine. It's all the same BS as it always was, believe me.

Anyhow, I just had my last cigarette an hour ago and now I'm checking in for day 'zero' once more, wish me luck!

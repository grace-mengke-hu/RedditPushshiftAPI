One month, six days.....

The five to six week mark has always been the hardest for me. I've quit many times. This time, I worked up to it for months and I told myself it would be different. My son is getting older(5 in Feb) and I don't want him to be smelling tobacco on me. That smell is unmistakable. Wether it's cigarettes or colts or captain blacks, whatever. That seems like it'll stick. Kickboxing has helped. I know there are some of you who are exercise and still smoke. I was the same. Never *really* feeling the ill effects of smoking. Maybe a little less cardio, a little burn in my lungs, but nothing HUGE.  I don't want to wait for that to happen. Anyway, had a couple glasses of wine and really missing the throat hit right now.  It'll pass like it always does.....

Question for males who have quit/ in the process of quitting (Somewhat nsfw).

So it's been 10 days since I received my e-cig and I have not had a cigarette since (I actually threw out almost a full pack in the garbage, did not regret it one bit). My plan is for each vile of juice I finish, I plan on ordering the next with less and less nicotine until I get my last vile with 0% and will eventually stop using the e-cig all together.

Anyways, let me say that I feel great. I cook for a living and my sense of taste and smell have changed dramatically. I am a daily biker and my lungs have been thanking me non-stop. I've also been eating really well and healthy, I pretty much decided to stop my bad habits and change my life for the better. 

Let's stay on track shall we. What I am about to share might seem like too much information but I am curious if this has happened to anyone else. So for the past couple of years, I've had trouble maintaining full erections and staying really hard. Ever since I have quit cigarettes, I've noticed I am hard as a rock, constently, whenever I have an erection. Has this happened to any other males out there?

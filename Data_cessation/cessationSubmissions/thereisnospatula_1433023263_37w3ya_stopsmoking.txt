Better late than never.. Going to quit while I'm ahead!

Hi Guys, 

I'm a guy in his late twenties who has smoked since being around 16. You would never guess it though lol - I'm constantly told I do not look like a smoker and people are genuinely surprised when I pull out my smokes! 

I love working out so I suppose that may have staved off some of the more visible side-effects of smoking over the years. It seems pretty nonsensical that I smoke because I take pretty good care of myself in every other regard..... I guess that's what addiction is though!? Going against all you are in pursuit of something that has no real benefits :/

Well, I've decided the time is now! I'm going to quit and would love to chat to others who have already stopped or are in the boat as me and are about to. I feel that the added support from here would be nothing but a good thing =)

I'm pretty new to reddit but have been impressed overall as I've seen/read some pretty interesting and cool stuff and have given my (completely unlicensed ha) advice over the past couple of months.

I plan on cutting down at first. My plan is to have my morning cigarette and then allowing myself one after every meal throughout the day. Is this advisable? I currently go through between 15-20 a day :( and that has to stop... And I'm willing to give it all that I've got!

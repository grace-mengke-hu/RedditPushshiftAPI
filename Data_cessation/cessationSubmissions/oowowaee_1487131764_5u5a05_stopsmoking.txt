Does anyone else still get cravings after 2+ years?

I am a pretty easily suggestible person, so that might be part of it, but every time I see someone smoke on tv, and every once in a while, I will suddenly announce "good god I want to smoke right now".  I still very much miss the ritual of it - is that the case for anyone else?  Do the cravings ever go away?  I feel very much like if I were to be diagnosed with a terminal illness tomorrow I would just start smoking again.

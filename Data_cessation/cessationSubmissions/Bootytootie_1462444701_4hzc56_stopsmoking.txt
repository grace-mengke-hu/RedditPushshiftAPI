Day 2- really bad cravings.

Hi everyone, first post to the site. I've made the decision to quit smoking after 7 years. I'm on NRT, day 2 and having really bad cravings despite being on the patches. 
I'm back at work tomorrow morning and not sure how I'll cope as I'm set in certain routines (smoking before work with a coffee, on my lunch break and on the drive home). 
Any tips on how others have coped during the first week?

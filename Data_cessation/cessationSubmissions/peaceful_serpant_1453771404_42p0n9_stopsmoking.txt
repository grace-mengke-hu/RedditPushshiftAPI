5 days in. Feeling so weak. May buy a pack soon.

I know.. it's not worth it.. I feel so frustrated.. I have also quit weed 5 days ago and alcohol because I have abuse issues all around.. cigarettes seem to lead to them, if i buy a pack i will priobably crave weed more. FUCK. I don't know why I am like this.

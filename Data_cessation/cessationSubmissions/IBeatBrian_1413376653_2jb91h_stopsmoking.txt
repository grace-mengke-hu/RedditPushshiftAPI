19 YO smoker of 6 weeks, advice on quitting?

Hey guys, so I have been smoking for 6 weeks in total now and I'm quite sure I'm addicted. After finishing an entire pack this long weekend, I'm set on quitting because as a 19 YO student, I can't afford this shit. It started out just once every other day when I went out for errands, and then progressed to me smoking every 2-3 hours to get that slight buzz that's ever fading now. I know the length and quantity of my smoking addiction isn't as large as some of you guys here but I think writing it down will help me in the process.


**This is my plan:**
I'm going to try and increase the gap between smokes by an hour every 2-3 days. Today I had no more than 1 cigarette every 4 hours awake. Eventually my goal is to continue until it reaches once every 24 or 48 hours and then try to cold turkey it from there.

Currently, I feel I'm more addicted to the habits associated with smoking than drugs themselves. E.g smoking while waiting for the bus, smoking when I get anxious, smoking because I'm bored, etc. To combat this, I'm going to just sit outside for 5 minutes if I feel the urge at home and just go on my phone when I'm out. 

Any advice? Is this a decent plan?

PS: Any advice on how to deal with colds when you smoke? I've had this cold for about 2 weeks and I feel like constantly exposing my throat to chemicals isn't helping :(

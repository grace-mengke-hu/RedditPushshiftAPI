Quitting smoking. . . . does anyone have advice about study breaks?

Hi All, 

I've been a smoker for 12 years (since I was 18) and now I am quitting smoking using Chantix.  The Chantix has been amazing at helping with cravings and, thus far, I've been able to break a lot of associations I never thought I would be able to break.  

My main problem--and the thing that is depressing me the most--are study breaks.  I'm in graduate school and I've always taken cigarette breaks to think.  I love taking a pause from my work, going outside with a cup of coffee, and having a cigarette.  I feel like this clears my mind and helps me to think.  

So, I'm wondering, do any ex-smokers have any tips about how to deal with the strong desire to take a cigarette break from school/work?  Or, do any non-smokers have tips about the kinds of study breaks they take?

The Chantix is really wonderful at helping with a lot of habits.  Unfortunately, I'm having a lot of trouble with this one.  I would appreciate any tips from ex-smokers and non-smokers alike.  What do you do to take a break/clear your mind/let your thoughts wander?

Thank you so much!

Day 2, crazy

Going fucking nuts, taking all my will power to not run to gas station. My wife is no support or I am acting so crazy she is avoiding me. I start a new job on day 7-8 and think I may need to go smoke to do this with a plan. I am trying cold turkey. Can't think straight, so angly all the time, brain is on fire. I don't think I will make it. The cravings come to often and last so long, and i am so angry and alone even though I am in a relationship. I am afraid I will lose everything, my new job, girl, myself. I am a fucking mess right now. So much rage in me is what I don't understand. I have never felt this much anger ever before and it scares me how I feel like ripping someones head off with my bare hands. It's just a feeling not going to do it, but god damn, insane intensity. Anyway, thanks for reading

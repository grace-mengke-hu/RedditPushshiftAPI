Made it through 1 day not smoking.

Overall, I would rate today a 7/10.  

Were there instances where I thought I was the devil incarnate and was going to lose my shit? You bet ya! 

Did I eat half of a one pound bag of shredded cheese with my hand? I did! I did! 

Was I pretty sure that reality wasn't reality during intense moments of existential dread?  Guilty! 

But ya know, apart from about a dozen instances of every emotion conceivable speeding through me at a 100mph, I found my Sunday to be mildly lovely.  Didn't have to brave the cold 13x throughout the day, drank a lot of hot tea, studied, let myself eat a boatload of cheese... I'd be lying if i said I hadn't made it through the one day hump a slew of times in my 14 years as a smoker; yet, today it just felt really good and a whole lot less taxing.  In fact, I think it might be the taxes imposed on the cigarettes that are leading me towards this quit.  Earlier this week I caught myself worrying about my finances and freaked.  As a perpetually broke, twenty-something spendthrift, moments like this are always somewhere on the periphery; but, this was the first time I truly got scared about how I was going to survive if I continued to spend ~60 dollars a week on cigarettes.  It simply cannot continue.  

I lurked through this subreddit today and ya'll are awesome! Thank you for being so inspiring!

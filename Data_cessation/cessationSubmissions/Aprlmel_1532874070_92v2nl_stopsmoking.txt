The struggle is REAL!!

Hi all!!! Hope everyone is pushing forward. I’m on day 3 of no cigarettes! And let me just say: THIS IS A STRUGGLE!!!! I’m sitting here, drinking my coffee, paying some bills. And ALL I can think about is smoking. I’m irritable and emotional. They say that the craving will pass after 15 mins. But that’s just not true for me!! Could use some ideas of what to do when they just don’t pass. Thanks guys!

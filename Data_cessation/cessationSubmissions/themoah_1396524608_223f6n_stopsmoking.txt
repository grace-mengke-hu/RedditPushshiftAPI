1 year, 1 month and 1 day.

I was smoking for about 6 years. 
I remember that day as it was today. I was in military, our patrol got ambushed we had to make our way to base on feet. After 6 km of very fast run i felt very bad (just couldn't breath). I've looked back and got bullet in the vest (body armour). 
I couldn't sleep that night, next morning woke up, threw away cigarettes and happy being alive and non-smoking.

 One doesn't need such situation to stop smoking.

I fucked up, I hate smoking

Being in a car on a roadtrip with 3 smokers, even smoking inside the car, didn't stop me quitting this stupid shit.
Being drunk in clubs full of smokers didn't stop me from quitting. One fucking bad day. Fuck me. I should not've continued smoking weed, although it was pure, I just shouldn't smoke anything. I feel like smoking is ingrained in me (it is most definitely not) because of my mother's smoking habits. I even read fucking allen car's book, and I loved it. At chapter 40 ("The last cigaret") I buried my life as a smoker in Leipzig in Germany whilst on a roadtrip. Expecting never to dig it up again. But I did. I snatched one out of my mother's purse. I don't know why. Just wanted to vent. 

  You guys are all doing amazing!

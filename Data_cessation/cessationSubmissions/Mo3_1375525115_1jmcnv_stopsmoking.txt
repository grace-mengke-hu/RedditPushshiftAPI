Alright, this shit stops now.

I've unsuccessfully tried to quit over 10 times now, and I've only been smoking a year and a half. I'm pretty sure I have a chemical imbalance in my brain (+ADHD) that makes it incredibly hard for me to quit - I felt so terrible, depressed and suicidal in the first few days that I gave in every single time.

But not this time. I started meditating recently and learned to just observe my emotional state without attaching any labels or thoughts to it, I learned to see it just the way it is - I learned to be okay with being uncomfortable.

Here it goes. I'll go smoke my last cigarette now. Fuck you, you pieces of shit, you can't control me.

Quitting smoking.... again

So in April of 2015 I quit smoking. That lasted until about a year ago when I started a super stressful job and eventually went right back to it. I’m not at that job anymore and I’ve been trying to quit again for about the last 3 months, so I figured I would post this to give me more motivation to do what I really want to do and not go back to it! 🙂 I’m finally feeling determined and I know it’s more a mind game than anything else. Here’s to quitting! 🙌🏻

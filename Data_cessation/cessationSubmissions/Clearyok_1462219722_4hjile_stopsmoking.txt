Started smoking again after 2+years of being a non smoker..The Wife is going to kill me if the cigarettes don't.

I smoked for 15 years or so. I stopped when I got into the corporate world. Just because of stress (horrible justification) of the job and studying for my CFA exam started smoking again. I had a few drinks a couple times with buddies and thought "once or twice, hell I won't go back to that"...Wrong.            

Now I'm up to a pack every other day. The first time I quit I had to use Chantix and can't really get it without the wife finding out. It's just too expensive to hide. Wondering if I should just bite the bullet and tell her (going to break her heart) or try lozenges. They...ehhh... partially worked last time but I always regressed after a month or so.

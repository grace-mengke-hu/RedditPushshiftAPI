Can you ever get back to your first cigarette high?

Been smoking maybe 20 years, mainly roll ups. I would imagine my taste buds are next to nothing and I wouldn't say the get any kind of high from smoking. Its just pure addiction and habit. So if I stopped could i ever get back to that original first cigarette high or have I permanently damaged my taste buds and whatever other receptors in my brain?

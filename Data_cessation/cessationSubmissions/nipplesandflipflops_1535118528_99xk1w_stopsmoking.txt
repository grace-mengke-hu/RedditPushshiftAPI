Hello, I'm new here and I want to quit!

I have smoked for about 5 years now and I'm tired of this loop. Yesterday afternoon I bought 6 packs, and before I went to sleep I decided to stop smoking.
Even though quitting smoking is something I really want, I'm also a porn addict and would rather keep smoking than going back to porn.
Therefore I'm scared. Any pointers?

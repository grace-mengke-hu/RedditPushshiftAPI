So today was hard. Real fucking hard - got the closest I possibly could to caving

A bit of background - I resigned from a long hours, low-pay, uninspiring job in another town late last year, a bunch of other shit happened over the course of this time but long story short I really benefited from little bit of a break, and the past few months have been about recuperation, began to start enjoying life, friends and family again apart from the fact that I was still smoking. I'm 25, been smoking since I was 17, the last few years almost a pack a day. Anyway, after much quit and fail of late, I'm the furthest I've ever been, 2 weeks in a couple of hours. I very very very nearly would never have gotten to the 14 day mark... Here's my day. 

I had a last-minute job interview this morning that I was very unprepared for (I got the call late in the day yesterday). This was strange because although I was a little panicky I KNOW fo sho I would have been a ball of anxiety if I were still smoking. Regardless, the nerves were there. Additionally, I am currently living with my grandmother and I'm her primary caregiver at the mo just because of some family and financial issues. She suffered a minor stroke this morning which left her with only partial control of the entire right side of her body. So straight back from my interview (which was average at best) and to the hospital for the whole day, only got home at about 6 pm. I've been so overwhelmed that all I wanted was a cigarette. I couldn't resist, walked to the gas station and bought a pack. When I got home I procrastinated for a long time but finally soaked the pack under the tap/faucet. Didn't smoke a single puff. I am relieved but also fucked off. Still stressed, craving pretty bad and also what a waste of money on the pack! 

Still, I will not smoke today. Nothing is stressful enough to smoke my fellow quitters, old and new! Aint nobody got time for that!

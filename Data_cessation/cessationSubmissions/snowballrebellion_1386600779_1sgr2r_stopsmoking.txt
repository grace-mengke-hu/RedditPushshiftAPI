Morning Cough? Other side effects positive or negative after quitting?

Almost at 140 days! Does any one else experience a heightened gag sensitivity in the morning? Since I've quit, it has not gotten better and I'll be hacking up a lung until about 9am. 
On a positive note, I have NEVER slept better in my life! And food is starting to become more rich in flavor. 
What side effects have you noticed that were unexpected or maybe unique to you?

Quit smoking exactly 72 hours ago

From a pack a day to nothing

72 hours ago I had my last cigarette threw away almost an entire pack, normally I’d tell myself “I’ll quit after I finish this pack” but decided to stop playing that game with myself. Played video games all day Saturday to keep my mind off smoking and then went for a long bike ride Sunday to help myself also. It was tough but I made it. Went back to work today and surprisingly didn’t have too many cravings. First thing I did when I walked in was told everyone in my office I quit, to prevent myself from asking to bum a smoke later. It helped a ton. 

On the ride home I almost stopped by a hookah spot but decided against it at the last minute. Decided it was too close to cigarettes and didn’t want to spoil my good run. Maybe in a month Ill go.

After 25 days I've quit I still can't sleep - life is harder than ever

I was a smoker for 17 years and I decided to quit this first January. Since day 1 I suffer of insomnia - I barely sleep 2-3 hour/day.

I am so tired I can't even do some sport. I am very nervous and always in bad mood. I feel very weak mentally and physically and my social and working life is going horrible. I am very happy I don't smoke anymore, but I am depressed as fuck for all the rest. Never thought it would be so hard! 

I really hope I go back to normal soon or I'll lose job & friends! I need to sleep!

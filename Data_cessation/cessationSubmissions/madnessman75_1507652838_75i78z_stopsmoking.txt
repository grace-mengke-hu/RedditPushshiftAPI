3 weeks smoke free. I'm certain that I'm done for good.

Hey everyone, 

I've not really been a long time smoker, only 3 years. A month ago, I was a pack-a-day kind of person (twice as much on weekends). I didn't ever expect to get that into ciggerettes when I bought my first pack. Even still, I had no intention of quitting. 

Only recently have I realized how much of my own personal image was built around smoking. Instead of actually filling my life with things I wanted to do, I would spend time sitting outside. Why work on who you are when you can have a smoke break instead? 

But I'm done now. For the past three weeks, I haven't even been able to stomach a single drag. The hardest part hasn't been the cravings, but instead coming to terms with who I am without the crutch of tobacco. I've come to tolerate, even enjoy, the Sisyphean struggle of being a Smokerâ„¢. The shortness of breath, social stigma, financial burden, and the morning lung-mustard made up my boulder that I was more than content to push up the mountain. 

Now that boulder has slipped from my grasp and fallen back to the bottom, and I can see just how absurd the whole thing is. 

I'm not hoping that I'm done for good. Hope is for beggars. I'm accepting that I will never make sense of the habit I love so much. So I'm ready to go back down and find a new boulder to take up my time. One that I will be even happier to struggle with.

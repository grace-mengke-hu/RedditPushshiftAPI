Is there a way to elimate the triggers that make you want to smoke?

I haven't smoked in a little more than a month but I am really struggling. I have so many things that make me want to smoke. Everytime I want to shit I want to smoke, when I am having peaceful quiet alone time I want to smoke, when I am shooting the breeze with my friends I want to smoke, after a workout I want to smoke.

Is there anything I can do to eliminate these triggers?

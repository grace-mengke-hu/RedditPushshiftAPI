This is horrible. I literally want to eat all the time. When does it stop?

Hey guys, I've been smoke-free since February. I've read all about gaining weight and stuff, so I've started to excercise at the same time to avoid it. The trouble is, I can't shake food cravings, especially sugary ones, and I've never had a sweet tooth before. I understand nicotine cessation has to do with blood sugar levels, but it's been four months! Is this normal? Please help & share your experience :)

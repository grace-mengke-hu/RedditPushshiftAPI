So ive smoked for 11 years now

I really really need/want to quit. I was vaping for a while just the cheap vuse e cigs, but i was going through a 3 pack of cartrages a day not so cheap. Now I'm back to cigarettes because it is less than what  was spending on cartrages. So what can I do to kick this. Like is it better to ween off? Or do I just scrap it all together? Im in a super stressful spot in life right now, but this needs to end. I just dont know if I have the self control to just stop completely

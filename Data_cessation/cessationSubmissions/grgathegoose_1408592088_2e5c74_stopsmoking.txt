Trying again, this time with an ecig...Any thoughts on these things?

I've tried cold turkey. I've tried gum. I've tried tapering. Been smoking for over 25 years now, and I am done. Bought a vaporizer thingy yesterday and haven't had a cig since. So, off the smoke, but still on the nicotine. What do you all think about this method? Any and all thoughts/advice appreciated.

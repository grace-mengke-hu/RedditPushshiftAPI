quit for 2 1/2 years and have started one/day again

I need help.

I quit smoking well over two years ago but, over the last month, i've picked up a habit of smoking one a day.. sometimes after work, sometimes at lunch time. I have not bought a pack but I'm really worried that this will spiral down into smoking again.

As silly as it sounds, I feel like I can't stop and am addicted mentally and physically to even that one cigarette a day. I can feel the craving and it takes effort not to smoke more or let one turn into "well, two wouldn't be bad..". My brain itself doesn't want to give up simply getting out of the office at lunch but then I'd see people smoking and it'd be difficult not to simply ask for one and join them.

Does anyone else have experience with this? Do you have advice for how to stop this habit before it becomes worse? I just need help or to hear from someone who has experienced this. I'm so disappointed in myself and really scared.

Time to pony up.

Hi. I visited this sub over a year ago as a non-smoker of 2 years. And then last summer I took a tumble and gave myself an excuse to pick up smoking again. [Here's my sob story](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3c9pf7/suck_less/) if you care.

* I want quit so I can run a half marathon again.
 
* I want quit so I can work out with my friends again without being petrified of them noticing that I can't breathe worth shit.

* I want to quit so that I am not a complete hypocrite (see link)

* I want to quit for my dog.

I have half a pack in my purse. Smoking one tonight on the deck under the stars and then I'm putting the rest under the faucet.

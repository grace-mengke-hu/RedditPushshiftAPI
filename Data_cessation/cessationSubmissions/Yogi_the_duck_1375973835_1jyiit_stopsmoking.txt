After all this time, I'm finally back.

Now I'm right back at it. I've been smoking for the past 6 years (since I was 14). It started as a conversation starter and socially made me more comfortable. Soon I started smoking every time I would smoke weed or get drunk (which soon enough became every day) and I was smoking every day. I did this for about 3 years, maybe 4 or 5 cigarettes a day. I was then sent to rehab at 17, and for 5 months I was sober, clean and free from nicotine. But lo and behold, no more than a week of my return from rehab did I pick up smoking cigarettes again and drinking. I drank very heavily for a year and went from smoking 4 cigarettes a day (marlboro smooths) to 2 packs a day (smooth 100's). I got sober July 5th of last year and since then smoking has been my crutch. Whenever I get nervous in my sobriety, I smoke. I quit recently from april-july. July 4th came around and again, anxiety kicked in and I smoked.
I've been *trying* (which is a very loose word) to quit again, so I bought an E cig, but I keep going back to regular smokes. I can't do this anymore. I'm only 20, I can't breathe, it hurts to swallow anything, I have no apetite and my teeth hurt. I hate this feeling and I hate the withdrawals but I know that it will only get better.

Anyways, I figured I'd share my story. If anyone else in sobriety has any tips on how to battle sober anxiety other than smoking or if anyone has any pro tips on quitting, I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks guys.

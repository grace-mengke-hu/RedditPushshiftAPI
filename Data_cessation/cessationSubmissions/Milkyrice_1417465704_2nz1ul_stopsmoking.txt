Day 30 of no smoking. I think i'm going to celebrate with a cigarette

or not.  


Just finished stage1 of the patch and am now wearing stage 2. It feels pretty good not smoking. I've tried a few methods before such as the gum, cold turkey, as well as the patch before. Out of the 3 i've stayed off smoking the longest by using the patch(but only 2 weeks before this attempt).

The reason as to why i relapsed from the patch before was because of some of my reasoning and thinking skills. "Oh, it's been 2 weeks and I haven't had a smoke, i'll just take the patch off now since i've kicked the habit." or "it's been a while, i think i'll celebrate with a cigarette". Going from the 21mg/day patch to zero was harder than I expected.


This time i'm going to see the whole 8 week program through, wean myself off and see what happens.

But seriously, does anyone else find that browsing /r/stopsmoking makes them crave a cigarette even more?

Day 1 after 22 years

Both my parents were heavy smoker, so smoking was deeply ingrained in my daily life. I started very young and I've smoked for 22 years (20-25 cigs a day for years). 

Last year my father died at the age of 62. Due to smoking. My brother and I had to decide about stopping the machines. I held my fathers hand while he died as a result of addiction to nicotine and I didn't stop smoking.  I'm an intelligent person, I really am. And I knew, he died because of his addiction. And I knew I was addicted too. And I knew, all this pain I felt was because of his addiction. And I knew, if I wouldn't stop, I would hurt someone I loved the same way in the future. But I didn't stop. I'm ashamed of that.

It took me way more than a year, but today is my first "full" day as a no-smoker. I'm not going to smoke again. Period. It's kind of a long day today, I'm a bit irritated and bitchy, but it will get better tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow. Or the day after that. 

I'm not going to smoke again because I don't want anybody to hold my hand while I'm dying on something I did to myself. 

Just wanted to tell you this.

72 max is all I've got

So the problem is that I'm not a heavy smoker, I buy a pack every three days (ish) smoke a single cigarette and throw the whole pack away. 

I'm a full time student and worker to pay for my school while I live at home and neither of my parents smoked. I'm a runner whose eats rather healthfully so I'm not worried about working out more. 

I have no f***ing clue how to make it more than 3 days without making a stupid choice. I'm sick of feeling alienated and having my family pissed at me. I've tried imagining my 10 year old brother looking at me while I light up and I feel like a giant prick for not having any self control. How the hell do I talk myself through cravings that last for hours at a time?

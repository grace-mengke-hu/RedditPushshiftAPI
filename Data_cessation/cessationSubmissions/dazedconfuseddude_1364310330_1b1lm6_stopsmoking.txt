I'M FUCKING READY!!!!!!!!!

Finished Carr's book. Stopped last night. I'm fucking ready to do this. Get the poison out of me. 

Brainwashed?! FUCK THAT! IT'S MY BRAIN! 

I'm taking back my money, lungs, body, and brain. 

EAT A DICK CIGARETTES! EAT A BOWL OF DICKS! 

Someone fucking badge me the fuck up! 

Badge me up, botty!!

Think YOU can't do it? BULLSHIT. 

Read that EASYWAY book, get your head out of your ass and fucking stop. 

EDIT: It has officially been 24 hours. I worked all day, got an emotional when my ex contacted me out of the blue, drank coffee, drove in rush hour traffic, ate three meals and just finished jerking off -- ALL WITHOUT A CIGARETTE!  It was easy. That little motherfucking monster tried his hardest in traffic and after jerking off to get me to feed him even a PUFF of smoke. I told him to fuck the fuck off and enjoy the slow death I'm going to force him to suffer though.  Me?  No suffering. STRONG AS A FUCKING BULL! COCK SURE! BALLS DEEP IN A NON SMOKING WORLD!! 

EDIT 2: Day three! At this point I am gleefully doing a jig on the slow dying corpse of the NicoBeast within. What amazes me most is its tenacity. Even in the thrall of death it whispers to me. Tries to convince me that I should smoke on the way home from work. Or maybe sneak a puff from a friend's cigarette. All I can do is LAUGH AT IT! The misguided arrogance of the NicoBeast has gone from mildly amusing to down right annoying. It doesn't know when it has lost. It's pathetic to watch it all shriveled up and struggling to survive. I've been drinking extra water and jogging at night after work to sweat the toxins out even further. My body is finally MINE. For the first time in FIFTEEN YEARS... I am in control of myself, my choices and my body. I am now deep inside the non-smoker side of the world. Wrapped in the velvet embrace of its smells and tastes. When i talk to people I don't speak low to prevent expelling any nasty breath in their direction, because i am confident in my minty fresh breath! 

I AM THE MOTHERFUCKING MASTER OF THE NICOBEAST NOW! BOW DOWN BEFORE YOUR NEW LORD AND SAVIOR, BEAST! BOW DOWN AND LICK THE SHIT OFF MY BOOT BECAUSE THAT IS ALL YOU ARE GOOD FOR: SHITLICKING!!

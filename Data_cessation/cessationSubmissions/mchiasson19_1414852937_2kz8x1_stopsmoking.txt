Today's the day.... kicking out the crutch.

Howdy, reddit. This is my first post ever, and I've decided that today is the day I finally kick the (butt) bucket. I've been smoking around 2 packs per day for about a year now, and I'm going to need all the help I can get. I've smoked for four years; as a stress relief, an escape from my problems, and as a crutch to help me through some serious mental health issues. But I don't want to be controlled anymore. I want to take command of my mind and my body and turn my health around. Halp!

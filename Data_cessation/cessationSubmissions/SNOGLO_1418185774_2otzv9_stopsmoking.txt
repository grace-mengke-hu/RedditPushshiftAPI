A new exercise record for me and some insight into how I feel at this point.

Today I ran for 1 hour straight without even thinking of stopping at any time.  I wouldn't have dreamed of that when I was smoking or even a few weeks after.  

I've been reluctant to start running again because 

1.  I was afraid I had fucked up my lungs too badly and was scared to know.  (~10 pack-years under my belt)

2.  I knew it would be torture for a while.

3.  Who has the goddamned energy to run anyway?

Well, I wouldn't say it was torture, but it was tough.  I had to overcome the side-stich, the achy chest, achy knees, etc.  But now that I feel I'm finally back in shape, I couldn't even dream of ever going back.  

I love the daze I get (I guess it's runner's high?) after about 40 minutes of solid running.  I love how much better I sleep at night, not only because of no smoke, but also because I get a great workout.  I love how I'm finally coughing up stuff once and for all.  

**Most of all I love how I'm finally taking my health into my own hands.**  I'm getting ahead of the curve here and it makes me feel very reassured.  

So running is now my reason to not ever pick up a cigarette again.  I want to keep this feeling I have forever.

*PS:  I know a lot of people have a hard time quitting because of social drinking situations.  It was one of the reasons for my reoccurring relapses.  I had to stop drinking to get serious about this.  Head over to /r/stopdrinking if you think that's the main reason you keep backsliding.  That community is fan-fucking-tastic and your health is worth giving up something as worthless as booze.*

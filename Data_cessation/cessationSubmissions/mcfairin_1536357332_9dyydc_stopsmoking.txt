I feel so lost

I've quit smoking before. Hell, I use to be subscribed to this subreddit and I left because it had been years that I quit and I didn't think I needed it anymore. 

I moved to a new location with my husband and I now work remotely. I feel myself bored and not having much to do and I went through a rough transition. I use to be walking distance from my job next to the beach and now I feel stuck in a place that I hate that's the opposite of the beach. Its only temporary but it's still two years.

I picked it back up because of sadness/stress and now I can't stop. I don't know what to do to get back to my happy self again. I hide my habit so no one knows so it's a constant worry that I will get caught. My life revolves around it once again. 

Do I read the Alan Carr book again? What has worked for you to help you quit *again*

I appreciate any help or advice at this point. I feel so sad and alone. I wish I could go back to the day where I picked it up again and remind myself of the misery I would be living in. Sorry if this makes no sense or is rambling, I am just beyond myself right now.

First 12 Hours without any cigarettes completed.

Hey Guys, I just decided to quit smoking 12 hours ago and haven't smoked any cigarette since. I am a smoker since I was around 17 and now I'm 26. Can't believe I have been smoking since last 9 years. I usually smoke around 10 cigarettes a day. Any tips you guys would like to give me? There's a voice in my head which is saying that just light one cigarette and take a drag or two and throw it. I just want to quit it. This is my first attemp to quit, I have tried to reduce earlier but never tried quitting. I just hope I have the strength and will to kick this habit out. Thanks.

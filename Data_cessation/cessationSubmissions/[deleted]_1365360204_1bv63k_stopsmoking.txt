Caffeine and alcohol causing big problems for me.

I think I have a tendency to overcaffeinate and that leads to reduced will power+smoking. Strong association between coffee and cigarettes doesn't help.

The same goes for alcohol.

Pretty sure if I can just learn moderation with those two substances, I might be able to make it this time.

I think I’m to emotionally unstable to quit smoking!

Hi, 

Before you give this the eyes roll - hear me out I’ve tried quitting a few times over the last couple of years - I can quit but what’s left is a angry, isolating - mean human, who I spinning out of control, binging on food. Is it worth it? I fee crazy and it lasts until I start smoking again. 

Longest I’ve quit is three months - I put on 30lbs and didn’t speak to a souls for weeks at a time.

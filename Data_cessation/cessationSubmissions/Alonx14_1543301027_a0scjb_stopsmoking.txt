Short-time smoker still having side effect while quitting, is it possible?

Hello reddditors,
I’ve been a smoker for just roughly 70 days around 10-15 cigarettes a day which is nothing compared to most people out here.  I thought that i should be able to quit easy because of that without any complications. But right the second day of non-smoking i have woken up on some kind of sound hallucination i believed to be my alarm. And now, day after I’ve had dreams so dreadful that I’ve woken up because of them.

Why is it worrying me is because I am the person that literally never has/ rembebers his dreams(and by never i mean literally once a year).

Are these symptoms of nicotine-relapse or am i just being weird and should try tl find a cause somewhere different? 
Thank you

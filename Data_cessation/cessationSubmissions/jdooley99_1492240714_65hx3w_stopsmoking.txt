Severe diarrhea

Was a pack a day smoker for about 20 years. I'm    7 weeks in. Not cold turkey. On the patch and still about 2 a day. 5-6 a couple times I've had a "few" beverages.

Anyway 4 days ago I woke with severe diarrhea and hasn't gone away yet. Finally took an immodium today and was good for 6-7 hours now back at it. Anyone else dealing with this? I mean when it's going bad I'm on the toilet every 20 minutes. My bum can't take much more. May have to buy stock in immodium

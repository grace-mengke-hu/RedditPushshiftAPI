Stopping this morning!

This morning, my friend and I were having breakfast. I checked my pocket for cigarettes only to find I had finished my pack last night, so I looked at him and said, "You know, I think I'll quit smoking today."

I've been a moderate to heavy smoker (a pack every one to two days) for one and a half years. I'm the only one in my family who smokes; they don't badger me about it, but they have told me they want me to quit. Part of my motivation is how proud they'll be.

Wish me luck!

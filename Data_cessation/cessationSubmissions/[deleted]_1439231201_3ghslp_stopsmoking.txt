I just need some encouragement...

I was doing so well for a while as I'm sure so many people here can relate to. But after about 4 months I'd get drunk and start having one every couple weeks or so. I'd reset my badge and move on, ashamed and disappointed. I keep trying to get back where I was but I keep smoking a cig every now and then. And I feel like I'm having an out of body experience where I watch helplessly as my body smokes, and slowly falls back into old habits. I know it's only one now and then but I can feel myself getting dragged back into nicotine dark, black abyss. Those who made it a while and then broke, how were you able to get back where you once were?

*Mental Progress* I no longer want a cig when my bf goes outside to have one

I was stupidly emotionally attached to having a smoke together on the balcony it is always what we did to calm down to have heart to hearts. I used to have to go hide in the bathroom or pace back and forth or stand next to him just to 'smell the smoke'
Now I just laugh at him shivering in the wind/rain and stretch out my legs on the sofa then tell him off for stinking of smoke!
This is a big step for me so wanted to share :)

Anyone else?

Been smoking since I was 14, 20 now and have decided to stop and haven’t smoke for a week now. Tbh finding it easier than I thought which is strange but my skin is getting really bad? I’ve always suffered with some spots not loads tho but now my forehead is covered and they are big too I thought stopping would make my skin better and not worse :(

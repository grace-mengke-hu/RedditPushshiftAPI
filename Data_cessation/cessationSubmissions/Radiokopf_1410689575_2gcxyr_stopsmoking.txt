Hangover on day 40!

Ive been out with friends drinking and having fun, there where somkers and when they went out for a smoke i went with them once. Just because i used to, not to smoke.

Later today i go meet with a girl i like, and im not as wasted as i used to be when smoking :)
Not Smoking feels very normal and default allready...

So for everyone on the first 2 Weeks: It gets a LOT easyer

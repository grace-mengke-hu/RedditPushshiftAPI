Got very drunk on Friday....

I got *really* drunk on Friday.

I went to a tiki bar, hung out outside with my friends, surrounded by smokers. 

AND DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT OR CONSIDER SMOKING!!!

This is a big success for me, drinking, without smoking has always been hard. And I've never gotten very drunk (I'm not proud of the fact that I drank too much and had a wicked hangover the next day) without breaking and mooching a smoke off someone. But this time I stood outside, talked to smokers, and didn't smoke!!

Feedback from athletes who have quit

I've been smoke free for 115 days now after smoking for 8 years. I also still work out and play soccer a lot. I'd like people to share with me how long it took them to really get their lungs back during workouts and athletics.  Or even something you did to help bring your lungs back. I could tell a difference over the first few weeks clearing my system but I still feel like my lungs are holding me back a a bit.  Thanks in advance

I got reminded the reason why i quit again, need some help

i quit smoking over a year up until 2 weeks ago.
it started with social smoking with friends thinking what harm 1 cig would do, well look at me now i'm back where i started

i've been smoking about half a pack for 2 weeks now and can already feel the damage of that alone, heavy breathing, waking up with a sore throat etc. this was my reason to quit smoking in the first place, i guess i have to reset my badge now.

but don't worry i'll quit.  right after this pack.

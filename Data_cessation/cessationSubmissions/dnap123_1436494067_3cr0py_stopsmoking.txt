Anyone reading this who hasn't quit yet... Don't unsubscribe.

I smoked for 4 years throughout college and by the end I was smoking half a pack a day, or more. I finished school in may, and have been smoke free for 3 weeks tomorrow. I subscribed to this sub to help me find the motivation to quit.

At times I wanted to unsubscribe so badly but I didn't. And today I just realized that HOLY SHIT, IT WORKED! I'm now subscribed to this sub, but I don't even smoke anymore! It's not just a promise I made to myself anymore- I have fulfilled the promise. I just wanted to say this is an incredible resource to those of you who have been preparing yourselves for quitting.

No matter how silly it seems, seeing the success story posts pop up on my feed each and every day really had an impact on my will to quit. And for that, I thank you.

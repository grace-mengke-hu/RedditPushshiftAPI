Wife's Smoking is Driving Me Nuts

I've been smoke free for 2 1/2 weeks yet my wife has still not quit. I've taken up running and I'm doing really great at it. But every time she lights up in the house I want to rip my eyeballs out. I've tried to gently suggest that she goes outside but that happens maybe once of every 10 cigarettes she smokes.  Let's hope at she either starts going outside or this'd welding of mania goes away soon.

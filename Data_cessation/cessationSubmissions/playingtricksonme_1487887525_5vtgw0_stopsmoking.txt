Husband smoked but I didn't

My husband went out of town and I really wanted to smoke. We are quitting together and it has been almost a month since my last cigarette. 

It turns out that my husband smoked a few cigarettes while he was gone. It really made me want to smoke some too but I didn't. 

I'm still a non-smoker.

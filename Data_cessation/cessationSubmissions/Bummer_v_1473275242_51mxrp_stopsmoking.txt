Day 3

I feel like day 3 is an eye-opener. My body feels like shit: I can't fucking poop, I have heartburn, I eat like a fucking pig, I can't sleep well, I'm always tired, I can't stop bitting my nails, I sometimes feel like crying because I can't take it anymore and my throat hurts when I wake up in the morning.

But you know what? I feel like a fucking queen. I'm feeling proud of myself, I'm feeling proud of my achievement and I'm fucking happy of what I did for now. I was nervous and I wasn't sure I would be able to do it. But I did it. And I'm still doing it. Is it easy? Absolutely not. But I'm doing it. And it feels fucking good. 

I thought I would miss smoking. And I do - for now. I miss it with my coffee, every morning. But I know I won't miss it forever. 

Every craving remind me to not be over-confident. And everytime I don't smoke, I remind myself to be proud of what I'm doing. I just wanted to share this with you. :)

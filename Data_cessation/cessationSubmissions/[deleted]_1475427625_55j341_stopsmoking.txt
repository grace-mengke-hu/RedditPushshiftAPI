Just say "no"

I quit roughly 3.5 years ago. To get here, I burned the old school anti-drug motto in my head: "just say 'no'".

Every craving is your mind asking "do you want a cigarette"? 

There are only two ways to answer this:

- If you say "yes", you will lose all your hard work and you will die from your addiction. You will not beat the odds. You will not quit again when work slows down. A painless cure for lung cancer will not come save you.

- If you say "no", it will suck in the moment, but the craving will pass, and eventually you will forget why you ever wanted to smoke in the first place. Your life will move on and you will not die from this pointless addiction.

Your answer to "do you want a cigarette" is a matter of life and death. It's an extreme statement, but it's the truth. There is no quicker and more painful way to the grave than saying "yes" to the question.

Any time your brain poses that question, you must decide to say "no". Each time this question comes up, remember that this is the most important decision in your life. The only difference between me and many of you is that I have answered correctly thousands of times. You will do the same.

Always say "no".

Good luck.

Here we go...(cough hack spit cough)

Well just finished a cig, pack is empty, pulled down the cellophane and wrote 10 10 2014 and stuck it in a place I can view it on occasion. Hard part is I got another chainsmoker/boozehound in the house. I stopped drinking BTW 27 days ago, feeling great about that and the cigs have filled that void to a point of ridiculousness. Not sure if this is a good idea but what the heck. I got up today at 7:30 and went out to my Dad's for breakfast, I did not smoke until about noon. That was refreshing, and when I smoked today... dizzy and coughing (chest cold) and holy crap that last cig tonight was a real chimney fire. Hope I haven't bit off more than I can chew. C U Tomorrow.. I have a busy day planned to keep my hands occupied (painting ceilings and walls)
Oh joy!

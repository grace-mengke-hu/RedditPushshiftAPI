Want to Quit Smoking?

Hi all, 

I’m doing a study on quit smoking that invites individuals who smoke at least 10 cigarettes to quit smoking through evidence based e-health apps that utilize mindfulness and acceptance and commitment therapy techniques that have been proven to help people to reduce the consumption of quit cigarettes or to stop smoking at all. I have arranged with the developers so that these apps are free for those who are serious about quitting smoking.

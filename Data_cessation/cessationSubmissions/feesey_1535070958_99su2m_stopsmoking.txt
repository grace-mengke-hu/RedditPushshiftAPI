Quitting cigarettes, wanting to continue with vapes, pipes &amp; cigars

I want to quit smoking cigarettes. I've been thinking about quitting them ever since I got my vape. I successfully quit for about 3 months when I first got my vape and did smoke my pipe occasionally in that time. I never really thought about cigarettes when vaping, but at some points there were some urges and I gave in with the excuse that I'm still on the nicotine anyway and a cigarette can't make me relapse if I'm still on it anyway.

I'd like to hear from some people that have quit cigarettes, but still smoke pipes &amp; cigars about their experiences with that. It is my decision to continue with pipes &amp; cigars and I hope you can respect that.

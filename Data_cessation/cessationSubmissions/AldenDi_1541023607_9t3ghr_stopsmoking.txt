A friend recently came to visit, and he brought me a nice cigar, how do I tell him I can't smoke it politely?

We're getting together this weekend, and will probably have a night of heavy drinking. I haven't seen him in a couple of years, and I don't talk much about the fact that I quit smoking a little over a year and a half ago. I don't blame him for not knowing, but when I told him after he showed me the cigar he just kinda laughed it off and said "Well it's a good thing you don't inhale cigars, right?"  


He's clearly planning on lighting his up this weekend, and I'm not sure how to tell him I'm fine with him smoking but that I don't want to do it with him. I even don't mind him doing it around me, I still love the smell, but if I puff on a cigar I know my nicotine levels will spike and I'll be right back to day one of quitting again. I'm just not sure how to tell him to go ahead without me without it killing the mood or ruining the reunion.

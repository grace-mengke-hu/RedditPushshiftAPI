30 days!

The month kind of flew by, honestly.

Pack a day. 12 years. But, I've quit for 8 months before... TWICE. So a part of my head isn't letting me get too excited.

The best part, though? I also need to drop some weight. Like a lot. So, now, I can run. For a while. Without losing my breath. My sweat doesn't smell like an ashtray when I work out.

Food that's good for you actually tastes GOOD. Do you know how fucking good spinach is? It's fucking good. Fruit makes my mouth explode now.

So keep at it. I'll make it past that 8 month mark this time around. And hopefully won't be as big.

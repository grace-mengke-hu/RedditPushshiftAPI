question about sinus problems

I'm about 70 (give or take) days without cigarettes but I still have very bad sinus/mucus problems. Every morning my nose is blocked on at least one side and I have a sore throat and I need to get rid of mucus in my throat. I've also been having problems with blocked ears too. 

I used to wake up with mucus when I was smoking, but I've never had problems with a blocked nose or blocked ears until after I quit. I don't think I'm sick because I feel fine otherwise. 
I don't know if this is still my recovery from smoking or if it's something I should get checked out at the doctors.

Has anyone else had similar problems?

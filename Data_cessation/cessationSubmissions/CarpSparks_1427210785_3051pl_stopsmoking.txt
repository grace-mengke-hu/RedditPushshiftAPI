Day 10 and Feeling STRONGER THAN EVER!!!!

I have been smoking a pack a day for 20 years.  quit cold turkey.  During the quit, I realized that Coffee was a big draw to smokes so I cut that out as well and started running.  I know it seems like a lot but let me share a few positive things so far: It's the march and I look like a have a tan.  (blood circulation must be coming back)  and no more shaking (No Coffee)  looking forward to the future.

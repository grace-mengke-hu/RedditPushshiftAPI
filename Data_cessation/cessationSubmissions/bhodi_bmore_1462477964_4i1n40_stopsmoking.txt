Sweet Jeebus this is hard.

I'm doing pretty well (approaching 100 hours according to the Smokefree app), but what a head game this is -- those little demonic voices in my head, scarier even than Ted Cruz, telling me "just run down to the store and get a pack, smoke a few, and you'll be okay". So far, I'm winning the battle -- I'll only be okay if I never smoke again -- but when will the voices go away!?!?

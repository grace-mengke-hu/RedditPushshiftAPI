Thinking of creating a before and after smoking website to encourage people to quit smoking and then help keep themselves clean

Hi,

I used to be a smoker for 12 years (smoked almost 2 packs a day) and I've been off from the cigarettess for 10 full days now (did some proper jogging yesterday first time in years and it felt great). Though I'm still overly anxious and even a bit scared about relapsing. However, I need something to keep my mind occupied.

Hence, I thought of creating a website (web/app developer here, but with a background in design) where people who have gotten rid of smoking could document their progress, which could possibly help those who are going through with it currently, and also encourge those who are still smoking to stop.

So the idea is to have that before and after solution, but in reverse. Which means that the submitter would upload two (or possible more) pictures: one when they used to smoke, which would be followed by submissions of their progress so far, that also includes a possible comment as well as a timestamp.

If you think you could contribute somehow, then let me know. Feedback, ideas and constructive criticism would also be nice!

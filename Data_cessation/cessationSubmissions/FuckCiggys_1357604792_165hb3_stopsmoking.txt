Don't cheat. 

**Don't Cheat!**

I feel that my quitting success comes from being serious about not cheating.

I remember when I quit previously. I started sneaking in mooched ciggys from people on special occasions, then I started buying packs and only smoking a few. Soon after that, I was pack-a-day-gay for the little brown nicky dick.

Fuck it. I can't cheat. It's how it is. Not even one. 

Knowing this keeps me from smoking. I know there is no "one ciggy" and "one ciggy" means I WILL be a full time smoker. 

So what if I could get away with smoking a few puffs, or maybe a cigar, or the perfect ciggy moment presents itself? I am erring on the side of caution and just sticking with the story: "I can't even take a puff".

Knowing and believing, with 100% certainty, that you cannot cheat takes away the anguish. If you never take another puff, then you will never be a smoker.

**Besides. What is ONE CIGGY going to do for you? That's like trying to satisfy a raging boner with one pump. Worthless. Fuck it, fuck them.**

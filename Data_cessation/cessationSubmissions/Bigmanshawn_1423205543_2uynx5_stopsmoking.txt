Captains Log, day 125.

What's to say, its totally worth it after smoking for 20 years.  I still have some issues, but things are gradually healing and my lung capacity is improving a tiny bit every day.   I still get the occasional urge, or need to "do" but they are mild and quickly pass.  The smoking dreams seem to have finally stopped (the bad kind) and in general much healthier.

A lot of people I work with frequently have regularly commented on how much healthier I look.  Just an air of someone not sick from the poisons of smoking.   And the smells... its so awesome not to smell so horrible.  I have actually totally switched positions and have a hard time sitting next to someone who just smoked because the stink is unbearable.   

For those of you just quitting keep it up! One day at a time, and remember 1 is to many.  Its worth it!

Those of you who are beyond me, you know how good it is already and thanks for the support during my hell.

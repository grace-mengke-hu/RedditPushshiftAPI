Quit started again several times but now is the time to quit forever!

I have read Allen Carr's book several years ago and it changed my life. Quitting seemed so easy to me and it really helped! Well... at least for a year or so. Then the old habit kicked in again and I kinda forced myself to start smoking again. I was studying abroad, hanging around with a group of people and literally EVERYBODY smoked. I was weak at that time. I couldn't resist, I kinda wanted to belong to this group. 

I quit again and after a few weeks/months I started again - all with the same excuses: I just smoke one cigarette and everything will be fine. Yeah bullshit. 

But now the time has come. I just can't stand smoking again. I hate the smell. I hate it to leave my cosy, warm flat at 11pm to buy a pack of cigarettes. I hate the coughs. I hate the fact that I am much more likely to die of cancer than a non-smoker. I hate to spend â‚¬5 for a pack of cigarettes. 

It all ends now. It's just the beginning. But this one will last forever.

For all those people who have had similar experiences than me, you are not alone and it is never too late to quit. 

Stay strong and all the best!

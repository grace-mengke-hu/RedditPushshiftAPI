Going to stop vaping for good starting tomorrow

I started first smoking, then switched to vaping one year and half ago, and I really regret it, it only generated problems at home, made me addicted and lose confidence in myself.

I am also tired of fapping, and I have decided that starting tomorrow I'm going to quit both bad habits for good

My main motivation is to get a healthier lifestyle (I work out calisthenics but my diet kinda sucks) and regain much more self-confidence, wish me luck guys !

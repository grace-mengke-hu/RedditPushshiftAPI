1 Year Anniversary in Sight. (small story inside).

Former half a pack smoker for ~5 years reporting in.  I have a small story to tell.  Apologies for the wall of text.

I rented an apartment for nearly 6 years in a quiet suburb.  I was not a smoker when I moved in but became one shortly thereafter--Camel lights baby.  Fast forward about 5 years, say ~winter of 2014/2015 and I received a notice from the apartment complex that they were banning smoking outright on the premises.  I was baffled.  I never smoked indoors, did my deed outside on the balcony, so I was a little pissed.  Well, that plus I was pissing money to the wind on rent and enough was enough.  I bought a house.  

I closed on the house May 1st of last year at ~3pm.  After closing I drove to the property and had a victory smoke outside on the back deck.  I then proceeded to spend the rest of the day (with the help of friends and family) moving all of my possessions from the apartment to the house.  At the end of the night I had a smoke after everyone had left (except one friend) outside.  The next morning the Verizon install guy came to get my FiOS setup.  I left him there with my mother and drove back to the apartment to clean and get the last few remaining things.  I had a smoke on the balcony again, but this time I put it out about half way through.  Something snapped inside me.  I'm done.

It's been 322 days, and I've held my resolve.  It's an expensive, filthy habit and one I'm glad of ridding.  I won't lie though, I have more or less replaced the act of smoking with consuming sweets and munching on pretzel rods when I get the itch.  If I ever did break down though I think I'd at least look to vaping, but I can say that right now it's not even a consideration.  

I quit cold turkey, and so can you.

My mom refuses to stop

I tried getting her to vape, got her a vape, and she then bought herself another one and some juice. she did that for awhile but just didn't want to put in the effort. 
She has smoked alot of her life, she is in her late 40s and, she was diagnosed with breast cancer around 43 and had to quit smoking to undergo treatment. She survived cancer and was cancer free! A few years later, around 45 she started smoking again. I don't know how to get her to quit. It just seems like she doesn't want to put in the effort to quit. I am not a smoker myself, but If please comment if you guys could give me some ideas on how I could help her or get her to quit. 

**Thanks Homies**

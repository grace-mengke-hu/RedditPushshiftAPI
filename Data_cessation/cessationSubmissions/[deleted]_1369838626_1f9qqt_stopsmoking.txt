I dream of cigarettes.

Today will officially be Day 5 around 5:00PM. The past three nights I have been dreaming about smoking. I wake up, think about going to the garage to have one, remember I don't have any, consider going to the gas station for some, and end up fighting with myself on the subject. As if the cravings and physical/emotional changes aren't enough add on fighting with yourself first thing every morning. Its just very frustrating.

Is it too late to quit smoking?

Hi everyone. Long time lurker here. I'm 23 now.  Finally built up courage to ask for help. I have been smoking since 2013. Its been 5 years now. I smoke around 6-10 cigarettes a day. I have been trying to quit since past year but have had no success at all.  Recently i have developed a very wrong mindset that anyways the damage is already done and there is no recovering from it. I will catch up cancer in future and die anyways so why bother. I have started seeing fine lines on my face and bit of hair loss too. I got so paranoid once that i did a full body checkup once and luckily the reports were normal. How do i get over this fear and actually quit smoking? And if i quit now do I have a real shot of living a healthy lifestyle in future without any health complications?

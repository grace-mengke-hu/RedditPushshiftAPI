I fucked up hard.

So friday night my GF went to the US for 6 months because of her work, and I couldn't help myself but had to go drinking with friends. But after I got wasted pretty bad I started bumming smokes and bought my first pack today after over a year. I feel pretty down right now but can't bring myself to ditch the smokes. I really hate myself for it but it's the only comfort I have right now. 
Sorry about the rant, I just had to get the whole thing from my chest.

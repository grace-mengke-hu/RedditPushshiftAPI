TL,DR: I am sick of relapsing, this time i'll quit for sure!

I have always been lurking in /r/stopsmoking, tried to quit a couple of times and failed.

What always made me smoke again is waking up and not having my cig. I would constantly think about not smoking which aggravates me even more. This time, I am going to try something else. Instead of going a buying this "one cig" I would come here and rant, spill my heart out. 

Thanks to this community, that I have been more conscious about my health and work on improving it. I would like to take a moment and say to all lurkers like me, just get out of your comfort zone and do it.

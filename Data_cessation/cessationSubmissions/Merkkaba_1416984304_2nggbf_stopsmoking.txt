Some thoughts on cravings, smoking in dreams, and power-ups.

So I have noticed that when I'm having cravings throughout the day, it is getting to the point where they are lasting smaller and smaller amounts of time.  I imagine that every craving I have another pocket of residual nicotine is leaving my body.  It is helping me get through the cravings but was wondering if there is any fact to this?  I've heard this from other quitters and found myself passing this on without proper research.  I've looked but found limited information.

Since the smoking in the dreams is so common in this sub, I was wondering if my first question has something to do with this.  Maybe this is my brains way of dealing with the loss of nicotine during the day. Does anyone else feel guilty for smoking in their dreams?  I always do and when I wake up, I think I should have just smoked it and enjoyed it for what it was.

I have been using the thought of power-ups for this round of quitting and I wondered what other people's were?  Power-ups are what I refer to as personal benefits of quitting smoking.  I happen to remember my dreams better for one.  Anyone else have any?

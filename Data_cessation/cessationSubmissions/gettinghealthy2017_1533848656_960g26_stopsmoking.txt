looking for honest answers

when did you stop thinking about smoking? i still think about smoking nonstop especially when i’m around people smoking or pass walkers smoking etc. took a long cab ride today and watched all the smokers, feeling jealous and angry and confused. i enjoy saving money, being healthy, not smelling etc but i have such a jealousy towards people who still smoke. if a smoker is walking ahead of me i’ll was close just to smell the smoke.. does this ever go away?

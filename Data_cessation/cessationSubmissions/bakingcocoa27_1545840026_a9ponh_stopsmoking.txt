Day 5, struggling with winning the mental game

Day 5 of quitting cold turkey.  Smoked 10-ish years, a a pack-ish a day. I’ve made lists of things that I like about being a non-smoker.  Every day I write myself a note with the date on top saying “I’m happy as a non-smoker.  Not one more puff, no matter what.”  I know nicotine is a cruel addiction, and that I’ve enslaved myself for too long.  I know cravings will come and go, maybe forever, but they will pass within minutes and I can survive that.  

Still, my internal mental game is incredibly weak-willed, like I could give in at any moment.  What has worked for you to overcome the demons in your brain?

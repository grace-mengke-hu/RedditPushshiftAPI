I want to quit but I don't know if I can...

My dad had a heart attack recently due to smoking 20 a day for about 40 years. This was a good wake up call for the rest of the family to get up and quit smoking. Consequently I'm the only one left. 

Problem is... I had anorexia a few years back and I turned to cigarettes to speed up my metabolism and suppress my appetite. Once I replaced food with fags, it was easy for the weight to melt off. 

Now I'm healthy again and the cigarettes are a hindrance.. but I'm scared of gaining more weight. I've finally accepted my image and I never ever want to be overweight, but I know it'll happen. 

Sounds stupid, but I'm weighing up cancer against crippling mental issues. Which one do I pick? Someone be the voice of rationality here please.

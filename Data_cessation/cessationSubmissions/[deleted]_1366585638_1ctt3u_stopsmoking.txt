1 week smoke free, and I am pissed as hell

Has anyone else just gotten pissed at everything when they quit?  I find myself raging and I can't stop it.  I feel validated and everyone else is to blame.  I know its the withdrawals because this isn't me but I can't seem to keep calm. How long does this last?

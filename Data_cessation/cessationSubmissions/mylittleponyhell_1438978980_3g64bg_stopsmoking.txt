Crap I just found an unopened pack.

I'm on day 4.  I have had my moments of craving them.  But as I was cleaning out my bag from this weekend I found a pack I had forgotten about and now I'm struggling so hard to not smoke them.  I know I should just soak them in water then toss them but I just can't seem to bring myself to do it.

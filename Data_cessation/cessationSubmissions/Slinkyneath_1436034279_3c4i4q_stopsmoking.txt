Day 6 with patches and lozenges

I'm half way through day 6 and wanted to just use patches for a few weeks, as I've done when I've given up before. Problem is, I keep getting the urge and then have a nicotine lozenge, building up to maybe 8 a day. Really don't know if I should be trying to kick the lozenges or go with it?

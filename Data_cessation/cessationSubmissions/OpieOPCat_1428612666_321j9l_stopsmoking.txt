5 months - Osu!

So as title says it's been 5 month without a cigarette.

Just in case my story helps other people, here it is.

I have been a smoker for 20 years, i smoked a lot of cannabis and tobacco. I managed to quit cannabis two years ago but have been overcompensating with tobacco. 

I then started practising kendo, and it has been a real help in quitting smoking. The difficulty to keep up with my mates during keiko while being a smoker made me realize what i had to gain immediatly from quitting. The discipline required and teached by martial arts helped me stay strong. Every time i was feeling like i'd like a cigarette i'd do pushups or suburi, trust me when you've smoked for twenty years without real physical exercise it makes a really good deterent ;)

Anyway, if you're strugglin with it maybe you could give it a try at your local dojo, it worked for me ;)

Good luck everybody, stay strong.

OSU!

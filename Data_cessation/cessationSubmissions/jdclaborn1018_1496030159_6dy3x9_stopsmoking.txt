Maintaining commitment through stress

During the beginning stages of ceasing to smoke, it is physically and mentally tough, obviously. But it's also an uplifting and energizing feeling to be able to breath, smell, move, run, bike, sleep again normally. It's like being reborn.

At about 2 weeks off smoke, all that novelty is beginning to wear off and I feel like I'm returning to a baseline day-to-day life again. I don't mind not having a smoke after meals. I don't mind having coffee without a cigarette. Actually, it's become pleasant to enjoy those activities just as they are.

The stability weakens when I become stressed out when I have a difficult interaction with my girlfriend. I'll become distraught to the point where I just want to say "fuck it" and go buy a pack. But I haven't. A voice is saying, go buy a pack. Relax. Inhale. Fuck the world. And another voice is saying "Don't. You know damn well those smokes do nothing for you and you will only feel worse once the smoke is over." That knowledge has kept me strong thus far. I still worry the stress will become greater one day and I won't be thinking clearly and break down. My plan is only to remind myself that the cigarette will do nothing but add more stress to the plate. So just let this stress be inside. Invite it in and allow it to sit in my bones. And some time will pass. And that stress will have left. And I didn't need to smoke.

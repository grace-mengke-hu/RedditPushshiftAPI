I smoked when I drank, don't do it!

I haven't really been drinking as much after smoking and each time the cravings have been much worse than when sober and the willpower almost nonexistent.

Last night I went out with the lads and bought a pack. I'm guessing I smoked about 12. The first drag gave a slight buzz but other than that it was horrible. I didn't enjoy any cig, my mouth tasted absolutely horrible and I drank more than I should have due to shame.

Woke up this morning with a pounding headache, a heart beat of 110 and I could almost feel the elevated blood pressure. I missed work because of it and am probably going to get a telling off tomorrow (perhaps an official warning).

I decided I don't want to reset my tracker as I've worked so hard up till now and I want to continue. The next couple of weeks are going to be hard as I go through the withdrawal again. I've decided not to drink for a couple of weeks and when I do I'm going to make sure my friends and girlfriend don't let me out of their sight.

Don't smoke when you drink. No matter how badly you think you want it, it will not help you and you'll feel so much better about yourself the next day. I wish I could have thought of that last night.

Good luck and stay strong guys!

chantix works for me, only 3 days without a cig but staying strong, any advice on how to treat the side effects?

I think Chantix is the cure for my smoking addiction; I have been on it for a week and 2 days and so far so good. The weird dreams and Nausea suck but lung cancer sucks more. I have tried to quit before but have failed, I would recommend this to someone who is having a hard time quieting. but does anyone know what to treat the side effects? that's the only thing I need help with.

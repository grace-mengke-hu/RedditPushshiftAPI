Hard but worth it. Cravings are insanse and make me feel so jittery/ restless, but we’re getting through this!! Every time I think about smoking, or how I don’t have to quit it’s not a big deal, I’ll come on this sub and start reading everybody’s stories. We are all in this together! Healthy living!

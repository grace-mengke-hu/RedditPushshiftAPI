Worst day by far, but still smoke free!

I lost track today of the amount of times that I was so close to giving in and going and getting a pack. But I somehow got through the day. Just really really hoping the next couple days start to get even a little easier. I'm not sure I could handle another day as bad as today. I feel absolutely exhausted from the internal fighting I've had to do with myself today!! 
It just feels like it's going to be this way forever. Someone tell me it won't be like this forever please.

3 Days Quit and My Guts Hate Me

So Monday night at 6PM was my last cigarette. I was supposed to have quit fully by that point, but I was walking a friend home from happy hour after we'd just lost funding for a show we were working on so I caved and had one. But the last three days I have replaced cigarettes with eating LOTS of food and fresh fruit and water.

However, if you were to gauge it by my bowels, you'd think that I'd been eating morgue garbage. My farts howl out of me with a sound and fury that terrifies my dog. The smell is so bad that I actually wince AT MY OWN BRAND. My bedroom smells like a taint. When I'm not exploding mostly-liquid diarrhea three times a day, I'm crapping little tan squiggles that look like baby snakes. 

Can anybody tell me what the fuck is going on?

I've had a pretty lousy diet for a while (almost exclusively meat and pastas with the occasional green thing in there). My diet is still filled with meat and animal proteins but I've tried to incorporate much more fresh fruit - the last few days I've eaten probably a dozen oranges, eight bananas, a package of broccoli, and six Oz of Hemp seeds (kinda like flax).

My first thought was it was stomach cancer, then diet, then nicotine withdrawals, then back around again and again. Anybody else go through this? The cravings are nowhere near as bad as the sheer unadulterated terrors that await my toilet every time I lurch in there for a cisit.

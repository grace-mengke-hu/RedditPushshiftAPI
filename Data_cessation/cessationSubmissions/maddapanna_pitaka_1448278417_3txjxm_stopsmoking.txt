Consider replacement therapy.

I made it 135 days recently after 5 years of attempting quits. This was my longest quit.

Then I had a super-stressful panic attack that led to me buying a pack in a pinch. Then I made it 5 days cold turkey again before I caved _again_ due to stress. Clearly, something had changed.

All this time, I've been skeptical about replacement therapy. The gums, the vaporizers, etc. I don't want to smoke anything anymore. I don't want to pretend I'm smoking. I just want to get on with my fucking life.

A friend recommended lozenges. I'm now on day 3 of using lozenges and guess what? Feels fine, man. This is way easier.

I still plan on getting off nicotine, but the point is that you don't have to beat yourself up and make it harder on yourself than it already is. I was stubborn and refused to try lozenges for 3 years of him recommending them, but now I see the light. Here's to hoping I get off the lozenges eventually too! But price-wise, a pack of smokes is still more expensive, and I'm sure my health is better off for this choice.


Regards,

edit: Should mention, the gum isn't much of an option for me because I have some stomach acid build-up.

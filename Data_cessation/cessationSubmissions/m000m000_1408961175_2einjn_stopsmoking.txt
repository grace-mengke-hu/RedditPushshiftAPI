2 Minutes

It finally hit me! I was about to fall asleep, go out and have a goodnight smoke. Instead, I had my last smoke and already I know I'm free. I'm so glad I won't have to worry about premature death, smelling like an ashtray, and holding back all of my athletic pursuits because of an expensive addiction. Glad to be in it for the long haul, as a non smoker.

2 minutes smoke free, and already its better.

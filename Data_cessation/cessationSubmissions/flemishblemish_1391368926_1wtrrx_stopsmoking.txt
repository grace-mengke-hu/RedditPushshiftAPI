I'm a day late, but...

Congratulations to all of the NYE quitters for making it to a month! You're doing good for yourself and your body, be proud, and don't forget to give yourself a small reward for your success.

And to those who tried and didn't quite make it, don't give up! Seriously! There's no better feeling than the freedom you experience once you finally break away, so keep working at it and don't give up on yourselves :)

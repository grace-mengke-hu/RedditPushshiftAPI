Day 365. One year. I want to help you guys quit.

Quitting smoking was the best thing I ever did. My strategy was to distract myself mentally during cravings.  What did I use to distract myself?  Guitar, Counter-Strike and Dota 2.  Seriously, pick up a hobby.  Improve yourself.  There are subreddits dedicated to any hobby you can imagine, and with the power of the internet, you can teach yourself how to do something awesome.  It's never too late in life to become the person you want to be.  Learn to draw, learn guitar or piano, find yourself something that you enjoy that you can distract yourself with.

As you deny yourself the nicotine that your brain craves, it becomes easier.  Your discipline improves.  I realized this, and decided to use it to my advantage.  I was(am) really fat.  At the time of quitting, I was easily around 430lbs.  I started counting calories over the summer, and  eventually started swimming, switched to a ketogenic diet(/r/keto), and I've lost 83lbs since then.  

Do it.  No excuses.  Don't quit tomorrow, or next Tuesday, just quit.  You can do it.

4 years, no consistency

I had my first cigarette (Marlboro Smooth) when I was 16. I didn't start smoking packs a day until I was about 17. I am now 21, and have smoked on average a pack a day since I was 17. I justify it by thinking about how my dad has smoked packs a day since he was 12, and how my great grandmother smoked from her early teens until she died at 85 from a nonsmoking related illness. I quit for 4 months once at the end of last year, started again for a month, and quit again until June of this year. I developed this crazy theory that I wasn't breathing air into my left lung at all and that thought still stays in the back of my mind. I want to quit cold turkey but feel as if smoking is part of my personality and that is holding me back. I don't know what to do.

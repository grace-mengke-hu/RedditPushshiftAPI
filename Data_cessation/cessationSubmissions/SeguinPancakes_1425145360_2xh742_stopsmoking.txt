Day 5 and feeling awesome!

I'm on my 5th day of my first ever cold turkey quit and I feel awesome. I have more energy, the first few days of grossness are behind me, and the best part is....I smell so good. I can't even get over how nice it is to not get into bed smelling stale cigarettes on my fingers or taking my hair down and smelling smoke. Now my hair smells like a girl's hair should, all flowery and awesome. It's the little things, but every time I get a craving I just keep reminding myself how good I smell now and how if I cave I'll just smell like shame. 

This quit feels different...real.

18 hours down and this is the hardest it has ever been.

I have felt so many withdrawal symptoms it was literally overwhelming. Shakes, anxiety, shallow breaths, sweating, headache, feeling disoriented at times, tired and nausea. I'm surprisingly not moody or impatient, I actually feel the opposite. What withdrawal symptoms have you all experienced? I never want to feel this again, EVER. The last time I tried to quit NYE I made it 2 hours in, as soon as I felt all these withdrawals creeping in I went and bought smokes. I am proud of myself for sticking with it today, I am just going to take it one day at a time. 

I am using an app called Smoke free and it helps, every time I feel a craving I log it, not to keep track but to kind of replace the habit. I opened the app earlier and freaked out because it said my time not smoked was 13 hours lol this has been the longest day of my life and I am so looking forward to the easy upcoming days! Unlocking all the benefits on the app costs $4.99 I paid for it, it's nothing compared to the $11.00 I'm saving a day!

Thank you to the redditors who recommended this sub and using a non-smoking app!

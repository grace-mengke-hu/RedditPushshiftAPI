What resources worked for you?

Part of my position is to counsel people on smoking cessation, and to support them in their efforts.

Those of you who have quit successfully either currently or in the past (and by successfully I mean smoke free for a couple of months), what resources were helpful to you?  Websites, books, YouTube videos, classes, I'm looking for anything you found helpful.

Also, what resources *weren't* helpful, and why?  

Finally, what would you like to tell your doctor, nurses, and/or family members who encouraged you to quit smoking?  What would you change about the education provided, or the way they interacted for you, or what would you just like them to know about what quitting smoking was like for you?

Everyone is different and I realize that one approach or resource might work well for one person and not be effective at all for another;  but frankly, I have shit for offerings currently.  I would like to compile a variety of resources, and learn how to help people improve their chances of quitting smoking.  

Thanks in advance!

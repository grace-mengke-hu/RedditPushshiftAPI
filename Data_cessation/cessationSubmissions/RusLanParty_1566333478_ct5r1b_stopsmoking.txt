What have you felt?

So as someone who never got past the 3rd day...
I wonder what changes do you actually feel on first &amp; second week?
What about smell &amp; taste of food? When did you actually noticed changes? Appetite? How about sleeping? Overall energy?
I personally noticed that i woke up extremely fresh on the third day... Felt like i slept 15 hours (in a good way). 
So please, share your experiences people :)

I've decided to stop because of you.

I'm currently deployed in the military and I've already gone through numerous fruitless attempts to quit smoking while here. It's hard to quit while deployed in the military. You don't want to give up those friendships and conversations started in the local smoke pit, but I don't want it anymore. Your words of encouragement that I've read in this sub have helped me to make the plunge. It'll be another struggle, but I want to be there for my kids and show them the real meaning of life without cigarettes and alcohol. I hope that I can get some kind words, as well as some wisdom. Thank you!

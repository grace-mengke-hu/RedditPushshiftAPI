Finally doing it

I have smoked nearly a pack of cigarettes a day for the past five years, and today I have had enough.

And I'm not just getting my life back from this whirlpool of a "life" that I have that revolves completely around my addiction. I get to join the fun of being a person who sets goals and meets them.

I've always been so jealous of people who have such energy and motivation to do real things, like travel, make friends, exercise, gain confidence by achieving life goals. And there I was, puffing away on a cigarette for my entire adult life.

I seriously feel that almost everything that I don't like about my life can be chalked up to my left-behind addiction. Maybe quitting smoking will do a lot more for me than just save me from nicotine. Maybe it will save me from the entire lifestyle and unhealthy way of thinking that I've had for my entire adult life.

What do you think guys? Aside from regained health, hygiene, and freedom from addiction, did quitting open unexpected doors for you?

One more high? No, sorry self.

I've lied to Myself for far, far too long. I can no longer look to those heady THC crystallized nuggets that smell oh so good to make me happy, to take the edge off, to "help" me do things. I've got to find the joy elsewhere. My Family, My Friends, Meeting New People, Seeing New Places, hobbies, cooking, yoga, meditation, music, singing, talking, thinking, playing soccer - are these things not enough? then why have I been lying to myself. I just want to live healthily. This is my only life. I will not have regrets. Only equanimity, peace, love. Any thoughts my friends? Can I do this?

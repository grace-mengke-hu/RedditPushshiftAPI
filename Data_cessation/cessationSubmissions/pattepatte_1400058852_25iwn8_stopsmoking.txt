Living in a smoker flat! Any tips for me?

This morning I had to run to the train for work. It wasn't even a 2 minute run and I was completely out of breath. Smoked my last one yesterday evening so I thought why not just stop now.

But I just moved in with 4 friends who are all smokers. So how can I deal with that? I can't and don't want to forbid them to smoke, but I still wanna hang out with them, watching tv shows and so on without getting the urge to smoke so bad.

6 years without a cigarette thanks to an app suggested by someone on this sub!

I was going through my subs and I landed here after forgetting about you guys and gals for years.  

A user here suggested I use an app as it helped him, I was skeptical initially but I wasn’t in a good place smoking a pack and a half a day and decided that it couldn’t hurt to try. 

The app was clever as it provided goals and milestones, this gave me something to look forward to and it provided me that sweet dopamine hit every day with a quote or a fact about quitting smoking. 

If you’re skeptical, just try it out for a couple days and turn those notifications on. 

Any app with goals and reminders. Don’t think too much about it ;)

Good Luck!

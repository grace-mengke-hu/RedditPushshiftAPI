Day 1 with Allen Carr's updated method

There is nothing that smoking is doing for me. I'm going to succeed this time because smoking does not help me with anything. I read EASYWAY and failed after 21 days. It recommended reading ONLY WAY if you fail using EW. I'm doing that now. It's going to work because I don't want to smoke - why would I go and buy a pack of something I don't want to smoke?!

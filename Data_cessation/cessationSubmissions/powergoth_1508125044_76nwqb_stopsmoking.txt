Just had my first cigarette in six days..

it tastes like familiar garbage, was not as relieving as I though, i am hoping that this doesn't set me back too much. I've been using thrive gum and it's actually been much more enjoyable than the patch, kind of replaces the habit part.. anyways I am not going to have another, wish me luck

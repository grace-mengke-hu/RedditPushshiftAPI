Day 8: I have no nails left but I'm pushing strong.

I went to sleep at about 9PM last night which is 2 hours earlier than usual. I woke up at 2AM, 3AM, 4AM, 5PM, and so on until I had to get up for work at 7AM. I had nightmares! I had a bad breakup with my GF about a month ago and just terrible dreams all night. I mean I thought I was doing just fine my first week and it was going to be a walk in the park but I was wrong! 

I am trying to keep it together. I assume this is just a bad day. I want to kick and scream but really I just want to go smoke and bring back that feeling of relaxation even if it's an illusion. I know I won't smoke but this is going to be rough.

I feel so tired. I feel dizzy. I feel just confused. I thought you feel better after you quit but I can't concentrate after almost 8 days of not smoking a pack a day.

Going for it again

So after being quit for a brief period....turns out the wellbutrin was causing hypomania. I was 1 inch short of hallucinations which I'm grateful I didn't have. I immediately stopped taking the wellbutrin and now I'm back down to relative normal.....just lamactil and buspar from now on. Going to go for it again, today was day 2. I felt reasonable, if not for my cold and it's not smoking related. I woke up like this.

Maybe the cold is making is easy to not smoke ha!  Just using nicotine patches now because me and cold turkey really turns me hypomanic either that or suicidal depressed. Both which ain't good so I need something.

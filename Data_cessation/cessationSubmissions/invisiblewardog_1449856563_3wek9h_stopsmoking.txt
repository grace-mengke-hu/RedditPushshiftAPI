The longest I've been without nicotine in 13 years

It's amazing to realize that since I started smoking 13 years ago, this is the longest I've been without nicotine.  In fact, I don't think I ever fully went through withdrawal until this time around.  I always had some form of NRT.  The fear of going through that horrendous window of withdrawal between days three and seven is enough for me to never smoke again.

Cigarettes still smell wonderful, I still get the occasional, short-lived craving, I still wake up from a "smoking" dream and look for the pack that I didn't actually buy.  And every one of those is a reminder that I have succeeded.

To all you newly smoke free redditors--cravings will pass if you let them, even if you experience them every 20 minutes in the beginning.  Hang in there!  It's going to suck, but it is very much worth the fight.

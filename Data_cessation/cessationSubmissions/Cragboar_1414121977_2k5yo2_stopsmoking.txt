Need Some Advice for Cold Turkey. Pack a day 5+ years.

Guys and Gals I'd really appreciate some help.
I'm 24 y/o Male, been smoking a pack a day pretty much since I started working at 17 and this is now my second attempt.
I've recently started using E-cigs, which helped me quit for about 3 weeks - but I fell off the horse the minute I ran out of liquid and had to wait for delivery.
I've come to realisation that nicotine replacement therapy isn't for myself and I'm left with only one option.
I've stopped smoking weed as well because I mix it with tobacco and I've stopped drinking to get rid of that particular temptation.
If anybody could offer some reading material or advice or even little ways that you have personally used to get my attention out of needing this shit.

I'd be forever grateful.

* Edit - I live in Australia, where Cigarettes rise in price twice a year and they are taxxed at something ridiculous like at 750%. This works out to about $19 - $20 a packet... So last year I spent over $7000.00 AUD which is over $6000.000 USD and about â‚¬5000.00

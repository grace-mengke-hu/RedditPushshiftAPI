Thoughts on the first week

Just a bit of a ramble really. I'm now starting to see myself as an ex smoker rather than a smoker trying to quit. I think the trick is really absolutely convincing yourself smoking is really disgusting. 

The benefits are already too numerous to go back. My girlfriend and I were at the pub on Saturday, and I didn't really even feel like smoking there. We had a chorizo sausage, jalapeno and goats cheese burger, and it seriously was the best burger I had ever tasted. The beer even really complemented it, which isn't something I'd have picked up whilst still a smoker.

I've noticed over the past couple of days too that I don't really have cravings anymore. The worst was the after dinner cigarette but even that's gone now.

Anyway, keep it going everyone, and thank you all so much for the encouraging words when I first started!

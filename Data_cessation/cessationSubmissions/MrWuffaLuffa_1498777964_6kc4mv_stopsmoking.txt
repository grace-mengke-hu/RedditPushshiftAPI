I wanna quit.

Like the tittle says i wanna quit. This will be my 5th time trying to quit. They times were i find my self going crazy is if im doing my normal routine. Get up get breakfast smoke a cig. Drive to work smoke a cig. Have a bowl of weed smoke a cig. Basically after a couple of hours i would want a cig. Im getting tired of giving them money im tired of getting the second hqnf smoke of my clothes so my 3 mouth baby dont have to smell it. I guess what im saying if anyone have tips i would give them a shot. For the most part this will be my 3 day with out one bit its hard if they are ALL around me.

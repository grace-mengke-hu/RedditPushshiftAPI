15 Days without smoking!

I really need to write this down and tell it to someone, even if no one is reading this! i always thought it's only a matter of the mind, of your own willpower... and it really took me a lot not to smoke. So many moments of thinking, that this one time would be an exception but i know myself well and didn't waver! one cigarette and i'm sure i would end where i was two weeks ago. i have an app which tells me how much money i saved and how many cigarettes i missed and it's really shocking, never thought about the amount... i saved a little over 100â‚¬ and missed 332 cigarettes.
i WILL stay strong and won't succumb to temptation!

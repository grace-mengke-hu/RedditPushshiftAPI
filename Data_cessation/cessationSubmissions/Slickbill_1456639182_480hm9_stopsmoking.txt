I quit ten days ago cold turkey.

I smoked and listened to the audiobook of the Carr method for about a week, then quit around 11pm Thursday night, 2/18. I'm 29, have a nonsmoking wife and a 10 m/o daughter.

I smoked for about 8-9 years, the last five were a solid pack-a-day. Tried to quit a few times, never lasted a day. Miserable.

After listening to the audio book, I had my last smoke, and I know deep down I never will experience another as long as I live. I can't say the first 10 days were hard at all. For me, just stopping was effortless -- literally effortless. If you try the Allen Carr Easy Way to Quit Smoking, listen to the audio book! It's amazing, and really easier to internalize the concepts.

I am so happy now, I don't snore anymore, I wake up early feeling refreshed and rested, and despite minor irritability at first, I feel so happy and balanced. Carr's method is just, freaking, amazing!

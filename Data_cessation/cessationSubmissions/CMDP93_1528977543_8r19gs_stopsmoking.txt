Opinions on Allen Carr's method?

I've just finished reading his book and I am not smoking anymore - so I guess it helped me get over that hill - but I have mixed feelings over the way he does it. Anyone else here has used it and or the live sessions and can spare a word about it? 

BTW this is my first Reddit post and I'm so proud of y'all strangers kicking the habit to the curb!

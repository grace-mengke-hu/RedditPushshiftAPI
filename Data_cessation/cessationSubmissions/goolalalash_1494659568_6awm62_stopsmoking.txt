Smells, exposure, and no cravings-day 13!

First, as many people report- HOLY SHIT I CAN SMELL EVERYTHING. Even while smoking the last ten years, I had a strong sense of smell, but usually only bad smells. Trash smelling- I caught way before anyone else. Sink a little funky- I got you. Someone farted- I smelled it- and in some cases, yes, it was me. But I never really noticed that I didn't smell a lot of pleasant things! For some reason, for the past decade I thought flowers just didn't smell at night, but I smelled spring at 2 am! It's beautiful. Another thing I noticed is that I don't mind the smell of smoke when people are smoking, but I hate when I walk into a place that smells like smoke now and I'm really disgusted by how much my clothes smell after being around smokers the last 4 hours. I had to smell like smoke a lot more when I was smoking but it just grosses me out. I had to wash my hands as soon as I got home as if I'd been smoking. But it was nice when I dried my hands and thought, "huh, it's not even your hands that smell like smoke because you didn't smoke!"

Second, I know most people suggest not being around smokers in the beginning, but exposure therapy seems to work best for me in most problems in my life. I mentioned a few days ago that I never realized how much smoking was attached to friendships, so I've purposefully still gone outside with my smoking friends so that I can make memories without a cigarette in my own mouth. I thought this might help when I'm first off the patch so that I won't have to reintegrate with friends and figure out how to function because I can't avoid all my friends (who all smoke) forever. 

Third, tonight is the first night I've gone out, had two drinks and not had a single craving. Even as I stood in the smokers circle, wanting a cigarette didn't even cross my mind. I am wondering if this won't be as easy when I am off the patch. Anyone have any experience with this one?

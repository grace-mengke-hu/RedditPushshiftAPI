I"M REALLY DOING IT. and yes, cold turkey.

Man, these ups and downs though. sheesh. I want one so bad sometimes, but then other times it's like I don't care at all! Cravings are still pretty strong but hoping that will start to decrease now that I've hit the 3 day mark. This is not easy, but I knew that going into it.

If anyone reads this, just want to say this subreddit is SO encouraging and helpful. I know it's only day 3, but it's day 3 of the rest of my life as a non-smoker and being able to come here and vent or just read other peoples successes is awesome.

"Relapsed" on cigs after 3 years of no smoking and 4.5 months of no vaping/nicotine... questions about the Allen Carr book

Title explains my situation.  The whole time I was smoke/nicotine free, I desperately craved cigs, felt like I was missing out on something I loved, jealous of smokers, etc... I felt like I was still a smoker who just hadn't smoked for a long time.  

I've heard the Allen Carr book can change your mindset/relationship with nicotine.  The thing is, I *want* to smoke, I love the way it feels and it is very nostalgic and fun for me.  But, at the same time, I don't want to die and don't want to feel the need to sneak out during work, social events, etc. to smoke.   I want two different things that can't exist simultaneously. 

Supposedly the book makes you not want to smoke anymore, instead of helping you fight the urge to smoke.  Is that true?  Do you all feel like it helped you quit?  

I'm in a slightly rough place right now and could use some help with this.

Thanks!

They say loneliness is a big reason for many people to smoke...

I've just had a breakup with a girlfriend of two years, and already felt the craving intensifies to the highest level ever since.


Somehow I feel that, right now, smoking is the only thing which can help me get rid of the loneliness. So far I manage to avoid slipping up again (I've failed, twice) but I can't help but think that I'm on the verge.


It could be that I'm just used to living with someone and all of a sudden have to be living by myself, it could be that I can't handle a big change. I know I'll be able to cope with the breakup better once I get back to work and get myself fit enough for the gym again (just recovered from dengue fever), keeping my mind and body busy. But right now I can't think of anything else than to smoke again to help myself feel better about the whole situation... the urge right now has become too difficult for me to overcome.


I would really like to hear if anyone here have similar experience, and how to overcome loneliness (caused by breakups or anything else) while quitting, because I feel that this is the biggest obstacle so far and I don't want to fail again.


Thanks in advance, /r/stopsmoking

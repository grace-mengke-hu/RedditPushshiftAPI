For those with small-ish children thinking of quitting.

I did a play-date today.  Drove from my house and picked up my son's friend.  I took the two of them to something (movie/fair/bowling/event).  After the event we stopped for food.  Then I took the other kid home.

* I did not smoke before I picked up the other kid.

* I did not need to leave the event to ~~take a call~~ sneak a smoke.

* I was never in a rush to end the 'date' so I could smoke in peace.

I just took some kids to a thing.

My son notices the difference.  


I wish you the best in whatever you choose.  I wanted to let you know what counts to me and is never in the late night public service announcements.

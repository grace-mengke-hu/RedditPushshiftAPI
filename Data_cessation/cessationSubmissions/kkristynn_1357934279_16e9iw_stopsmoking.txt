weight gain?

I know it's a pretty shallow thing to think about... but have any of you experienced weight gain as a result of quitting? I remember starting smoking led to significant weight loss (which I then thought was awesome.) I'm not the skinniest person by any means, and putting back on more weight scares me. But being a smoker for life scares me too.

For good this time. I can just feel it.

Had a grand ole night of drinking and being a chimney on Friday night. Woke up Saturday without so much of a hangover, just that dry mouth stale-smoke-filled-body feeling, and discovered I'd finished my pack that night. I was like, alright, its time. I'm not going to buy a pack today.

Got off work that night, and instead of my usual reward cigarette for finishing work, I shook off the craving. 

Didn't buy a pack Sunday, Monday or Yesterday. Went drinking last night, craved badly, but was happy to wake up this morning knowing I'd maintained. Currently on day 5, and I already feel like a non-smoker.

It's hard to say how much I'd been smoking, it would vary wildly depending on my work schedule and amount of drinking, and I always share with those around me. On average I was buying two-three packs a week. Some days I wouldn't smoke at all, some days I'd nearly finish a pack.

My previous record was three and a half weeks last fall. Then the Patriots played the Texans and I was stressed out before the game and succumbed. That won't happen this time.

So far I've been good craving-wise until I start drinking. Also watching Mad Men makes me crave like mad. The biggest side effect thus far is the constipation, which is in constant battle with the coffee shits. This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

This is a great sub. Let's stay smoke free together.

EDIT: If its at all interesting, I'm also 11+ weeks off of trees after being a multiple-times-a-day toker. My ability to get off of that habit makes me feel much better about my ability to stop smoking altogether.

Take it one day at a time.

I've had to fight, still fighting now. I live with three smokers and yesterday was the closest I came to cracking. I got really stressed out about something, had to run away from my house because all I wanted to do was dig through an ashtray for something smokable. I've been comfortable for days now, but this one thing just caught me off guard. Gotta stay vigilant, even after two weeks.

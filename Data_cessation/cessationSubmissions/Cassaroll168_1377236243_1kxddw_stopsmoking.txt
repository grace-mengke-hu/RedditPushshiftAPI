Why does it have to be so bad for you!?

I quit two weeks ago. I still miss it. But now I'm just angry at how bad it is for you. I wish there was a way to maintain the habit without the horrible health effects. I mean is every cigarette that bad for you? Are they all the same? And why? Why are they SO bad for you? It's like they designed it this way on purpose. Why can't they make a safer cigarette? That would sell out like crazy! 

I'm just angry at myself for doing it so long and angry at cigarette companies for making it so easy and enticing all the time. I just want an easier way out. I want to keep smoking but not have the health effects. GAH! I feel like a little baby crying for his mommy with this bullshit. Rant over. Thanks for listening.

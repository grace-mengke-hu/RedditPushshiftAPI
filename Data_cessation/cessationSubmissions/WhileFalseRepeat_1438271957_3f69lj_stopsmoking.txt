31,536,000 Seconds (and counting)!!!!!!!

It is has been one year for me and I am amazed at myself. Who is this healthy person I've become? Is this really fucking happening? Am I really an ex-smoker? Hell ya!!! 

In the beginning, it was too difficult to imagine making this milestone. But a strange thing happened - seconds became minutes, minutes became hours, hours became days, days became weeks, and weeks became months. It got easier as time passed and every single second I became stronger. There remains a fight ahead for me, but I'm confident that I've developed the tools and healthy habits to provide a lifetime of healthy living. I feel so good about my former self taking the steps to make this day happen. Thank you former self! 

I owe a big thank you to those in this support group. It is the sharing of strategies, ideas, thoughts, rants, and encouragement that helped push myself to achieve this goal. I didn't feel alone in this battle and that was truly helpful. Thank you to everyone in /r/stopsmoking!

For those starting out - you *can* do this. Keep on keeping on and continue fighting for your future. You are stronger than you know and there is a future self that is waiting to thank you. I once thought I could never stop smoking - it is amazing what can happen when you give yourself a chance.

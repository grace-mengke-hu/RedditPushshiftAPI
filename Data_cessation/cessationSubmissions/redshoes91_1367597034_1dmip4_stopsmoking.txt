It's time to quit...

I only started smoking around 3 years ago when I first started uni. I'd gone through a bit of stress and a friend suggested a fag to calm me down. Two weeks of "I'll just finish this pack" and of course, I'm a smoker. Now, as I'm graduating in a month, I've gone from 15-20 a day to cold turkey. It feels horrible at times, like I WANT to shout and cry at people, but then I come on here, I realise I've already done three days, I CAN DO THIS!!

Thanks for the vent.. I'll be on here once a day!

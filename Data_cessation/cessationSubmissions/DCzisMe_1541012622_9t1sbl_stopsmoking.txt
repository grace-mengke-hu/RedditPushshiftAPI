Day 3: Must fight these urges.

Holy crap do I want a smoke. This has been the hardest day so far. My gf quit with me and she has the same feeling today. What is going on. Oh well, more water, more tea, more pushups I spose. Not much else to do but fight through it. 

What have you guys done to get through these first few days? 

Thanks for letting me vent. Good luck to everyone!

Three long drives this month, fffuuuu

So every one of us used to love smoking when driving.  Shit on long drives we'd blast through a pack, right?  Driving to the beach was it for me, chain smoking with the windows down on a hot summer day?  Fuck.  Sometime's I'd splurge on a cigar, or a pack of black n' milds.  Well not anymore.  Fuck.

Three weekends this month, three mini-vacations, three excruciating long drives.  This weekend my girlfriend and I are driving up to bumfuck PA, 2.5 hour drive each way.  The following is camping for five days, 2 hour drive each way.  The last weekend is off to the beach, 3 hours each way.  I'm getting angry just thinking about it.

Any tips?  Any thoughts?  Jeez, what do non-smokers do when you're driving that far, it sounds so damn boring.  Going to have ulcers like crazy from all the damn hard candy and gum I'm going to go through this month, shit.

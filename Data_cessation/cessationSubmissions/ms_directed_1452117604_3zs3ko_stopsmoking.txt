i quit this bitch!

its been 5 days...i hope this sub-reddit is still here when its been 5 weeks...5 months...

right now i'm just trying to get thru this 5 minutes. AGHHH. can you smoke fingernails btw?

srsly though, what about vaping without nicotine? does that count as smoking? not doing that either, but curious about it.

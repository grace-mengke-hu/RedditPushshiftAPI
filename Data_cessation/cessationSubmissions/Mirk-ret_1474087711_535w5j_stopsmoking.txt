On Thursday I drank a few beers...

and I didn't smoke. 

Honestly, when I was buying those beers I thought that it was a bad idea. Not just because I knew it was going to make me crave a cigarette, but I'm quitting drinking too because it has come quite problematic for me.  

So I drank those beers and felt shit about myself. I thought about going to ask my neighbor for a cigarette or two, but somehow I just kept chewing nicotine gum, and thought how disappointed in myself I would be if I drank *and* smoked. 

Before I quit, I thought that I definitely couldn't drink and not smoke. Now that I managed to that I feel way more hopeful about succeeding in this thing.

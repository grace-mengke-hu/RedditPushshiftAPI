First week is done...Its getting easier.

Hi there. I just quit smoking cold turkey last saturday after smoking a pack a day regularly for a good 10 years. I was in the shower with my boyfriend and just could not stop coughing with the smokers cough. It was ridiculous and I decided that I had enough of it then.

The cravings are not terribly bad. I don't even want to smoke a cigarette at all, but I do feel like I need some kind of release. Its getting better though. My mind has also been going a million miles a minute it feels like. I'm incredibly tired a lot and having crazy mood swings that are not normal for me...is this normal for quitting smoking?

I guess if I had other questions, what else should I be looking forward to, side effect wise, from quitting both nicotine and tobacco entirely? Thanks!

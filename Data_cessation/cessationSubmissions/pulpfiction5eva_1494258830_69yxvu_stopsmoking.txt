One Week of Being a Non Smoker...And I Hate It.

So the title pretty much says it all. I've gone a week without smoking, and it's one of the most difficult things I've ever done. I know this is hardly a groundbreaking conclusion to come to, but I just needed to say it. And the worst part is, I don't even really want to quit, I'm doing it for a job (I'm working at a summer camp this summer and I won't be able to keep cigarettes there). I am honestly considering smoking again after I get back in late August. I know this probably isn't a popular thing to say, but it's just how I feel. If I was quitting because I actually wanted to, I imagine this would be a lot easier. Sorry for bumming anyone out, I just need to get these feelings off my chest.

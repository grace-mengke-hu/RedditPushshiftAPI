Anyone else notice a decrease in caffeine tolerance without cigarettes? (seems specifically linked to coffee)

I'm 7.22 months in to quitting and pretty much since the first week of quitting coffee seems to hit me harder than it did before and I cannot seem to recover my tolerance but I'm not sure if it's a coincidence or actually related. 

I have been drinking the same morning Americano every day for 6 years but over the last 7 months it actually gives me a buzz whereas it was simply an enjoyable beverage before and sometime I even get the symptoms of caffeine overdose from just that morning coffee. I also used to be able to handle an afternoon Americano or Latte no problem but now have to opt for 1/2 caf or decaf or it makes me feel ill. 

Oddly however it does not seem to affect caffeine intake by way of cola/pop. I can spend all day drinking Diet Pepsi or have a Redbull at a bar no problem.... it's only my ability to deal with coffee that seems affected which is odd because caffeine is caffeine.

1 1/2 Months now, tough weekend ahead

So i've been cig free for over a month now, and i'm really happy about it. I'm better at sports and overall I just feel much better, mentally and physically.

Tomorrow I'm heading out to a festival, where there will be a lot of drinking, smoking and music, it's going to be a big challenge but hopefully i'll make it through.

Wish me luck, and stay strong to everyone out there, it gets easier!

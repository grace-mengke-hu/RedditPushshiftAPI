What do I do with my hands when I don't smoke?

I have been smoking for almost 10 years now. I genuinely want to quit. My biggest motivation is my health. My lungs have always been taking a beating from smoke and from winter colds and flus for many years now. I am so sick and tired of coughing up dark mucus and wheezing. There have been times when I quit for weeks or a month or two. Whenever I quit, it's usually during times of travel or no stress. I always get back into it due to my social circle, but I only have myself to blame.

I actually hate the taste of smoking, but I really feel like I need nicotine sometimes. I smoke after exiting the house, getting out of the car, while waiting for the bus stop, during study breaks, whenever I run into a friend, etc... It's a real problem because I smoke on cues. When I don't smoke in a while, I feel like my vision gets blurry and I cannot focus. I feel like I need to smoke if I want to excel in school.

I am moving to another state soon for school and will probably have no friends. I will probably do myself a favor and try to avoid smokers. I think the biggest problem is that I don't know what to do with my hands or what to focus on when I need a break from studying. What do you guys do?

By the way, my badge is inaccurate. As you can see, I tried to quit 791 days ago.

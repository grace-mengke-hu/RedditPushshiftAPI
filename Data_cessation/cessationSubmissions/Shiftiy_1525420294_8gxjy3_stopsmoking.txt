Two months down - it's possible. I see my dad and wish he could have done it.

Hey Reddit. 

A bit of back story. I've smoked since I was 15. Over 20 years. Pack and a half a day. 
I was a couch potato for my twenties and started exercising in my 30s. I've tried to give up smoking on average once or twice a year for the last ten years. This time it's different. 

My dad got news about lung cancer last Christmas. He smoked a pipe all his life. I'm not going to describe what he is going through, what he looks like or the effect this is having on us all. Imagine it yourselves and now double it. 

I have not had a cigarette in two months. The want for one is nearly gone. My trigger was always alcohol. Always. My will power went out the window when I had pints. So anyway this is what helped me. 

•Stop drinking for at least a month
•Exercise - walk, run, anything at all
•Get outside and get some air into your new lungs
•Reward yourself after a set amount of time - buy yourself something 
•Change your eating habits, you will be hungry for a time - use this to eat healthy
•The first three days are the hardest with day two the worst for me
•The pain passes, It honestly does
•Drink plenty of water
•YOU CAN DO THIS
•When you finally go for a drink put yourself in a place you can leave if you want and preferably with non smokers
•The cravings go away in five minutes
•The craving strength lessens over time
•The number of cravings reduce to nearly nothing over time
•Distract yourself when you want one, take up a new hobby - paint, knit, sow, draw, run, swim, surf, climb, board games, make models, learn a new language, learn a new skill, take on a project. 

While two months is not that long a time I genuinely feel I have broken the back on this. I'm not allowing myself to say I'm a non smoker. I think I will be a smoker for the rest of my life but I will be one who doesn't smoke. I am not going to allow myself to become complacent - I have fallen into that trap before. 

So take my word for it. I see my dad now and no one wants that. Currently you are throwing money away in order to hurt yourself and feed a pointless need. 

If I told you to pay me to give you a pin so you could prick yourself you would call me mad. That's what you are doing for nicotine.. paying someone so you can hurt yourself. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Again I'm here with my dad with tubes in places (we made a joke of counting them earlier) that no one should. Don't be that and dont be someone who becomes that. Please, for you.

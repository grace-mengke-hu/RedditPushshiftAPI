I messed up big time.

As you can see by my flair, I messed up. I went to the field (Army) for two weeks and smoked like I used to; about a pack/day. I'm optimistic, though. I'm using my vape, which makes quitting much easier for me. I had my last cigarette seven days ago. I will get back to my current flair again.

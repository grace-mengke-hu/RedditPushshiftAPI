One month today!

And feeling awesome! I did get a terrible “quitters flu” around day 5, but I have had zero bad cravings, no second thoughts. I think my skin might be clearing up.  I also dropped the e-cig after week 1!

The biggest struggle for me, and why I used to not wanna quit, was driving. I used to chain smoke while driving and I always looked forward to being in my car for that reason. But now I’ve gotten into listening to an awesome podcast and I look forward to driving for that reason! I detailed my car about a week ago, gave it a good scrub inside and out, so the smoke smell is barely there anymore. 

Keep going, everyone!

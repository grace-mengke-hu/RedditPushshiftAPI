Stopped smoking years ago but started again last year. Can someone please remind me why I'm a brainwashed slave to cigarettes and that they do nothing for me?

I read Alan Carr's book and it worked but for some reason now I don't want to stop. I know it doesn't do anything for me, at all. I know how much better I felt when I stopped. Can someone tell me what an idiot I am for continuing to smoke? I need to hear it. Thanks!

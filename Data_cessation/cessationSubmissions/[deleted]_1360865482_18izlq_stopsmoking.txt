tl;dr

Last year I tried several times to quit, and I had one really good stint (lurk my posts, there's quite a history :P), however, I was fooled by the constant knowledge that my brother had cigs and was always within reach of them.
Well he's five days into quitting and is being very good about not smoking. According to him he hasn't had one since he stopped and if that's the case then I'm proud of him, because he's almost past my longest withholding. Anyway, I'm standing firm and not letting him bum from me, I won't enable him to fail at quitting, because I'll need him to be clear of the urge to support myself in quitting.

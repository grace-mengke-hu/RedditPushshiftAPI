Back on track

I'm back on track since my little slip up following the death of my grandfather. I feel very anxious. I'm a naturally anxious person but I can't get the thought out of my head that a cigarette will make all the anxiety disappear. I wish I could make this feeling stop but we all know too well that's not how it works. :/

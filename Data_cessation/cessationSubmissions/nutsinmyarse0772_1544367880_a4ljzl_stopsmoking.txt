advice to quit

hey guys english is not my first language so forgive me for my grammar but basically i want to quit smoking right now due to the destructive things it does to my body im about 5 years into smoking and everytime ive tried, ive failed  tried going cold turkey but im always in my room and the boredoms just kinda suck and light one up to kill it. ive never had a close friend in my area to hang out with so it's much worse, also want to become active but the town im in are so polluted that i dont wanna head out, hope you all having a good day and waiting for your responses thank you.

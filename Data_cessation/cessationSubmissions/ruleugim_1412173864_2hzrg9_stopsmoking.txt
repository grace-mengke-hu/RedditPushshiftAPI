Kind of a weird thing I'm doing to keep myself from smoking... and it's working

The biggest issue when I try to quit smoke is usually my mind justifying having just one... and we all know that's when it's done. Previous attempts have failed because of this. Two years ago, I had a pretty good one that lasted for 4 months. Best 4 months of my life, until I was out drinking and somehow convinced myself one wouldn't hurt. Back to pack-a-day in about a month. It all happens so slowly and "under the radar", sort of, I barely notice the trap until it's done.
 
Last Monday I got some weird health test results and I realized this thing is going to kill me soon if I don't do something now, and flushed my cigarettes down the toilet, but I needed something extra to make sure I wouldn't relapse and I'd keep myself from smoking. 

Might be that I'm masochistic, or immature or whatever, but what I came up with is **a rubber band around my wrist** at all times. I'll snap it any time I think about cigarettes, when I kind of think "oooh, it would be nice to have a smoke right now" or when I imagine sucking on a death stick. It has kept me off it for two days, so it's not a huge success story yet, but these were the two easiest first days I had so far. The test results might have helped, and I also ate very healthy and exercised a little these two days, but the negative reinforcement of the band helps too. It's also barely noticeable and inconspicuous. You can snap it anywhere you are when you get the urge to smoke. 

TLDR: I keep a rubber band around my wrist and snap it any time I think of cigs.

What happens if I just have one?

I'm on Day 4 and it's the worst so far. I feel like I can't take another workday like this, I'm very tempted to just walk down the street, buy a pack and a bic, and smoke one.

So, what happens if I have one? Do my withdrawal symptoms reset completely? Am I right back where I was? Will I not feel this way for another four days, or will I have to go through the last four days again?

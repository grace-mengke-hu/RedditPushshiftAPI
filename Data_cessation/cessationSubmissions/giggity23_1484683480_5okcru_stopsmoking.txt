335 days. 11 months!

It wasn't until 8:30 PM I realized that I am only a month short of not smoking a cig or joint for a whole ffing year! I am gonna rock this month! I feel very good! I still remember how I was 11 months ago.. a coughing, reeking guy with a few pounds too many.. The cough is gone, I feel fresher than fresh and I lost weight by excersizing regularly. 1 YEAR HERE I COME!

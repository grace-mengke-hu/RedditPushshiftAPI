A word of truth

Surprisingly quitting this time around has been very easy for me. At first I did not know why, but I had a strange realization tonight. The reason it is easy because I actually wanted to quit smoking. Every single attempt before was always "Ugh, I should quit. I need to quit. I really just need to stop." but in reality I didn't want to at all, I just wanted to keep smoking.

All of us know the dangers and the shit that is smoking, but we all still love it/want to smoke and that is why we continue to smoke. 

Not this time. This time I wanted it. I wanted the freedom from the nicotine. I wanted to be a healthier person. After the first 3 days of withdrawls, it was very easy to continue, because I wanted the healthy feeling that came with not smoking for a few days. It's now been 14 days, I woke up this morning without coughing up a lung, I have been working out, eating right and it's all been great and I want more.

The point of all of this is that unless you want it, you wont have it. That goes for everything in life. If you want to quit smoking you will. If you don't want it you won't. Keep it up everyone.

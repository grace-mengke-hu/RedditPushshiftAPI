8th day no smoking with Odranal

I've been doing a treatment with Odranal, which is an anty deppressant that is particularly good at helping to quit. First I took the drug and kept smoking for 2 weeks, (That's preety standart for the treatment). I was suppossed to do nicotine gum for a month but I ran out after 5 days and haven't bough more, so Im nicotine free since the 24th.

It's been preety easy this far and I feel kindda dumb for not getting help before (i've quitted before but it was much harder)

I might unsuscribe for a while cuz this subreddit actually reminds me of cigarrets, but I'll be back when I feel more confident or if I relapse.

TL;DR: Trying out treatment with Odranal, so far very good, I recommend getting extra help when quitting.

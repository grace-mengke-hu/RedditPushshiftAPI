Attempt #563... Slightly warm turkey?

So I am going to attempt to switch to American Spirit cigarettes  and slow WAY the hell down from my 1.5 packs a day.  I've tried almost everything.  All that's left is hypnosis (ya right lol), acupuncture (maybe, a bit far-fetched), and switching to another brand to slow down.  I chose American Spirits because they have a lot fewer chemicals than the Pall Mall's that I smoke.  Just stopping doesn't work for me, hopefully this will.  
  
UPDATE:  I tried the American Spirit cigarettes and they suck.  I decided to just stop.  Thanks for the support guys!

It’s day 13

It’s day 13, hurray. 

Except I am now a chubby nutter. 
Making it through day 1 was a nightmare, I was one of the heaviest smokers you could meet. Ahhh my little demonic friend. 
This is, on the one hand, a small miracle, yet on the other, a complete crock. I’m absolutely mental :/ 

Snappy, moody, crying at random, at hysterics about the miracle of it being day 13. And, of course, the eating. My god the eating. It’s like I am a human trash can. 

Anyway, I’m using that smoke free app, my new friend along with nicotine gum, and it said ‘check out redit’ and ‘for bonus points’ write something. So here I am, in all my smoke deprived sarcastic glory. 

I want to call myself ‘clean’ or ‘sober’ but the world doesn’t tidily compartmentalise we smokers, so I am a non smoker. Even that classification, non smoker, includes the world smoking, so it seems there is no getting around that word. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. And if you’re also going, keep going. We can get through this, shite as it is, we can be ‘clean’ breathing free, running through the meadows enjoying air as clear as Crystal I am sure. And no doubt this development of chub will decrease as I get a handle on the compulsive need to have my hand at my mouth, gnawing on something. 

Maybe I should get a Chubba chop or something.

Bring on day 14.

Six months down!

This sub was great for motivation and accountability, particularly in the first few weeks, so thank you all again!  I feel magnitudes better than when I first quit (ten days on the step one patch, then went cold turkey from there).  Cravings still come when I see or smell a cigarette, but I never would have believed that I could move along and not give it a second thought.

> Damn, I could go for one of those right now.........heh, no.

I've seen people comment that the thought of still having cravings after this long would be unbearable, but it *really does get easier*.

I can't wait to see how I feel in six more months.

Cheers, r/stopsmoking !

All is well so far....

I've made the decision in my mind, i know why i have to quit. Kept giving in at the end of the day, always having 1 and thinking "oh its just one" but then another or even 2 more would follow. I've managed more than 20 hours so far. I've been seeing someone who has been a great encouragement, its easy to resist if im with her. But i have to remember that im doing this for myself. So i thought i would see her today but it didnt happen, immediate thoughts were "well, now you can have just one", but i've resisted. This is one of the most disturbing experiences i've been through but at the same time i feel the exact opposite every time I resist another craving and watch my progress. Maybe its a mix of heart ache and craving, who knows. Went mountain biking today, was really good to put some fresh air into my lungs. 

I started getting rid of all the smoking paraphernalia, as its one of my main triggers. Just writing about it makes me crave. 

Got cookies and tea next to me... and this sub too, its been a great encouragement and source of knowledge and honest experiences. 

Thank you everyone!

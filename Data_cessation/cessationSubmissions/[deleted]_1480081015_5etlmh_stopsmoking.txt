I got quitter's flu.

I stopped smoking for 2 days but I couldn't sleep today. I woke up after 3 hours of sleep because of tonsillitis. I can't swallow because it hurts so much. Some say don't use antibiotics because it's not from bacterium, it's from your body adapting to changes. I feel sluggish. What to do? I don't want to smoke again for these to go, it's the easy way.

Quitting and the support system

There is a lot of debate about the best method to quit. Personally I found that cold turkey has worked best for me. Maybe NRT will work better for you. Regardless of your chosen method, one thing that is truly vital to a successful quit is the support system. It's hard to end an addiction and even harder when the people around you don't see it as a big deal. My SO supports me every day with my quitting, complementing me on my progress. Without his support, there is a small probability that I would have already broken my streak of roughly four months smoke free. I deal with a lot of stress on a weekly basis, but with support from him and alternative outlets, I have found that I don't need cigarettes to feel better. Let this be advice for new quitters. Any method will work, but it's hard to do it alone. Don't be afraid to talk to someone about your addiction, especially someone who cares about you. When they ask you to quit, it's because they want to spend as much time with you on this earth as is allowed. Don't give up and remember you are loved.

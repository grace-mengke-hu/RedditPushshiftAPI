I accomplished 14 days. Yesterday I failed. I feel like a failure.

The first 14 days were incredibly easy. I don't know why exactly but I didn't really feel the urge to smoke.
Yesterday I had to travel for 9 hours and was so stressed and tired, I bought a pack and smoked 2 cigarettes.
The urge was too strong. It was completely psychological and I feel like such a failure.
I should have just ignored the urge but I didn't. I wasn't strong enough.
I'm still eager on quitting, but now I'm scared that I won't do it.

I said myself, that I will smoke today. As much as I want. It's 4pm and I'm smoking my first cigarette for today right now. But that it will be the last cigarettes and I hope I can do it and stay strong.

I have so much respect for all of you. It's so hard and you're all so strong. And I'll be just as strong as you.

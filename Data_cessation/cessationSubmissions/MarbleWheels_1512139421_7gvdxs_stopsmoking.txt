I quit vaping 15 minutes ago

Hi! 
Never been a smoker, my gf was a heavy one. 
I got her a vape to stop smoking, she successfully switched to vaping and stopped for good when found out she was pregnant. 

Well, I got addicted to vaping.

It probably is way better that smoking but still I felt it is not free from physical effect and anyway I HATE being addicted to stuff.

So I stopped. I gave my vaping gear to a friend and never smoked it for around 4 months. Then I started again, I wasted money on what in fact is a "drug gear" and started again. 
Lightly, only at work during breaks, but still an addiction. 

I started too accepting cigarettes from friends and you see where this road can lead. 

So, I got angry at myself and around 15 mins ago I took my vaping gear that I hide at the office (my gf doesn`t know I vape) and just throw it in the trash. 

I know it will be around 10 hard days but fuck it, never again.
I know how I work, so if (when) I`ll be on the verge of going and buying gear again I'll just come here and please, be verbally harsh with me.

On a side note, I'll go for "addiction replacement": I'll start rowing again, a way better thing to be addicted to....

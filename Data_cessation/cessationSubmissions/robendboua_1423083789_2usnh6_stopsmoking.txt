The easier way!

I'm one of those guys that was never able to quit more than 6 hours in the 12 years I was a smoker. I had many attempts, but I never really believed it would work, and it didn't, until now (2 weeks in). This time it felt different from the moment I threw out my tobacco pouch.

I somehow knew it would work this time, because I was in a different place than during any of my previous attempts. I moved to a new country a few months ago and have worked to rebuild my life how I want it. I have a job I like. I regularly practice my favorite sport. I made some good friends, including some who don't smoke (usually most of my friends smoke). I have very few sources of stress left in my life.

I think these things helped a lot. Granted not everyone can just move and build themselves the perfect life, but if you can remove some of the sources of stress in your life, I think this whole process will be so much easier. 

Hope this info is helpful to some of you.

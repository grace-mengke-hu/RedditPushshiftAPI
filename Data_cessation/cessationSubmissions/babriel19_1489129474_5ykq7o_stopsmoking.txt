Set quitting date to April 1st, 2017

I feel I am a heavy smoker, I smoke two packs in about two days. I have asthma, I used to smoke less then I started hanging out with my best friend and living with her and her boyfriend, they were heavy smokers then I started smoking. Long story short is that I've wanted to quit for a bit because I wanna feel better when I go for my walks and I wanna save money. So hopefully all is well.

Pain in left of chest after quitting? Anyone else?

Hey guys. Just looking for anyone who has experienced similar issues so I can put my mind to rest. I feel like I'm getting pains in my chest, around the heart area. I've never had these pain before, and the only thing that has changed is that I've quit smoking cold turkey for a week now. 

Can withdrawals cause pain? I'm guessing since it's physically addictive and my body MUST be going through changes, since I used to smoke quite a lot, daily, for years.

So yeah, just for peace of mind, anyone else?

Thanks :)

3 week anniversary! Finally letting go. Feling good about the non-smoking, but sad and preoccupied about other things

So yesterday evening was the three week anniversary. I am honest when saying i haven't had one single craving for a cigarette. I do have moments of unexplained exhaustion and emotionality though, so it's obvious that the psychological dependency isn't completely out of my system. At least it's not coupled with a physical monster crave to grab a pack of cigarettes. 
As the weeks go by, and coupled with a drastic reduction of my alcohol intake, i am also reviewing my friendships, some of which are decades old. One of the more difficult aspects of escaping from the smoking and excessive drinking was the fact that a large chunk of my friends were also indulging in this extremely unhealthy behaviour. It's difficult to realize that quite a few friendships have run their course as i don't wish to lead the same lifestyle as is normalized within that set of friends and where there doesn't seem to be a lot of support in doing things differently ( i sometimes get the feeling that they can't wait to see me fail and to going back into the boozing and smoking). Feelings of loss (there were for a long time lost of positive aspects to these friendships) are coupled with feelings of regret that i ever became friends with them. Maybe i am just being too negative right now, but thoughts are flashing through my head as to what my life would be like if i hadn't hung out with the more experimental set during high school and later college. Less debt? A career rather than a series of placeholder jobs? Stabler moods? Stopped smoking earlier/never started smoking at all? Maybe this is just a mood and it will pass, but i can say that stopping smoking is very confronting and has an impact on far more than the way in which you think a out your physical health.

First really vivid smoking dream

Last night I dreamt that I smoked 1 1/2 cigarettes and was fully aware that I'd be breaking my two week streak but thought that I could just not tell anyone and forget about it myself. The dream fast forwards a bit and I feel guilty and know that I have to start over.... Man, I'm so glad that I didn't actually smoke.

I've been expecting smoking dreams and was actually kinda looking forward to them because it would mean I could smoke again! But that's not how it felt... I didn't want it. And I had some other dreams that were pretty fun and I felt like that smoking dream just took time away from them... Just like they took away from so many fun things in real life!

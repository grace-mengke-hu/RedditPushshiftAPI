I've tried to quit at least 50 times (seriously) and I keep going back...

When I quit, I put it in my head that I don't want to smoke anymore, but I keep making excuses and try to justify that smoking is alright. My newest excuse is that I enjoy smoking, which I do. I really enjoy it, but I am concerned about the health issues down the line. I have an extremely hard time making my own decisions and I am easily influenced by outside sources. Any suggestions?

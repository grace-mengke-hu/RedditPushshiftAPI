Quitting on Monday

Hi all! Just joined this sub and I’m going to be quitting cold turkey on Monday. I’ve been smoking for 14 years now. I can’t believe it’s actually been 14 years... anyway, I’m super nervous and need some words of encouragement. Does it truly get easier? I’ve tried to quit before but never really gave it my all... hence, still smoking and need to attempt quitting again. As soon as I’d have a drink I’d chase down a smoke and not really give myself a fighting chance at all. This time is different though. I’m almost 30 (f) and there are so many things I want to accomplish with my life and I want to do something that I can feel really proud of before I turn 30. Also want to pay off my debt and with the extra money be able to start travelling more. I’m in it for the long haul this time I hope but, I’m really scared! When I’ve quit before I get really depressed and convince myself I’m missing out. It feels like I’ve lost a best friend.  For those who have quit, are you truly happier without them?

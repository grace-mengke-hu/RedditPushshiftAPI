I sit in front of my PC dazed and confused.

I sit in front of my PC dazed and confused.

 Major relapse and I just don't know what to do with myself. 

Quit smoking on 12/10.

 It was smooth sailing until exams hit, and with them, the worst cravings I've ever had.

 I mean a relentless barrage that I would drive back with all my force, only to return with a twisted mindfucking vengeance. 

For two days I battled the djinn that wreaked havoc on my mind, then late last night, in a weak moment I crumbled.

 Now all I have left is a lighter in my pocket, an aching body, a heavy heart and so many questions. 

In a deep recess of my mind, I exist in an alternate universe, one where I didn't pick up the keys and drive there. 

That fork in my road has faded away like the many that I have already allowed to pass, and i'm left with the bitterness of a fool that stuck his hand in the snake pit one too many times.

Its been an hour since my last smoke.

I want to say I won’t go back but I’m so sick of the lies.

If you have quit, and are toying with weakness, fight it to your last breath because I can promise you that there is nothing there except suffering and torment.

I appreciate that you read this, I know you’ll understand.

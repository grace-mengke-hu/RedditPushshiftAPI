Thank you, Polar Vortex, you bastard!

I wrote on here about a week ago saying that I was scared to fly back for my last semester because the mere fact of being at college would be a trigger.

Luckily for me, I go to school in the Midwest, and even if I hadn't quit I wouldn't want to smoke when it's negative 20 outside. Thank you, polar vortex, for making quitting a necessity rather than a choice.

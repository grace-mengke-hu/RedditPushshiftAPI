Relapsed after 256 days :(

Not sure how it happened, but I made the mistake of "I'll just have one" during a very stressful period. 

It's been about five days or so of smoking and I definitely don't want to continue, but for some reason I don't feel the same resolve I did when I quit 256 days ago.

For those who are in the process of quitting now, don't make the same mistake I did, I really regret doing it. The "pain" of ignoring a sudden craving is nothing compared to the disappointment and feeling of waste you'll feel if you succumb. And it's not just the health effects and the stench, it's demeaning and humiliating to be a slave to a roll of dried up grass, to have it dictate your mood, affect your actions and your thoughts. I really hate it.

So, I made a mistake, and I guess it's day one for me again. But if I did it before, I can do it again. And this time I've learned my lesson, I hope.

365! An entire year without that monkey on my back.

I feel good. I haven't even really thought about smoking for a while now.

Completely cold turkey. No gum, patches, e-cigs, nothing!

I smoked my last cigarette on September 2nd of 2012 at 11:30 am (I'm a bit early with the post, but oh well) and just decided not to get a new pack. It wasn't easy, but I did it.

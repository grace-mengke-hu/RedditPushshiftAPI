Smoker's Flu While Vaping?

I'm trying to quit smoking. It's 10 days without a cigarette so far, but I have been vaping 6 mg (not high usage but about 10 "smoke sessions" a day to help with cravings) and I'm either getting the smokers flu or sinus infection. Has anyone gotten the smokers flu while vaping? I figured that wouldn't happen until I quit vaping as well..... I have nasal conjestion, on/off sore throat, dry scratchy throat, occasional sneezing, and mild headaches.

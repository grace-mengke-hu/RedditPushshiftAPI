I haven't quit yet, trying to plan ahead...

So I'm 30/f, smoker since age 15.  I'm starting to experience scary health complications and I'm desperate to stop smoking.  I set my quit date for new years day... I'm usually way too hung over to smoke for a couple days.  I'm reading allen carr's "easy way".  

To be honest I'm pretty scared about quitting.  I've tried to quit 4 times.  Thw longest I made it was 7 months.  I slipped up at a new years party and that was that.  Somewhat fitting that i'd try to quit on new years day several years later!

Quitting makes me psycho and emotionally unstable for months.  I'm really nervous.  But if I don't quit now I think I will be dead very soon.

Quitting I can handle, but when do headaches become a Doctor problem?

Almost a month in, and the headaches won't stop.
Everyday I have to take some advil and some days I have to hide in my office, put on some relaxing music and avoid as much human contact as I can get away with. It is true that it is a small price to pay for being healthy. However headaches for a week or 2 would have been enough to drive the point across. 
I drink lots of water, eat healthy, and just started back in the gym last week. However I work full time and do school part time. I have already had to take 2 days off work for withdrawal issues and my school has been on hold for 3 weeks (it is a in your own time/at your own pace course which is helpful) however it is rather hard to comprehend mathematics when you want to rip out part of your brain.
My question is, at what point is this no longer a 'take a advil and push through' and 'you need to see a doctor'.

If anyone else has suggestions on fighting the headaches, I would love to hear it. Most of the internet is "Drink water and switch coffee for tea! Sunshine! Rainbows out of your ass!!!!" which is helpful you already didn't follow these things before you quit.

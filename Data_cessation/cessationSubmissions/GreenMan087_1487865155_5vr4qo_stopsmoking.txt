Quitting this weekend

Turning 30 this weekend. I have been dipping pouches for about 5 years now. I quit once for 75 days, gave in and been dipping daily.

Any advice and preparation? My plan was to buy a lot of gum and mints. My goal will be to reward myself with $ etc. ie if i make it 2 weeks straight, buy myself some crest white strips.

Any other advice or support? Going to use the quitnow app too.

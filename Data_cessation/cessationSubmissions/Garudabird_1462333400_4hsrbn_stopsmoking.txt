Is this normal?

I have quit smoking more times than I can count and each time have had a different experience with what and how much I cough. This quit was planned but moved up a bit by a cold that hit my chest. I've been coughing up quite a lot and I'm not sure how much was from smoking and how much the chest infection. Either way I'd rather have it out than sitting on my lungs. It just seems to be going on for longer than I remember. It's been 10 days now and isn't lessening.  Also I think I have also damaged my wind pipe from coughing and I have a metallic taste in my throat from the blood. Is this normal or should I be considering consulting a doctor?

On My Way; One Deciding Factor

Hi guys,

Same problem, different dude, you know?
I've been a smoker on and off since say... 2011. Up until now it's been on and off quitting; I'd affectively drop the habit due to say money, health etc etc, but until now I've never been totally serious.

I've never been a heavy smoker; 5 a day at most when sober, but just 10 minutes ago when brushing my teeth I ended up spitting out black. Not black phlegm, which I've always associated with the lungs cleaning themselves but actual black, err, foam? Whatever one calls the by products of cleaning teeth I guess.

Needless to say, never seen this before and I was sufficiently freaked out; freaked out enough in fact to log into my seldom-used Reddit account and enquire about this.
I feel I should make this more relevant so I shall ask; black spit, not phlegm, is that normal? Honestly never seen it before but it scared the shit out of me. 

I'm somewhat new to Reddit and as such new to board rules so by all means correct me if needed, apologies in advance; I'm just kinda struggling here guys. Many thanks in advance, and if anyone has any help for me, I'd muchly appreciate it; starting to realise how destructive my habit is. (I'm effectively 24, so I'd like to think nothing heavy has been inflicted as of yet, but the early bird stops smoking, err, earlier.)

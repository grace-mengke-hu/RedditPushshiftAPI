Got a nicotine free electronic cigarette.

It's menthol flavored.  I love it.  When I get hit with a craving, I just take a puff or two and put it back in my pocket.  It helps in a way you would not believe.  I guess different things work for different people, but man this is almost like carrying around a tiny hookah.

I'm doing pretty well right now.  How's everyone else faring?

As im getting rid of another bad habbit i just remembered i was a smoker.

Just checking in to tell you in not a smoker anymore. Did not have the urge in month. Last time it was when drinking and lingered for like 5 seconds before it let it go.

it took me 2-3 years of wanting to quite before this time i had streaks from 1 week rising to 6 month with pauses of month on times. If you fail remember this is a journey with one possible outcome: Im not addicted anymore.

Have a good day!

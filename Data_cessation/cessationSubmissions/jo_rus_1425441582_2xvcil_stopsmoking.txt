2 weeks!

Wow, it's been 2 weeks. Not gonna lie, cold turkey's been tough this time (serial quitter, 27 years smoking 1/2 pack a day-ish). Am currently sucking on a cinnamon stick because I just had a trigger but I'm not going to smoke.

What are your triggers? How do you move through them and stay successfully quit?

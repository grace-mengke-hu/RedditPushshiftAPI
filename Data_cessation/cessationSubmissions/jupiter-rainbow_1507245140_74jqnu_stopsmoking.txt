Terrified of smoking, terrified of quitting, need advice.

So I’m a 37 year old extremely busy mom/wife/work full time. I’ve smoked a pack a day since I was 16 (I only recently realized it’s actually been that long and it freaked me out). I’ve never really REALLY tried to quit smoking before. I have always given up after like 6 hours. 

I have crazy health anxiety which is all the more reason I NEED to quit smoking. I worry about heart attacks and cancer and strokes and emphysema almost constantly, yet I still smoke! And I recently noticed that I kind of run out of breath when I talk now, very scary.

My biggest fear is of dying while my daughter is young. It’s my number one reason for wanting to quit. I’m really nervous about quitting though because I’ve never done it. I’m panicking just thinking about it! I want to be excited about it instead. 

My husband quit by vaping and 3 years later he still vapes at the lowest level of nicotine there is. What do you all think about vaping to quit? I know it’s replacing one form of nicotine for another but if it gets you to quit then good right?

Also do any of you find any apps helpful? 

I have been stalking this sub all day and have seen posts where people have quit for a long time and still have cravings or they relapse. I wish we could all go back and never smoke from the beginning.

I need everyone’s best advice! My life depends on it.

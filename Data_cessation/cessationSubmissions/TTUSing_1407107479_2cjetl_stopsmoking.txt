Day 1 -- First accomplishment

I successfully woke up, got dressed, got coffee and drove to work without having 2-3 cigs for the first time in 14+ years.  I have no hope it will last this time to stop quitting... but for now... I am not smoking and that feels good.  I think I will have to take it seconds at a time, sometimes minutes at a time if I am lucky but I am determined to remain a non-smoker.

Reading this forum off and on the past few months have given me the confidence that there is light at the end of the tunnel and I am not alone.  Thanks!

*Edit* Well... I have made it through lunch and didn't really feel the need for a post meal cigarette.  I have now been cigarette free for 14 hrs and 5 mins.  Wahoo!!

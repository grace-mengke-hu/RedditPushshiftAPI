This seems too easy?

So it's almost been 2 weeks and all those other previous times I quit I would have caved by now. For some reason I haven't and it doesn't seem like I am going to. I read Easyway and everything clicked.

I know its supposed to be a 3 week or 1 month period and my true test will be coming in 2-3 weeks where I will binge drink at a party with a ton of smokers, but right now it seems way too easy.

Am I setting myself up? Or is it really this easy to just stop? Almost 10 years smoking and within these 2 weeks its like I never started at all.

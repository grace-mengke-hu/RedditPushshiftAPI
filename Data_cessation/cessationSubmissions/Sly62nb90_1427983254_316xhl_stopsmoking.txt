Really looking for some motivation to not buy a pack.

I've been fighting the urge to smoke for a couple of weeks. I've given in more then I should, and had a few with friends or at work. And now. My motivation is gone, I feel beaten, I feel like I should just go get a pack so next time I have a urge I'll just have it with me instead of hunting for one off my co workers like a wolf. Help :( a exhausted beaten smoker.

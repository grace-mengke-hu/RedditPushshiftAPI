It's my anniversary tomorrow.

Nine years.  At least I think.  It's been so long, I can't honestly remember for sure if it was 2006 or 2005.  I'm almost to the point where I haven't smoked for as long as I did.

To all of you who are about to quit or just quit, and are having a hard time, STAY STRONG.  You can do it.  Before you know it, you'll have that 4 digit star.

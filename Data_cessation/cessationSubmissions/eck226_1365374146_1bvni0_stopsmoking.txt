4 Weeks, 5 Days down. Doing good, but have a question about a cough I've developed.

So I smoked for about 17 years, some times almost a pack a day (2000-2003), but more recently (2008-Quitting) it's only been maybe a half pack a week, and occasionally half a pack, maybe a bit more, in a night while drinking. So it's been a bit over a month and I finally went for my first good run since quitting. I was in the Army most of the time I smoked and it was never an issue. But since I quit I've been super busy at work and finally got out for a run.....and it hurt, bad. It felt like I was breathing blood for the first mile or so, and now I've developed a deep chest cough (about 3 days now) and have been coughing up some pretty nasty stuff. Is this just a result of my stopping, or is there something more I should check out? The reason I ask is because I don't have insurance and just going to see a doctor is going to run me a minimum of $220.

Any help would be awesome! Thanks!

Day 0

Today is my first day. I'm 21 and have been smoking since I was 16. I normally smoke a pack a day. I want to quit mainly for the financial aspect but also for the heath aspect. I've had the thought in my head to quit for months now. I just haven't been able to make the jump. Well today is the day. Cold turkey.

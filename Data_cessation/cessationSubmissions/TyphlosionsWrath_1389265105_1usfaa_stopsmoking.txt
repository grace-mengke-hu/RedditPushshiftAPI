My mind is making so many excuses to grab a cigarette

I've been off cigarettes only for 24 hours and my mind is literally making excuses as to why I should smoke. I tell myself "I'm stressed, I enjoy the habit so what's wrong?". After work I wanted to rewarded myself but I haven't done it yet. I've been killing the cravings with gum but it's too much now. The only reason I quit is so I can get some good stamina for my workout. What did I do to stay calm?!

Dealing with Hunger &amp; Weight After Quitting

I’m over 3 months into my quit and have noticed that I’ve put on about 10 - 15 lbs. I realize this is amount of gain is common but I find myself constantly craving food and worry it is going to continue to trend this way.

When I was a smoker I’d sometimes skip meals  and not even realize it. Now I’m finding that normal sized portions just don’t cut it and I’ve been, snacking frequently throughout the day. I’m having to talk myself out of over eating just like I had to talk myself out of having a cigarette when I quit smoking.

Anyone else struggle with this? Long term quitters, do the food cravings eventually go away?

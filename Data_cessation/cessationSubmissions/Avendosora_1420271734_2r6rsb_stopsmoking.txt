I hate everything

I have for the first time in my adult life quit smoking.  I hate everything right now. I have smoked since I was 12. I have not once in my adult or even post pubescent life had to face a day without smoking.  Not a single day.  I have now gone 2.  I want to upend my whole life and say to hell with this and go have a smoke. I want to throw away my marriage (The consequence of me smoking since my husband has demanded that I quit smoking) and just light one.  I don't even know what will happen the first fight we have after this.  I have never had to endure conflict without smoking.

I have been an addict for my whole life.  I;m not quitting for money, health or personal betterment. I'm doing it because my husband told me too.  I don't even know if I want to keep him now. Its hard to decide if this is the addiction speaking or if this really is the last straw...

Edit**  Day 3, Still hate everything.

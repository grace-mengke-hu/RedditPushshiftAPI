Quitting after more than 9 years of starting and stopping!

Hey guys! 

As noted, been smoking for almost 9 years, not quite in the traditional manner. 

*Age 18 Started off smoking a couple PrimeTimes which turned into a half pack of cigs a day.

*Age 19 - 21 Half a pack of cigs a day.

*Age 22-26 - No more cigarettes, 1-3 Black-and-Milds a day
-occasional cigarettes when drunk

*Age 27  - 1 Black-and-Mild a day, at night. 


If you have known me anytime in the last 4 years you wouldn't know that I smoked. The only ppl who have a clue would be my best friend and my girlfriend. 

The only time I smoke in public is when drinking, when I can play off the casual smoker card. 

Basically for the last 4 years I have been smoke free during the day, but need the strong strong hit of that Black-and-Mild to put me to sleep at night. 

I'm a very active person and have logged 10's of thousands of miles biking/running/swimming over the years. Competed in many triathlons and distance events as well as competitive swimming. Never stopped smoking for more than a few days in preparation for an event. 

I've been smoking to put myself to sleep at night for so long that I don't know what else to do!!

I really want to give this up but the problem is I really do enjoy it before going to bed at night. 

Anyone else have a similar experience?

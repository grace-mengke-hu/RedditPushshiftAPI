I know quitting would be good for me, but I'm smoking because I hate myself

I'm 24, been smoking since I was 19. I quit for awhile semi-recently but picked it back up on my 24th birthday, back up to 2 packs a day. I dont enjoy smoking, I do it because I'm bored or when I'm anxious. I know quitting would make me feel better, but at the moment I dont want to feel better. I'm not suicidal but I do have thoughts of death and I want to hurt. Right now I'm more depressed than I've been in a long time. All day I've felt like a zombie, and I'm not gonna kill myself but I wish I would just die.

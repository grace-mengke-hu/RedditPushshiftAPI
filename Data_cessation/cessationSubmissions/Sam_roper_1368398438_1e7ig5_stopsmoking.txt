It's sooooo hard!

I have smoked for 18 years, but only about 4 a day, I got DVT recently (at the age of 34) and have been told to give smoking up, I'm on day 19 now, but it seems to be getting harder! Been using the nicotine tabs that go under your tongue, which have helped, but when do the cravings get easier!!?

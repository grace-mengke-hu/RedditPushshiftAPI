DAY SIX! IN 24 HOURS, I WILL HAVE ONE WEEK!!

Wow!  That just feels good!  I made it cold turkey for six days!  One more day gives me a week!  This sub is a such an inspiration and so much great support!  I am so grateful this sub is here -- and all of you posters and lurkers too.  I feel your support and it makes a big difference!  Anyway, six days!  Yeah!

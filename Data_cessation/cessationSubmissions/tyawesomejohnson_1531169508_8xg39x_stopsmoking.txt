Brain Fog/Anxiety need advice!

So I quit smoking cold turkey exactly 14 days ago (two weeks) and I also suffer from an anxiety disorder and have had panic attacks since age 13.
I’m 19 years old and smoking and used dip along with also juuling for about a year. 
Long story short, my nicotine use was insanely high. 
Well it’s been 14 days since quitting and I’m still feeling restless and am having constant 24/7 anxiety and horrible brain fog. 
I’m not as bad as week 1 but the duration is honestly starting to scare me.
To anyone else who quit, I just need to know, how long does the brain fog and constant anxiety last and when does it start to get better? 
I’ve already decided using nicotine again is not an option and with how terrible I feel I never want too again but I just need to know how long before I start getting better.

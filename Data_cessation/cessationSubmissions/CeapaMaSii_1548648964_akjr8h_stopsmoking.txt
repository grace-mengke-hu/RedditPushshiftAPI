Is a joint cheating?

Going strong, 2 weeks now but im kinda conflicted about my smoking weed habit. I have a small one daily. Im going strict discipline in my life lately, letting go of most bad habits and oh boy there's lots of them. I just feel it would be to much to let it all go at once so I decided to keep my little daily joint. However, i feel its interfering with my quitting cigarettes I feel guilty every time. Could this cause a relapse?

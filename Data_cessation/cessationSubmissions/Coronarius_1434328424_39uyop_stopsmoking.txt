Half a year later

Having smoked 14 years, nearly half my life, 1-2 packs a day, sometimes more, I quit a few weeks before Christmas last year using the Allen Carr method. I just recently hit the 6 month mark and, fellow quitters, I've never felt better in my life. I have way more energy, I'm less grumpy, I sincerely enjoy physical activity now. I didn't drink much when I was still smoking, but now I barely drink at all. I've also managed to lose about 20 pounds with—ideally—20 more to go, all of which can be attributed to quitting. If you're a long-time smoker, quitting will improve the your quality of life tenfold: the feeling of triumph alone is the most valuable of experiences.

Thanks guys, this community helps a lot. Excelsior!

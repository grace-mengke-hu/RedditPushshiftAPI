Quit analogs!

Hi all! I have been lurking around, and just had my badge made, so I figured I would say hi! I quit smoking earlier this year cold turkey, but wound up going right back to analogs after about three months due to stress/not being mentally strong enough to continue. On Friday, I was close to the end of a pack, decided I was sick of feeling like crap all the time, and decided to switch to vaping, just as a final crutch in the hopes of being nic-free ASAP. I used a less-than-ideal vape situation in my first quit, but it didn't make it any easier. This time, I invested in a nice Aspire starter kit, and find my needs are being sated just fine. I bought all 6mg juice (a couple of different flavors), but decided that I am going to buy 0mg juice next. Really, I just want to be done, and I think that vaping is going to be the thing to do it. I am using the Vapemate app to help keep me on the straight and narrow, and it's really helping! I just thought I would introduce myself and say that I'm happy to be off analogs!

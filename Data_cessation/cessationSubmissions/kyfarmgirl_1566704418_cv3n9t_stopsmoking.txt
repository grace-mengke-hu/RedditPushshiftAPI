Emotional roller coaster

12 days free!!!!  I am so thankful that I have made it this far. I usually fail around days 5 to 10(on my numerous previous attempts). 

The mood swings and depression started hard around day 4 and was pretty terrible through day 10. I am starting to feel much better. Also I had difficulty using the restroom, sleeping, cried a lot, felt week, was exhausted, just basically felt  awful!!!

I used my previous attempts to help me figure out what did and didnâ€™t work on my previous attempts. 

I am investing a lot into this stop. When I wanted a cigarette, I would call up my mental image, repeat my mantra, and think about all I had invested and would be throwing away. 

Things that seem to be helping include:  

I was able to work from home.  

CBD tincture (get the good stuff not from the minute mart)

Stop smoking app

Sunflower seeds

Mental image of pushing cigs away

Mantra:  NOPE=not one puff ever

Allowing lots of snacks

Drinking lots of water

Comparing smoking to being on my phone

So I'm 22 this year, been smoking since the prime age of 18 (5 years goes by fast..) I've decided to ditch the smoking after a family scare and personally it is quite hard.

Today's Australia day and I'm surrounded by mates who don't smoke and I'm thinking, I can either piss off for 5-10 minutes and have a smoke and none of them would care... or I can sit here on my phone for 5-10 minutes in front of them with no smoke in my hand awaiting the response.

Obviously 2-3 minutes in I've been questioned... just as I type my story on my phone my friends are saying 'get off your phone ya loser'.

So what I'm getting at is that by replacing a smoke for a phone for a short period of time can help resist those cravings from the people surrounding you!

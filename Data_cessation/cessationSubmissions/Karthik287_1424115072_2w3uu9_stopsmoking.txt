Finished Day 1

For about a week or so I stopped smoking during the day having been on around 15-20 a day for 5yrs. Between finishing dinner and going to sleep i'd smoke between 2 and 5 cigarettes. Having tried to quit so many times before it was during this time that I really understood something Allan Carr said. You really only enjoy cigarettes after a period of abstinence. Yesterday as I was doing the same thing I realized just how idiotic this endless and pointless cycle was and said I'm done. Like clockwork, after dinner I had the pangs but I just waited for it to pass,it took about an hour, and I honestly feel like if I can make it to day 4 I can make it to month 4. I'll be back here to give and receive support as I ride out nicotine withdrawal.

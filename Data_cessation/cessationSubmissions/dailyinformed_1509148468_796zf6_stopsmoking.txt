Why do we keep going back? (After many months off)

I remember in 2013 I quit aproximately 6-7 months. Then went back into it.

Quit in 2015 for 1 month

Quit in 2016 for 1 month. Then quit again for 5 months.

Quit in 2017(for 2 months).



Why do I keep going back after months off? Looking back I'm totally confused. It doesn't make sense.  All I know is one day I'm totally convinced that I should stay off.... then one evening I'm really tempted to "live the old days" but then I abstain and the next day I'm like "shit... That was SOO CLOSE. I'm glad I didn't do it".

But there's only so many times that I can dodge a bullet so close.... So In the end...it eventually it gets me... 


Why Do I keep going back?!?!

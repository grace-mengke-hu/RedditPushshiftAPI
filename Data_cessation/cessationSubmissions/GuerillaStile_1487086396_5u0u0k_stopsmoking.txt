Almost at 2 weeks.

So I am at 13 days and I can't keep my mind straight. It feels like my head is on fire and covered in ice at the same time. Last time I quit I made it 7 months and don't remember anything this intense. I don't plan on going back but i feel like with my mind going like this I can't concentrate on my wife and 5 month old daughter. And I don't want them feeling neglected. Especially on valentines day. We celebrated last night and I couldn't even make it through a movie with my wife. I hope this part ends soon. Thanks for letting me rant.

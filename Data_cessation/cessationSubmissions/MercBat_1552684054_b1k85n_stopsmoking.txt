Im scared, can my lungs recover?

It's been around 13 years, I've not smoked loads and loads per day the whole time...but for years I did and not just cigs.

Will my lungs heal after quitting? How much have I shortened my life? 

Life was terrible for so long and smokeing helped, iv worked hard over these years to make sure that now it's not and won't be again, but what have I done to myself? I want to live a full life now.

Can anyone shed some light here

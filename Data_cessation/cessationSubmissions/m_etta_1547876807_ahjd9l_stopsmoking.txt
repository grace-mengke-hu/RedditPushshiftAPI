That last pack

When I quit three weeks ago, it was actually pretty spontaneous. At that time, I had a nearly-full pack in my purse, and one extra pack in my luggage (I was traveling). 

The weird thing is, both packs are in the same spots 3 weeks later. I haven’t touched them.

Part of me likes the challenge of knowing they are there and still not taking a single puff. Like it requires even more willpower. But a small part of me thinks it’s really stupid and I need to just throw them out. But then I just...don’t throw them away. It’s this weird situation that seems like it’s no big deal but for me it’s like, a thing.

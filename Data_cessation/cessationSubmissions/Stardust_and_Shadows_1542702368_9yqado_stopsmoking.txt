3am cravings

I am 2 days into not smoking. I am doing it with Wellbutrin and The patch.  


Ok, doing good. The cravings are pretty much mental or near the time to take another pill. It's not been fun trying to break the habits. I have the normal "Do something with my hands and/ or do something with my mouth or Eat something" problem. Eating wins most of the time.  What is killing my chances to quit are the 3am cravings.  I would wake up at night just to smoke. Ta-Da here I am awake. I was looking forward to not wake up just to smoke. **"So, my question; how to not wake up at night to smoke and breat the cravings?**  I had to get up because it was so bad I was doing the to frustrated to sleep/getting pissed off and tossing and turning.

Day 80

i like to come in here from time to time and just look at my number. I have a counter on my phone, but checking my number here feels more real.

A coworker asked me why I keep checking x marks off on the calendar. I told him it was a nice mental block. If I get tempted now a days I can think of my counters, and think about the shame of resetting them. If its  real bad craving, I cut to my tooth picks. But I haven't used one of those in weeks.

11 years I smoked, off and on, heavy and light. I've never made it past 90 days before. Always caved, always felt like I controlled it now. I know now, after 11 years, that I can't. I can never be a causal smoker. I can never have one every now and again. That no matter what I tell my self, I can't cave again. Just one more smoke and I'll be back to bumming loosies or buying packs.

My smoker friends don't believe I've made it this far with out a smoke now and then, that's on them. I know the truth and I'm proud of my self.

Thank you for being here, I came here years ago while I was trying to quite again, and I've come back again this time. With hope in my heart that I will never be so weak again that I will have to reset my counter. That my number will keep climbing, and in time I'll forget about the struggle and be free of my addiction.

11 more days and I'll be smoke free longer then I have been in 11 years. I know I can make it. All those struggling on day or week one. I believe in you.

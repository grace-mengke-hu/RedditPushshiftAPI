I quit... Again!

I quit a few weeks ago. I'm feeling a bit stronger, getting ready to boost my health with deep breathing and yoga. Pretty excited. Mindset is everything. I didn't want to smoke any more. Too expensive. Stinky. Sickening. Blegh! I just stopped. I'm happy. I dislike smoking. I don't feel wobbly.  
Good luck to everyone.

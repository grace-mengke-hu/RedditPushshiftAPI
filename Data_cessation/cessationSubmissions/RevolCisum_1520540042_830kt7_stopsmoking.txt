Day 4

I'm still using lozenges bc cold turkey had me needing benzos to not flip out.  I'm using way below what they allow, and hoping to stop them at no later than 2 weeks into quit.  Still feeling pretty strong in my resolve.  Def eating more junk, gonna have to get that under control quick.  But so many perks already.  I'm breathing better, tasting and smelling better, sleeping better.  Ready for spring and hoping to get out in the yard soon, fresh air and digging in the dirt time without cig breaks!

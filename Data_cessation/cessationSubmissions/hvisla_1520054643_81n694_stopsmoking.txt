Six months!

(More officially so, if February had enough days. Oh well.)

I’m so proud of myself for this; it’s the longest I’ve gone without a cigarette since I started smoking several years ago. But at the same time I’m frustrated that my husband hasn’t followed my lead and tried to quit yet. It’s likely because my quitting saved us some money when we were broke, but now that we’re less broke, he can justify his habit again. (Also, he was at it long before I came into his life, which makes it that much harder. Sigh.)

Anyway, sorry for the quick rant. I’m still very proud of myself. Here’s to another six months!

I feel like crap!

It is 3am where I live, and I'm going into day 3 of quitting. My body aches and I have an awful whooping cough (only sometimes productive). I have been doing levalbuterol treatments as I am asthmatic, but they've been getting me so jittery that I've stopped halfway through whenever I try one. My ears and my nose are stuffy and I can't string a sentence together without feeling like my throat is so dry I must cough now and my eyes decide to cry and make me look like a little bitch. 
My boyfriend is annoyed at my coughing but is trying to be understanding (considering it's 3am). He's a smoker too and when we said we'd quit together, he bought a pack a few hours later. I'm not going to lie, I kind of hate him for bailing on me. I feel like I could set shit on fire right now if I weren't so sluggish. I'm sorry for not formatting, I feel useless and I need support.

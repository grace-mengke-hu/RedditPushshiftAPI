*sigh* Trying to Quit Again

My dad died of lung cancer, so in theory, I "should" know better than letting myself fall into a pack a day habit. I do know better, I swear I do know better. So I'm wearing a patch today and I have a spare to slap on if I sweat it off on my run today. 

My hands aren't hot anymore. My heart rate is back to a normal range, my blood pressure is closer to a normal range, and I'm going to stick to it until I can wake up and go onto my balcony without wanting a cigarette and don't have to wear the patch to keep losing my mind. 

Thank you everyone for the inspiration. Lurking here has really motivated me to take the next step.

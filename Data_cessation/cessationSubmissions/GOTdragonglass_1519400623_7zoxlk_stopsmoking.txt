Quitting side effects (not the health benefits)

So I'm curious what side effects people have noticed when recently quitting cigarettes.

My last smoke was on Sunday and I'm having a few nicotine mints a day to control the rage and suddenly I'm getting intense vivid dreams nightly which are a bit weird/horrible. Like last night I was had a very uncomfortable friendship with a psychopath who showed me his secret underground murder room, great tiling and drainage O.o I woke up not feeling good!

Also broke out with some annoying spots this week too.

Has anyone else noticed anything?

I quit over a month ago, but why am I tired all the time?

Hey all,

I quit just over a month ago (May 9th was my first day without) after a 9 year habit of about half a pack to a full pack a day near the end. I'm happy about the decision and it's actually been a bit easier than I thought (so far, knock on wood).  The one major change I've experienced so far is that I feel so tired all the time.  I thought quitting would immediately turn me into a decathlete instead of making me want to nap at 2:00 PM every day.  I've been scouring the intertubes everywhere for an answer as to why I feel so tired all of a sudden.  I read a few things about how when you smoke, the nicotine regulates your blood sugar (or something to that effect) and when you quit your body has to figure out how to do so without the stimulant you normally gave it as a smoker.  Is this true?  If so, how long does this phase last before your body begins to revert back to "normal"?

PS:  I also quit drinking and smoking marijuana (heavy on both fronts) on the same date as quitting cigs.  I'm assuming that has something to do with it.

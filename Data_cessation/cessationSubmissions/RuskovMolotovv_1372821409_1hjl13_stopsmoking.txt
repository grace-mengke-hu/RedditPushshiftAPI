Resetting the badge...

Oh I feel shitty! After 28 days of a relatively smooth sailing ride, with the occasional cravings, but really nothing too bad I discovered one of my strongest trigger. I put more than 15h of work into a project this weekend (on both days, so about 30 total), pushed myself far, but didn't accomplish my goals in the end. The physical and emotional fatigue that resulted only increased my deep feeling of defeat, sadness and disappointment. 

When you're so tired that all you want is a hug, I made the mistake of buying a pack. I didn't enjoy the smoke, it didn't make me feel better, but it sort of reassured me through a known routine. Now of course, having slept a healthy amount of hours, I feel horrible and more depressed because that's another thing I failed at. Now I have that pack looking back at me savoring its (temporary) success...

I feel beat and uncertain that I can face the first fews days again, which were in my case like many others the more difficult to manage... I guess I just wanted to put it out there and feel accountable. Thank you for listening, I'm gonna go cry in my corner now (half-joking).

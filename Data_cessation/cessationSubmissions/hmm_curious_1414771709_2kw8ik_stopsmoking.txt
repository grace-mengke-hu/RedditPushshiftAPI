Close to an year in and almost collapsing

Hello

**TL: DR
As you can see from by badge, I'm close to the one year mark. All things were going somewhat ok until a few weeks ago when I started thinking about smoking again.  The thoughts below are probably the smoking demon talking. I'd appreciate if someone took the time to knock some sense into me.** 

* I'm demotivated, probably because of the onset of fall and I think that smoking will restore some of my energy. Somehow I remember myself more active and determined while smoking. Thinking about it now, when smoking I managed to get the determination to quit,  so this somehow proves that I had more energy. On the other hand, I was feeling the same de-motivation last year, and I thought that quitting smoking will cure me of it. 
*  I'm generally more stressed about work. Since I've quit smoking I've started to grind my teeth at night (occasionally) and my dentist warned me that this is mostly due to stress. I'm also naturally grumpy and a somewhat negative person (I'm mostly focused on point out errors instead of giving out praise) and I think that smoking will somehow cure this stress and make my negativity more manageable. This is a major point for me and I think that I would be more happy with myself if I do it. Somehow the anti-depressant role is important. However, I've also gotten a promotion during this year and the added responsibilities are also responsible for my stress. I'm also close to 30 and seeing life differently than my early twenties smoking self.
* I'm hungry. All the time. Before I quit I was loosing weight and managed to drop down 7 kg (from 89 to 82) but since then I've almost gained them all back. I also drink more when I go out for beer, probably to satisfy this hunger/urge, and I've started to drink more at home (I'd use a few beers during the first few weeks to help me sleep better without smokes).
* Some of the benefits of quitting are not as strong as advertised. Yeah sure, you can smell and taste things better, but after a few weeks you get used to it again and you're not surprised/happy about it any more (you just take it for granted and ignore it). About shortness of breath - going for long runs or bike rides is still hard work, although it is easier. 
* I guess that some of the drawbacks of smoking are also forgotten. I no longer feel my pulse regardless of how much coffee I drink, I get fewer colds. My promotion has made me forget about the monthly savings I get by not smoking. 
* While interrupting, the smoke breaks were giving me clarity and allowing me to focus my mind on work and on people. Now I'm more short-sighted and I still get angrier than before. It's a bit harder for me to keep my calm at  times, although I'm still well above average in regards to controlling my anger.
* On the other hand, I don't have an uncontrollable urge to go to the shop and get a pack right now. I've decided to at least wait until I get to the one year mark, and then when I'm wide awake and sober decide if I want one. I quit cold turkey and haven't had a single puff since.
* I'm also heavily anchored by the fact that I've motivated my wife to quit (power of example and by giving her Allen Carr) and I'm afraid that if I were to cave, I'd drag her along with me.

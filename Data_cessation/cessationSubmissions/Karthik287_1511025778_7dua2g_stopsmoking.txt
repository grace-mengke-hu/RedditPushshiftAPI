2 Months Today

Hey guys. 2 months today. You weren't kidding. It does get easier with time. There are days when I don't even think about cigarettes anymore. I did have one hiccup about 2 weeks ago when I was drunk and had a smoke. I hated it. I felt nauseous and hungover the next day. If anything its made my resolve even stronger. I haven't had a drink since that night though. I feel like I can't trust myself around alcohol and wonder when that association will die. I do enjoy a drink and this break from alcohol is definitely helping me get in shape faster. Its just surprising what a powerful trigger alcohol is because I don't even think about cigarettes anymore when I'm sober.

How can I be supportive?

Hi all,

My girlfriend of 3 months has been a long-term smoker. Started when she was 18 and is 28 now. She's trying to quit smoking as it causing her health issue. She's trying to quit using nicotine gum and I think she also have some patches.

She was doing pretty well for the past week, but eventually withdraws got the best of her --she was having panic attacks -- and she broke down and smoked a cigarette.

I'm trying to be supportive and make her feel that she can do it - as many of you have - but I don't know how. I've never smoked in my life, so I can't pretend to know what she's going through. I'm also not trying to belittle her efforts either, I know it's not an easy thing. But, at the same time I feel that when she breaks down --and has to have a smoke -- she's not being strong enough... I obviously can't say that to her.

How can I go about making her feel supported?

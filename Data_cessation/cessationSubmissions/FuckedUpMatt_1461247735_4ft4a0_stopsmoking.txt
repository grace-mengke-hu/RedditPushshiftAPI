i'm really trying.... Afraid I'm going to fail...

So I have been smoking for a few years now, one - two packs a day.... And last few days I've been sick.... Smoked 2 cigs per day (didn't inhale, just keept in my mouth, because my throat hurts).

So today I decided to quit. Smoked one more, almost choked, grabed a pack and threw it in the river....

Now I'm carving so much! What to do.... I know I will die again from coughing and hate it, but i really wanna quit..

How to stop the carvings and stop smoking for good?

Help please?

P.S. Sorry for bad english...

Update:
Failed at day 1. 
For a next few days (2 days) I will limit myself to 4 cigs a day... Then going to the seaside where I will be busy most of the time (I'll try to be busy) so I will not bring the pack nor buy it.

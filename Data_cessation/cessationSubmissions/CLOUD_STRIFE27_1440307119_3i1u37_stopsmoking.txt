I bought a pack of smokes tonight...

...for a friend and it was kinda weird but in a good way.  I'm 6 months in and buying a packs of smokes, even if it wasn't for me, felt like new ground.  It initially felt like I had never done it before, when in reality I had done it many times in the past.  I guess what I'm saying is that it really does get easier with time and you guys can all do it.  I hadn't really had a moment that made me feel this way and it was nice to finally experience one.  


Keep it up and join me in not smoking today.

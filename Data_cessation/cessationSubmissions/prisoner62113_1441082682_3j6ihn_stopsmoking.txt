Thoughts about advertising

I grew up in a western country where for as long as I can remember cigarette advertising was banned. But now I'm in Indonesia, one of the heaviest smoking countries in the world, a place where travelling cigarette salesmen roam the country handing out samples to shops and the like (yes, really). 

Advertising is commonplace here, although it is restricted to some extent. They are not allowed to show cigarettes, or people smoking in the adverts.

So they all end up like generic car adverts. Lots of flashy unrelated images of people wandering around large apartments, laughing with random people, or driving around cities at night, and some meaningless tag line like "Get ready for a bold new experience".

Which got me thinking. Are cigarettes really so shit that even when manufacturers are allowed to advertise, they can't find anything good to say about them?

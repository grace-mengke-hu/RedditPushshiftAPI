I started smoking at age 14 and I'm turning 30 in a couple weeks. I want to quit. I need to quit.

The title is pretty self explanatory. I've tried to quit twice in the past 14 years. I did ok on the patch the last time I tried to quit. That was three years ago. For the past couple days, I've been coughing a lot in the morning and having a hard time catching my breath and breathing. I really need to quit but I am afraid I'll just say "fuck it" and not do anything. 

Right now, my plan is to go back on the patch on friday of this week when I get paid.

I'm also an alcoholic and I smoke a lot more when I drink and I'm worried about not smoking with my drinks. Help!

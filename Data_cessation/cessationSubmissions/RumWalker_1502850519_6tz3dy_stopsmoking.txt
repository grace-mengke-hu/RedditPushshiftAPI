Day 5, attempt number 6. When does it get easier?

I'm moody. I'm snapping at my wife and step-kid. Every time I walk into the garage or out the back door (where I used to smoke), I want to leave and buy a pack. I still check my pockets when I leave the house: *keys, check; phone, check; wallet, check; lighter and cigarettes... oh, yeah, I don't smoke anymore.*The longest I've gone before is 2.5 months, and inevitably went back to my pack-a-day habit. I'm expecting failure, now, as I've "quit" so many times that it didn't take. 

I want to smoke, and I don't. I like the act of smoking, I LOVE the instant "load off my shoulders" feeling, but I don't want the health risks (and it costs way too much, when you start adding up months and years). 

I'm using Chantix this time, but I still *want* it. I find myself thinking "Well, maybe I could just do one or two a day, like after lunch and when I get home from work."

Sorry if this post seems extra whiney, but I'm struggling tonight.

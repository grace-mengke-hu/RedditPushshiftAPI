Looking for advice regarding my recent use of nicotine

I started using nicotine gum recently as I realised that nicotine is the only thing to help with some terrible headache I get. The closest to being a smoker is years ago when I used to smoke pot daily and mix it with tobacco. I eliminated that habit 2 years ago and never had the feeling of be addicted to tobacco (but it can be said that I kicked what was a strong dependence to pot).


I use the nicotine to support my meditation practice (by getting rid of the awful headache) but I expect to end up relying on it even more when I will go back to work (I'm on vacation). 


So far, my use is about 2-4 gum per day at 2mg each. 


I feel that gum will do less programming in the brain than cigarette, as there is not the actual physical movement. It also feels like it goes less rapidly to the brain and instead fill my brain slowly over the course of 30 minutes (and I get maybe another 1 hour before the effect will be mostly gone. If my headache hasn't returned, I don't feel the need of taking more.


I would like information on nicotine addiction actually works. Does our brain change permanently to requires it? Does refraining to use it for a few days every week can help prevent such thing to happens? 


While there is adverse effect on health (microvascular, as an example), I find the addictive properties less scary than something like benzos (which I use sometimes in small dose) as those have a strong rebound effect that can last for a while. I'm I right?

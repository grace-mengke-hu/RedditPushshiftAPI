I quit right now

I've been smoking for 3 years on and off. Smoking upto 4 or 5 a day recently. I've finally made up my mind to stop. Thanks to the inspiration from a lot of you guys. Writing this post is my first step to commitment.
To new quitters like me: Let's do this. Cold turkey. Are you with me?
To the pro quitters: Thank you for the inspiration. Any tips would be appreciated.

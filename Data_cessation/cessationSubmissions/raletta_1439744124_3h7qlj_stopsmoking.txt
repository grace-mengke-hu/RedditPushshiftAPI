Which are your worst days?

Which days were the hardest for you?
I think day 3/4 are typically difficult but today (day 7) is the worst for me, which is why I need to distract myself by talking to you  guys. :)

I also remember that I failed sometimes after 3 weeks. I think it is caused by a false sense of security and the typical "one cigarette can't hurt"-lie.

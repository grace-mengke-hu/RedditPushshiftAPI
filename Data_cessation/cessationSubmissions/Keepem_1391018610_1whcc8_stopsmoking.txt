Commit Today

When I quit smoking for the last time, I didn't know that I would make it this far. In fact, I didn't know if it was going to be forever. I didn't know anything about my commitment. All I knew was that I was sick and tired of cigarettes. As much as I would crave and want them, I was tired of them. 

I didn't give myself a range of when I wanted to quit, I didn't set up a quit date, I didn't do anything. I just came to the realization that the most important thing for me and my life goals didn't include smoking cigarettes. It became #1; nothing is more important than a life free of smoking. When that was the highest priority, feeling bad didn't matter, wanting to concentrait didn't matter, headaches didn't compare, nothing could match up to my #1 priority.

I would invision myself months down the road, no smokes in my pocket. I realized that if I continue to think nothing is more important than not smoking, I will be there very soon. Low and behold, I woke up this morning. The day is here. 

This could be you too! Time continues on, despite any excuses, persons, or anything else. It will move forward with or without you. One day you will be waking up 6 months from now. Now ask yourself, on that day, will you be smoke free?

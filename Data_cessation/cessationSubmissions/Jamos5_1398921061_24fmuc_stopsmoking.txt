It's getting better all the time!

It has been 2 weeks and 2 days and 9 hours since my last cigarette. I'm feeling proud and confident but also wary. It seems too easy. Last night I had a nightmare that I smoked a cigarette. In it I was driving and had a cigarette in my hand. Next thing I looked down and I had smoked the cig without even realizing it.  I've never been more relieved in my life than when I realized I was just dreaming!  Anyway.... That's all.  I realize the title doesn't quite match the tone of my post but I got that Beatles song in my head so it's going to stay...   Anybody else have nightmares about smoking?

3 weeks clean and a short story to tell!

Hey all,  

I quit a little over 3 weeks ago after 10 or so years. I just found this subreddit and saw that it was encouraged to share stories so I hope it's ok to share a [post](http://www.cragglerock.com/rambling/3/5/2016/smoking-haemorrhoids) I wrote about quitting and some reasons why.  

If this sort of thing is frowned upon please let me know, and I'll delete my submission.

Having read through some of the posts here over the last few hours, it's been interesting, motivating and humbling to see how long some people have been off tobacco!  

Being off cigarettes (and weed) for the last few weeks has been a strange feeling but it's helped me put more energy into writing, drawing and picking up my guitar again. I'd like to continue documenting what life is like without a nicotine addiction and I look forward to reading and commenting on the journeys of others here!

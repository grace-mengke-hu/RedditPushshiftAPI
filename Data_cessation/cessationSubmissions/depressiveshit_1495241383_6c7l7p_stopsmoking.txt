20 days already and I want to get back to smoking.

So, it's almost 3 weeks and I still haven't fully gotten over it. This experience however encouraging it got and no matter how much it made me feel proud of myself, it made me realize that the cigarettes weren't the only thing killing me, but also depression. It's the depression that's going to kill me if I don't ever get back, not cancer, not smokes. I started working out hoping I'd manipulate my mind with the endorphins, but this kind of manipulation is already over. I mean I wound up pretty much alone and I know I'm fighting this alone, but this is just too overwhelming. I don't want to get back to smoking, but it seems as if cigarettes were my only friend back then. It's kind of hard to face this reality, I mean I've been through lots of fucked up shit and it's already no use going on living healthy or anything. Everyday is the same, I don't feel safe anywhere, not at home, not anywhere in the streets, fucking discrimination and fucking abuse makes me angrier everyday, at everyone, makes me less comfortable in my own skin. I live in Egypt and I'm supposed to be studying art, but college is full of shit and nobody is actually interested in creation, everybody is just looking for grades and stuff like this. I know all this bullshit might be irrelevant here but it's been a huge burden and I couldn't just take it anymore, I had to spill it all out anywhere. Also, seeking professional help is not an option, money is an issue, and psychiatrists in Egypt don't seem to know what it is exactly that they're doing. I hope I can stay strong to quit and go on living, I just hope. I don't even know why but I hope.

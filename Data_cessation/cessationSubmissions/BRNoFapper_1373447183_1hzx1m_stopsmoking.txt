Lungs feel weird when I wake up!! Question inside!!

Hi Quitters,

27 days smoke free here. Don't miss it and I am definitely doing fine!

It has been almost a month but I feel my lungs hurting and they feel quite weird in the morning when I wake up.

What can that be? Do you guys think that is still a side effect of smoking? If so, will that go away?

I smoked 1 pack a day for 4/5 years.

Cheers

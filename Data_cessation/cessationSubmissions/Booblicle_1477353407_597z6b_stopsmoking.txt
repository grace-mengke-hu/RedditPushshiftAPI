1101 days or about 3 years.

I wouldn't have really thought about the date except  for an instance of persistent irritation I've had to deal with for the last week or so and it dawned on me that that irritation was comparable to the addiction of cigarettes, but on a much subtler note. It made me smile understanding that this  irritation has  given me less stress than my average past days of smoking. 

It still feels like last month that I quit... well except that I'm profoundly more active, and healthier - I've been running 3 days a week since I quit, off and on. Happy with my legs, I've now started cross-training for an improved upper body. ðŸ’ªðŸ˜„

I have absolutely no desires for cigarettes and would probably choke on the f thing if I tried. I hate smelling the things, but I live with smokers so it is a constant thing I have to deal with. This arrangement has effected my dreams on more than one occasion. But alas, I'm unable to change the people around me. I can only change myself. 

I'm not here to offer help this time. Well actually I will.

Small edit: it seems reddit killed 90% of those posts I've created, or I suck at reddit searching Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

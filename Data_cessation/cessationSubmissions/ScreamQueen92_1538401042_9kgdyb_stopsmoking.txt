Made it to 3 weeks!

Made it to 23 days so far! Have stepped down to step 2 patches, and aside from a few moody episodes and a headache yesterday, still going strong! Today was a lot more, “normal”

I never thought I’d go 24 hours without a smoke, let alone 3 freaking weeks!!! 😊😊😊

I could not be prouder of myself! 

Another milestone for me is tomorrow, I get my full licence after nearly 9 years! (I was on my learners/permit for 6 years due to having no car and my probationary for 3 years) 

Things are finally looking up!

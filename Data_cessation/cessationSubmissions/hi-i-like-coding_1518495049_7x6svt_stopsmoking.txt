Depressed, and feeling like I might smoke again

I see other people smoking, and I feel like I'm missing out on something. It seems like it's the social aspect that keeps bringing me back to smoking. This time I'm a little bit wiser. I hope.

I'm starting to have those familiar feelings... the thought of: "well what if I just have one." Historically, it has never worked that way. Historically, one cigarette has always led to more cigarettes.

This has happened to me before, where I've gone some long period of time without smoking, and then I start to feel curious again and try lighting up a cigarette for "old time's sake"... and usually I'm back to a pack a day in no time. The last times were no different, and this time probably wouldn't be any different.

I've kind of been struggling with this for a while.

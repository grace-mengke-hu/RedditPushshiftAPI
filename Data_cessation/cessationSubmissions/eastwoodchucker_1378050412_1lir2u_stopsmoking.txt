Haven't even made it a day yet, so tempted to buy a pack.

Smoked for almost 10.5 years now, around a pack a day. My wife, 6-year-old and 2-year-old are my reasons for wanting to quit, but at the same time, right now, they are being the reasons I want to have another. How do you guys get through difficult moments that your cravings just tend to make 10x worse? I already have a horrible temper, and couple that with a night of sweaty first-few-hours withdrawals where I didn't sleep much, and my 6-year-old refusing to ever listen to me at all, I feel like I should just run off and live in the woods for a couple of weeks or something just so they don't have to be around me. Help. :(

Concentration

So I'm not sure anyone else has this problem or if I'm really that much of a mental case, but it's been almost 8 months and the ONLY thing that has really bothered me is I have not regained the ability to concentrate. More specifically, when I do try to concentrate by intention I find I cannot and I get frustrated and then angry at myself for not being able to concentrate. This all started when I quit smoking and I'm having problems dealing with it lately. I used to take a quick 10 minute walk around the block when I got that way and it my brain would sort the thoughts out and I'd be ok for the a day or so.

It's 9F outside with almost a foot of snow on the ground, a quick walk isn't happening.

Anyone else go through this? What did you do to help it?

I'm sure I have some sort of ADD or something, but I'd rather approach this in a more healthy way than a doctor prescribing a drug if I can help it.

Thanks in advance! You guys have put up with me a lot since I quit almost 8 months ago, it helps a lot.

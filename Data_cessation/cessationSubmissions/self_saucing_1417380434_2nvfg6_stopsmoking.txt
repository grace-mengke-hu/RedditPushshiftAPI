404 filthy smoker not found

Hi all, just dropped by to check my badge and couldn't pass up the  opportunity to use that number.

After smoking *heavily* for 20 years, I posted here (from my old account) when I was at 40 hours and on struggle street.

To anyone out there struggling:

**It gets easier**

Easier and easier and easier. At first I took it second by second, then minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, week by week, month by month... I'd say I'm now taking it year by year but honestly I missed my day 365 because **now I don't even think about it** (except occasionally when someone smokes near me and I think "I can't *believe* I ever did that - and smelled like that!)

Keep going everyone, you are all wonderful!

p.s. I blew up some balloons yesterday - it was *easy*

11 Days! But for the past two days I've been coughing up blood. Help?

So for the past two days in the mornings and randomly throughout the day, I'll get a bloody taste and sometimes cough up a small amount of blood. I havent been coughing that much, a few times in the morning, so I dont think I've irritated anything in my throat. A quick glance through online has satisfied my hypochondria into thinking I have cancer, so I was wondering if anyone else has experienced coughing up small amounts of blood after quitting smoking? My lungs also feel like they hurt, if thats any help.

Thanks!

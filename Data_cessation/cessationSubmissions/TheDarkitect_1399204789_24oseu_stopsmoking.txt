First day, harder than I thought.

Every time I smoke a cigarette I go on my balcony, and light my cigarette in the night's silence, it's a very peacful moment for me. I'll definitely miss that, but yesterday, I just found myself on the balcony mimicking the smoking gestures and breathing heavily... Quitting cold turkey is hard.

Wish me luck !

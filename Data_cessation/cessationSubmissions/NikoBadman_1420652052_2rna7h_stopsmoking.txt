Day two...and been there so many times before.

OK, it's been two days without any cigarettes, and its not even on purpose... I just didn't buy or smoke any cigs without realizing it.  

How do i keep going now?? - i feel really motivated and searched for this sub. Cause iv'e had good experience with weight loss due to the comunity feel on these type of subs. Most of my friends smoke - even my GF smokes... I know the cravings are going to be there. After one beer. After one spicy meal. With the smell of my morning coffee. You name it.

I guess all i want to know is how the hell you guys are doing it.

Have a nice day.

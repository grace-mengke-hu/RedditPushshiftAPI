A little motivation for you fellows! Day 7

Quit cold turkey a week ago. Was fine until now. 

Today I encountered a minor problem/nuisance, which gave me anxiety.
I have never experienced anxiety, but the combination of nonsmoking and problems was a little bit too much for me...
I was so tempted to smoke again as I was convinced it would take away the anxiety. I was on the verge to give up - but you know what?
I said fuck you to my addiction and struggled through the day and Iâ€™m lying in bed now feeling great and proud!

What I want to tell you is: I am not a person with a strong will, i have often weak moments where I betray myself. If someone like me resists the urge - YOU CAN DO IT TOO!

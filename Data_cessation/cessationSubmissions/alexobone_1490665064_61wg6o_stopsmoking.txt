Something really weird happened and I want an explanation

I'm 21, smoked since I was 15 and was really addicted. So addicted that I smoked tobacco through a bong most of the time so I would use less so it would last longer. Smoked all day every day weed as well. Loved smoking never though I could quit because I liked it and I was so addicted. I've tried to quit MANY times but it was simply too hard. Then a miracle happened. 
I just woke up one day and wasn't addicted any more!? I didn't crave tobacco in the slightest. I actually felt sorry for people I saw smoking. I have no interest in it anymore. I don't even want it when I'm drinking or at work. I recently became single and that causes a lot of stress but yet did not crave tobacco once. I have had no withdrawal symptoms like mood swings or anything, it's just like I never smoked in the first place. All I've had is a positive cough and it's positive because each time I cough I expel a bit more mucus so feeling more healthy every day. So yeah guys...wtf happened? Any ideas? I'm not complaining! I feel amazing! But why!?! Could it be the power of god because I prayed or something? I don't know!?!

24 hours in.. shit.

So, I've only been a smoker for a year- however I vaped for 4. (I know, I did it backwards). I started cigs because i got sick of the habit of vaping 30-50mls a day everywhere, the battery panic, all of it. 

I was convinced smoking was easier, because I had to go outside to do it, and could regulate it. What a lie. Now my whole world is scheduled around it.

Mind you guys, I am now 7 days sober and a hardcore recovering alcoholic, so what better time to quit smoking than when you also quit drinking? 

Not sure why I decided to quit during the work week. Sitting at the office on Reddit only one day in and I can't focus at all. The cravings are insane. 

Wish me luck guys.

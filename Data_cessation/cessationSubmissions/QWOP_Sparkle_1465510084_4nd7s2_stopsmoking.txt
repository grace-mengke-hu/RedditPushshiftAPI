A year and 6 months after quitting, I'm getting chest pains again...

Hey r/stopsmoking, I just wanted an opinion on wether or not I should see a doctor or if this is still part of the quitting process.

I know that the moment you stop smoking, your lungs start clearing out all the tar and stuff and that it can be uncomfortable a few weeks and months into it.
For a while now the chest pains have mostly gone, I've only had the one instance these past few months where I've coughed up tar with little discomfort.

Recently, my chest has been hurting again, occasional tight feeling and sharp pains in the frot and back of the chest. It feels very similar to the first few weeks where I quit.

I don't know why it's happening again, is it normal for these phases to come in and out over the next 5-10 years? It's worrying me abit, it's not so painful to the point where I can't do anything, it's just uncomfortable.

Who else has been working on quitting smoking by vaping?

Since the separation from my abusive ex-husband in 2011, i've been smoking. I've tried quitting 4/5+ times since i started. Medicine helped me stop, but once I felt fine (on my own) I would stop taking it. As soon as I got around friends who smoked, i'd tell myself, "Just one"...and as you guys know...if was never just one. I'd start back so much stronger. 

Then, I was introduced to vaping. I could have as much nicotine as needed in the device and ween myself down as time went on. I started w/ a 6 (from the bad advice of inexperienced sellers) then went to a 12. Since i was still smoking 1/2 a pack a day, I went to an 18. Same. So I went up to a 24, and stopped smoking cigarettes completely.

My beautiful new husband of 2 months has been very patient with me. He hates me smoking cigarettes but supports me, because he says he doesn't understand being addicted to something like that. He supports vaping, because he agrees it's not nearly as harmful as cigarettes. But, he (realistically) wants me to be completely independent of any type of smoking by the time we start having kids.

Have any of you been successful in completely quitting cigarettes by vaping? Those that have, have you been able to become independent of vaping at all?

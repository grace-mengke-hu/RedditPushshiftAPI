Bummed out

So I finally got to try chantix. After trying the patch, lozagens an gum and failing numerous times I was really excited to try the chantix as I felt like I knew this was going to be it for me.

I'm five days into the chantix and giving up on it. Not because I don't think it would wok but it's tearin me apart,

Constantly dizzy, anxiety, waking up multiple times at night in a panic and even feeling feint at times.

On a good note though. My efforts and ideas of quitting smoking have not diminished. While I was really in high hopes of chantix I've always had it in my head that if chantix does not work for me that I would indeed make another method work for sure...because I have to quit and really want to quit.

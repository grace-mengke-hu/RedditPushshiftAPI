I can't stay committed

I've gotten so pumped up about quitting, thinking of all the benefits. I approach quitting with the best of intentions and a sense of resolve, that "this is it". But give me a day and it all fades away, I no longer care about anything, the reasons just fade away somehow.
I think I could hold on through any amount of cravings if I could keep the mindset I had when I decided to quit, but my head goes to an entirely different place when I've been without my drug. I find it really frustrating... almost like there's some other me who's a complete asshole and sabotaging my efforts.

Does anyone have any tips for staying committed, and avoiding the mindset of "I don't even care any more, screw this". I can't seem to get past it.

Fell off the wagon

Had been cold turkey for 39 days as of yesterday. Started to drink some beers with friends yesterday, broke down and bought a pack (should note it was the first time drinking since quitting.. Woke up this morning feeling defeated, threw out the pack, and told my self to start over. This feeling sucks.

Any suggestions/tips to not give into the cravings while boozing??

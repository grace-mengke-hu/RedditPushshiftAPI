Just looking to start.

Hi there r/stopsmoking. I'm 18 and in college now. I've been smoking on and off for about 3 years now (bad, stupid, illegal I know). I told my SO I was going to quit earlier this year (in about June) and then I came up to college for summer classes, and it was a spiral downwards. I started smoking again (and I lied a few times to my GF about it, she's back home though so she isn't here with me). I've been trying to slow down smoking (I was probably about 5 sticks a day at my worst) this semester though, and I usually do maybe two a day (I know this is going to sound ***really*** scummy, but I quit buying packs and I just bum and that's helped). Sometimes I wake up in the morning and say "I won't smoke any today" or "I will only smoke one today" and it never works. It's even worse when I hang out with my friends. I have a problem saying no. I try to stay inside a little more so I'm not tempted to go and ask for one. But here's the strange thing, when I'm back home I have NO urge to smoke, usually because I'm doing stuff. I think part of my problem is boredom/unused time.  

Right now I'm at a loss as far as what I should do to fully quit. I'm starting a new workout regime this week too, and would like to get a lot healthier, and start by not smoking anymore.

**TL;DR**: Want to quit smoking, been trying to for a while. What can I do?

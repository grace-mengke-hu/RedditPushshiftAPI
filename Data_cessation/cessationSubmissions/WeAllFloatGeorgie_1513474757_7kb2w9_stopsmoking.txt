About to rip up my last five cigarettes

I've tried to quit so many times but I'm gonna give it another go. I got myself a gram of some slightly chiller stuff to smoke.. hopefully that can get me past the dreaded first five days if I make it stretch.

Wish me luck guys and any advice would be truly appreciated. &lt;3

Have been thinking of quitting for so long and finally decided to take the plunge today!

Have been smoking for 7 years now and it has been my go-to solution whenever I'm feeling stressed or just bummed out. After much persuasion, I really thought it'll be good to quit ASAP!

Well I hope this sub would give me the motivation to get through this, seems it's quite tough from what I've read so far.

All the best to me and all the others out there as well

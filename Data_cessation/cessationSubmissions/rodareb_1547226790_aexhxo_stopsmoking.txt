Im losing my mind over nothing. Funny - not funny.

So, I´m having some login issues with my ig - aaand now I´m crying. I´m on day 14, for now I allow myself one single serving of nicotine a day - it used to be over 9k (like 20-30)(for 8 years, I´m 23 please judge me).. 

Anyways, it´s not just rn - yesterday seriously I found myself thinking "Who the hell talks at 9pm???!!!" - because my roommate was in a phonecall and my neighbours  had people over - I almost shut down: put in earplugs,  anc headset, on top of that I wrapped my head in a sweater - and I swear to god I could still hear everything.   
I see now that I have some severe anger management issues without my tobacco, I´m simply falling apart. 

I´ve been an emotional rollercoaster, I was a messed up teenager, but this shit.. damn. Sobbing for 4 hours straight watching kids getting a new life or something on YT, almost texting my ex, following another ex on ig, having some seriously disturbing images in my head (skin getting cut and nasty stuff coming out of it), an urge to take a life - a fly would do, I just need something to die, or simply laughing my ass off for no particular reason, like please stop me. Please.   


I´ve been doing meditation, breathing exercises, cold showers, walks (walks give me serious craves though), but I´m still sitting here clenching my buttcheecks reeallly hard because for some reason thats where my stress goes.. 

So, this cannot be normal? I feel like a crazy person. Please help me..

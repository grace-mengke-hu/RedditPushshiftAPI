Smoked 2-3 packs a day for 33 years...

Quit 2 years ago today.

 People can come up with a thousand excuses not to quit yet. Try turning it around and using those excuses to quit.

 There have been times when I felt like bumming a smoke off someone. I've had a few people offer me a cigarette. Why throw away 6 months, a year, 15 months, 2 years of proudly not smoking?  So, even though there were times I wanted a smoke, I didn't need one. I would live better without.

 Most days, I don't even think about it anymore. It's been a long time since I've reached for a cigarette out of habit.

 Life is good. Best of luck to all who are attempting to quit and congratulations to all who succeeded.

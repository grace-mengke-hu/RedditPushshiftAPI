Day 4: nothing like I expected?

This strangely hasn't been that difficult. I've just been hitting my vape with 0 mg juice instead of my usual 3 mg and it seems to have tricked me into not really having cravings.

My mood has been way down in the dumps though guys, oh man. I've been depressed as *fuck*! When does that go away?

Quitting again

So I'm doing it again, and this time I'm determined to make it different. Just sent in a request to change my badge. Smoked one more cigarette, then threw out my (almost) full pack. I'm just so fucking tired of it all. The thinking a dozen times a day "I need to quit smoking" as I light up another fucking cigarette. The self-consciousness and self-hatred for standing outside puffing away as people walk by. I've hated the fact that I smoke for way too long, and hated myself for continuing to do it. My little in my fraternity hates it too, I can tell. He's told me that if I quit, he'll quit. I don't know if he will, but I want to be able to say "Hey man, I did it, it's your turn now." So here's to no more cigarettes, no more reeking of smoke, no more terrible cough, no more judgement in the eyes of my friends as they see me standing outside breathing in this poison, and no more hating myself for not being able to overcome this addiction. Here's to quitting.

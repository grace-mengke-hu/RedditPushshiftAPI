... that feeling that someone is sitting on your chest

Hi All - 

Tomorrow will be the 1 week mark for me (on the patch) and the past two or three days that I still wake up with that awful, someone-is-sitting-on-your-chest kind of feeling. Like I said, I haven't smoked for a week, but that feeling comes back some mornings. Anyone else still get this?

other that that I feel great. long drive this morning which was tough, but once I started driving I soon forgot about having a cigarette.

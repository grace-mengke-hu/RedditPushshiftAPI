Massive increase in depression

I’ve cut back drastically a few days. I brought my last pack and refuses to buy another. My ID expired and thought well why not quit now. I don’t want to get out of bed anymore. I suffer from PPD but have been unmedicated for months now. Tonight I’m suppose to go out with some friends to celebrate our birthdays. I don’t want to. I just feel like laying in bed and crying.

Doing it step by step...

Smoked for 25 years and recently decided I'd had enough.  My stupid smoking brain thinks it's smarter than my healthy "I'm in control" brain, so I had to get crafty and stay a step ahead.  I identified the main situations and feelings that brought on my smoking:

* Stop smoking in my car: This is where 50% of my smoking happened.  Bored?  Light it up.  Traffic?  Burn one.  30 minute drive to work was 3-4 smokes.  Driving to meetings was another 2-3 smokes.  Over half a pack smoked in my car.  Every day.  When I cut off the car smoking, I smoked like a chimney when I arrived at my destination (at first), but I decided I wouldn't just hang out at work and huff 3-4 cigs before going in.  Same with meeting friends for dinner, etc.  Everyone else is seated & chatting it up, and I'm outside jumpstarting a second or third smoke.  Weaksauce. 
* Stop smoking after tasks are done: On the job, I'd work on a project for a couple hours and "reward" myself with a smoke.  At home, I'd hang shelves, do dishes, clean up, whatever... and "reward" myself with a smoke.  Now, I stretch out, do some pushups, walk around the office for a couple minutes, and get back to action.  I kept reminding myself that the reward was NOT smoking.
* Stop smoking after meals: This was a tough one for me... something about that "Ultimate Digestion Tool" after a meal.  To counter this, I start imagining how dirty that smoke will taste compared to the nice burger I just had... imagining that dirty ashtray taste/smell as a side dish or dessert eventually kills the craving for me.

I phased these steps in one at a time and once I had these in my arsenal, the last (and most feared) step for me was:

* Stop smoking when drinking:  I like my beer.  I like my whiskey.  And I don't think I'd ever had either without cigarettes as a co-pilot.  As it turns out, they actually taste better without cigarettes (similar to the after-meal smoke).  When I'm drinking and get a strong craving, I usually drink a glass of water at a slow to medium pace.  It seems to help the "do something with my hands" fidgety feeling, and I don't end up drinking a dozen whiskeys and blacking out.  Best part of this is waking up the next day without the foul "cigarette hangover."

I still get cravings, but not nearly as often as I expected.  And the overwhelming majority of them are in these four scenarios.  I've been completely smoke-free for about 6 weeks with no patch, gum, etc.  And I haven't killed anyone either!

I'm just shy of two months and psychological cravings have come back with a vengeance. Normal? Advice?

I have been going along great - the physical withdrawal of the first three weeks was tough, but I had a lot of support and powered through. Now at just under two months I'm feeling irritated and angry all the time again, really really wanting to smoke. The other day a friend who didn't know I had quit offered me one and it was literally like catching my hand with my other hand while it reached for it, like it was possessed haha.

Holding strong, but feeling kind of bummed - no idea how long this will last, no idea how to make it better... I am still staying strong, but the constant application of willpower has ruined my eating habits, and other things that require discipline.

Any advice?

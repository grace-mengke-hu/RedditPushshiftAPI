I found a way to reduce my smoking, so I can eventually stop smoking completely!!

Because I'm switching majors and have to wait a year, I'm currently jobless. I'm living off my parents' money in my own little flat, and I spend pretty much the same amount of money on food as I do on smoking. I smoke too much, I smoke when I'm bored, I smoke *constantly*.

I found a way to reduce it though! I made it a must to drink a full 300ml glass of water before I'm allowed to have a smoke. I always have water on me outside to follow through with it then aswell, and it's helped me cut down so much. My throat is hurting less, my migraine from dehydration is getting better, and I'm spending less money on tobacco.

I'm a little proud of myself and felt like sharing that. I hope all of you are doing well on your journeys. :')

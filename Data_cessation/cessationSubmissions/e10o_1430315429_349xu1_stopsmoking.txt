How's quitting after e-cigarettes?

I'm on day 13 of not smoking cigarettes, but I have been using a cheap vaporizer to get me through. I'm curious to see others experiences using this transition of cigarettes to e-cigs to no nicotine.

I'm planning on dropping the e-cig this weekend, and I know the nicotine withdrawal will be there, but I'm not sure how it will compare.

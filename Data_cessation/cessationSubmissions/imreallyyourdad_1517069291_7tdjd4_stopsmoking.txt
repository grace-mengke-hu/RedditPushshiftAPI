How can I change my routines?

I am a student living with friends, and am currently trying to quit smoking. When I was home visiting my parents all was fine, I managed not to smoke for about 3 weeks, but as soon as I got back to university, I continued with my old routines (morning cigarette with my coffee for example). 
Any tips on how to change that are highly appreciated!

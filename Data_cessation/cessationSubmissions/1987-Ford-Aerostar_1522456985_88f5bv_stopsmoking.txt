I quit cigarettes for two months but have had some chew. Thoughts?

I haven't had a cigarettes for two months but I have bummed some chew from my friend only about one a weekend for three weeks now.  I feel good about it but I am still on the tobacco.  Do you think this is progress or am I just being an idiot?

I unintentionally quit but I want to make it last.

By "unintentionally" I mean the I smoked pretty much a full pack of smokes Saturday night when I was drinking. Usually I would only smoke ~5/6 a day. But this night I was drinking heavily because I had jut been promoted and wanted to celebrate so I smoked a lot more.

The following morning, I woke up and my mouth tasted like an ashtray and even the thought of smoking made me feel ill, that's without the hangover from the alcohol. So I didn't smoke at all yesterday and I just haven't bought a pack of smokes since.

I want to keep this up! I keep fighting myself from going to the shop to buy a pack of 10 to slowly take myself off it but I know I'll just smoke as much as I usually would.

Should I keep going cold turkey? Buying a 200 cigarette vape isn't ideal either because I would just abuse that.

How long until the cravings go?

What can I do to take my mind off it? I've watched 3 films tonight already.

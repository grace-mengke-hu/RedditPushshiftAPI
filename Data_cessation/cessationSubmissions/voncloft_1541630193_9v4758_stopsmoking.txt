I need help

I am an avid smoker - I love it, I am up to a pack a day - and  I know I need to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an addict, I admit it - Cold turkey works best - however the way I do that is by locking myself in my apartment for 2 days straight (I am a home body - I don't go anywhere unless I absolutely have to) - that will prevent me from going out and buying cigarettes and that is a "2 day win" and works most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

However I had a stressful week (had a funeral of a family member) - and I lit up to deal with the sorrow, pain, etc. Now that everything is back to normal (best they can be anyway) - I want to stop again - and with busy season picking up I just found out work is working every Sunday until the end of the year - so there goes my 2 day "prison".

&amp;#x200B;

I tried patches, gum, welbutrin, chantix all made me sick - what other options are there. I have tried to throw cigarettes out at night when I say "thats enough!!" - only to buy more on the way to the gas station on the way to work (if I don't I bum off of coworkers)....repeat

&amp;#x200B;

Has anybody operated this way? (I am thankful I don't have an addiction to illegal drugs - I know I would be in trouble (never tried them and have zero intention because I know how it would end) How did you beat it? I am a hypochondriac - and I fear cancer, which is why I want to quit......HOWEVER part of me is apathetic and just wants to smoke smoke SMOKE!!!.

Thanks for any advice

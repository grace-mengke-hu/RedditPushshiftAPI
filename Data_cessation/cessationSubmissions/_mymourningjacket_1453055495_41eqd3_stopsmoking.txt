Last night was amazing

I quit on NYE and last night was the first night where I honestly felt that my life is so much better sans cigarettes. I went to a friend's party and sang karaoke/played games and didn't have to miss a second of the fun to smoke. This morning I woke up and the only reason my throat was sore was because I tried to impersonate Scott Stapp on a Creed song last night (lol). I really can do this.

Today. The first of many, hopefully the rest of my life.

I'm making this post as a reference for myself on becoming a non-smoker.  It's something I've struggled with on and off for 3 years, but I've suddenly had a fit of strength to let them go.  

I can attribute part of that to buying Allen Carr's Easy Way, although I haven't finished it yet.   This is the first time I've truly felt liberated in some way with cigarettes, hopefully it stays like this.

Wish me luck!

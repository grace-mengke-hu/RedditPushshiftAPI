Quitting impulsively

Hi all, I've tried to quit no telling how many times now, and failed miserably every time. In the past, every time I've quit, I've tried to pick a significant quit date - my birthday, wife's birthday, anniversary, new year's, etc. Today, I decided about halfway through a cigarette that it was time to quit for good, so I tossed the rest of my pack (which I've never done before, for all my previous attempts I always finished my pack). I feel like every time before, I was just "quitting" because someone else wanted me to, but I really knew I'd pick it back up. I don't know why but I'm more optimistic than I've ever been before. Anyway, just wanted to share and see if anyone else had a similar "AHA" moment.

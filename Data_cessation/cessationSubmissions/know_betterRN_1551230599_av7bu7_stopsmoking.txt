What am I doing?

I quit smoking on Christmas. It has gotten so much easier since then. I’m already at a point that I only think about smoking once or twice a day, and this is after 20+ years of smoking. Lately though I’ve been frustrated with my increased eating. I recently lost weight, and I’m watching myself put it back on, and it’s so frustrating. I’ve been running my mouth for the last two weeks that I’m just going to start smoking again so I can quit eating. Welp, today I did just that. I smoked two entire cigarettes today. And I still ate like a freaking dumpster fire. Ugh! I’m so frustrated with myself. I just need y’all to say something to get my head back in the right place.

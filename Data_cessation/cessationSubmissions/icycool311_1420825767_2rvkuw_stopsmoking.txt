3 days been quit and feeling bored

i have stopped smoking and feel really good about the decision that i have taken for my life but the thing is i get this boredom feeling every now and then that i should get out of my house and do something since i used to go out of out my building to smoke. Plus i am jobless and don't have much work so don't know what to do. any ideas? 

is it just me or is it the feeling of the change in life?

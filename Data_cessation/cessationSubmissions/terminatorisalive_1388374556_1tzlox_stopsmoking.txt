Shit!! I took 3 drags...

I did it to remind me of how disgusting cigs were. It definitely was not enjoyable and it did what I wanted to confirm.  smoked 3 drags to feel the pain. I did that and it hurt...but I did it. Does this mean I have to reset my badge? Fuck the badge thing helps I wasn't thinking badge when I did it...

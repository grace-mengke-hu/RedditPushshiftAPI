Walkthrough post: Morning Cigarette

Let me walk you through how I am handling not having the morning cigarette step by step.

I wake up. I think about some alone time on the porch and having the fresh breeze on my face and having the morning cigarette. Did I even really quit smoking? I still have a half pack left? I can just ween myself off of the cigarettes very slowly and then actually have a seamless quit date. It won't even hurt that much if it juts hurts a little every time I prolong not having a smoke. I think about how many times I tried that and I failed. I feel like a failure. I'm still lying in bed. Maybe I can just prolong the time not having a smoke doing something completely useless like watching TV. Maybe by quitting smoking I'm procrastinating to actually do something else. So I'll have the perfect excuse for not doing any of it.
I don't have the perfect excuse for any of it. I need to do both. It's kind of ridiculous. I'm a grown up, I should be able to do the things that I set for myself. Am I this weak? I should be strong!
I'm still lying in bed, now my thoughts are circulating really fast and my pulse rises a bit.

I usually handle a rising pulse with a smoke. I get very worried about that. What if I don't manage to quit because of my stressful job? Again circling thoughts. I am still in bed.

I think about the pack. I visualize the pack with all the leftover smokes. I think: Two more days, that can't hurt. I think: I'm going to be such a bitch. I think: What if I can't do this.

I decide to get up, wash my face and eat on the porch.
I decide to take the next decision about this in an hour. Then it wouldn't be a morning cigarette anymore.

Day 2 thanks to kickstart by chest cold

I’m on day 2. I’ve known I need to quit based on sounds my lungs have been making. I got sick this week and felt too wiped out to get out of bed.  Now I’m on day 2 and fighting every second not to break down and buy a pack.  As luck would have it I’m also in overdraft so things are working out to my advantage in a weird broke ass loser with no health insurance kinda way.  Gonna stay strong

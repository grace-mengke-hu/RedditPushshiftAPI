Trying for my heart

I don't have bad blood pressure, but sometimes I get so angry by the littlest things. I used to not have these problems when I was quit for a good while. I also remember how much lighter my blood was when I quit. I bled a couple days ago and it was super dark red.

So I'm trying cold turkey. Please give me your best wishes. I've set up the app. I always remember when I quit for 8 months and remember how much better my body felt. My grandmother died from a heart attack at the early age of 60 and I don't want to ever have a heart attack even once.

Also, my smoking has gotten really bad. I've tried every NRT and vaping, but when I recently went to rolling my own with a machine I would smoke three at once sometimes taking breaks super often. It's out of control. I told myself if I were to go back it wouldn't be cigarettes.

what have proven ways been most successful to quit smoking, both for you and based on medical literature?

I'm trying to help out my mother and a lot of my family. I've thought a lot about things, and researched a lot but I'm not quite sure what to move forward with. I was thinking CBD and maybe other natural remedies that have anti-anxiety / stress properties, and possibly transitioning to a vaporizer such as a juul, or even one that is nicotine free.

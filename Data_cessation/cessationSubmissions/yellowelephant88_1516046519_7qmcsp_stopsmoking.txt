Celebrating one year smoke free

Hi folks, 

I've just gone past my one year mark of quitting cigarettes, a landmark I never thought I would reach in the early days of quitting. I've had little need for this sub in the last few months honestly but I've always stayed subscribed to try and help those just starting their journeys. 

 
 I just wanted to encourage anyone beginning their journey that it is possible and it gets easier every single day. I'd recommend reading or listening to the Alan Carr book and setting a quit date and using all the brilliant advice and support this sub offers. 
 
 
I'm more than happy to answer any questions if anyone has any, and wish everyone the best on their journeys.

60+ day Quitters: Can you remember what a craving felt like?

It's weird, I read these threads from those at the beginning of their quitting journey about how hard it is.  
I do remember it was difficult but can't for the life of me remember HOW it felt. Is this unusual?

I suppose I am saying is hang in there, the process is tough but soon you'll wonder what all the fuss was about!

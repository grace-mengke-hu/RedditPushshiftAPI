Dropping down patches

I'm on 2 day of no smoking and think these patches are actual miracle workers. I'm used to smoking 25 a day so it's just the habit I stuggle with more than anything at the moment 

I was wondering how long people left it before dropping down to a lower dose of nicotine patches. The leaflets says 6 weeks but that seems like a really long time.

Also does anyone find they can't sleep with them on? I'm going to try taking it off tonight and see if my sleep improves 

TIA

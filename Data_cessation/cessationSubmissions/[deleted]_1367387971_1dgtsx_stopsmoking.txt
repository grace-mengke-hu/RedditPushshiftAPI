Holy crap. 42 days! And now I feel the urge to smoke again because I have less than 45 hours to complete the assignments of one class and pass so I can graduate.

WARNING: drunk rant below with obscenities.

Basically for those of you who don't want to search through my comment/post history, last month my dad had a health scare, found out he's addicted to pain meds, and because I live with him, taking care of him is a priority in my life. Not that I have a problem with that, he's my fucking father and I feel that as his elder son I have a responsibility to take care of him since he is unmarried. 

But dammit did his health scare ever fuck me up in school. I was already depressed enough and quit smoking solely because he got sick. I'm falling behind in my Linux class and I really don't know what to do. I have one workbook and a lab test and a test to go through in the next 45 hours or I am fucked and I fail the class. Hence, I don't graduate, throwing away years of studying and classes that I have slaved through just because of ONE FUCKING CLASS, FUCKING LINUX. Something I'll probably never, ever, [insert Chris Jericho scream here] EEEVVVVVEEEER use in my career. Who the fuck made this a requirement for my major to graduate?

Anyways, I'm sorry but I had to let loose. If I fail out this time I give up on college. I spent most of my 20s in the military but it was never as hard as this shit. The sad part is that this is a fucking 2 year AAS networking degree, nothing like the 4-year+ degrees most of Reddit gets. (Go ahead, give me shit for going to a community college instead of a "real college"...) Never felt this strongly for a smoke, and it's in arm's reach. (since my dad smokes)

Fuck I'm screwed.

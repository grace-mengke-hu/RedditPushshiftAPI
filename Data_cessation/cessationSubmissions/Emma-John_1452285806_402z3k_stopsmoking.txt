90 days - will my quit-induced over active appetite ever go away?

90 days without a smoke and still having significant mental breakdowns here and there. I wish they would disappear but I have faith that all that is needed is additional time. Who has experience with managing their weight while quitting? I allow myself to eat what I crave because its better than dealing with an episode. Eating helps satisfy me in some way and in some cases I can avoid the fallout when I drift into a low mental state. Will I ever regain my eating habits I had before quitting? I know that it will take some work, but before I quit smoking I found it so easy to eat healthy all the time and meal plan. Now I lack all ambition and will go get fast food just cause its easy, plus you never know what will set you off at the grocery store .. the wrong price on an item coming up on the till can put me into a full on fit, temper tantrum. A coworker of mine who quit over a decade ago told me she gave herself 30 days of eating whatever she wanted, and she toned it back down after that. I feel like my emotional stability lessens with each passing day and I am too on edge all the time to be able to eat a diet that leaves me at all unsatisfied. Any advice on the subject would be awesome, even just speculative thinking.
Thanks!!

Quitting smoking and university

Hey guys!
So ive read Allen Carrs Easy Method book and was really motivated to give it a go but unforunately just lasted for 2 moneths.
Now i decided to give it a go again and re-read it and this time hopefully succeed.
The problem is i have an importand exam coming up in about 3 weeks and from what i remember from my last try especially these weeks were like HELL! I know that a single exam is nothing compared to a life as a non-smoker, but like for the sake of the exam is it possible ti study productivly in that time of withdrawal or will i definitely fail the exam? Or should i change my quitting date??ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©

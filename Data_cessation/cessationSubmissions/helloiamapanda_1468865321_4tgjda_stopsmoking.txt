How can I get my stubborn dad to quit smoking?

My dad has a myriad of very serious health problems that have recently worsened. His doctors are saying it's literally a life or death situation now and he NEEDS to stop, but he's so incredibly stubborn and naive. Right now he's being forced to take a month off so his doctors can monitor him because his problems are THAT serious, but it's not like he'll be OK at the end of that month if he continues to smoke.

I'm so stressed and worried because it's like he's not taking this seriously. He just kinda pushes it to the back of his mind and gives in to his cravings. I don't want to be without a father but don't know how to help. My sister calls him every day and my mom tries to help too but it's not enough. Any advice is really appreciated... thanks for reading

How long did you go easy on yourself?

By that I mean, what habits did you keep and what did you shift from early quit days. 

I’m on day 10, and I’ve been giving myself more grace as far as like taking a nap with my kid for 20 mins before I clean the house, having a piece of chocolate after dinner, etc. I was totally an emotional smoker with stress/anger/sadness triggers so I’ve been definitely feeling all the feels and while it’s helping to cut myself some slack, some of it I definitely feel guilty like I *should* be being more productive or switching out the chocolate for a more regular workout schedule but I’m also paranoid I’ll overwhelm myself and compromise my quit.

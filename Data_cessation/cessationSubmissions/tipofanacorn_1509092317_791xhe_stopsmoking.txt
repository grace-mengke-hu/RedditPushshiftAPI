Tv and smoking.

Yesterday I started binge-watching Mindhunter where they smoke constantly. Cravings are real. Good show though.. I've been smoke-free for 53 days today, and for the most part I have no problems. My girlfriend smokes and it doesn't bother me or cause cravings and I can go out drinking, no problem. But when I watch this series where there's a lot of smoking, that really seems to get to me. Cravings I get only last for like 10 seconds but I get many of them during one episode. Today morning I woke up thinking how I would kill for a cup of coffee and two smokes right now. But oh well.. just here to complain :D Stay strong. Back to my show.

Did anyone else get a swollen lymph node when they quit smoking?

I quit smoking a few days ago and now one of the glands on the back of my neck is swollen. I'm worried about this and have extreme health anxiety. I will see a doctor if this doesn't go away, but in the meantime, I wanted to ask you all if this is at all a common symptom when quitting.

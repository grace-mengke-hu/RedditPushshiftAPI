I have decided to quit smoking at the age of 19.

Hello everyone. 3 days ago I got a throat infection and couldn’t smoke. So I decided to quit then and there. Bit of a background info, my whole family from my mothers side are smokers, and my father and one of his sisters (who we always spent time with) were also smokers. So I’ve always been around smokers and though it looked cool. At age 15 I decided to buy a pack of cigarettes. (I’m from a country where there are no laws) I had smoked before but I had never bought a pack of my own. And for the next year every weekend I’d buy a pack of cigs. At 16 I graduated from high school and had a lot more free time and thats when I became a smoker. As years went by my addiction got worse and worse until I hit 18. My uncle died from cancer. him and I were very close and 1 pack a day wasn’t enough anymore and I started noticing my health and lungs deteriorating. I couldn’t play soccer (with the help of an injury) and couldn’t walk for long. As a result I started getting fat and so I reach where I am now. 19 turning 20 in 4 months. Have been smoking for more than 3 years. And can barely breathe or live my life. I’m going through withdrawals (coughing and vomiting) so need help coping with an adult life without smoking. Appreciate all the help I could get thanks.

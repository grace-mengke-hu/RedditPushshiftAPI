Nervous

I am 24 years old and have been smoking since i was 16. The time has come where i know i need to quit. Its expensive and the health risks just aren't worth it. Ive recently received chantix from my dr and took my first pill today. The weird thing is, it makes me nervous to quit and to think about quitting. What will i do when I'm stressed? How long will it take until i no longer want one? I wish i had never even started. I don't remember myself as a nonsmoker and I'm not sure how to be that. The real problem is that i enjoy smoking.. After a good meal, with a drink, after a bowl (i smoke weed), when a good song comes on the radio. Does anyone have any advice? Are there other people who liked smoking that were able to quit?

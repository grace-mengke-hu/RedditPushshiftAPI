Need help or recommendations

First time poster, 27F. Been smoking since I was 20 and have been trying to quit for a few years now. The longest I went was 5 days and I had a panic attack so I started smoking again. I need to quit. My grandma has lung cancer for the fifth time and the type of chemo her doctor has her on is seriously kicking her ass. She's down to 85 lbs (from 125), is barely eating anything, and now is in the hospital for dehydration and mental confusion. Turns out she has pneumonia on top of the lung cancer and it is causing dementia-like symptoms. It is scaring me, yet the first thing I did after finding out was lighting up.

I can't use the patch, I'm allergic to it. The gum and lozenges make me nausea's. I wind up smoking more using an e-cig. Going cold turkey is horrible for me. And I cannot take any of the medications due to problems with them and medications like it in the past. Can anyone give me some advice?

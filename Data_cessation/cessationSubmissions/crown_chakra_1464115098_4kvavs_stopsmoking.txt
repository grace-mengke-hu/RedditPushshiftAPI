I seriously recommend binaural beats for taking the edge of some of the symptoms

"A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, one through each ear becomes a new frequency inside the brain."/wiki

Roughly described; The beat i tried alters your brainwave-frequency to a more calming frequency state.
[Here's](http://www.binbeat.com/images/binauralsandanxiety.pdf) a study on 108 participants and [another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11191043) on 15 mildly anxious patients.

I used I-dosers [Quit!](http://idosersoftware.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=34&products_id=185)
Now there are a lot of beats for recreational use but many serious doses as well, for me it took away around 30% of the nasty feeling in my gut when my cravings goes wild. 
For best effect:

* Over-ear headphones are recommended
* Lie down with your headphones if you can stay awake
* Try clear your mind from expectations of the beat
* Meditating before a session gives the beat an easier time to do it's work on you.

Good luck and ask me anything you want!

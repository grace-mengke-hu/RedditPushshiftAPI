I quit smoking today after 33 years

I am scared but I am determined. I refuse to spend another dime of my hard earned money on cigarettes, and I want to walk up and down stairs without being winded. I want to breathe, and I want to SMELL GOOD. I'm using Chantix and it has really seemed to help me with cravings. Today I am done with smoking.

I'm almost there, but need help to get rid of the one cigarette I smoke at night

I've been diminishing my tobacco consumption over the last two months in order to eventually quit smoking. These days I only have the urge to smoke in the evening, even if it's only for one cigarette. When I go out I usually smoke two to three cigarettes a night, it's really hard to skip these ones as well.
I'm trying to get rid of these cigarettes in the evening, but I absolutely don't know how to do it. Do you have any tips ?

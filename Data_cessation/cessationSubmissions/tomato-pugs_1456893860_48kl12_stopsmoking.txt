Need support to quit smoking T-T

Hi everyone, 

I've been smoking for the past five years about 2-4 a day and sometimes up to 6 on the weekends if I'm around smokers. I desperately want to quit, but the demands of my work make it so much harder for me to kick this bad habit. I have become accustomed to smoking when I get home after a long day and before I go to bed. In addition, I smoke after a pro-longed time with others ....I feel the need to just be a lone and smoke to recenter myself.. I am considering nicotine patches or gum, but don't know too much about those.. and I am not a pack a day smoker, so I was just wondering if anyone had some strategies that may help someone like me... 

I've cut caffeine out of my diet already, and am struggling to get back into a routine of daily exercise.. Smoking just always seems to come back into my life despite everything that I do T-T. Any help/support would be greatly appreciated :)! <3

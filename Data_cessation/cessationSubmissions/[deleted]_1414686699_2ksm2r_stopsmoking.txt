Just need to vent... To public strangers

I don't have an actual craving, but I just really want to smoke! I've been feeling this desire for a while now. Actually, it probably has been there the whole time.

Almost 100 days smoke free. I realize everyone experiences this in their own way, but this desire is a little too prominent to ignore and brush off as normal.

Ugh. The weight gain is still keeping the negative thoughts around too. Is 15-20 lbs normal for the weight gain portion? I feel like hard candy and a little bit of extra snacking is all I've done and increased my gym activity (5-6 days a week). So frustrating to experience all of these negative side effects when I'm doing something so positive, right?

Just ugh! 

Thanks for the ramble space.

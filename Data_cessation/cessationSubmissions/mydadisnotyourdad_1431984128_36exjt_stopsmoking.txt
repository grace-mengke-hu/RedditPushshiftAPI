I'm a quitter.

I started smoking when I was 17. Today, I am 30 years and 3 months old. I told myself I would NOT be a 30 year old smoker. It took me this long to gain the courage to quit. It takes courage, right? To completely change a 13 year old habit? I started taking Chantix a week ahead of my quit date (last Friday) and have not smoked since. I did, however, stop taking Chantix due to it interrupting my sleep (I also caught myself sleep-walking twice). I have not had the crazy urges and cravings like I've experienced in the past. Perhaps this means I'm mentally ready to quit? Wish me luck, I've been lurking here for a few months and it has helped motivate me. Here's to never smoking again!

Stoping in 3 days

Next Wednesday, I'm done with smoking cigarettes.

8 months ago I stopped for 4 months, but after that I started a cycle for a buy a pack, then try to stop, last a few days only and cheat again. I need to stop for good now.

I know a hard part for me is when I'll be smoking cannabis with my friends. When I was in Canada, people usually smoke pure cannabis (joints or pipes), so that caused to problem. But now I'm in Germany and everybody smokes it in joints with tobacco. So I'll just have to tell my friends that I stop using tobacco, bust out my pipe and stick to the green stuff. But I know it's hard to do because it doesn't have the same social feeling of sharing a joint. But I'll do it anyway, I need to.

I'll tell you a bit more on the day I stop.

And good luck to others, you can do it for sure.

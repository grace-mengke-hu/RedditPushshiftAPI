Cheating doesn't have to be the end of your quit. But it sucks.

I'm at four weeks and I've smoked on seven of 28 days, sometimes just a puff, occasionally a proper night of hitting it. I've managed to pull back and keep quitting afterwards, but it's hard every time.

Cheating doesn't give you a break or relief from the stress of quitting. On the contrary, you're putting nicotine back into your system and now you have to mini-quit all over again as it trickles back out. 

I've got a known temptation coming up on the weekend and I'm just going to cancel until I'm feeling a little stronger.

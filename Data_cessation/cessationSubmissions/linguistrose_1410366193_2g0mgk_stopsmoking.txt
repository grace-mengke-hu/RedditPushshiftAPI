Today it's 50 days!

I've made it 50 days without nicotine. It's been super hard, especially with the semester starting and the stress of having a small child, but thanks to this sub (and a lot of personal strength), I've been able to get through it. Thanks for reminding me that I'm not alone and that it gets easier and easier!

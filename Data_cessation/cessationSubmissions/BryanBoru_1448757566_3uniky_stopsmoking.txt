I assume it gets easier.

My week tobacco free has been relatively smooth. I have not snapped on anyone using withdrawal as an excuse. I've been able to go out drinking and my morning coffee hasn't driven me to smoke either. I even force myself to be near my friends when they smoke. I do not want to be one of those preacher ex-smokers, but more importantly, I do not want to isolate myself from the smell/ environment using my quitting as an excuse. 

My fear is, if I isolate myself from it now, later when I end up near it without a choice, it will entice a desire and nudge me towards a smoke then. 

I know why I stopped smoking, and I do not want to smoke. 
Yet there is this feeling I've consistently had, similar to the feeling I had back when I smoked. If I was busy back then, I would think to myself, once I finish this task I can finally go smoke. 

And I have that feeling currently at times. It's all well and good, I own zero tobacco, I couldn't smoke if I wanted to. But it is consistent. I spend a large amount of time alone, and I 'could' just go and have a smoke and no one would know the difference, but my body would, and my mind would. and conscious and thinking me knows I do not cheat anyone but myself by sneaking a cigarette. but why do I keep thinking I am due to have a smoke soon. I check my apps and watch my time add up and it helps encourage me. I am curioous if other people have had this kind of experience and if they had, does it get easier.

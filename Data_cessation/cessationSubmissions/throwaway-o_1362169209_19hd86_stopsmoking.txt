Experiences with e-cigs and nicotineless liquid?

Anyone been able to quit smoking completely by trying e-cigarettes and liquid that has no nicotine?

I'm curious because I quit smoking completely using nicotine-laden e-cigs (what I cared the most for was not the habit, but the cancer and the smell) and I am now tapering off the nicotine.

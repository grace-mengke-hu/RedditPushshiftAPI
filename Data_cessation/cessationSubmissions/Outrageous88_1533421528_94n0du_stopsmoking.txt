Over a year under my belt

Hello all! I haven't been here much since around month 4ish. It gets better let me tell ya. Full disclosure I hit a cigarette about a month ago and it was disgusting and I haven't looked back. I am linking the link to Allen Carr's 'Easy way to Stop Smoking' this is the book that helped me in the beginning. I read it twice and took all the advice to heart and that was it.

The brain is a beautiful thing, learn how to use it to your benefit. I am proud of all of you! KEEP POUNDING

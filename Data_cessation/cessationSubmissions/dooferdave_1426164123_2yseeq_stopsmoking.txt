432,000 minutes into my quit and I feel great!

Ya that's right, me, 10 months quit. Man, I thought I would never be able to say that.

Last summer I got out my old bike and started doing lots LOTS of riding. But now I am back on the bike after a brutal few weeks of winter. Next month is two long bike rides, one is 62 miles and the other is 100 miles and NO smoke breaks. :) Gotta love spring. Two weeks after that, I hit my one year. Seems surreal.

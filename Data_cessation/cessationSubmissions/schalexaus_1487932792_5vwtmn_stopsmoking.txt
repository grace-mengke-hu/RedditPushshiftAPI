I've spent $50 on this quitting "attempt"

This is so difficult. I throw out my pack of smokes, and the next day something stressful happens and I buy a new pack. Then later that day I will toss it. Rinse, repeat. I've spent more than 50 bucks in five days doing this. The stressful craving will cause me to do such crazy, out of character things, such as picking up cig butts off the ground at the BUS STATION (EWWWW WHYYYYYY), dig thru old food in my trash to find the one singular half smoke I tossed. 

When I do this, as soon as I have the smoke I feel so disgusting and guilty for going to such great lengths. I've probably tried to quit 8-9 times in the past year and I'll do okay for a day or two, but then this happens every. Single. Time. Should I maybe give my IDs to a friend to hold onto (I'm young, so I need it to buy cigs)? I've considered it but I feel so ashamed to have to sink that low. It just seems I cannot get past the first few days of cravings, and then I completely reset myself and have to do it again. I'm sick of reliving the same 3 shitty withdrawal days over and over and over again. I can give advice to people trying to quit, great advice actually, I just can't seem to follow it myself!

I suppose this is more of a vent than anything, I am still going to try whatever I possibly can. Any advice would be much appreciated :)

Is it me or my addiction talking here?

I'm almost at the two-month mark, and I am experiencing horrible mood swings. I really try to act like my normal self and not let others know, because well, it is embarrassing.

I have a problem at my house that required me to put in a claim with home insurance. The field adjuster called me twice on Tuesday promising to make an appointment to see my home. On Wednesday, she told me she would make an appointment with me on Thursday. On Thursday she didn't contact me, so I contacted her and she said Friday from 9:00-11:00. It rained so it couldn't be done. Nevertheless, she didn't call to cancel or set-up a new time. She didn't respond to my text and the call went straight to voicemail. I called my insurance company and complained about her. When she called me back, she told me that nobody had ever complained about her before.

I'm not usually the type of person who would call and complain about someone to their employer. I know I'm irritable because I haven't had nicotine for so long. I'm starting to second-guess my sanity. Was that a normal response to the situation or am I over-reacting due to irritability from a lack of nicotine?

I don't see the point

I've been a smoker for 4 years, I'm 21. I started cause I thought I needed it. I was stressed out at the time, (girlfriend, college, being a teenager) and thought smoking would help- and it did. It helped me calm down until I needed another cigarette.

Instead of solving the issue in front of me, I created a whole new one. Even now, I still smoke, but I'm starting to fail to see the point. It doesn't relax me like I convince myself it does, not to mention all the negative side affects that I have seen through scare campaigns and such.

Obviously the fact that it will kill me does not bother me, if it did, I would've quit by now.

I'm starting to see that I follow logic, even if it's a logic or illusion I've created in my head. I feel like most smokers convince themself to smoke through making it sound logical in our heads. 

At the end of the day, you give that cigarette it's value. Yes, there are withdrawals, but I think most of them are mental. 

I'm not really sure how to end this, I kind of just put my thoughts down. I hope this made sense or helped somehow, it's helped me put a little perspective into smoking.

Vaping to quit? Or will I just use it as a substitute?

Hi forum,

My badge is wrong I am still smoking. I was thinking of buying a vape - some people recommended it. However, I had one before, many months ago, and I still smoked cigarettes too. I used the vape sure, but I kept up with smoking cigarettes.  I also don't want to keep using the vape forever, like I see a lot of people doing. I see a lot of people who just buy a vape and keep using it, and I don't want to do that I want to be done with putting shit in my lungs.  But also I don't because, umm, I'm still doing it. 

I'm worried if I buy a vape again (lost the old one) that I will keep smoking still, and keep using the vape forever.  So I thought I should try quitting by other means, but those other means (gum, patch, nothing) have not worked.  I don't have insurance/money to purchase chantix.  Also anti-depressants are a no-go, I don't want those and I've reacted badly to them in the past. 

What do you think? Should I give it a go with the vape or keep on trying with nothing?  Thoughts?

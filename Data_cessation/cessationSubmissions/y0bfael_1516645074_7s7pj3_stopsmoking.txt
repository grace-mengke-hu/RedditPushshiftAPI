Rewarding yourself?

I’m coming up on 2 weeks and a few people I have told I stopped smoking to have asked if I had any reward thing for myself as I go longer and longer with out smoking. 

I’m like not really?  Thing is I’m not a materialistic person.  And a lot of the things I want to do are much later in the year.

One of the things I was thinking was already semi part of a b day present to myself this year, that’s a tattoo coverup/possible full sleeve tat. 

There is also a trip to see/meet some friends that I game with later this year.  Other wise I have not really thought of any kind of reward. 

So I’m asking. What have you guys done at certain milestones. Anything small to large.  In life the only things I have actually rewarded myself with is unhealthy stuff. Want to change that. 

Thanks for reading and keep up the fight. I already feel a huge difference between week 1 and leading into week 2. 
This is worth it

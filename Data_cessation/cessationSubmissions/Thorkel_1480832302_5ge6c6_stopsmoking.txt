Relative dying of cancer. Quitting smoking and drinking

So, I woke up to [this](https://s17.postimg.org/pmi0tipf3/IMG_5063.png) the other day. 

Ray is a distant relative in her early 60s who has smoked and drank daily virtually her entire adult life, although she quit smoking a few years ago. I am 31/m, smoked about half a pack a day since I was 19, spent virtually all of my 20s as an alcoholic, and my relationship with alcohol is still unhealthy. 

Now, I want to make clear that this isn't the first time I have decided to get serious about my smoking and alcoholism; I'm not having a first-ever come-to-Jesus-moment just because a relative has cancer. I once quit smoking for an entire year, and for brief periods of time I have managed to bring my alcoholism under control. I've spent many years thinking very deeply about my addictions and how I can best overcome them. But this recent incident with my relative has made the urgency to quit smoking and drinking much more poignant to me. I really don't want to end up going through what she is going through at such a (relatively) young age.  I'm making this post because I have decided that tonight will be my last night of both smoking and drinking, and I want to join the "recovery" community. Any tips, questions and words of encouragement would be very welcome. Thanks for reading.

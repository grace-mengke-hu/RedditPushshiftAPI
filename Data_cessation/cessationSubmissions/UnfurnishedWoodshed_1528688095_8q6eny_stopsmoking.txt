Smoke free in my 20s

I’m turning 20 tomorrow and I just smoked my last cigarette. 
Tried to quit a few times before but never took it seriously and always started again after a few weeks.

I read Allen Carr and this man is a genius! I feel very optimistic that I can live my 20s and the rest of my life without these things.

I’m going to my birthday party tonight and it will involve some drinking and lots  of my friends smoking. Usually that would be a triggering situation but I don’t wanna spend one more second of my life suffocating myself, so I’m still gonna enjoy myself tonight! 

I’m finally free and it feels so good!

Reading "Easy Way" without smoking.

So I've read "Easy Way" while smoking and it didn't work before. I was wondering if it were possible to break his rule and read the book while not  smoking as he suggests you continue smoking whilst reading his book. Also I've reached my one year anniversary of starting with <10 a day and and wondering if withdrawal should be that bad. I've stopped for a week before and had no desire to smoke again but curiosity to become a "casual smoker" led me to a relapse. I then smoked for another month and have tried to quit at the beginning of November and have only had a slip but not a relapse.

TL;DR; Can I read Allen Carr's book without smoking

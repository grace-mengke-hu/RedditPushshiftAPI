Day 4 and panic feels out of control

I apologize in advance if there happens to be a long wall of text. I just need to get this all out.

I'm terrified. Absolutely terrified. Every small ache or pain my brain turns into something awful. When the panic starts, along with the physical symptoms, that was the time that I used to run for a smoke. Now I run, well, anywhere. I'm afraid to be around anyone. My husband is an amazing support with my mental health issues,but I feel bad for dragging him through this process with me. He is also focusing on his quit, I don't want to give him the added stress.

Thankfully I am seeing my doctor tomorrow. Maybe quitting is going to necessitate a med change. 

Just please tell me this gets easier. The overwhelming panic is almost unbearable.

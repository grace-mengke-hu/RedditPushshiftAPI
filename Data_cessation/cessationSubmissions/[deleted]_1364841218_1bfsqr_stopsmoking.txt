I keep failing!

I feel like I am mentally motivated to quit but every time the urge comes I succumb and just say "ah, fuck it."

I think part of the problem is I can't really establish worthwhile reasons to quit. I know it's gross and it is harmful to my health, but I really enjoy it.

What are some reasons you guys have decided to quit smoking? How do you get past the first few days of strong urges without cracking? 

Any and all advice would be appreciated because I feel so alone and need some sort of support system.

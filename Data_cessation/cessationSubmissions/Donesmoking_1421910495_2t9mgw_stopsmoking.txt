Quit smoking as of today. Im in the military and it is brining me down a whole lot physically.

Made this account to keep track of days and such without it being seen by the people who see my main reddit account. It seems like absolutely everybody in the military smokes so it will be very hard. But hopefully this will help keep me on track. 

Thanks for the mods of this sub for making your badge system easy and thank you to anybody in advance for some words of advice.

Day 1,615, fighting sudden huge urge to buy a pack

It's been so long since I quit smoking (with the help of r/stopsmoking) that I had to calculate how many days it had been in Excel. 

Anyways, the past 14 months have been this incredible series of changes that now I find myself craving cigarettes on an almost hourly basis. 

My wife got pregnant which meant she gained weight, which means I gained weight (daddy weight is a real thing apparently). Now the baby is 5 months old and the combination of the lack of sleep, my wife and I getting on each others nerves, combined with us giving up drinking for lent and starting a new job has me seriously considering buying, at the very least, one of those disposable vape thingies.

It's been four and a half years. I thought this part of the cravings were over! I'm thinking I'm going to have to find a different way of unwinding, magically getting along with my wife, not stressing over a crying baby, and losing weight :)

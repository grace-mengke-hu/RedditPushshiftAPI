Quit alcohol and drugs, now it's time for cigarettes.

For too long I have been using cigarettes as a crutch, as a way to take breaks, as a way to calm down and as a way to wake up. 

But the thing is: cigarettes don't calm me down, cigarettes don't wake me up. All they do for me is pollute my lungs and my mind. 

Enough is enough.

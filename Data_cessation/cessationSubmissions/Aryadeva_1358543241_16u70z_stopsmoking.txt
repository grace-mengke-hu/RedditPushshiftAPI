I started smoking again. What do I do now?

I quit just before Christmas - left school, where there is both stress and other smokers - and spent a few weeks on the farm. First couple of days was hard, but being home was enough of a change from my usual routine that I didn't hurt too badly.

And now, I guess I can vouch for the authenticity of the 'there's no such thing as one' rule. Had a drag from a friend one night, and immediately started fiending again. Now I'm back to where I was, maybe even worse.

I'm feeling pretty terrible, to be honest. Anyone have suggestions for where I go from here?

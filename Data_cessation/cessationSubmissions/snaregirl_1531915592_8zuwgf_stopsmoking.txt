Day 28th, new mission - thank you!

Hey!

I´m actively using Smoke Free app, and it´s been a huge help during my quit, especially the "daily mission" feature. Today´s mission is to message whoever is proudest of your quit and thank for their support; I have done this privately. But there is also an option in the mission to thank your online community for the support they have given you. So let me thank you for being here and supporting each other and keeping me accountable. There is so much knowledge pooled in this sub on the topic of cessation. Wish you a good quit day, and a lot of ease and strength in keeping your quit.

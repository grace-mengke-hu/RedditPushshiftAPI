28 years of my life..I just quit Friday..

I am 36. I have been smoking since I was 8.I had an ashtray in my room and it was not an issue. In fact the only problem was when I would take from my mom. I lose sleep at the idea that I have smoked for 77% of my life and I am not 40. Maybe my entire..my ma never stopped while she was preggo and I guess second hand.. but fuck.. I need to quit. I stopped last Friday and while I feel good..I want one really bad. I am angry at everything. I cannot stop eating. I already had insomnia before I quit but now it is worse. I would always smoke one right before i fell asleep.

    My biggest fear of failure comes from my own idea that everything I did in life growing up involved me smoking. I do not have any memory of me without involving smoking. My brother and I would get a carton of smokes in our stocking for xmas. Me from age 11 him 12. I know my life depends on it. My health depends on it, my money depends on it. But wow this is hard. I feel like a chump for not being able to just stop. I know heroin addicts have it worse. Which is something I do not understand. I smoked meth from age 14-20 and quit cold turkey..but this.. just m,e typing this I want  to run to the store. TBO the only thing stopping me is I spent all my money on bills. Well  I have change  but I am in a nicer neighborhood now and the stigma..I am rambling..if anyone who may know what I am facing can give me tips thank you in advance..I am going to try and sleep.

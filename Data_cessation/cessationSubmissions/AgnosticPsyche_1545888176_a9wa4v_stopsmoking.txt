I've tried so many damn times...

I've gone 4 months two times. 

2 weeks atleast half a dozen times. 

3 days in a row like atleast 20 times. 

Each time I try to get the courage to get just one day it gets harder and harder and harder. I've only been smoking 5.5 years. 

When I go to bed tonight it will be 4 days nicotine free for like the 50th time. 

I want this time to be the last time ever. My bank and my body cant afford it any longer...

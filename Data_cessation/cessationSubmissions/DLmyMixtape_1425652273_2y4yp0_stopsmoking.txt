Hour 36, I'm ready to be free

I've always heard that the first two weeks are the toughest, and at this point I embrace it with open arms. I can't afford (physically) to be a slave to the tobacco industry. I realized after getting into my car (where I smoked heavily for years) how bad it smelled like cigarettes. My ashtray was overflowing, burn marks everywhere. I consider myself a clean person, as well as a professional, and I would be embarrassed anytime someone got into my vehicle. I shouldn't have to murder my lungs because I couldn't handle a stressful day at the office, or because I was bored while I enjoyed a beer. From this point on it's the gym, and sunflower seeds.

Side note: 5 years as a heavy smoker; 36 hours and counting as a free man. 

Sorry for the long post! I had to get this off my chest. Stay strong brothers and sisters.

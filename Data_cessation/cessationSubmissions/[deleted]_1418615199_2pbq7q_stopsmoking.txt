I want to quite, but I don't know where to begin. Any advice?

So I'm a pretty heavy smoker, I go through a pack a day, but mostly its become a routine habit and its hard to change e.g. wake up have a coffee and a cig first thing. I have tried cutting down except for the routine cigs.. but I really don't know how to stop the cravings anyone got any advice from personal experience?? 

Thank you reading this! 

[Edit 1: I "quite" in the header was a typo - it is obviously supposed to say "quit"]

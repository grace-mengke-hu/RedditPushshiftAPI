On day 2... Question about symptoms of withdrawal

So I've tried quitting many times using many different methods. This time I'm confident that it'll be my last effort. I'm kicking this habit once and for all! Today, day 2,  I've been experiencing extreme energy swings. I've dozed off at my desk, standing waiting for an elevator, even in the middle of a meeting. I'm lucky to have strong supporters at work or I'd most likely be fired from my job. Is this a normal symptom of withdrawal? I've never experienced it in my previous attempts.

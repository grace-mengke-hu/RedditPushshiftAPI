Day 27 and still struggling :-/

Still irritable, still angry, still utterly miserable about 90% of the time. Every single day is a struggle from waking up to going to bed. Cravings all the time. I am at the gym every single day but it doesn’t appear to be helping me with my moods. 
All I read is information telling me that everything should be remarkably better after 4 weeks. It’ll be exactly 4 weeks tomorrow and I don’t see it changing overnight.
I’m aware this is all psychological but that isn’t helping me to combat it. 
Is this normal?

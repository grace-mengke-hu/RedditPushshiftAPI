Let's get this over with.

Hi guys. Been a smoker since I was 18, and am 26 now. I quit for a year in-between cold turkey, but unfortunately went back to it in a moment of weakness.

Determined to get rid of them permanently. I've got three left. Tonight is the last night.

Nice to be back here. I'm excited to get my badge back. Godspeed you glorious bastards.

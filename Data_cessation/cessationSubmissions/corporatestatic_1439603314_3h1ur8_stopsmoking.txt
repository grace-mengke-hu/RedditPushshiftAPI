I Was Planning on Quitting... But...

I decided yesterday I was done with cigarettes. I wanted to finish out the work week and the plan was to have my last cig before bed tonight. Tomorrow morning, Saturday, I was done for good. 

My girlfriend of 5 1/2 years, who I live with, decided we need to break up about an hour ago. I don't know if quitting right away is that wise. I know the first three days are the hardest and I don't know what kind of monster I will become going through that and not having a cigarette. Should I give it another week after the initial shock, stress, anxiety, and pain are gone?

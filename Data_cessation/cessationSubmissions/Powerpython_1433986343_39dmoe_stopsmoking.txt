Smoked for 3 years, quitting cold turkey before it's too late, any advice?

Im 18, and began smoking when I was in highschool. I've always had quitting on the back of my mind, but Ive had a hard time putting forth any action. Seeing a friend of mine smoke after he got lung cancer when he was younger made me realize that that might be where Im headed. So in a burst of inspiration I gave the rest of my pack and my cigarette roller to my brother who smokes.

Along with quitting cigs Im focused on quitting weed and masturbation too. It's really the holy trinity of vices; weed, cigarettes, and jerking it. I would smoke probably a pack every two days, along with smoking weed daily. 

So in my burst of motivation, as a way to force it in myself that I wanted to quit, I went on a run to see how my lungs would feel. My lung capacity is definitely not what it used to be, so Im hoping to maintain some sort of disciplined running schedule so I can reclaim what Ive got left. I havent been smoking forever, so I know im not fucked, but Im definitely tired of coughing up phlegm. 

Im open to advice if anyone has something to share, thanks in advance guys!

I am getting cigarette dreams every night (5 days post-quit)

Long story short, this isn't the first time I've quit. I'd have one socially or drinking, and then it would flare back up again, I'd scale it back down again, quit for a while, the cycle would continue. This is the first time I've quit with no intention of ever having one again, though. Decided I don't want to smoke in my 30's, so last one was the day before my 30th birthday. I thought I'm in my 20's, hey it's cool to drink a little, smoke a little, I'm young this is what this time is for. I started to see some of my older friends either quitting or committing (consciously or not) to being a smoker around 30 years old, so I decided I should decide and stick with it. So no more, ever. I'm done.

I am getting cigarette dreams every night. One of the major reasons I quit was because I didn't want cigarettes to rule my life, and it seems even 5 days out they continue to do so. Even when I don't have them, and even when I'm not conscious my brain is telling me do this.

My last 5 nights in a row all had me smoking cigarettes in them at some point, if not revolving around that. Did anyone else experience this?

Why cant I lose this habit?

I am a terrible closet smoker! I have been through the gamete, nicotine patches, gum, vaping, Allen Carr (which was my longest quit) and I just can t lose it . My kids think I quit a year ago and my BF has just started "catching" me . He is a non smoker and really finds it repulsive. Every time I get to the point that I am ready to quit I begin to panic. I feel like it is my little treat , my dirty secret . Its a  part of me that I don't have to share . I am an educated, fit , social woman. I work out 5 days a week and don't even eat meat. Yet I am sneaking into the driveway at midnight to light one up! HELP. I want to lose this horrible crutch

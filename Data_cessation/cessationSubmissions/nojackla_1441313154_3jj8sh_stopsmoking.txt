I had "the dream!"

I've seen other people posting about how they'd have a dream about smoking and wake up in a panic but it finally happened to me. Super weird. 

I'm glad I'd read everybody else's posts about it or I'd be worried that I was backsliding or something but, "no," it's normal and it's a good sign that I'm on the right track. Thank goodness for this forum and keep sharing your stories. You never know who they'll resonate with.

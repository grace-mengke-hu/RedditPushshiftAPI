Today I am free....

Yesterday I finished listening to Allen Carr's Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking and finished reading the original again a few days ago and today I am finally free! I do worry a little about when I get home from work. My husband is still smoking and I cannot get away from there being smokes in the house. I've been on this Day 1 so many times and I am determined for this to be the last time!

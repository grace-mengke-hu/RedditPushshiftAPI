First day, I feel irritated, strong, and I could probably eat everything in the kitchen. When I say I feel strong I mean physically strong, like I could lift a truck. I have a weird feeling in my arms not really pain but kind of an ache. I am staying away from people as much as possible; donâ€™t want to say something I will regret.

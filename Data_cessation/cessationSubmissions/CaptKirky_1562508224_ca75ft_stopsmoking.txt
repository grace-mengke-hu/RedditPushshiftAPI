I need help -Smoking on the job

I keep doing pretty well. Ive slowed down on my drinking with has helped immensely BUT Im finding that I cannot get through a day at work without wanting a smoke.
Its not because my job is stressful, but because I sit on my ass all day (10 hr shifts,) and its nice to go on the roof and take a 5 min break every few hours with a smoke. I really need help with figuring out something else to do with that time and those cravings. 
Any suggestions? Ive tried making tea, (which I make quite frequently anyway, so thats not helping.) And Ive tried 5 min meditations which only result in me thinking about smoking.

Its really annoying to me because I feel like whenever Im doing anything else, I dont even THINK about smoking. Help!

30 Hours Without a Cigarette

I had quit smoking for over 10 years, but then I started dating a smoker. When you're kissing a smoker after quitting, you taste the cigarettes on their mouth, and for me, it triggered. At first, it was just a few a day which quickly escalated to a pack.

Over the past few months, I've been using e-cigs in place of some of my regular cigarettes. Last week, I was down to about 4 a day, this week, I've just had one or two morning cigarettes each day and using my e-cig other times. This morning, I completely skipped my morning smoke, so now I'm at 30 hours without one.

Last time I quit I used patches but they caused weird dreams and the withdrawal was more noticeable. This time, it really hasn't been so bad, and I'm tapering down the level of nicotine in my e-cig juice at the same time. 

I gave away my last pack yesterday and I'm done.

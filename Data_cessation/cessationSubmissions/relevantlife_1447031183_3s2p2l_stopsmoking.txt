I have been smoking a pack a day for 7 1/2 years. My mother (never smoked) has emphysema, my grandmother (never smoked) has COPD. My uncle (smoked for 35 years) has COPD. Tonight I had my last cigarette.

It's going to suck ass, but I am likely going to watch everyone in my family die from lung related diseases. I do not want that fate for myself as well.

7 1/2 years is a long time, but I'm only 27. By the time I'm 40 my risk of cancer will be way down, particularly if I also adjust my diet and quit drinking so much damn beer ! 

Wish me luck. Any words of advice will be very appreciated.

1334 days today and I am resetting my counter..

in a sad moment of stupidity and weakness..  I bought a pack of Marlboro 'lights' soft packet.. had 3 with beer for whatever reasons..my own reasons.. they changed the packet.. doesn't resemble the 'cool' old packet with the logos (Europe).. they taste awful but I kept going..now it is full of pictures of damaged lungs overfilling the packet.. i feel sad..  heart rate monitor on my watch showed 112 bpm while sitting and smoking.. tomorrow is a new day.. i will fight it.. expecting the downvote to nadir but unfortunately the struggle, for some of us, is for life....

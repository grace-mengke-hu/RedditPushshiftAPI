Today is MY year of not smoking!

It's my first 365 days of not smoking. Thank you for your inspiration and your support. This community was the final point to make me quit and it worked. I remember reading stories of how guys stop smoking for a year and they got me inspired. So this is my year and here I am NOT SMOKING! After all this time struggling with cigarettes this a VERY big thing for me. For those who did it - thank you, for those who are on their way - do it ! It is worth it!

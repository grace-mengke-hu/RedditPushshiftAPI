Breathing weird after quitting. Whats going on?

Hi, I am new here. I am experiencing weird breathing. 

A little background: My Job had become a "smoke free work place" and it has been about about 2 months now with little to no cigarettes. I used smoke about half a pack a day. I've been using a vaporizer, patches, and gum generally working my way down. 

In the past few days my breathing is really weird, and I am starting to panic because of it.

 It feels as if it is very slightly harder to inhale, like I am breathing wrong. Does anyone here know what this might be? Its freaking me out a metric shit ton, and I can't sleep in fear that I will just decide to stop breathing.

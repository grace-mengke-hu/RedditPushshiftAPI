Why I've Been Able To Quit...

Hey Everyone! I know this won't apply to a lot of you, but for those living in Ontario, Canada, there's something called the "STOP" program that hooks you up with free nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, inhaler, quick mist). It's in almost all cities and you don't have to go through a doctor, give medical history, or anything invasive like that (though a lot of doctor's offices do provide a "STOP" program counsellor and NRT). The first visit takes about 20 minutes and then once a month I'm in and out in 5. I wish I was a person that could do it without the NRT, but I'm not and had a terrible experience with Zyban, so this is a godsend to me as it's so expensive (yes the cigarettes are expensive, but one of my main reasons for quitting was having no money).

For anyone in Hamilton this is the phone number to the place that I go through the city: 905.540.5466 ext. 1

Like I said, I know this won't apply to a lot of you, but you never know, maybe your community offers one. It's gotten me to day 23!

Good luck to everyone!

Day 2 & The Dangers Of 'Just One' Cigarette

So, I'm back on the wagon after falling for the trap again. I'm going to share my story mostly for catharsis but also I hope it can help someone from making the same mistakes I did.

Back in October 2014, I quit smoking. After 6 months I stupidly had one drag on my friend's cigarette in an inebriated moment. I didn't smoke another one for 2 months and thought I got away with it. For the next year or so, I would end up smoking one cigarette every 2-3 months. Little did I know that I was already on the slippery slope.

Fast forward to September 2016 and the frequency has increased 1-2 times per week. Lo and behold in February this year I broke up with my girlfriend and ended up smoking every day again.

Only looking back now did I realise that the time I lost the quit was the first cigarette after 6 months. From then on I had the illusion in the back of my head that I could control my addiction.

Back on the wagon, and day 2. Here's to no tobacco passing my lips *ever* again.

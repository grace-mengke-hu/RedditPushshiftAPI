Day 51, good things

Hi everyone! I've been off cigarettes for ~7 weeks now (off nicotine gum for ~3 weeks).

Good stuff happening here:

I can smell things and I smell nice, my mouth feels clean and my dentist is just ecstatic about this, my nails are no longer yellow, my hands and feet are warm. I feel much more calm, relaxed and happy. I don't need to worry if I run out of cigarettes or if I'm allowed to smoke somewhere. Obviously I'm saving a lot of my time and money.  One huge thing is that during my smoking "career", my stomach used to be all messed up for 70% of the time which was very frustrating. Those issues have been gone since day 1. That alone will keep me from going back to smoking. 

All the best from someone who smoked a pack a day for 22 years.

One Week Smoke and Nicotine Free- Gave up one addiction for another

Today marks one week since I smoked that last slave-driving cigarette. ðŸ’ª It hasnâ€™t always been easy. In fact, today has been very challenging for some reason. Iâ€™ve had consistent cravings since I woke up. And yet yesterday was a breeze. Thereâ€™s gonna be hard days. And you just need to decide that you wonâ€™t smoke in that moment. Sometimes we just need to take it one moment at a time.

So, 7 weeks ago I began running and weaning off the cigarettes in preparation of this time. When I first started, I could barely achieve a mile without gasping for air and feeling sick and having to stop to walk every couple of minutes. But this morning I ran three miles at an 8:35 minute pace - which Iâ€™m really proud of at nearly forty. And this past Saturday I ran 7 miles just because I could. It was easy to breathe. I didnâ€™t feel sick. I felt strong. I feel strong and amazing. I registered for my first marathon race on October 14th of this year! So, instead of obsessing over quitting smoking, Iâ€™m obsessing over my training. Eating right. Getting stronger.

Iâ€™m 38-years-old and I smoked for 28 years. I know I can do this. And so can you.

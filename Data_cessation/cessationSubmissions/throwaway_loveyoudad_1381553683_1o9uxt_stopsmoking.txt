/r/stopsmoking, I need your help desperately.

(Sorry in advance for the wall of text)

I love my Dad (I am his son). He is a brilliant man, a PhD in engineering, and has made every sacrifice possible to provide for his family and bring us to the US. A little backstory – being of Asian descent, culturally speaking, there are certain things a son would NEVER say to his father. Telling him I think he should quit smoking would be one of those things.

EDIT: I can only imagine the stress he has gone through, and I'm sure that smoking helps take the edge off of the stress.

 My relationship has been somewhat estranged with him, but has improved greatly in the last few years. Still, I have probably hugged him maybe 5 times in all of my “grown” life (not counting times when I was maybe a toddler, child, etc). And again, being of Asian descent… emotion isn’t something he knows how to show to his son, and me to him.

Here’s where I’m reaching out to you. I’m sitting here, crying, because… I want him to quit smoking. I want to help him.I am scared to death for his health, and I want him to be around as long as possible, to spend time with me, to be there for what I hope are his future grandkids.

He has been smoking since he was about 15-16, he’s 45 now. It’s still not too late, right? How can I help him kick this awful habit?

Reddit. I would do anything for him. ANYTHING. I will be lucky if I grow up to be a fraction of the man he is.

Thank you. I'm so lost. I want him to live.

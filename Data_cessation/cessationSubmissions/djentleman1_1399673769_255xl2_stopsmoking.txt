Its day one for me and I'm feeling good :)

Ive been lurking around for awhile but this community seems really solid. You guys are clearly very helpful and i look forward to being a part of this community. Its about 5 pm where i am and i have yet to have a smoke. I had my last one last night around 10pm. Im craving it, but ive been keeping myself occupied. I hope to be able to kick it just like some of the other posters. Wish me luck!

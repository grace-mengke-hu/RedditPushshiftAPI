On to day 5 smoke free, using the patch.

I am a 35 year old, mom of 3, who has smoked pretty much since I was 16. That would be 19 years of smoking. 19 years of smelly clothes, hands, breath..... Lately, it has taken its toll. Going to bed with chest pain, waking up with a sore throat, shortness of breath. I just keep telling myself, I can do this. I quit once for a solid year and made the mistake of going out with friends and thinking I could just have a cigarette or two. Huge mistake!! But as I've read....no time is too late. So here is to another try! I'm hoping this subreddit will help, reading what everyone else is going through too. The only thing I want in life, is to live as long as possible to watch this three beautiful kids of mine, grow into adults! That is my focus now. Cigs will not help me out with that!

Getting though this without cigarettes

Last night after work I got some pretty bad news: my mom's boyfriend passed away of a heart attack. He had been in my sister's and my life for many years,  and had offered us support many times in the past. He even helped me move to a new city,  cat in tow and all. 

Walking home talking to a friend,  I had some serious cravings.  Smoking non stop was my way of dealing with these things. But I remembered my badge in this sub and I refused to have to reset it again. I went out for drinks shortly after and drowned my sorrows just for a night,  like the way he would have wanted. And I did not have another craving all night. 

I just wanna thank this sub for being here and helping me cope. Thanks for reading!

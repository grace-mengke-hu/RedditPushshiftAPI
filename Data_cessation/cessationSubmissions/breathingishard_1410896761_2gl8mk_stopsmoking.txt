I quit smoking 1 month ago - some questions.

Ok, so I know the awesome amazing things that will happen to my body when I quit smoking - like breathing better, heart healing, taste regeneration ect.  But I want to know what are some of the NOT so pleasant side effects to expect.  I am past the physical withdrawal symptoms and mostly just have the mental trigger issues (and even those are slowly fading).  However, I have this terrible tickly feeling in my lungs which I can only assume is my lungs trying to clear 12 years of smoking out of themselves.  I have a few other things happening but just wondering what nasty side effects to expect and how long to expect them.  

Thanks.

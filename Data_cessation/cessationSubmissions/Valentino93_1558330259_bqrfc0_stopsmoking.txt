I'm on day 3 of no smoking

    Okay so I dont want to be that guy but so far it's been relatively easy, almost too easy. I've been smoking a pack a day for the last 5 years and just randomly decided to quit when one day no plans etc just woke up and said I'm done. Thing is I'm worried that it's going to get bad since the first 3 days have been pretty easy. Am I just lucky or is the worst yet to come?

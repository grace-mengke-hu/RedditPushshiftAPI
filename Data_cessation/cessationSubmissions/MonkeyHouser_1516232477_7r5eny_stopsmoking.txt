Reaction to the TV

So I'm on day 69 *giggity* and last night I was catching up on the show Shameless. One of the characters, Lip, was super stressed out. He took out a butt and the moment of lighting/inhalation it was like a  lightning bolt shot through my body. It didn't really make me crave one, it's a really hard feeling to describe but reminded me how powerful of a drug nicotine is and that even though I'm over 2 months in I have a long way to go. Stay strong out there

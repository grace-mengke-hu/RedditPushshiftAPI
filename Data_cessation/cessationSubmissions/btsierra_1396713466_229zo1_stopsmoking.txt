Fifteen months today!

I quit on January 5, 2013, because I both wanted to and because I couldn't smoke because of a minor case of pneumonia.  It's 15 months later and I feel so much better, and have some savings to boot!

To anyone having a hard time.  You can do it.  It can be hard, but the benefits are so worth it.

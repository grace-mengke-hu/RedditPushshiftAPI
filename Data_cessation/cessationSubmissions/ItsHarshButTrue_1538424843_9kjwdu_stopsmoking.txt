I gave up

After 8 days smoke free, no patches, no anything, and a growing rage for the most trivial things in the last three days, I finally gave up. I smoked 2 cigarettes in a few minutes, then threw away pack and lighter, but the clock is back to zero.

The worst thing is that I'm not even that disappointed about it; I just feel that I had to. I know that it's probably bullshit, I just feel that my body couldn't hold it anymore.

More specifically, I just felt a itch in my liver, an inner annoyance about "something not being right" and a rage I could not express if not by screaming and in general being crazy, and I don't want to go around looking nuts. 

Some things not working in life may have contributed (lying to my parents about uni going bad, burden of conscience of sort), but I went through worse and perhaps I'm just trying to justify it.

There was also a side of me saying "Fuck it, I'm just 22 and in perfect health, why should I go through this process now? I've been smoking for just three years. Let me arrive to my 30s at least."

I guess the reason I'm writing this is to understand if someone else went through this or similar, and how should I react to it.

If you think it's probably "too early" for me to quit also say so, I don't know if age plays a part in motivation or other things.

Every word you might want to spend about this, good or bad, is welcome and I thank you in advance.

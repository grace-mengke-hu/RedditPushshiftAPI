I smoked my last cigarette last night.

I am a social smoker for the most part. I only smoke on the weekends, usually one night a week. But depending on how many drinks I’ve had, I sometimes end up smoking a lot more than I had planned on. I’m tired of telling myself that it’s okay that I smoke because it’s only on the weekends.. I don’t want to do it anymore. This is my commitment to myself to stop. Any tips on avoiding social smoking?

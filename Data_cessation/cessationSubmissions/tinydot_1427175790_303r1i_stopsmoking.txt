Rambles and questions.

I recently quit. And I mean quit quit. I saw a post in the sub that just go to me, and I honestly don't think I'll slide off the wagon for a very long time, if at all.

My cravings are manageable, though I can feel the junkie trying to get a smoke. (Hey, you made it a few days, just have one).  I need to type this all out, to solidify it in my brain. I quit, and no I can't have a victory smoke because it defeats the whole purpose.

How do you handle transitioning your smoke break to just a break? What about your friends at the smoking area?  15 and 30 minutes are so long without a smoke.  I don't know what to do to fill the time. Today, I just walked around my building and then picked an empty room and sat there for a bit. I felt like a weirdo. At least I'm a weirdo that doesn't smoke.

It feels like I've went so much longer than I have without a smoke. I think it's because I think about them so often.



Thanks for reading, guys.

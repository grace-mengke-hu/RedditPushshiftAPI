Recently struggling after a 100th day

Hi everyone, It's been about a 100 days since I last smoke and recently I feel like I get this feeling that I want to smoke. My girlfriends smokes and it often makes me want to smoke. I used to make jokes of having a cigarette when I started quitting and now I feel like I really want one. I don't know why. I've been to a few parties, I've seen friends who smokes, I've went to bars, and yet, it's at home recently that I struggle the most. Why now? My job as been kind of stressful lately too. 

I feel like it's not such an achivement anymore to have stop smoking. I wasn't such a bigger smoker too, about 3 to five smokes a day. I almost feel like stop smoking when you're pretty much casual is harder.

I'm 25, and been casually smoking for about 5 years and less casually for 2.

Any help?

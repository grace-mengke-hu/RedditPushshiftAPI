Just venting

I'm on vacation and went back home. I have a rocky relationship with my mom and gave her attitude (probably underservedly). She yelled back that I should go smoke. She doesn't know I've stopped, didn't tell anyone really. Most of the things she says don't really bother me anymore but that one hit. Just wanted to post here.

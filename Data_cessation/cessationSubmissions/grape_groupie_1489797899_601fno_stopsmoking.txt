Any tips for someone who struggles after the first couple of weeks quitting?

Hey there, new to the sub today. 
I have attempted to quit smoking multiple times and each time I find the first few days ok, then struggle after the first week or 2. 
My last attempt I made two months entirely smoke free and then quickly got back into a rut after a stressful time at work. 
Whilst I'm proud of how much i've cut down in the last year I'm still finding it hard to stomp out the habit completely and any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Had a dream

Last night I had multiple nightmares that I was smoking. All I remember about the dreams is that I was smoking and I enjoyed it. UGHHHHHH. I woke up this morning ready to get dressed and buy a pack, what the hell is the matter with me?! I was feeling so good. Why is it so hard today? No worries, I'm not going to smoke!

Just quit "social smoking" with friends. Are there any health risks from smoking a small amount?

Not sure if this is the right sub reddit, but it's about smoking so I figured I'd ask here. I have an anxiety disorder so I'm overly paranoid about any potential health risks from smoking in the past.

I used to smoke when drinking with friends about once a week and smoked a couple or few cigarettes each time. I know that any smoking is bad for you, but I've probably smoked a max of 200 or 300 cigarettes in my life and a dozen cigars. I'm just wondering if there are any health problems I should be worried about since I haven't smoked that much. I'm 22 if that matters.

Thanks for any help, and sorry if this is a stupid question. I just get extra paranoid about things sometimes.

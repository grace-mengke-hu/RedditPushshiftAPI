One week down, rest of my life left

Seven days have passed. Seven quite long days. Long because I'm basically counting the hours. But it's going surprisingly well. I think I'm empowered by the decision I've made. There is never really any choice. Every time the urge to succumb arises, I tell myself "well, this sucks, but I will just have to wait it out". Using tobacco isn't an alternative. Actually, putting in a snus (I'm not smoking by the way, I use snus) is unthinkable. And for a number of reasons: I have made a comitment to my girlfriend and to my sister. I bought a smartphone I couldn't afford. I eat, drink and do whatever I want as long as I'm quitting. I save a fuckton of money. I treat myself as a god, and do whatever the fuck I want as long as I'm quitting. Quitting is the most important thing in my life right now, and everything else comes second.  
   


So is the tobacco really worth it? No. It isn't. It's a temptation. And instead of succumbing to this particular temptation, I succumb to every other temptation that arises. This is my method. It might help you. Eat chocolate, ditch work, school, the gym. Make your wife blow you every day. Don't give a shit. Just get rid of the damned addiction.  
 



Good luck.

17 days!

I can honestly say I have never been so proud of myself. 

Week 1 - horrific
Week 2 - total emotional wreck
Week 3 - so happy to be here, in shock I’ve made it so far, and while the waves of desperate cravings do still pop up each day, I’m learning to breathe, drink that water and get through it. 

This site helps a lot. So much positivity for everyone’s quit. 

Let’s do this! “Not another puff” 🙂

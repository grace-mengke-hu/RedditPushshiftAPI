Day 25. It's worth it.

I spent tons of time reading these posts before I quit - I didn't think I could go a week, but the stories of the people here really helped a lot. I'm on day 25 today, and I just went on a 3 mile run non-stop without hacking up a lung. It was amazing!


I don't think that I feel magically a new person, but at least I don't feel like a slave to cigarettes. I'm no longer self-conscious that I smell, and I am making steps to becoming more physically active - something that smoking has kept me from doing. The cravings still happen - especially with drinking - but just grit your teeth and let it happen. I even survived Oktoberfest in Munich with no cigarettes! Thanks everyone.

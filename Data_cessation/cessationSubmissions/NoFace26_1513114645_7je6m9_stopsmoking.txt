I can't believe I passed 100 days without even noticing

I just came back to this sub and realised that I've not smoked for over 100 days. My cravings now are limited to a few circumstances through the day, mainly while coming home after a long day at work, but they are so easy to ride out and ignore now compared to what it used to be like. The main thing I'd say to any newbies is just how quickly it gets easier. 

When I think about what changed since I stopped smoking, I think the main things are:

- lower anxiety
- much better breathing
- feeling genuinely clean more
- better teeth
- food tastes way, way better
- more enjoyment in life generally

In some ways, I'd love a cigarette right now. It would give me that rush. That instant gratification. But now, the cost genuinely feels as though it outweighs all that. In my heart as well as my mind.

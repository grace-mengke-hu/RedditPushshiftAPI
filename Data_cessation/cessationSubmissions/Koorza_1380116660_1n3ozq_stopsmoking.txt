Found a cig in my jacket. I am so tempted right now to light it up.

Hey, 

I am at home alone on my 2nd day. Honestly it was already really hard up to this point. And now I found this leftover cig. I just wanna light it up. Can you guys just tell me something so I throw it away.. I've read allen carrs book, read all the top posts here. And I'm still struggling. I guess I need some personal encouragement.

Thanks in advance!

Who else is joining the class of 2016?

I know lots of people made it their new years resolution to quit. I am one of those people! I made it 4 months before and I know I can do it again but permanently this time! If you are in the same boat let's do this together!!!! Let's follow through with the best decision of our lives and not smoke together! Happy New Year!

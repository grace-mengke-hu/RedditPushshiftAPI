Boredom smoking

I'm assuming this is very common, being so bored the only thing you can do is smoke. When ever I try to quit I don't like making a big scene out of it. I will cut down and break all my habits (the points in the day when I usually smoke). But I will keep a pack of tobacco and everything with me just incase something happens as I'm a stressful person and work as a doorman in a busy nightclub usually I'm told to look after the smoking area or on the front door. It's very easy for me to smoke at work especially on quiet nights (busy nights I can have 1 every 30 minutes if i choose. 


Just a bit more info, last time i quit i got to the point where i felt i didn't need 1 but everyone was smoking and i was so bored and now i'm back to square 1, my girlfriend only smokes on nights out or when she's with me. I really don't want her to start smoking she's a smart girl but i've noticed her smoking more and more and some times asking me for 1 rather than just smoking with me. 

Any advice on quitting? 
Any advice on not boredom smoking?
And finally how long until you feel amazing?

Almost 6 months in, weird (but weak) cravings.

They aren't bad, just annoying.  I'm in a hotel right now, and tomorrow is gong to be my first solo distance hike of the season. I'm thinking more about smoking tonight than I have in months.  

As weird as it sounds, I used to LOVE smoking at camp at the end of a long hike.  Probably my favorite cigarettes because I felt that I really EARNED them (whatever that means).   It's going to be good to get through the next couple of nights without smoking.  Its really weird that I keep finding new triggers as I go through the seasons?  

In the end, I'm just glad that I get a chance to get into the woods for a few days, and I bet the miles won't be as rough since I quit.

Not craving but... getting bored?

Hi all, I'm making a new attempt at quitting, starting today. But ever since I arrived in school, I have been dying of boredom. I don't have a lot of friends so smoking in the break time has always been something I looked forward to. Almost like a "prize" for listening to the professor for 40 minutes (sounds miserable, I know).

I don't even think of smoking when I'm at home playing World of Warcraft, but as soon as I get involved in real life, I feel like I have to smoke. I also fee like I'm edgier and more angrier today, the chair I always sit on and the same haircut I've always had has been bothering me a lot.

Any tips to overcome this?

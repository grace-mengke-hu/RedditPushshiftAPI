Mad love to Allen Carr

I began quitting with a nicorette quickmist spray.  Then I watched an Allen Carr DVD presented by Robin Hayley.  I smoked for 8 years and quit after one hour of watching.  I have found it very easy, im a happy albeit slightly obnoxious non-smoker.

Just to clarify, I binned the spray after watching.  You haven't quit if you use nicotine substitutions, you are only prolonging the addiction.

How twisted can the thoughts of an addict get!!

There was a campaign in my neighborhood for HIV prevention where you could get tested for free and get your results in 20 minutes, so I thought why not.
As I waited for the results at the park with my dog and longingly looked at someone smoking, I *actually* thought to myself, for a millisecond, "if it turned out I had hiv, at least that would justify a cigarette".
As if part of me was hoping it. How sick is that?? At least I shocked myself enough to realize how perverse addiction is.

Why cant I?! Also a bonus odd question

Seriously everytime I say im going to quit I make an excuse. Oh the work week is going to be hard ect. 

How do I get out of this mindset. It’s miserable. I spend $20.24 a day on cigarettes and even thats not enough motivation. 

Ps: odd question, but I notice I pee a ton. Could it be from smoking, like it irritates my bladder? I don’t really consume any extra water, its just a constant need to piss and most of the time its not much.

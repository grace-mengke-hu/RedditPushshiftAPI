I need your help

So I relapsed yesterday, after being smoke free for 2 weeks. Since than the cigarettes are disgusting for me. Nevertheless my body is craving for it. I smoked 2 cigarettes today they were also disgusting and gave me a headache. So what should I do now ? I feel so bad that I relapsed and actually I donâ€™t want to smoke further. Can some of you give me some tips what I should do now ? Just quit again or smoke a bit more to get more disgusted ? I am really confused and in an emotional low.

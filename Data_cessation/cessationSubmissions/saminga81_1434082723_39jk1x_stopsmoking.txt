Day 2 begins...

I've had my first day of quitting go by.  Every time I see a cigarette, I remind myself that it and his 19 friends have done nothing but suck my wallet dry, made me stinky, and screwed with my blood sugar.  So when I see one, I flip it off, get angry at it, and yell "FUCK YOU!!!"  Strangers smoking think I'm out of my head until I tell them "not you bro, the cigarette.  I just quit"  I can do this.  I WILL do this.  FUCK YOU CIGARETTES!!! FUCK YOU AND ALL YOUR BOXED IN FRIENDS!!!

So when are these stupid headaches gonna stop? (day 10)

I'm like 10-11 days into quitting (which I've done before), and I keep getting these rolling migranes that make me a real shit to be around. If I'm home I can usually just put on some music, close my eyes, and kill the lights and wait it out, but it sucks when I'm at work and I have a headache I can't shake. I've tried advil and shit but the unpredictable and short-term nature of these really blows. How many more weeks of these can I expect?

Support Groups?

I recently had a health Event related to smoking. Cut down from 30 per day to about 6. Not really a problem amazingly. BUT, I see as they pain subsides I feel like I will back to the same situation. 

Anyone used support groups and if so how did you find them in your area? If not, then what?

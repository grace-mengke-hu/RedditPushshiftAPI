Four weeks, Â£167.74 saved and 438 ciggies NOT smoked later...

And I'm feeling gooood! *-cue song-*

Look at my [baby](http://i.imgur.com/7hj8JfU.jpg)! Look at it!!!!  No longer am I causing myself damage and pain with those little white sticks, instead I can torture myself with this contraption! Haha! Seriously though it's freaking amazing and I love it already although I can barely last ANY time (dear gawd I'm unfit!) but that will change just need to give myself time.

I honestly cannot remember a time in my life where I ever felt this good. I'm facing up to the two banes of my life: smoking and my weight. It was a catch 22 situation before I wanted to stop smoking but used it as a kinda comfort blanket from the fact I was unhappy with my weight and I couldn't lose weight too easily due to the fact smoking was seriously buggering up my body (especially my lungs which used to hurt so freaking badly).

But now I'm doing both! A whole 29 days without a smoke and I feel freaking *fabulous* and now I've got my new toy to concentrate on I'm happy as Larry! :D

I just wish I wasn't stuck in work so I could go home and have another shot of it! :P

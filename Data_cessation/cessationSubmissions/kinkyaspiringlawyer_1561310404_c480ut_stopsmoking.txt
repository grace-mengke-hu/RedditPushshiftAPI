Stopped smoking for 3 months...best decision ever until I had a panic attack

Hi, I've been a silent lurker here for a few months. Made my decision to stop about 3 months ago and I never felt better. I had a massive panic attack last Sunday and I could not calm myself down. Impulsively, I bought a pack and smoked about 3-4 at one go. It made me feel terrible, both mentally and physically. It did help me to calm down for a bit but my body just wasn't feeling amazing after that. 

I texted my friend and said I don't intend to continue and that I'll give her that pack when I see her. Yesterday, I was in my room...felt bored so I just had one. Again, today, I had one. I don't feel hooked on it but it just felt too easy to reach. Too bored to resist. It's my fault, I take full responsibility for letting myself slip. 

Mentally, now, I don't feel great because I feel extremely guilty and I feel like I lost the war again. I was doing so well and I was so proud. Now I just feel like smacking myself in the head. 

I'm not sure what I'm asking for here. I guess I'm asking for advice and support to move past this.

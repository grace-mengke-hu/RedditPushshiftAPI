My friends surprised the hell out of me!

So my friends surprised the hell out of me yesterday. We had a party and I didn't know what it was for. When i went there, turns out they did the party to celebrate my 1 month of quitting smoking. One of my friends baked my favorite black forest cake. Wow, that made me feel really good and gave me a whole lot more motivation to keep going! People are awesome! :)

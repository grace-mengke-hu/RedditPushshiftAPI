I like things better now

I enjoy things more now and overall i have less anxiety. The triggers for smoking are like fun challenges which allow me to replace a smoke with something else i enjoy. This could be coffee, a donut, doing some activity, a glasses of water or even just the mindfullnessness in the passing of the moment.

On the long term i will feel overall better and don't have to stop enjoying the things i do. There will always be lesser moments in life to face, and reality is better deelt with while not intoxicated. This also allows for a better experience of anything i do with my pastime or recreation. I appreciate life more now that i do not smoke.

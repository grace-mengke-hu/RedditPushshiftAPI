I still smoke

I stopped 3 times like 3 months and came back each time for the pleasure it gave me. Like a sensation of liberty, feeling grow up or old, like some emotion passing, accepting my condition, i don't really know. 

Do you folks understand that? did someone worked on that?

Basically it's why I smoke. When i stop I really enjoy when i come back to smoking, it schedule my life, I have the feeling of doing something (when I smoke), it give me more credit and I enjoy doing more things while smoking or making a cigaret pause than if I don't smoke.

It's like, a support in my life.

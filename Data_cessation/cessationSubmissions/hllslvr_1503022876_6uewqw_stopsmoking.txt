I need a good reason to stop smoking-do erections improve?

I'm 30 and been smoking for 13years or so, around a pack a day. Also overweight and in bad shape. I've noticed my erections aren't firm when i manage to get them, and have lost morning and spontaneous erections. Penis feels dead most of the time. Also, calves hurt when i start walking for more than 10mins. Very probable it's a blood circulation issue.
What i want to ask is, people with similar issues (ed) did you see improvements in your erections after quitting smoking. How long did it take you if so? I think knowing that i can get my erections back once i quit is what will help me kick the habit.

I stopped today after I had postponed it so often

When I was 16 years old I always said to myself that I need to stop with 20. I'm now 21 years old and then I started saying "you'll stop after you get your general qualification for university entrance" witch would be in May, but it isn't as hard as I imagined. I mean I thought this final year will be really difficult, it's not, not yet.

Of course it will become hard in November, December and at the finals but I got enough time until then and after I didn't smoke this whole day it's 19:27 PM here UTC+1 I feel a lot better already.

Anyway, I'm having the cravings only when it comes to a situation where I normally would have smoked or when someone is smoking near me. I always try to focus during these moments and try to imagine all the negative effects of smoking. I also read a good quote on reddit about the subject which I often repeat "You only smoke to feel again the same way like you felt before you smoked" I think a little bit of this sentence is lost in translation since I've read it in English here, remembered it in German and now translated it back. I would be glad if someone who saw this sentence too could post the original in the comments.

I will try this experiment  for the rest of today along with the banana theory i posted not to long ago.told me to smoke my last cigarette and keep the butt in a small portable tin, or what have you, and carry the last butt with you where ever you go. Smoking is not so much the nicotine that your addicted too, but the hand mouth coordination that comes with it. Not only does the butt symbolize our last smoke but use is for the hand mouth coordination. Not only this, but it smells, and tastes horrible. Your mind will then start to believe that that is what smoking smells and tastes like. I will try this experiment  for the rest of today along with the banana theory i posted not to long ago.

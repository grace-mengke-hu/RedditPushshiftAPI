Day 6. So close to smoking today although my willpower is extremely strong according to my friend

So I've had the day from hell today and really want a cigarette although its not a typical crave, like it is craving but isn't a normal crave. It was more of a bad day? have a smoke to relieve yourself followed by me just not reacting at all to it. Anyway I was on my break today at work with my friend who was smoking and the dialogue went a little like this.



                        
 

 





 
 

Me- "I really want a cigarette"

Her- 'Here, have one'

Me- "Nah, I quit"

Her- "So, you look like you really want one"

Me- "Yeah but I don't really want to"

Her- "How is it that easy? You can't just say you don't want one and be fine"

Me- "I don't know, if you want to quit then just don't smoke, it's simple"

Her- "Fuck you" (as a joke, and then conversation went on as per normal)

 
 

I don't know tbh, I really do want one but the one of the main reasons I quit is because I want to be able to go out to a club and not want to crave cigarettes and just be in there and have fun. It's really starting to get to me now cause it's my 2nd shitty day in a row. A few more and I'll either go completely insane or just smoke one which means I will get addicted again, I need some advice, any advice. I need to know how long until the cravings and feeling depressed and like shit all the time will go away. I have been smoking since I was 15 and 15-25 a day since 16 and a half which is all I spent my money on from working. I am now 18 and a half so 2 years I've been smoking full on so hopefully this shouldn't go on for too long right!?!?!?!?

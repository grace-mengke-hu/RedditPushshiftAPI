Can I still smoke weed when I'm trying to quit smoking cigarettes? (All my joints are mixed with tobaco straight from a cig)

So I can't smoke a joint without mixing it with a cigarette. If I leave the cig tobaco out when rolling, it's too little weed to be able to roll it, and if I put more, I'd feel sick. Idk if I don't tolerate weed much, or my weed is just too strong, but this is normal in my town. Almost everyone mixes it. I live in Switzerland, btw. We have good shit here.

Anyways, If I quit, and smoke a joint, will my body start craving nicotine back? I want to quit smoking, but not weed.

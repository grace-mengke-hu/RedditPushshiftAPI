Hi all, 48 hours CT then relapse

The title pretty much says it all. I wasn't planning on quitting, I got sick and just didn't smoke for 48 hours. Those 48 hours weren't even really that difficult. Of course I couldn't breathe and was coughing non-stop. 

On my way home from work I blew it. I was arguing with myself and my rational side lost. I bought cigarettes and smoked one. Now I feel terrible. I'm going to throw these cigarettes out brush my teeth and start again. 

How far back have I set myself?

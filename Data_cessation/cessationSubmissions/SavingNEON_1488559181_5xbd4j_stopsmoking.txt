Day: 1

Saw a post that inspired me to try to quit again. Honestly, I enjoy smoking, but i know how It is effecting me negatively. 

So I want to make choices to better my life. Here are some of those choices.
1)quit soda

2)quit smoking

3)quit fapping

4)quit staying up till I crash from exhaustion.

What I replaced it with

1) water

2)Honey sticks

3)Guitar/cold showers

4)sleep earlier and feel rested when I get up. (Roomate helps with accountability)

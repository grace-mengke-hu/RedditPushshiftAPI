My story

 Hi there!(mobile post so crappy) I told myself I would quit before our forth child,(due on Jan 22nd) and I did! Nov 20 was my last day and I feel great. I took champix for a month and read that stop smoking book. What a great feeling! I have a fairly stressful job(driving heavy loads off-road, ice roads etc.) and I have to say not smoking makes it more enjoyable. My only advice is take your vitamin D, lots of it. It doesn't have to be hard, just keep telling yourself it is a DRUG addiction and the cravings are your body thanking you for not smoking. Or something. I'm not out of the woods yet, but I think the worst is over. Thanks for reading!

Things are getting weird.

3 days with no cigarettes.  I am having really crazy nightmares, yesterday I dreamt the entire back catalogue of Eddie Murphys movies were non fiction. They really happened.  Last night I dreamt I had to shoot a puppy in the head with a rifle, it was horrible. Is this normal?

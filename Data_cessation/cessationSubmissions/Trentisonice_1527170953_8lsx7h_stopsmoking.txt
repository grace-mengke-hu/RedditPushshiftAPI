Been 3 days since I stopped being a salve to nicotine

What makes it hard is that I have no support around me. I was a closet nicotine addict, I started with dip and then used cigs in college. I decided to buy a Juul towards the end of of the semester so that when I went home I could conceal my habit better from my parents. 

I had about a pack a day habit, and I have called it quits 3 days ago. I feel in pain, I have been getting  angry at my mom for no reason and I get agitated easily. I feel as though I'm going about this alone and it is making it so hard for me. Nobody understands that I am having trouble sleeping, have a weird feeling in my head, and crave nicotine soooo much.

I know it's the devil, but life with the devil in it seems like it was better then this :(

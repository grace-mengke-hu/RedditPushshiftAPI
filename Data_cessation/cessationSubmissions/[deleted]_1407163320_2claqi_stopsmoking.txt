I can't believe I said I would quit Today ...

I Said I would quit today and I did!!

I watched the video ... (I can't believe how great that video is)

I requested a badge ... 

I will likely be on /r/stopsmoking all day checking in, reading and trying to keep my little mind busy. 

The only thing I have to do today is be a non-smoker . 

~Feeling~ .. Nervous, excited, hopeful, worried.

Thank you .. So much

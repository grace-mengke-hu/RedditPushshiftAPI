1000 DAYS!

Unbelievable.  A few years ago I never would have thought it was possible.  I smoked for 17 years!  I remember getting through the first couple of months by telling myself that if I lived to be 80, I'd start smoking again because it's all downhill from there anyway.  Now, I look back at that and chuckle - it was because I felt like I was losing my closest friend at the time, but now I don't think I'd smoke even if I lived to 100!

I've posted before, and I'll probably post again in the future... But i just wanted to say to all the people who are just recently quitting or thinking about quitting - If I can do it, you certainly can!  Just stop smoking, and don't start again, no matter what else happens!

And one more piece of advice:  If you still feel crappy after 2 or 3 months after quitting, go see your doctor!  Sometimes there are medical conditions that the smoking is masking that you don't notice until you quit.  I had a few... But I'm better now!

Good luck everyone!  You can do it!

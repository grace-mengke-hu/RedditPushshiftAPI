Wanna smoke again

Honestly, I’m so completely over the weight gain. Very superficial and a stupid reason to smoke. But it’s been a thought in my head for a week now. I smoked for 10 years, have been fit and athletic the whole time. Now my metabolism is crashing and my biggest smoking trigger is being hungry, so I’m eating a lot. Obv I’d like to quit and not be hungry. 

Am I alone in this particular struggle?

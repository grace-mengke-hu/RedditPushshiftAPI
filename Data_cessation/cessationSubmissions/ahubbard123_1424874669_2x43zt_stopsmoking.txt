Bad dreams about my teeth

I'm almost at the three week mark. No nicotine replacement therapy. Cold turkey all the way. I keep having dreams about my teeth being chipped, cracked, corroding, falling out etc. They are very vivid and scary. Did anyone else have these kind of nightmares? Do you think they have anything to do with quitting smoking? I don't really feel all that stressed out. 

Anyone have nightmares in general after quitting smoking?

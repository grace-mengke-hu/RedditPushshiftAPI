Trying the patch. Again.

At this point I'll do fucking anything if it means I can stop smoking cigarettes. I'm so tired of waking up and immediately smoking while hawking up loogies. Tired of spending 6% of my income on cigarettes. Tired of having to worry about the smell. Tired of endlessly scheming over cutdown plans. Tired of "trying" to quit and failing within a day. Tired of being short of breath. Tired of overflowing ashtrays fucking catching fire on my front porch. Tired of wondering when my continued smoking will affect the trajectory of my HIV infection. Tired of all of it.

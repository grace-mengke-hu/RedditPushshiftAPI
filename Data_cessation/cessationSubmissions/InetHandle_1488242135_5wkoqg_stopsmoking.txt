Hi, New to sub. On day 4 (with vape/patches/etc)

Honestly I am not sure it even counts as I am convinced I have tripled my nicotine intake via replacements.

Nearly attacked GF this evening in spite of that.

How on earth is this okay? I can't concentrate on anything. 

Going cold turkey as of tomorrow morning when I wake up. Will I then have a timer till this gets easier? Because the replacements are starting to feel like self inflicted torture.

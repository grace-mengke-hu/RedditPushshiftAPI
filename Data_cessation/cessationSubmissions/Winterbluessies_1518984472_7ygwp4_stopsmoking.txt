Done with vaping

Anyhow, I am one of the select few that didn't really smoke cigs before I started vaping. I smoked a hell of a lot of weed and used the e-cigs to cope when I was out.

Anyways that turned into mods, sub-ohm ect and before I knew it, I was doing it everyday. I was going in reverse, and raising my nicotine to the level of 36mg.

Anyhow after 4+ years of use I am going to stop now. Looking back at how many different boxes, batteries, tanks, and juice I went through is sickening. I would get the vape-plus from the gas station at times, but I was switching between 0, 3 and 6mg nicotine.

Depending on how stressed and all that I was, I would switch between those three. I was at 0 for the last week or so, but the habit of the action is still there. Kind of broke and not much money to spend on more coils I said last night was it.

I was trying to put a old coil back into my tank last night and it was too tight. I ended up breaking the glass in the tank and I said fuck it, now is the time.

Anyhow, good luck to anyone else trying to stop. I am hoping I went down low enough that the nicotine withdrawals will be next to nothing.

Haven't had one cigarette since April 7th, 2014.

Never have cravings, it is the farthest thing from my mind by this point. But honestly, every time I watch a movie with characters smoking casually in that badass, epic kind of nonchalant way, I remember VIVIDLY how much I enjoyed smoking when I was in the thick of it. So vividly that I start to miss the ritual in a general way, not physically, but mentally. I fantasize about smoking as an older man (I'm 24) and think if I just make it to 50, what's the difference? When the movie ends I forget those feelings and go on living my cigarette-free lifestyle. I have no trouble not smoking now, there is no chance that I would pick one up again, and I've been offered many in the past ~2 years, so peer pressure is no concern, but like I said, sometimes I miss the ritual. Have any of you ever had thoughts like these? Even so late after your last smoke?

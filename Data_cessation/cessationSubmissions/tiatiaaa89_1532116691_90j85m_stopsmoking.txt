Incentive System

Hey all, 

I just wanted to share with you a few of the things I'm doing to remind myself in a reward based aspect to affirm my journey to stop smoking. A lot of us use the Quit Smoking app or some other form of one, and it shows us how much money we save/spend a week. So in my state about $65.00 a week is what it cost me to feed my habit of about a pack a day. A friend of mine recommended to me to take that money out and put it in a jar each week and I could visually see what I am saving. Not saving for anything in particular, but I guess anyone could put a goal towards it. 

I've been having a particularly rough 11th day. I don't know why, everything just feels odd. I either want to smoke or eat, and that's a frustrating battle. I just got back from the bank to get my $65.00 and I can hardly wait to go home and put it in the jar. Something about that, makes me feel really good. And I am no longer wanting to smoke like I wanted to this morning. 

My supportive non smoking boyfriend is setting little challenges up for me too- if I make it to day X I get a little gift, or pick a special dinner. Just something to set my target on in the short term, to build into a long term. 

  
I don't need this to keep going, my money and health/long life is of course important to me. But this really helps me set my sights on the future, and when I get to that day I do it again. The mind is a crazy thing, don't know if others are doing anything like this, but I thought if you are anything like me it might help.

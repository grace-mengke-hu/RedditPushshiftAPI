Need help being a supporter

I'm really sorry if this has been discussed before but none of my searches showed anything. 

My boyfriend just quit smoking about a week ago. He's been vaping to help the cravings. I was really excited about him quitting for many many reasons but especially because he would quit leaving me alone on the couch or at the bar to go outside. Yet, he still goes outside to vape bc it's something he really enjoys. That took me a quick second to not be upset about but I decided I must choose my battles.

Now, what I need advice about is how should I react when he caves? There have been a couple times he's caved and bummed a cigarette. Is it better to be supportive and encouraging by saying he's been doing such a good job and everyone makes mistakes? Or is tough love better? I really don't want to push it because he really REALLY didn't want to quit but he knows it's a good thing to do. 

Please help!

By the way, I was a smoker and I was able to quit cold turkey so I do know what it's like to have cravings and to cave but I wasn't nearly as heavy a smoker as him.

Today is my day 2!

Got through day 1 pretty easily, surprisingly! I have patches which helps. I had cut down to 5 or less for a few days before yesterday but I went cold turkey yesterday. It probably helps that I'm sick and I don't even feel like smoking anyway. Just gotta keep positive and keep those dirty thoughts out of my mind!

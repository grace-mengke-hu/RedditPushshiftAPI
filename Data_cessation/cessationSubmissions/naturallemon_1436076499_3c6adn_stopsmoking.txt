STILL COMMITTED!

I told you all I'd be back on Saturday to tell you I still hadn't had a cigarette.

I'm a little late because I've been out drinking with my friends, which is the biggest trigger for me. 

And I'm proud to tell you I'm still going strong.

If I can say no, anyone can say no (because I'm really the weakest little shit ever). And now I'm even more convinced that we can all get through this. 

Sending so much love and appreciation to everyone here. Keep fighting the good fight, my dears. I'm with you.

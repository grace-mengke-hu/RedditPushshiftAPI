Started smoking again after 5 years since quitting

I started about two months ago (stupid I know) 
I've felt the effects immediately 
Difficult to breath at times trying to catch my breath but I've gotten a cold twice now since starting.
Before that I haven't had a cold in over a year! 
Pouch is almost finished and then the ciggies 
HAVE to go!!!

Day 12, high blood pressure

As part of a huge attempted overhaul of my health, I am now 12 days off cigarettes (as well as alcohol, caffeine, sugar, grain, dairy).  Overall I feel way way better, but I'm worried about my blood pressure which has actually risen since becoming healthier.

My BP ran slightly high before (I believe my last dr appointment, about a month ago, was around 130/85), but now I've been going to the grocery store daily and getting readings all the way up to 149/105!  To clarify, that reading was the highest, and normally I'm looking at something like 140/90, which is still high for my age/weight (32 years old, ~150 pounds).  Been to several different stores to verify and all of them have me running high, Giant Eagle for some reason much more than others.

Anyway, I tried some Google and found conflicting information and scattered anecdotal evidence about quitting cigarettes temporarily raising blood pressure.  Was wondering if anyone here experienced this or knew anything about it.  Searching the sub had mostly results of people posting their BP went down.  Perhaps quitting all of the other things cold turkey as well has thrown my body off, I dont know.

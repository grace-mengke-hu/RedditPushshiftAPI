When does the wretched coughing stop?

I’m 28 days in. Quit because I had caught bronchitis so badly that it caused a muscle spasm in my rib cage. It took that excruciating pain to realize this wasn’t worth it. 


Despite quitting, I still have a severe cough. Even when I did smoke, I never had a persistent cough. But it’s been two months since i caught bronchitis, and I cough every five minutes or less without cough meds or anti-inflammatories. I cough myself to sleep. I cough myself awake. Both sides of my rib cage are swollen. Everyday is a constant and sharp pain in my sides. I’ve been to the doctor multiple times. All I get is cough meds and pain meds. The doctors said it’s nothing that serious (not cancer, no lung issues other than the asthma i already had since childhood) and I’m grateful for that at least. 

But i am so depressed and miserable. Why did I even start smoking in the first place? Why did I think I was invincible and immortal? Fuck cigarettes, fuck the manipulation they played on my body.  For anyone, anyone at all who can relate, when does the coughing stop? I’m dying for relief.

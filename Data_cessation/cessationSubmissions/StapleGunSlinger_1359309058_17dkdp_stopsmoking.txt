I had a breakthrough last night! DAY 4!!

This is my second post on here, and I have to say that this one is way more exciting than the first one! I had planned a trip to a beer festival with my friends for months before deciding to quit. Yesterday was the day, and to say the least I was terrified. I kept on thinking that with all of that alcohol I wouldn't have a chance of saying no to a smoke or caving into a craving! Well guess what?!?

I made it! I didn't even think about smoking all night! Its the most amazing feeling of accomplishment! After so many years of being a slave to the poison it felt amazing not have to freeze my ass of in the cold! 

Thank you to everyone that left me some words of encouragement a handful of days ago! They really helped, and I cannot wait to be able to reach another milestone!!

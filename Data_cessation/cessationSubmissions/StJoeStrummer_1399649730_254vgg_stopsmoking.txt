Day 5 - I thought this got easier...

Maybe it's because I live with a smoker who doesn't seem to get it at all (lights up right in front of me in spite of my requests not to), maybe it's because I smoked so many damn cigarettes every day, maybe it's because from pacifiers as a baby to bottles and filters as an adult, I've always found a way to get hooked hard...the last 16 hours have been harder than days 2 and 3. 

I've been doing a lot of things right...I have run 3 miles a few times this week, and it seems my old track/XC legs are still with me even if my lungs are not. I have been staying busy at work and in my free time at home...rarely have my house and car stayed this impeccably clean for as many consecutive days. I like getting my sense of smell back, tasting food, having energy. Still, everything is screaming "SMOKE!" everywhere I go. Hell, even the posts on the side of the highway look like cigarettes today. The word sounds so appealing. 

I'm not going to have a fucking cigarette. I know this. I just wish my body would get used to the idea.

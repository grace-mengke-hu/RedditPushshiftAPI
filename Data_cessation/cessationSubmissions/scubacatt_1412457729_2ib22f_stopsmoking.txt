Quit Yesterday and Am Way Too Tempted

Hello fellow redditors, I smoked for four years and am now attempting to quit. I'm only a day in and was wondering if any of you had advice. Should I pick up a non-nicotine e-cigarette or should I pick up nicotine patches or should I just go cold turkey? I've tried cold turkey twice before and I can't seem to will myself to stop.

Why do long term quitters relapse? How can they avoid it?

Hi Guys. I recently relapse (2 rollies during one drunken night) after 16 days, but I am continuing my quit. To prevent this from happening in the future I would like to ask- why people who quit 1, 2, 6 months still relapse sometimes? How is that possible? What should they do to prevent it? Thanks for help!

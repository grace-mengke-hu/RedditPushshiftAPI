7 Full Days!

The first few days I chewed the gum to help with the cravings, but the last few days *I forgot*.  I don't even know for how many days, but I was excited about my 7 day milestone and it made me realize I can't remember when I stopped using the gum.

I hear that weeks 2-3 are way worse than the first one, though, so I'm bracing myself for that.

And while I haven't had too many especially powerful cravings, I have had other miserable side effects - endless coughing, headaches, insomnia, vivid nightmares, and depression.

The last one is being the hardest to cope with at the moment and I just keep feeling like, "hooray, you won't die early of lung cancer, *but who cares because life has no meaning*."

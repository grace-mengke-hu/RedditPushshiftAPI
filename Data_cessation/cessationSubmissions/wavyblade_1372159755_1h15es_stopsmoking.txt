27 hours of freedom.

going strong, but i find it funny how unthinking and automatic the inclination to smoke strikes from time to time.  I know if i had a pack laying around i would have accidentally/unconsciously smoked one by now.  equally surprising is how mild to non-existent these cravings have been, I would have thought i would be beside myself white knuckling and teeth grinding my way through it, but i haven't.  just simple thoughts like "i don't do that anymore" puts those little pop-up smoking thoughts to bed.  


In full disclosure i have been feeling a generalized nervous energy and did have a little episode of irritability last night, so withdrawal symptoms do seem to be kicking in, but they haven't been extreme or really very intrusive.  


i'm praying one minute, one hour, one day at a time.

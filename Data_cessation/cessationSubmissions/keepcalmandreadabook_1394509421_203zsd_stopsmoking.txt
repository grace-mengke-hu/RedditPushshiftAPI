One week, I made it.

Had 185 days before picking up a cigarette while stoned, who knew that one cigarette would turn into a pack a day for three weeks (answer? All of /r/stopsmoking!)

I quit a few times but couldn't make it past a day or two, but this week I really worked hard at it. I had to avoid certain people at my college by taking the long way around just because I knew they would be smoking cigarettes and offer me one. I also purposely spent all of the extra money I had lying around so that I couldn't go out and buy a pack even if I wanted. The first 5 days were the toughest. I'm still feeling an urge here and there, but they are starting to go away, and keeping my mind busy with exercise, school, and video games has really helped. And a new kitten, which is what I spent all of my money on. She looks completely blinged out. =)

Thanks /r/stopsmoking for existing, seriously. Sucks to be back at just one week clean, but it doesn't suck as much as it does still smoking.

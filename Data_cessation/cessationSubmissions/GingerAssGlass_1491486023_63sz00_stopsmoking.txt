10 days no smoking, looking for advice

Hi all, I smoked my last cigarette 10 days ago (woot!) BUT, all of the awful things that happen when you quit are happening at the same time. Yesterday I had about 5 crying spells, didn't eat anything because of the acid reflux, and the tiredness: I TRY to sleep from 10 PM to 7 AM but get a total of around 3 hours of not so good sleep. I work in a very fast paced, stressful kitchen so all of these things combined are a recipe for disaster. I'm very close to caving not because I need or want a cigarette, but because it's so negatively affecting my everyday life. What do you guys do to stay away from cigarettes and keep functioning normally?

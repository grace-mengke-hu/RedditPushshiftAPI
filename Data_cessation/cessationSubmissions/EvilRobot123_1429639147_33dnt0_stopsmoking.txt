Am I the only one who wants a cigarette whenever I listen to old 90's grunge rock?

Hey guys I'm 20 years old and I've decided to quit smoking because I had a falling out with my group of friends who started me on the stuff and it just doesn't feel the same smoking by myself. I have quit before but those were times when I was proving a point to my parents who have been smokers my entire life. I sort of "relapse" every week when i go to either house. 

I know that I can quit especially since my girlfriend is quitting with me. I was just wondering if Grunge (Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains) gives you those cravings of smoking like me.

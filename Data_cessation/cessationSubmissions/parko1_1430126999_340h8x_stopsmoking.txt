A Century

100 days wow! 
I made it this far the rest of my life should be a piece of cake.
The first few weeks were real hard then it got easier and easier. Now I go for days without even thinking about smoking.
Reading posts on this site and replying to the odd few has helped me immensly.
Thanks all :)

Ideas for rewards. Stuff that's better when a non-smoker.

After a few, ok many, failed attempts I am more determined than ever to stay quit. 

I have made it to day 10 (hurrah) and was thinking it would be good to come up with some rewards. I thought it would be fun to crowdsource some ideas!

Firstly, I thought anything that is majorly better while not smoking i.e. watching a long film in the cinema without needing to smoke, having a really good meal etc. 

But I'd love to hear your suggestions. What worked for you?

Can't stand the smell anymore.

At first I actually found the smell relaxing. For the first year ciggerette smoke just smell good to me. After the first year though I became indifferent to its cent. I didn't seek it out anymore if I was stressed. 

Now. After two years. I can stand the thought being in the same room. Out side with smokers is fine. And if someone wants to light up, I'm not going to panic and stop them. But if I'm stuck inside with a smoker I start to get a headache. The smell is almost repulsive now to me. 

I thought I would never get over how much I loved the smell of ciggerattes. And I'm really happy to learn that I finally have. And that all it took was time.

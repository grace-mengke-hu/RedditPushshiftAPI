How much "damage" have I done?

What's up guys? 

I know I'm waaaayyy down the totem-pole in terms of smoking...but how much damage do you guys think I've done to myself? How much can I reverse? 

I basically smoked for two to two and a half years. I would say I averaged ~3 cigarettes a day. Reason why I say this is I would at most smoke 7 cigarettes a day if I had something "big" going on, like a test or something. There were also many weeks or days when I didn't smoke. I also don't smoke over the summers. I would say I smoked 1/3 menthols, 1/3 unfiltered roll-your-owns, the remaining third just "regular cigarettes". By "regular" I mean something along the line of Marlboro Reds or OG Camels, no "light" stuff. 

I am also in my early 20's. Haven't lit a cigarette since May. I'm planning on keeping it that way...but Distribution Theory tests happen. 

Okay, I lied. I smoked one or two late June and they both tasted awful. I could feel the smoke hurting my lungs. Just felt nasty. Chemicals. I'm planning on keeping it that way...but Distribution Theory tests happen. 

I know this sounds extremely vain, but I was really beginning to get worried about how smoking was affecting my appearance. I also drank quite a bit this past year, so combined that with smoking, lack of sleep, and stress...I looked like I aged at least half a decade. I look "normal" now...but yikes. 

I don't really have "urges" anymore but I'm also not under any particular stress. But at the same time...

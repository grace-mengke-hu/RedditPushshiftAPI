Hello there, Could you help a fellow?

Hi ! 

I've started smoking when I was 19. I'm 24 now, and not a day goes by without me smoking more than a pack.

I'm not desperate, but I see signs that I should definitely stop now  before it's too late.

I've tried patches which were good, and electronic cigarette which was a mess.

Got any ideas to stop? any methods for which I could slowly get to the no smoking part without experiencing too much withdrawal?

Also, I'm currently living in a smoker group. Meaning that alot of my social interactions will take place where I could smoke with friends. How do you handle the social part? what "tricks" do you have to stay with those guys but not smoke with them?

Hey, you, if you read this I'd like to thank you.

Am I the only person who has used negative feedback to successfully quit smoking?

Finally stopped for good 3 years ago by inflicting pain on myself anytime I got a nicotine craving.  As soon as I so much as thought about lighting up a cigarette, I would pinch myself hard and twist.  Not to cause any actual physical harm, but hard enough to make me wince.  My brain got the message fairly quickly that it could expect pain anytime I got a nicotine craving, and the cravings seemed to go away more quickly than in my prior efforts to quit.  It's the only thing that's worked for me long-term.  I'm curious if anyone else has any similar stories or knows of any precedent in the scientific literature.

Good luck quitting, it's worth it!

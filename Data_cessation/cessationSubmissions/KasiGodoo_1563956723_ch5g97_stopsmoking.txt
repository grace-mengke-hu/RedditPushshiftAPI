Withdrawals

I'm on day 8 and I've got to say that the withdrawals are hitting hard. I feel irritable, depressed and just want to be left alone. I'm usually a nice guy but I swear I'd beat someone up if they messed with me rn. When do these intense sensations go away and can I quit weed simultaneously?

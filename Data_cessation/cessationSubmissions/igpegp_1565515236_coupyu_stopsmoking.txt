Successful attempt!

I’ve tried to quit smoking many times in the past, always having some small degree of success (2 weeks?) and then slipping back slowly before becoming a 20-a-day smoker again.

But this time is different.

At the same time as I quit smoking, I took up Mountain Biking, and I’ve never had so much success.  6 months down the line &amp; I’m still nicotine free.

Seeing my fitness level go from really unfit, and overweight, to being able to keep up with my non-smoker friends on the MTB trails has been amazing, and has been a massive help to remind me why I quit smoking.

The other thing I did differently this time, was I initially didn’t tell anyone when I first stopped.  Just like with tests, when you tell people you are having a test, even though everyone is willing you on and wants you to do well, it adds pressure of not failing, pressure that I didn’t really want this time.

I didn’t tell anyone and just enjoyed ‘secretly’ getting healthy, and it was a nice little ego boost when people started noticing that I smelt nicer and my skin looked better.

Thanks for reading my story!

New Year quitters! Check in!!!

Wow, who would have thought. In few weeks, it will be a full year! So much changed! I love not smoking. I wish I would stop smoking earlier, but I did try..many many times. This is by far, the longest I went. I did gain weight, but I do not blame it on quitting smoking. Lots happened in my life since I quit. I got engaged, we bought a house...moving...Honestly, I didn't have time to cook at home and we ended up eating out almost everyday. Both my fiance and I are finally getting back on the right track and started to workout again and eat clean. 

the benefits of not smoking are amazing. Last week, I had my first full teeth cleaning done after they did the initial "post-smoking" cleaning. Before, my gums would have 2-3 depth...now, a full cycle of not smoking..I am proud to say, the improvement is awesome. I have 1s and 2s with couple 3s. 

I hope those who joined me on January 1st, 2016 in quitting this nasty habit are still going strong!

To those who are starting out...keep going! It is sooooooo worth it! The benefits are amazing!

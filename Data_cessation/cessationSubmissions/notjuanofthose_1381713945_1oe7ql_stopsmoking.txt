One week thoughts: The hardest thing I ever did / Easier than I thought [LONG post]

So tonight I will be **one week smoke free** and I thought I should share some of my thoughts. It's been a very tough week but I managed to enjoy something new each day. 

These last few days I've been kind of worried when reading about people relapsing after being smoke free for several months, when you are supposed to have less and weaker cravings. I'm only a week in and I already feel that the hardest part is over and the thought of relapsing way down the road is frightening to say the least. Maybe thinking that "this is easy, I can do this anytime" is what's screwing with guys further down the road.

This post is to celebrate a week = huge accomplishment for me. To tell you the truth I wasn't sure I was gonna last 1 day without cigarettes. At first the cravings were pretty bad (the 2nd and 3rd day were the toughest) but was expecting that and I had my mind in the right place. It helped to read [this book](http://whyquit.com/ffn/) during those times, and sunflower seeds + ice cold water were my savior during the toughest points. 

After the first few days I was ready to face some serious triggers. I knew I was going to go out with friends during the weekend, drinking alcohol and probably smoking weed so I needed to prepare for that. On Wednesday (day 3) I drank a can of beer (0.5 lt) alone at my place. It tasted different than usual (not as good) and I sure missed having several cigarettes with it, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle.

On Thursday I went out with a couple of friends, only one of them a smoker. We went to a bar and my friend who smokes went outside several times. We didn't join him. The funny thing is I had A LOT of cravings before getting to the bar, but once there it wasn't bad at all, *I just didn't want to go out and smoke*. When we left I had to wait for the bus to go home, and there was a girl smoking in the bus stop. At that point, having drank several beers, and waiting for a bus (which was always a trigger, like waiting for anything else) I just couldn't take it much longer. I decided that home wasn't too far away and walked there (another trigger for me although not that strong). My first night out since quitting felt like a huge success, not only did I not smoke but the cravings weren't even close to what I came to expect from the first few days. 

On Friday I stayed home by myself and smoked a little bit of weed just to make sure I could handle it. I got crazy cravings and had to drink lots of water to keep them at bay, so I thought "I won't be smoking more of that for the next couple of weeks".

Yesterday was another landmark. I went to a friends house and three of the guys there smoked. I had to sit there watching them light up and smoke, I had to smell the cigarettes, I had the packs and lighters at hand, etc. It was a bit difficult but again, not as hard as I thought and completely manageable. I did smoke a bit of weed and got a tad drunk, but I didn't cave so it was a big victory again.

**In the end, the whole process was much easier than I thought it would be.** I know I have a long way to go before calling myself an ex-smoker, but it seems that the most difficult part is over. This is also kind of scary now, I don't want my brain to think "man, this is a piece of cake, you can have a couple of cigs and quit again". That's why I always want to remember that the first few days were really crappy, and that *even though it looks easy now, it wasn't so easy to come to the decision or fight the stronger cravings once I quit.*

OK, I just realized this post is a huge wall of text but I needed to get it out there. I will probably post something a bit more concise tomorrow just to help some of the guys who are starting. 

Good night my good people, stay strong

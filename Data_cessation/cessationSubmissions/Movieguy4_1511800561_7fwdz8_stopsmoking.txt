Today is the day I quit smoking.

I have tried this multiple times to no avail, but I am fed up.  
I want to be able to sing without getting shortened breath.  
I want to run again.  
I want to stop having to disguise my scent and breath.  
I want a long life with high quality.  
I want my chest to stop being tight.  
I want to stop having to sneak off to light up.  
I want to have control over my life.  
I want to circumvent all the health issues that smoking will bring upon me.  
I want to save money.  
I want to be healthy.  
I want to be free.  

I love that this community exists and I look forward to giving and receiving encouragement through this new chapter in my life.  You all are amazing.  Much love.

About to jump that hump!

Here I am on the dreaded day 3, coasting through the hours I spend at work.  Since I committed to completing this process, I have bummed exactly once from my coworkers, a couple weeks ago.  So not smoking at work is fairly easy for me.  The struggle begins after I leave here.  Last night was not fun.  I made it though.  Tonight will not be fun either.  I have caught my troll brain almost convincing me a few times that smoking again is acceptable.  Thanks to you fine folks, Allen Carr, and other support, I am better equipped to refute that claim.  The best quote I have taken from thus sub - "Quitting is annoying for a few weeks.  Smoking is annoying forever.". It's my new mantra, through the easy times and especially the difficult ones.

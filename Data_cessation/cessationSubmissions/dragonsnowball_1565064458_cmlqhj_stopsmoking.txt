FUCK YOU NICOTINE (A Poem)

FUCK YOU NICOTINE. You may think you're winning now because I keep relapsing but what you don't know is that every time I do, it doesn't mean I've failed, it just gives me the chance to fuel my strength for the next quit. I add reasons to my list, I think up new ways to distract myself, I knock you down a notch off that pedestal I kept you on for so long. Every time I ingest those disgusting fumes into the body I am learning to respect and care for, it just makes me hate you more and it forces me to get wiser in how I can finally defeat you. And I will defeat you.

13 days smoke free. Proud, but HUNGRY!

I'm proud to say I have been smoke free for 13 days. Was a heavy smoker for 20 years and did the cold turkey vibe. The only thing I'm struggling with is the fact that I could eat and eat and never get full! In fact, no matter how much I eat, I'm starving like 5mins later. Anyone else have this?

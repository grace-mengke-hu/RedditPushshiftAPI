Who has quit smokeless tobacco, and how?

I can't for the life of me. Been doing a tin a day for a little over four years now, and have tried numerous times to quit cold turkey. I've made it 4-5 days here and there, but that's about it. It started as a vice for me as an aerobic athlete in college (heavy drinking during season wasn't really an option) and it became the thing I looked forward to most after a long day of class and a hard practice. It quickly became more frequent, and now I look forward to that lip and a beer after work. The hardest part is not just the physical nicotine addiction, but the fact that I do still enjoy it. That said, I know it needs to stop. Anyone with any tips (I know this sub is primarily focused on smoking) or experience...shoot.

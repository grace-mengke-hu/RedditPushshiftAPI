New here - a couple questions

I've been able to quit a few times, but I always start back up. Right now I'm down to a few a day and don't buy packs anymore (I just bum a few a day from various friends)

My problem is, I can't seem to get past this point. I just want to completely stop. I never really had a problem with the chemical addiction part, I just enjoy smoking even though I know it's bad for me. 

Sorry for the rambling. 

To anyone else who has been at this point: How did you finally stop once you got to the "only a few a day" point?

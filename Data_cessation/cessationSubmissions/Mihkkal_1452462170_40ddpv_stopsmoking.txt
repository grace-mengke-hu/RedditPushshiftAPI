Quit this past Friday post finals, doing pretty well, but it's going to be rough.

So last week I told my parents I'd succumbed to smoking again, and that I wanted help to stop, as my dad had been an avid smoker for 30 years and quit using pills prescribed by the doctor. He told me about the costs, and how he was willing to pay for it, if I really wanted to quit. Well I went home that night feeling like shit because I couldn't get my shit together, I don't want my dad paying for my shit, so post finals this past Friday I quit.. cold turkey.. and I'm sticking to it! Just felt like telling someone :-)

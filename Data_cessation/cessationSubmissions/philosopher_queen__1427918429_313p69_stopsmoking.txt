Day 1... freaking out a little bit

Okay so I'm only on my first day of this quit but I'm having a lot of random confusion. Is this normal? I feel like it is taking me longer to make decisions about totally routine stuff like where I want to eat lunch, or when to do my homework (I'm still in college). It basically just feels likes my body wants to do the muscle memory and go do my usual smoking rituals but my brain is just trying to do the important day to day stuff. It's completely disorienting and I feel like I just end up doing nothing because I keep having to convince myself not to smoke.

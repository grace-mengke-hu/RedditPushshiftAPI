Drinking

I am at 12 days now and most of the time i am feeling fine, but the difficult part of me is drinking. I really like the feeling that alcohol brings, but now after stopping i realize that a lot of the good feeling came from nicotine. So now it just feels like something is missing and what used to be great is now just good. This, combined with a reduced ability to think straight makes it a stuggle for me to drink. How do you deal with this?

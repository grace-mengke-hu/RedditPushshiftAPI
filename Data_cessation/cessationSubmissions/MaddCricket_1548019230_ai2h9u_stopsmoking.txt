Never another puff!!!

I’m over four months in and these past few days have been hell for me. It’s a VERY stressful time at work so I’ve had to relearn how to deal with it, even avoiding everything public lest I find a refry that is too tempting to stop myself from, and to top it off I’ve been having a lot of smoking dreams lately which does not do much good for when I wake up.  Today I dreamt of smoking menthols which was disgusting enough already (never cared for menthols), so I woke up a little nauseous with a craving that’s lasted for the past four hours.  I put a new phone case on my phone, a case I haven’t used since I was a smoker so it still has a scent, and surprisingly my saving grace that has kept me from giving up and going out to buy a pack today has been to just smell my case with deep breaths.  

Regardless of this, I refuse to give in! I will never smoke again and want to just remind everyone who is freshly quit or far in that the cravings still come and they are possible to get through.  Even if it is smelling something like a phone case or a sweater and having a small intimate moment with that old habit, it doesn’t mean we need to immediately go light up.  Never another puff! Quitter for life!!!! Take the minutes as they come and know that every craving you make it through is only making you stronger.

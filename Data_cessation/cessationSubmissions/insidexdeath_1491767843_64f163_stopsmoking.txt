New Years quitters! Where are you at?

How's your smoke-free life so far? Any experiences you may want to share? Did you become physically active (jogging, or the gym)? Any positive traits you felt you didn't have before you quit?

As for me I still get mild cravings from time to time (not on a daily basis tbh), but usually lasts just a minute max, and I'm just over it. I can see this becoming tricky as I always get this "I'm nicotine free now, one cigarette wouldn't get me hooked", but I take deep breaths to get my shit together. I want to become physically active though, but haven't managed that yet. I'm working on it.

New quitters, you may want to take note of this as to what you'll be expecting later on. 

Hope you're all having a good day/afternoon/evening.

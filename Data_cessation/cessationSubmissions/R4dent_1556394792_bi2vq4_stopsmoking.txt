Hopefully my last time

I'm once again attempting to quit. Every time so far has ended in failure and I'm going for it again. Smoking takes such an insidious hold on you that it's so hard to stop. I've had my last smoke, made a list of reasons to remember whenever I feel I'm going to falter and trying it again. Peace brothers!

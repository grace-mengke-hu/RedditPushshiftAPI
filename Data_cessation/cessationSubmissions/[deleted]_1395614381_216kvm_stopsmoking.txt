8 Days ! Today I lived longer

I am feeling better today, much better. I can finally breath longer and deeper. I hated that short breath effect of smoking. I felt like I was dying.. I have an app like many of us giving stats and I smiled when I noticed the one dealing with the hours/days you gain from quitting that shit. You can live longer when you don't smoke, we all know that! It is a very nice perspective. It is also very good to stress that when you do quit, you start living longer instantly. 

Today, I woke up at 6:00am. I mean...wtf ?? It is Sunday! I used to sleep until at least 11:00am on Sundays and I would have that terrible lasting headache and tight chest. It's 11:30pm now and I feel great, really great! Tomorrow, it is a working day and I am absolutely relaxed with that, no more stress. I feel the energy deep within. I walked out with my dog for three hours today (2 hours this morning, 1 hour this afternoon) and I never was tired or short breathed, I can feel that I am on a healthier way.

You can do that. I started to have cravings yesterday and I ignored them rather easily by concentrating on my breath. I just thought 'You don't want to go back, you want to keep that breath, right?' It worked. So far it worked.

I want to thank all of you on r/stopsmoking. This community is also among the reasons why I did not relapse. It is always comforting to read that you were able to reach the first week, the third month, the year...it is so inspiring. I want to give it back to you. I hope you can find some positive inspiration here.

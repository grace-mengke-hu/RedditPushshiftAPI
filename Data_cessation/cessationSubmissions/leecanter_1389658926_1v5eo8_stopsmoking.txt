A personal achievement for me!

I had been using the nicotine patch for four days (normally by day 2 of wearing a patch, I tear it off and buy a pack.) On the night of the fourth I stayed the night with my buddy in North Manhattan a long ways from my place. His apartment was so hot, my only patch I brought with me sweated off in the night.

The next morning I was craving so bad, I gave in and bought a pack down the road, telling myself I go back to patches the next day. Normally if I had said this to myself, I would have made up an excuse to keep buying cigarettes in stead of going back to the patch. Yet here I am back on the patch and feeling great about it!

TL;DR: Although the physical addiction to nicotine is still there, for the first time in my smoking life I've realized I actually don't want to smoke anymore.

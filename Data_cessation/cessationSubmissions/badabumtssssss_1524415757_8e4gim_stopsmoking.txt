After quitting for months, did your gum color improve?

To those who’ve successfully quit, did you notice any improvement on gum color? That is, if ever smoking made them darker. 

Been smoking for ~6yrs now. Though I haven’t reached a pack a day level, my gums are now darker than how they were years back. Currently trying to quit. Just want to know if quitting lets you get back your healthy looking gums.

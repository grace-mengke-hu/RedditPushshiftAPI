Cold Turkey is the best way for me

My longest quit before this was 3 months using an E-Cigarette, but the very moment I dropped and broke it, I was back on the cigarettes. It didn't help me get off nicotine, it was only a cigarette replacement. 
This time I've done 8 days completely free of any nicotine replacement or aids, and although it has been very very difficult, I can actually feel my dependency disappearing! It gets easier by the day. I know deep down that I'm not going to smoke again, something I haven't felt before when trying to quit.
The thing I notice immediately about quitting smoking is a genuine feeling of breathing easier. It's great :)

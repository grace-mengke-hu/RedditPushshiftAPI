Almost 2 weeks with JUUL. Big hurdle, almost there.

Smoking since I was 19, quit several times along the way for 3 months to 1 year at a time. Started again mid-2017.  Another stressful life event triggered my coping mechanism: cigs.

Fast forward to a month ago. The heavy chest feeling and coughing in the AM were getting worse. So done with cigs.

A friend recommended the JUUL and let me test it out on a couple occasions. 

I was skeptical about the JUUL but after countless days of waking up feeling like shit after a night of smoking 5-8 cigarettes I decided to give it a go.

It seems to be satisfying my intermittent cravings throughout the day.  I got the 5% nicotine pods, which I believe are the lowest strength ones they have (for now). The plan is to ween off cigs using JUUL, then ween off JUUL. Hopefully they make 0% eventually.

Anyway, the hardest part is that I live with someone who still smokes, and they walk right past my home-office every time they go outside to smoke a cig. Usually I would fail this type of interaction during a quitting phase, so that fact that I haven't had a cig for nearly 2 weeks is a good sign!

2019 - The year I quit cigs forever  &lt;-- That's what I want.

Cheers and good luck to everyone else, as well!

First shift without cigarettes

Okay so I made it through my first shift with no cigarettes without any total meltdowns.  The phone may have suffered some slight damage though!  I know that there are some people that have a very easy time quitting smoking.  Just because your journey was different does not mean that you need to be mean to other people or judgmental.  A few years back I was mid cigarette halfway through the day in Afghanistan and put my cigarette out and didn't smoke again for another 6 months it was incredibly easy.  Then I picked up the habit again this time around I have had I don't know how many failed attempts at not smoking over the past six months.  Hopefully I can get through the first few days.  For everyone that has shared encouragement, support, advice and links thank you so much!!!!

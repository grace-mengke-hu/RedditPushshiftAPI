Too early to quit?

I'm 17 years old, and have been smoking for 1 year, 4 months and 25 days now. Of course, it began with a cigarette on occasion, while drinking or at a party. Pretty soon, I was smoking up to 10 a day when I had a pack, and maybe 2 a day (bummed off others) when I didn't have a pack (broke high school student). I'd say I have smoked 6 cigarettes a day on average, and that means I've smoked 3084 in my life. 

Perhaps my question sounds stupid, but is it too soon to quit? I know each puff I take causes damage to my lungs, but I do enjoy smoking on occasion, and over the last few weeks have been able to control myself well. I smoke only when I drink now, or when I smoke other stuff. Otherwise I don't have any cravings. I know, however, that when I am travelling, or on vacation, I will definitely want to smoke. Quitting for good just seems too final at the moment, but is it necessary, considering I haven't been smoking all that long?

Edit: Thank you all so much for the advice. I will take it all to heart and quit forever! Even one, I understand now, can lure me back into this ridiculous, self-sustaining, idiotic trap.

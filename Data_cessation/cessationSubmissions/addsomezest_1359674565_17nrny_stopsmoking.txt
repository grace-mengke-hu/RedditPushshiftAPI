Long time lurker

So, I've been subscribed to this sub for quite a while, without actually quitting smoking. Frankly, seeing all of your posts popping up on my newsfeed was a often reminder for me to finally make a change. 

I know you've all hear this before and most likely felt it. But I don't want to quit, at all. I enjoy the social aspect of it the most. Also, it's difficult to quit when you go on smoke breaks with your boss and get in good with him. Also, my SO is a smoker. 

Today, I ordered an e-cigg thing recommended by another redditor as a compromise. I feel like I can still enjoy the parts I love about smoking: nicotine, social, get in with boss without all the harmfull crap I'm polluting my body with. So..that's my plan. Good luck to the rest of you that actually are **really** quitting. For now, we'll see how my compromise works.

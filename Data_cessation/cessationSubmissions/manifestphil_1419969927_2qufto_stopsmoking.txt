It's the small things...

I quit on Christmas day as the best gift I could give myself and my family. This isn't my first time quitting, but it will be my last.

That first cigarette after getting to work has always been "my favorite" and I knew it would be the hardest to kick in the butt. I don't keep any cigarettes anywhere because it makes it too easy to relapse in the middle of a craving. On the way into work today I almost pulled into the gas station. Almost. Instead I kept on driving and hit up /r/stopsmoking to read about folks who've quit for 5 days and those who've quit for 580 days.

Sometimes it's the small things. Today that small thing was a big thing.

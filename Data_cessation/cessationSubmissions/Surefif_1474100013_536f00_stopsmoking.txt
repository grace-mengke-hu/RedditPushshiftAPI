Today. It's time.

It's 4am and I'm in the courtyard of my building with a beer and the mindset that when I go upstairs I'm done. 

I chose this date specifically and have been planning on it for some time. It's my 30th birthday. I took 3 days off of work to fully get the nicotine out of my system. My absolutely gorgeous girlfriend (who HATES cigarettes) is upstairs waiting for me to finish, and will be spending the next 3 days without leaving my side. I have a fuckton of fruit juice to counteract my blood sugar crashing once my brain stops force-producing enzymes that make me think I'm fed (thanks, cigarettes, you sly fuckers). I've mentally prepared myself for this moment. But, I'm scared.

What if I fail? I work in the service industry and getting back into said industry is what caused me to start smoking again after 9 months of being done. All my friends smoke. Hell, damn near everyone in this city does. This is going to be tough.

But, I feel I'm prepared. I'm going to chain smoke until I vomit then go upstairs and wash my face, brush my teeth 3 times then climb into bed with my girlfriend and go to sleep. In the morning I'll break every remaining cigarette and flush them down the toilet. I want my last memory of smoking to be one of disgust. When I think "holy fuck I want a cigarette" I'm not going to lie to myself by saying "No I don't," I'm going to tell my brain "I know you want one but you're not fucking getting one." It's a mental battle and I'm bringing everything I have to the table.

I can do this. As soon as I hit "post" I'm lighting up the first of however many it takes for me to hate smoking.

Sorry for the mental catharsis but idk I feel it helps to write this down.

I can do this. But I'm scared.

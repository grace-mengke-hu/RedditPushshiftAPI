After 13 years of smoking i quit it feels better

I was smoking since 13 years and now went cold turkey straight away.
It's day 12 and still some craving. I know I can fight it out and I am trying to hold on.
I have tagged this year for myself as  lone wolf year.
I have a lot to fight for this year so I started with probably the most difficult one.
I wish good luck to all who are fighting known and unknown enemies of theirs.

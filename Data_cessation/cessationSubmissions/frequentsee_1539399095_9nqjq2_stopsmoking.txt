Day 84: My troubled confession.. (DO NOT READ IF CRAVING)

Warning: Do not read if easily influenced.
So, uh, I've held in there for awhile now. This is the longest I've gone without smokes in like 12 years.. &amp; I gotta say.. I don't feel any better. In fact I still feel terrible, if not worse. I have an awful taste in my mouth all the time now. I'm still hacking up phlegm. I'm still tired. I still crave them so much. What the fuck is going on? I quit drinking and everything else, too. I'll never go back because of how physically and mentally devastating quitting was (seriously, holy shit) but Jesus dude.. I feel no different whatsoever. Anyone else have something similar going on? Sorry if this bummed anyone out. I put this post of for like 6 weeks already because I didn't wanna upset anyone

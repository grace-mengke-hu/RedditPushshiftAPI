Using e-cig, just for one night?

I quit smoking 10 days ago.  Not even planned out, just read the Allen Carr book and stopped.  Tonight was my first night having beer since I've stopped, four beers over the course of the night, and definitely more cravings than any other time since I've stopped. I have an event tomorrow that I've had planned forever, and the likelihood of my just not drinking during it isn't very likely (it's a show at a bar) -- I'm worried I'm going to drink and bum a cigarette off of somebody tomorrow.  I was wondering what you guys thought of using an e-cigarette just for the one night (throw it out before bed and everything).

Day 1

Good morning everyone

What a fantastic community. Stories, experiences and comments are truly inspirational and very encouraging 

Have been on Champix now for 2 weeks and day 1 of my new life has arrived. Have smoked 30 per day for forty years but no matter what will not smoke again.

Some really bad cravings for the first 2 hours so far this morning by which time previously I would have smoked at least 6 of those filthy fags

Good luck to all - none of us are alone

100 days and a simple message

Ok, I figured I'm entering triple digit territory and there won't be another big milestone until the 6 month mark so what the hell...100 DAYS YEAH!

101 days ago I thought I couldn't have done this, when all it takes is saying NO to yourself. We are really good as saying yes all the time. It's ok to say no at times, it's for our own good.

Then, like anything else in life, practice makes perfect. At first it'll feel like you're writing with the wrong hand, but over time and with practice, it feels...normal.

I am grateful for this wonderful community. I could not have done it as easily and as enjoyably without /r/stopsmoking on my side.

day 23!

I'm on day 23! I took the tobacco free classes at the local hospital to help me wrap my head around being successful! They were free and aided in getting free patches. Being in a group gave alot of ideas on what to prepare for in those trigger moments. Withdrawl iis real!
I feel so much better! Those commercials are REAL! A friend's daughter just got a trachiotomy! HELLO! WAKE UP!! Don't want this to be me! I don't smoke anymore..... 32 years.DONE!

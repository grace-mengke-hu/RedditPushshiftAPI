Day 17. Quitter flu hitting HARD.

I smoked about 12-15 a day for years. 2nd serious attempt at quitting. I managed for 4 years before but it snuck back in. 

Last time I was never sick like this. After about a week smoke free I got sick, seemed like a regular cold. It lasted about 4 days then died down for 2. Thought I was getting over it then BOOM. 

Sweats, shivers, cough, mucus, foggy head and can't concentrate. Also feel pretty low at times.  

Currently chewing about 4 bits of 4mg nicotine gum a day. 

Please tell me it gets better.

2 Years (and 14 days....... didn't even realise time passing) clean

Hey fellow ex-smokers and aspiring ex-smokers. I have passed the 2 year mark and it's unreal how easy it is. I even forgot to celebrate 2 years. It's no longer a problem, a habit nor a crave. If you guys are wondering if it'll ever get easier, it does. So easy in fact that you don't even think of it. Had to look at my calendar before I realised I passed 2 years.

I do have my cigars every once in  blue moon but there's no crave, no addiction, no wants and I can go weeks and months before my next. 

I hope this motivates and inspire everyone who's starting off to keep at it, keep off them shit sticks and feel better as soon a possible. When I first quit I looked at those with 100s of days with the greatest of awe, respect and absolute jealousy. Turns out? It wasn't that hard to start with! You guys totally got this!

Cheers

I need motivation

I feel miserable after reading about people who used to smoke a pack for a decade and quit. I've been smoking for around 5 months and I just cannot stop. I try to convince myself that I can manage a few a day but it gets out of control really quickly, especially if alcohol is involved. 

I hate feeling like shit after a night of heavy smoking. I hate spending that much money and feeling that dependant on something. I need some motivation guys.

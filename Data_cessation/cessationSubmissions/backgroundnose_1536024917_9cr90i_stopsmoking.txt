Broke down again

Broke down and bought cigarettes again last night.

 I need to figure out what my triggers are. Evenings and friends who smoke seem to be some of them. I also have a small part of me that feels it will make more more awake/alert when I need to stay up late.

Part of the problem is that I don't take this seriously enough. I still think that" I'm not really a smoker " or that "I'm a light smoker" or "I'm not really addicted". I guess that's because I wasn't really for so many years. Until I was.

On the plus side I threw them out again this morning and am resolved not to smoke today. Maybe I should get an app. Any recommendations?

Please just one cig

help guys!
I left smoking about 9 days ago. I've been using work as a distraction throughout the day so that I don't smoke. but as soon as I get off work I crave a cig so badly but I'm able to shake that off.

I just woke up and thought I just want to smoke one cig, how it feels like! 
I know it's just my mind producing cravings

however on the good side, my head is clear. I can be around smokers. my throat loves me :D

I just wanted to know how long before these intense cravings go away and what happens if I give in to them one day.

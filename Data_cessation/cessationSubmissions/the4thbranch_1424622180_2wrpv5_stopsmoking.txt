I finally quit smoking! But... what about second hand smoke?

I stopped smoking about 2 weeks ago after having smoked for almost 20 years. I am using the Allen Carr method, which has really helped. I found out about it through you guys, so a million thanks!

I don't want to shy away from social events just because I am now a non-smoker. So, last night, I went out. We were indoors and a lot of people were smoking; I was around a lot of second hand smoke. I woke up feeling like crap this morning. I feel like my recovery took a step back. (On the other hand, I didn't smoke, so yay!)

How do you deal with second hand smoke? Any tricks to be around it? Does it reset your physical cravings period? Does it delay the healing of your lungs? In other words, is this going to mess up my quit?

Stay strong, everyone!

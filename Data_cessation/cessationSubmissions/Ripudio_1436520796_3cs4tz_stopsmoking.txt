Need some help

Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to the sub, but I've read a few posts and well...I want to quit. I'm almost 30 now and I have pretty much been smoking since I was 18. I'm at about half a pack a day now, sometimes more, sometimes less. I know its terrible for me, I just can't find a reason *I* want to quit. I don't know what its like to not be a smoker, I'm a relatively functional person, don't have too much trouble breathing or exercising, but I don't know anything other than this life that I have now. I've been a smoker as long as I've been an adult. If you have any advice or could share the reasons you quit that were meaningful...that would help. Thank you.

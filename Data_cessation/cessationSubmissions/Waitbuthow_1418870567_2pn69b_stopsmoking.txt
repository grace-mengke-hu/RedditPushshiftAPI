I started smoking again, after 4 years

So… here’s my story. I quit smoking 4 years ago. The year previous to this we moved to a new city. So I stopped smoking at work, new people, they never knew I was a smoker. Then, Dec 22 2010 I quit cold turkey. It was because I wanted to have a baby. A couple of months later I was pregnant. So, at that point, even if I did get the urge, I had my little baby inside me and I never even contemplated picking up a cigarette. Then I was breastfeeding for a year, no way I was going to put those poisons into my body and feed them to my baby. It was sort of easy. I felt amazing, and I was so proud of myself. Then I got pregnant with baby 2 soon after weaning, again, I was extremely motivated to stay off them. I’ve never been healthier.
And now… I’ve weaned baby 2, and 4 weeks ago, my husband had to deploy to the middle east suddenly. For 4 months. I’ve been mothering on my own. And I bought a pack of cigarettes. Because I’m an idiot. I’ve been smoking for 4 weeks, just when the little guys are asleep. I’m so upset with myself. I can’t believe I’ve done this. I need to stop immediately. But when I quit before, it was preceded by a big life change. And now, I’m just stuck here, with the children and I’m bored.
What the hell have I done. I feel so low.

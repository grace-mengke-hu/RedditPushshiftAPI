1 year smoke free

When I started out, I didn't think I'd make it this far. It became clear a few months in that this was doable when I stopped being reminded of cigarettes. Now I can even stand around with my friends when they smoke and it doesn't bother me a shred. 

To everyone just starting out - stay strong. It is hard, but you can do it. And it is worth it.

I'd really like to hear from anyone who has cut back to 1/day or so from being a regular smoker

I used to smoke a bit more than half a pack/day and after 'quitting' a million times I feel like I'm really close to success finally.




I used the patch to get through the toughest parts but I still have been having approximately 7 cigs week for the past two months.



I still get cravings but not the crazy emotional withdrawal cravings I used to get. I mostly just want a cigarette after a few drinks or sometimes even just cause I'm bored at the bus stop. They are rarely that satisfying but I do find myself enjoying one sometimes, especially if it's been a few days.



Anyway, I'm working on day 4 nicotine free right now. I want to keep the ball rolling. I've been drinking a little less and that's helping.



 Have any of you former smokers maintained a casual cig habit for some time before quitting for good?

I can't take quitting serious anymore

One pack a day smoker from 17 to 21. From then social smoker, mostly when drinking. Managed to quit from 24 to 25. Started again, social smoker.

Last 3 months I've reset my app at least 40 times I think. I just get carried away, smoke, feel bad as hell, don't smoke for 1-2 days, do it again. 

I literally can't take myself serious, and it's a really immature and stupid cycle I'm in right now. 

I know it's about will, but any advice, whatsoever? Something to take myself serious again?

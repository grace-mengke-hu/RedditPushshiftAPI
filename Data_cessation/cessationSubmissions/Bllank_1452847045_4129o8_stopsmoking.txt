How to make my dad realize it is wrong?

I'm trying to help him. Making everything I can to help him realize he has to stop smoking or he will die. He is 45 years old and been smoking about 30 years. Every time we with family bring up theme about quitting smoking he gets very angry and goes outside to smoke. He smokes about a pack a day. He's almost lost all hes teeth and can only eat tender food.Now I'm trying him to make him read book The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr. At least give it a shot and he won't even try reading it. How can I help him or make him read that god damned book?

BTW he never let me smoke and would be mad if knew I sometime smoke too. Maybe I should accidently smoke in front of him ? Maybe it would help?

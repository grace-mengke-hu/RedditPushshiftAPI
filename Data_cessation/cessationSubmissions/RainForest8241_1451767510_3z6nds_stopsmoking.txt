Relapsed to cope with anxiety

Admitting to yourself and loved ones there is a problem is the first step right? It could also be the hardest, along with getting help. I smoked cigarettes for 8 years. I quit 8 months ago. I've had a few lately because of traumatic life events. I'm relapsing for now to help with my anxiety. Until I get professional help or research other methods to cope with anxiety I will be smoking. I quit once, I have the power to do it again. I'll be seeking help soon, I've always just been afraid for that first step. I also fear benzodiazepine medication because it has made me very angry in the past. I also deal with anger issues, which I will be addressing as well. I look forward to bettering myself and seeking help. Mental health is very important and I need to start taking care of mine. 

Thanks for reading.

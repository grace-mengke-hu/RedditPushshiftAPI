I berated and screamed at my Mom.

I've been off nicotine for 9 days. My temper is volatile and I raved at my mother this morning for no justifiable reason. I am always courteous and respectful toward her, so this incident is not congruous with my personality. 

I've been smoking intermittently since the age of 15. I've become a horrible person since quitting. I rant at my mother and bang my head against the wall in anger and summon tremendous energy to suppress the impulse to scream obscenities at strangers. 

I'm so close to relapsing. I don't think my will is robust enough to bear this pressure. I am hurting the people I love. How could I scream and rave at my mother? Jesus.

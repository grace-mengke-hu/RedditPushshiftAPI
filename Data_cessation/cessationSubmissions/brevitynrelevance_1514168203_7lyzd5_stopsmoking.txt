Saying goodbye to smoking

I’ve always been a secret smoker.

My smoking has been casual. Two in the morning, one immediately when I come home from work, after dinner and before bed. But my smoking was always private. My smoker friends of course knew, but my closest non smoker friends rarely saw me smoke. They could smell it sometimes I’m sure but were too polite to say anything. 

Smoking was something I did, alone, for me. 

My desire to quit was sudden and a fluke. For years I saw no reason to quit. I’ll do it when I’m 30, or I’ll do it when I get pregnant, or I’ll do it when the wrinkles start. I saw an ad for the smoke free app and I thought hey why not? 

Giving up smoking feels like I’m breaking up with a really crappy friend because I’m giving up my own private ritual. My biggest reason for quitting is that in six months I’d hit 10 years of casual private smoking. I don’t want to be a ten year smoker. 

Almost ten years and smoking was my own private friend. Through college, a move to Japan, different jobs, different apartments, I always had a pack to come home to. I know smoking is psychological. And right now Im finding it hard to accept that I’ll never smoke again. 

It’s been 24 hours. I know the worst hasn’t come. But like the recovering addict I am, I can’t think about forever or tomorrow. I’ll take this one day at a time. And focus on not smoking for the next ten minutes.

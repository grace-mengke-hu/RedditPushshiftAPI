Reset my Quit app - hopefully for the last time.

So, I've been trying to quit for two months now. Started in new years and lasted 2 weeks then stupidly had a smoke and went back to a pack a day. Tried 3-4 times again since then and I last 2-3 days and then go right back to it. I don't understand why my mind tricks me into giving in. Every time I'm smoke free for over 24 hours I think how good it feels to not be smoking anymore, and the smell, I hate how my hands, clothes, and all smell while smoking. Then for whatever stupid reason I end up getting a pack and chainsmoking to "replace all those I didn't smoke the last couple days".

I had the last smoke I had from the last pack I bought and decided that I'm giving my best to quit this time. If I end up smoking once more, I don't know how or what I'll have to do to end this filthy habit. 

I got engaged 3 weeks ago and my biggest motivation to stop this habit is the happy life I can have with my soon to be wife and future kids (hopefully!).

Here's to not smoking anymore!

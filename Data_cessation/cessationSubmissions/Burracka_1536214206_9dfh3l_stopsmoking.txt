Day one of the long journey

(25m) been smoking for about 2 years now , i started as a social thing because all my friends was ( yeah i know it was stupid) because they would all go out to the smoking area and i felt weird for not doing it while they was. 

Im doing this for me so i can feel better and not be ruled by a addiction. Does anyone have any tips ? i know this will be a long and hard journey which ive done before when i lost 90 lbs. but i feel i will need more help with this

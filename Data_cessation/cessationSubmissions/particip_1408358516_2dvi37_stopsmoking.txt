I've got to reset my badge :s

After quitting for 150 days I was home alone for a week (girlfriend & kids out on holiday for a week) and had some problems ... so I just started smoking out of boredom. I went back from 0/day to a pack/day in less then 24 hours.

So here I am again, 

1) because I failed 

2) to make it 'official' that I'm quitting again tomorrow.

~~The badge-reset will follow tomorrow!~~ 

update: ... the timing isn't right ... I can't quit today. Don't shoot me for it, I'm not looking for excuses ... the timing was super important last time. I hope to find a good spot within 1 week.

4 days now, easier than i thought it would be / easier than last time i just "tried"

after many times of me saying to myself "i'll quit... eventually..."
I've finally decided to actually do it, and had quit cold turkey at Friday night.

slept in through Saturday 

Now i'm in the middle of my work week: (starting Sunday where i come from)
I found that if i keep myself occupied and don't think about it, then i ... don't think about it, and its really easy.

i still go outside for coffee breaks with the rest of my work friends except i don't smoke with them, just talk and drink coffee /etc'.

whenever i feel i am about to break and go buy a pack-
I tell myself that if I do it, then "they" win and i loose.

(They = evil good for nothing "Tabaco" companies who somehow convinced us to buy cow crap covered with poisonous cancerous tar from them, for a good amount of hard earned money)

just telling this to myself actually helps quite a lot.
if i break... i loose, there's no denying it and there's no cheating it.

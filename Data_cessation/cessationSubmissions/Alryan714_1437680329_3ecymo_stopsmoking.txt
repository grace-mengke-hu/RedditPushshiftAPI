Cravings

Almost a month and half in and it seems to be under control. Then family drama happenes. I am not sure why but family fighting is my number 1 thing that makes me want to give up and smoke. And it is not even my family but my in-laws. I have been with my husband for 6 years. And I opened up to my in laws about how the other son was being a dick to me and now that has open Pandora's box. I found out how much my father in law really dose not care for me and how much he dose not care for my folks and my brother. My folks have only seen them maybe 4 times in the whole 6 years and my brother has never met them. They moved out of state 3 years ago so it is hard to see them. I thought we had open communication.  I thought wrong. I am just so sad for my husband. He is a great guy supporting his daughter and I and our home. Ugh. I i am trying the walking away and not speaking to him but he keeps blowing up my husband about how I am a coward and thinned skinned. He called my mom a asshole and put my folks financial situation down. My dad has been sick for about 4 years and last year he fell and lost the ability to walk. My husband's father has not had a job in the 6 years i have known my husband and lives off his wife's trust fund. My folks make enough money to support themselves in retirement. So much crazy. Sorry for the rant. I just want peace.

If this helps anyone, that's great. I'm a week and a day in

As far as cravings go. focus on your center of focus on your Non Dominant eye. Breathe inhale with your stomach to your lungs, and exhale slowly out. <- That's good for anxiety and stress as well.

As far as the insane body tension goes. I am doing ashtanga yoga 2 to 3 a day. Luckily I have been able to get rid of insomnia like that. When you quit your bodies muscles tense up, After or before yoga try drinking tea 1, probably will make the sucking part of all this last long if your muscles are un-tense then detoxified.

For excessive stress/anxiety, there is an pill that is a somewhat similar concept to melatonin by the name of "Gaba" which can be found on amazon/whole foods the type of thing, it makes alpha brain waves for you, there is a pill named "L-Thyanine" which works similar it just "helps" you make them. I do 750mg 2 to 3 a day if I feel any bit of that shit. Also Tea 2 (Stress and Tension Tea) Is really wonderful for.

An E-cig and weening your way down, I've been doing that some. Seems to make this process a whole easier.

Also cough drops nonstop, If you're sucking on a cough drop it's takes your mind off shit.

This stuff helps loads too. http://www.soundsleeping.com/index.php

I play this w/ a combo of Sleep/Relax/creek/bonfire , but w/e works, works.

Side note: I've been smoking almost 5 years straight, I'm 27. I quit twice, once when I was 18, started around 16, and again started at 21, and right before i turned 23 i got up into it again. I was on a medication called "fluphenazine" for my anxiety/nervousness, it made quitting pretty thoughtless and easy. I quit after smoking for those 2 periods of time and really experienced nothing out of the normal (Med normal). If you have very important reason to quit. And you are very serious, maybe try it. But i would talk to a doctor, i went off that stuff cold turkey earlier this year and it was extremely hard (*Thank you USA mental health cuts in the 80s*) My personal thought is that proper sleep, water, and diet, are the most important thing a human can do/consume.

Hope any of this helped

I think the thing that gets me through it the most of ashtanga yoga, theres places for it, if there isn't in your area, there loads of youtube tutorials.. It's appears to be very corny but w/e. But truly works. 

WOO good luck to me, and everyone else, so ridiculous.. If anyone says it's easier to quit heroin than cigs... That's bullshit.... Maybe ages ago.

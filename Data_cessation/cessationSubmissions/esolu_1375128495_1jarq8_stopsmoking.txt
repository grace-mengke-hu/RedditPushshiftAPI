Overwhelming Fears

I've been suffering from fear that what if I waited to long to stop.  I have a physical in about a month, so hopefully I will get a clean bill of health and that will help.  I plan on asking for a full workup, EKG, XRays, etc.

whyquit.com is great and all, but those stories have really fucked me up...

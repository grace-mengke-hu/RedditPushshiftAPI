So day 3 and my body is trying to convince me to get an e-cig.

NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE. 

I am not new to this rodeo, was off the ciggs for 8 months 3 years ago, e-cig, then "oh one won't hurt" to "hey if I get a pack it will last me all week" to "hey, I need a pack for today".

NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE

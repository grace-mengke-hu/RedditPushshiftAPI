I just noticed i'm at month 3 today

it globally feels good.  my chest is much cleaner and i have much more energy throughout the day, it feels good not to be a slave to a substance. in less than a couple of weeks' time i became sensitive to second hand smoking and became that annoying person who nags about cigarette smoke in a social setting again.

quitting was rather easy, granted i've only smoked for about a year and started at age 28. i slowly went up from 1 cigarette every other day, to 2-3 per day in a couple of months' time, up to 10-15 per day by june. that's when i attempted to quit the first time, i held on for a month but relapsed. my consumption quickly got back up to where it was prior to my attempt, occasionally smoking up to a pack a day.

later one morning in september i had skipped breakfast, was feeling pretty anxious, by the time i got to work i had smoked 4 cigs, felt the urge to smoke one more before actually starting work. at that point is when i thought i have to get a hold of myself. i threw out the rest of my pack without going for that "just one more", knowing that this is the trap.

i get the occasional craving, especially when i'm stressed or feeling down. i also get nostalgic thinking about the '5 minutes just for me' time, i still feel like i'm not quite there, at the point where i can find my center and be at peace for a minute. i might try meditation for that.

Why so much hate for vaping?

Hello all, long time lurker here. After numerous quit attempts the traditional way (cold turkey, patches, gum etc) I've finally quit smoking cigarettes thanks to using my nicotine vaporizer. Two weeks cigarette free is amazing, and I don't get the hate. 

If you want to quit, and vaping is the only way you can, isn't that better than continuing smoking cigs?

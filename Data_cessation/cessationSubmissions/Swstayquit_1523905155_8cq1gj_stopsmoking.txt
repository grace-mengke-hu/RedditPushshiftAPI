Second guessing Day 5

Just joined this community - I have never been part of stop using nicotine community ever and have quit several times in the past,
Longest being 2 years and was nicotine free for 8 months and then restarted last year and kept quitting for upto 3 weeks and then relapsed.
Today is day 5. I have been through the first 3 days so often so keep asking why am I doing this to myself.
Gain weight with every quit ofcourse. I am on the patch - only 7 mg but have been thinking of all the stressors coming up and reasons why I would deal with my life better if I was using nicotine.
Typing here for accountability and support. I am a better person when I have nicotine in my body. Mornings are my toughest.
Thank you

I didn't think I could do it!

I tried quitting 5 years ago but it didn't last long. The benefit was that after that attempt I smoked less, at first I had the occasional cigarette, then 3 a day, then 5 and in the end I was smoking 10, which was half of what I was smoking before. Even though I managed to smoke less for so many years, deep inside me I believed I could never quit. I thought I belonged to that special group of people, for whom it is impossible to stop smoking (maybe because they have a gene related to addiction behaviour). 

I proved myself wrong! I am smoke free for a whole month and it is not always easy, but it is a nice feeling to have accomplished that! Although they say you should take it one day at a time, deep inside I am sure I will not smoke again. I am proud of myself and you should be as well, whether it is one day or thousands of days since you quit!!

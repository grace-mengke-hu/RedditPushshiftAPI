DAY 7

Long time smoker here who took up meditation 8 days ago and has not smoked a cigarette since. I quit simply and quietly after I didn't want to go out and buy another pack when I ran out eight days ago. 

I've had to white knuckle it here and there for sure (like right now) but for the most part, I can actually *feel* myself becoming a non-smoker. Each time I have had a strong urge I just imagine how shitty that taste actually is when I haven't smoked for a couple days in the past and how much I don't like myself when I light up and what a huge effort I have to put into not thinking about smoking while I am smoking (knowing better and doing it anyway is cognitive dissonance, killing yourself for relief is a whole new level). 

Just stopping by this awesome sub as a note to self that Day 8 will be better no matter what if I don't smoke today!

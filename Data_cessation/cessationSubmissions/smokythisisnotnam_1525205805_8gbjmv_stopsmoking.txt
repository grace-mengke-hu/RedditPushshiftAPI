After multiple attempts to quit since January, I finally quit today.

I had quit for 4 months last year and nearly 9 months in 2016 \(and those came after a 20\-30 serious attempts\). And now I hate myself for starting again. Today I had this really suffocating feeling and I decided to quit and unlike other attempts this year the thought of smoking itself feels nauseating. So hopefully I'll quit for good this time!

Day -1

I realized some time not that long ago that I've been a smoker for half of my life, I started when I was 17 and now I'm 34.  Every time I light I cigarette, I feel miserable about it and pretty much just hate myself.  I bought a vape last year to try and make the switch to something "healthier" but I ended up just using that on top of smoking.  I'd go a few days with no cigarettes and feel really great about it, and then I would find something to stress about and go out and buy a pack.  

I've spent so much time in smoking rooms in international airports, covered in the stink of twenty different kinds of smokes, huddled outside in the cold after a nice dinner, rushing away from the table to get a cig after drinks, and pretending that smoking was an enjoyable part of my morning coffee/contemplation ritual.  

I've had a lot of false starts over the years, I've gone two weeks, I've gone a month at my longest, but I always come back to it.  

Tomorrow will be my first day as a non\-smoker/non\-nicotine user.  Today, I feel like I'm finally ready to wrestle control from this disgusting habit and take my lungs back.  I keep telling myself that it's not about what I'll be giving up, but about what I'll get from doing this.  I don't want lung cancer, I don't want to develop some sort of heart disease, I don't want to reek of of smoke, or stand in smoke filled glass cages desperately sucking on the end of a cigarette because I can't handle a nine hour plane ride and a layover. I don want to keep telling my  six year old nephew that someday I'll quit when he asks me why I do something that's so unhealthy. 

I'm feeling determined.

Here's hoping I can see this through.

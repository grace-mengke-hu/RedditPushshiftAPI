I regret quitting

I wish I hadn't quit as abruptly as I did.  I didn't have time to enjoy those final few cigarettes.  I wish I would have prepared myself more.  I want to get back into smoking, but the only thing stopping me is the fact that I never want to have to go through the hell that the last 14 days have been again.

Do I need to reset my badge?

My friend cuts my hair.  Yesterday I went to her place to get it cut.  She smokes inside her house. Ugh.  I caved and had one with her.  

I didn't buy a pack, I've been smoke free since and I have no plans of letting this ruin my quit.   

Is the badge days smoke free, or since you pledged to quit?

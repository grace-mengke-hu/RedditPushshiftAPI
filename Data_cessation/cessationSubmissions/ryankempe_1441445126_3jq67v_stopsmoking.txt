quit smoking strategy

So I've tried many times to quit smoking. Once i quit cold turkey for a year as a new years resolution and actually did it, then about 15 months after the first day smoking crept back in. 

So far i have realised that I crave a cigarette if I am anxious or stressed or have low blood sugar. I think I mistaken my sugar cravings for nicotine sometimes.

Are there any other insights you guys have surrounding your smoking habits? what causes them? and what strategies do you use to avoid smoking?

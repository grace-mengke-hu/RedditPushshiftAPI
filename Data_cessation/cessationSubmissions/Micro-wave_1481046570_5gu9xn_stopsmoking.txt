Made 24hrs before buying a pack

I am out of money this month. I only have money left for travel to work, now that I bought a pack. A lot of people quit cold turkey, but I'm pretty proud of myself for making 24hrs before giving in. I don't think cold turkey works for me cause it mostly makes me think about smoking.

I'm hoping I'll burn through this pack in two or three days, and I don't get paid for 10 more days. I find replacing smoking with eating is helpful, because when I crave cigarettes I can convince myself to look forward to eating instead. This isn't really a problem because I'm on my feet all day at work and generally don't eat enough.

Any encouragement? Any tips? I know I'm gonna be doing the right thing by quitting, for my health and for my wallet. I've only been smoking for a couple months, originally to help with some mental health problems (severe anxiety).

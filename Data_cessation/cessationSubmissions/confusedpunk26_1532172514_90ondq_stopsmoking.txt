Surrounded by smokers

So all of my friends smoke. They're happy and supportive every time I tell them I'm gonna try to quit, and don't try to make me do it. But they're attitude toward smoking is that everything kills you so why does it matter. And some of them have blatantly said they have no desire to quit. I'm extremely weak willed and allow their feelings about quitting, influence me. Plus being around them when they smoke tempts me to smoke too, and I just can't seem to find the strength to stand my ground. 

Any suggestions to help me motivate myself and stay strong during this process? I love my friends and don't want to have to stay away from them to do this.

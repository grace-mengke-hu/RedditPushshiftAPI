2 days in, got gum, got a disposable ecig, anyone got any other ideas to pass my time?

I have gone 2 days for the first time in 3 and half years. Wanted to quit for so long, didn't believe i could do it. Finally feel liberated but struggling to keep my mind occupied any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Wanting to smoke again?

After a rough first week I've done great for the past 14 days. I barely think about cigarettes at all and even when I occasionally felt the need to have a cigarette (ie when I am drunk) it was always easy enough to tell myself no.

Now, however, I find my motivation is dwindling. Where I previously had the "I actually *don't want* a cigarette" attitude I am now back to "I would like to have a cigarette and the only reason I don't have it is because I'm stubborn"-mind set, which makes it a lot harder not to smoke.

Why do I suddenly want to smoke again? What's happening? Please tell me this will pass as I know I won't be able to keep myself in rein if this feeling persists for a long period of time :(

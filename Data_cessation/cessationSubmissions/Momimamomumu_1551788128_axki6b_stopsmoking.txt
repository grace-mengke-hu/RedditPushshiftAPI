I just realized its been a little over 1 year now.

It's truly amazing how time does fly. It's almost like it was just yesterday when I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/7yecqc/i_want_to_be_alive_for_the_future_for_my_future_d1/) but it's already been 380 days.

In that period of time, a lot has happened. Some for good and some for worse but I pulled through. I didn't smoke when I *so* wanted to and when friends or co-workers tried to make me smoke, I politely declined.

I realize this doesn't mean much in the grander scheme of things but I'm happy and I hope others can come along to quitting for good. 

Cheers and here's to another year till forever.

The nonsense of smoking

I hope that this text helps someone who wants to quit smoking but have a lot of fear about it because they think they will pass through a hell or will not enjoy or confront the life better without a cigarrette. This is a little summary of the phillosophy of Allen Car, the Easyway, that have a tax of more than eighty percent of success. There are a lot of videos (and books on pdf) about this methode. In essence, this methode is about to become aware of the zero advantages to smoke, and the reason why the people dont quit smoke is because the society have a washed brain on this topic. (sorry if my english isn't very well)

Smoking isn't beneficial in any psychological aspect. Only in one: to quit the sensation of nervousness that left the previous cigarrette. It's the unique "positive" aspect that has the cigarrette. But... if you don't smoke... you dont need to resolve this. 

It's a myth veeery extended that the cigarrette makes you relaxed. The cigarrettes put the smokers more nervous, anxious, lethargic and depressed, because the body is deprive by a lot of vitamins and nutrients, and the oxigen. Also, left a feeling of guilty and stupidity because the smoker knows that it is damaging hir health and its a nonsense. In essence, he/she knows that he/she is doing the dumb. 

It's all mental: the current smokers believe that they would't confront the life on the same form if they dont smoke, but it's a myth that perpetue the dependency. If they quit smoking, they will confront the life with more energy, decision, concentration, etc. The tobacco doesnt contribute in nothing in your life.  If you smoke any type of nicotine, you will continue with the addiction and you will depend on it.

Remember that the smoker not enjoy more the life. Only is captured by a trap.

Solid reasons to quit?

I have no doubt in my mind that if I had a really, really personally compelling reason to quit, I'd be able to do it in a heartbeat and never look back.  
  
I started smoking April 24th, 2017, so almost exactly a year before my decision to quit yesterday. I decided to pick up smoking because something happened in my relationship and I couldn't cope on an hour-to-hour basis. I was in no way physically dependent on nicotine that first month, but the psychological addiction was real.  
  
Over this entire time I smoked an average of a pack a week. After a certain point, the meditative effects disappeared. It went from a cigarette providing a (short-lived) morale boost to ... *not* having a cigarette striking a morale hit. It doesn't give me anything, and I hate relying on anything just to function at baseline.  
  
Other than the guilt of actively contributing to tartar buildup and cavities, that's really the only thing that sticks out in terms of why I want to kick the habit. I don't smoke enough (&lt;1K a year) for it to be that much of a savings opportunity, I don't care that much about my long-term health (sorry, just being honest), and I'm not even embarrassed of smoking anymore. I'm afraid that this isn't a strong enough motivation; that once I hit day 10 or so, I'll just completely fold because the stress of quitting is not "worth" being able to pat myself on the back for quitting. But I also don't want to wait for the right time because I know myself and that it will ever come.  
  
Am I just being a baby? Have you gone through this and, if so, how did you set yourself straight? TIA

I just had to stop and say thanks to everyone on this sub.

I'm on day 5 smoke free and had a rough day at work.  I wanted nothing more than to stop at one of the multiple gas stations on the way home to buy a pack and " just have one".  I didn't and when I got home I immediately opened up this sub and reading all the stories and seeing all the things people love about not smoking really made me happy that I didn't stop.  It's only been about 20 minutes and I'm still craving them but just the thought of getting them makes me feel ashamed of myself and I don't know if I'd feel the same if it wasn't for the stories of you random internet strangers.  But to everyone out there who's struggling too don't give up, because despite not knowing each other, we're all in this fight together and just knowing that helps.

Most days are a breeze.  The desire to smoke has lessened with time.  I still have hard days.  That will likely will lessen with more time.  Today was hard.  I thought I would never quit smoking.  She was like an old friend one who never judged.  When I am unable to ease my worries and rest my minds she was always there.  Moving on.

I felt like having a smoke last night

 I don't know where the feeling came from. I just suddenly reached towards my desk for a nonexistent pack of cigarettes.
 It took me a moment to realize what I was reaching for, kind of like when you walk into a room and forget why.
 I wasn't having any cravings. It was just something I wanted. I ended up filling my water bottles and just enjoyed nice cool water the rest of the night.

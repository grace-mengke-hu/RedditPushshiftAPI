Eleven days free!! A few observations and question!!

 Hello quitters,

I'm 11 days free! I read Allen Carr's book and quit easily. No cravings, no withdraw symptoms and the usual bla bla bla that you guys are used to read from Allen Carr's readers.

I'm very happy that I managed to kick this addiction and I already feel free of it. I feel better and better everyday.

But I noticed a few things:

- I have seen a lot of people saying that after a week or so you have your sense of smell and taste improved. I haven't noticed any improvements yet, is that normal?

- Yesterday I walked/jogged for 90 minutes, didn't feel tired or out of breath but when I went to bed, I was coughing like crazy and today my lungs are burning. It feels like I have smoked 4 packs this evening but I didn't smoke anything. Is that also normal? Will this sensation go away soon? I also feel tired, not sure if that is related to not smoking though!

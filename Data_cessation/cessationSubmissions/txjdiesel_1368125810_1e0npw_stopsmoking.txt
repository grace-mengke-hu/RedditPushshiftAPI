Grumpy & Snacky: The dwarves of /r/stopsmoking

I'm quitting but, I'm also in the process of trying to lose weight. I've only been smoking for about a year total (with a few months without in between) and I still have the self control to say "no" to myself when I'm tempted to buy a pack. But, I've noticed that I'm a bit grumpier and feel the need to snack more. I know these are typical quitter's symptoms, I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on curbing these, particularly the snacking. 

I'm pretty opposed to the gum, and vaping because I actually want to step away from tobacco completely. I've tried dipping to get away from smoking and, while it worked, it's such a disgusting thing to me that I don't think I could ever keep it up also, it doesn't really help with the whole getting away from tobacco. So...any help/advice/tips from those who have been/are there would be much appreciated. 

Stay strong!

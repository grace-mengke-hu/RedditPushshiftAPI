How do I keep my mind away from smoking?

Hi guys, unfortunately I'm starting this again and am realising just how hard this is. I'm 6 hours in as for some stupid reason I thought it'd be smart to have one last cigarette. I have my e-cigarette and have been using it constantly (No nicotine) and I'm constantly thinking about smoking. How can I keep my mind actively avoiding smoking when everything I do, makes me want a smoke? I used to smoke constantly when doing anything at all. You name it and i was probably smoking.

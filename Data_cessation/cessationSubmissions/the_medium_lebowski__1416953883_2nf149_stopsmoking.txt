60 days! :D

$300 saved, 910 cigarettes not smoked! Feels great! My girlfriend has recently decided to quit too. I would have slipped up more than once without her support, so now I'm happy that I get to return the favor and help her quit! 


To new quitters: it gets easier! Stay strong, and get a support system of friends of loved ones for those times when you won't be as strong as you'd like.

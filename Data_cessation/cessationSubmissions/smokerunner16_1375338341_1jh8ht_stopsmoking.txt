Im starting now

I have been too poor to buy any cigs since monday but I made the decision now. I went out to run after being an XC runner for 6 years and couldnt get through 3 miles. That was my wakeup call. Ive got me an ecig to help from a friend and fraternity brother. Im curious to know what were peoples wakeup calls to quit and any tips y'all have for the journey ahead

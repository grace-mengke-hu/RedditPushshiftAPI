Confusing side effects....

I lost my voice on Monday and it still isn't back.  I don't know how this happened.  I dont feel sick or anything.  Even smoking for 8 years I never lost my voice out of nowhere.  

Is this a side effect?  It's ironic because now that I'm a non-smoker I sound like I smoke over a pack a day.  

I'm on voice rest and drinking tons of water and nothing is helping :(

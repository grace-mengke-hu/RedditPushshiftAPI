A happier morning

I honestly can't believe I've made it 21 days. There was a time I thought I could never quit. I have been working hard on this for much longer than 3 weeks and now everything is coming together. Every morning I go to my calendar on the wall and cross out the day before. Seeing all the Xs makes me happier than I imagined. That feeling is better than a cigarette.

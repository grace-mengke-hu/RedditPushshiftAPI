This is it. This is exactly what I needed...

At noon mountain time yesterday, I smoked my last cigarette with the mentality that "I'm just not gonna smoke again." I read Carr's book and made the choice.

I'll admit, my confidence for success was not quite where he suggested it be before I stop, but I had already decided that when I finished that book, that was it. It's been a rough 30 hours. Something didn't feel right. It was harder than it should've been. What was I missing?

Then I stumbled upon this place. Got to see how many different people used the Carr method and praise it. Real people, not just blurbs at the end of a book. This is my fix for the hard cravings. The positive comments about how good quitters feel, and the negative comments about the shit I've left behind.

I'm feeling like I'm over the biggest hurdle already, thanks to you.

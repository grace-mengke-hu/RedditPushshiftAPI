The First Craving

It almost always gets me. I've been trying but it feels like I don't have the willpower. My days listed isn't accurate as I set it for what I think is the last one but an hour later I cave. The longest I've gone is 3 days when I was in Mexico with family since I've been smoking. I'm 22 and I feel like it starting to run my life. I'm really at a loss and disappointed with myself. Even though I'm sure it's all been said before, some thought or advice would be nice rn

[Club 31]Check-in time! Or join the "Back Wing" to be smoke free the rest of December

Club 31 is a group committed to staying smoke-free for the 31 days of December. It's a great way to help get through the holidays and start the new year 2015.

* Anyone else who quit smoking on or before December 1 and is still smoke-free can still join Club 31. Just comment below.

* If you have smoked, just say so in a comment -- no judgement. You can join The Back Wing ...
* Anyone who quit smoking by Monday Dec 15 can join the "Back Wing". Same deal. No smoking for the rest of December. Just comment below.

Best wishes all.

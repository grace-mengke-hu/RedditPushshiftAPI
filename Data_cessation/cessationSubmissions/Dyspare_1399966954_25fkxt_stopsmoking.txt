Help me help myself!

Hey Reddit,

So I quit smoking about 8 or 9 months ago. Since then I've gone from 150lbs soaking wet, to 220lbs and double chins!

I'm EXTREMELY uncomfortable, my ankles and legs are swollen with water retention, I can barely even tie my own fucking shoes. I've already had to replace my clothes once, and I'm now looking at doing it AGAIN. I've tried all sorts of things to help with the water retention but not much seems to help. I've tried eating healthier, doing cardio (Kind of hard to do as most of it is impact workouts and my body is not handling throwing around my extra weight like that), eating things that are supposed to help with the water issues, and now even herbal diuretic pills (We can't buy chemical diuretics in Canada over the counter.).

Anyway, I'm now sitting here thinking I'd rather be a smoker then be a fat bastard who can hardly even bend over. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has been down this road? If they retained water and gained weight so fast they now have stretch marks? How they handled it and if it ever went away?

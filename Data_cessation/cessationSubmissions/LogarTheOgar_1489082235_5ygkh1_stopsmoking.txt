Never quit quitting - Quit #n

I don't even like cigarettes. I like cigarette. I like one, but then...

One always leads to more and then more and then way too many. And then my chest hurts and my head hurts and it costs a lot.

A badge reset is easy to think about doing but a little more jarring each time to do.

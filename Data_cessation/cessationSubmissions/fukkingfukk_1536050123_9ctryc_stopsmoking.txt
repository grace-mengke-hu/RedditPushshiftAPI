I am quitting smoking for the sake of my brother's children

I'm quitting. I'm doing so because my sibling has brought tiny persons into my life whose needs take priority over my own. They -- these sleepy, slow, insensate beings -- need me to show leadership. I am not showing leadership when I have to disappear without explanation to inhale substances that will help me to kill myself prematurely. I therefore quit.

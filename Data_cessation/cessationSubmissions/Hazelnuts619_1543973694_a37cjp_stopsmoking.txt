Withdrawal Hitting it's Peak After 5 Days 1 Hr.

For those of you who have quit after a moderate to high addiction to cigarettes, how long does the worst part of it end? 

I never knew the withdrawal could be that bad... this shit sucks. I don't know how y'all do it. I'm not even sure if it's this bad for anyone or if it's just me. I have abruptly quit for 5 days and 1 hour after smoking/dipping for over a year. 

Any advice would be welcome please. How do y'all get through the peak of Withdrawal? Thanks all.

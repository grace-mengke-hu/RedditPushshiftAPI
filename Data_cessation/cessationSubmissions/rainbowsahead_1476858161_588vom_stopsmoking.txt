Help

I stopped smoking for the past two months and after having a couple of relapses while drinking, I bought a pack. Such a downward spiral and I'm so disappointed in myself. I've been smoking and drinking for the past 20 years apart from the odd break. I want to change. I'm stopping again at the end of this week. I'm prepping up by listening to Allen Carr's Easy Way. I quit for the two months with the help of the Smokefree app and Nicotine Replacements and reading this wonderful subreddit. Is cold turkey best or NRT or does it depend on the individual? Any advice is gratefully received!!!

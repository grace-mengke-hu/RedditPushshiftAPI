Stop smoking (we love you)

And we don’t want you to die, we don’t want you to die.

Yes, Will Toledo I’ll finally listen, gosh. Lol.

I’ve smoked forever, since I was like 14.  Now I smell like cigarettes all the time and the thought of smoking one gives me a headache. So yeah I’m pretty much done with all that.

Wish me luck to sticking with it. (:

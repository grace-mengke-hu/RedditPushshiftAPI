Day One

Today is the first day in 8 or so years that I haven't had a cigarette, and I'm miserable. Every 20 or 30 minutes, I reach for the phantom pack that would ordinarily be sitting next to me while doing school work. My insides feel weird, and it's difficult to keep focus on anything.  I'm wearing a patch, but it doesn't seem to be doing what it promised.

I know this will be worth it eventually, but I'm on the verge of calling my husband and telling him to pick me up a pack on his way home. I never in a million years, thought I would be so chained to something as stupid and frivolous as goddamned cigarettes. I'm ashamed of myself, and sickened by the fact that I am so weak. 

Edit: Thanks to all for the suggestions and encouraging words. Made the first day a lot less horrible.

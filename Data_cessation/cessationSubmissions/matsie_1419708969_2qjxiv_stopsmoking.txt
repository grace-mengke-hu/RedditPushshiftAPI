Went out to a giant punk festival last night...

Hey everyone! I am home in Detroit for the holidays and my friends and I all went to this big punk Christmas show last night. All of my friends were smoking and I hung out with them outside the venue. Didn't even break down to try to bum a cigarette let alone try to actually smoke one. It's a little thing, but I'm super proud of myself.

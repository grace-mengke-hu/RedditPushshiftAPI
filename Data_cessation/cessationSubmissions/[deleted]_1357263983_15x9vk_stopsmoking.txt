Fuck you tobacco!

So I smoked for roughly eight years.  I had my first puff through a resin bong at age 12.  Its been pretty much downhill from there.  Yesterday I lit up my last spliff(some really really nice lemon haze might I add) and bobbed into the chemist to speak to a stop smoking rep.  Got one of these nifty quickmist sprays, cost me eight pounds and apparently it lasts a week.  I think that's a win as far as cost goes.  The rep did raise an eyebrow when I said I didn't smoke marijuana because I must have stunk of it and my eyes were red.  No problems so far, I get an itch to smoke and the spray takes it away.  I was sceptical at first but its turned out to be some kind of miracle cure.  People have smoked around me plenty but honestly it hasn't bothered me.  I still love the smell of a cigarette.  I have also quit weed, at least for the first 3 months of stopping the cigs.  Seems counter-productive to be smoking joints and I think I would just smoke more weed to compensate for the lack of cigs.  Today was easy, but its one day I don't want to be cocky :)

Also, nice to meet you all!

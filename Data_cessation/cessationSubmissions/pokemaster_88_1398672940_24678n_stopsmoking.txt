Really cranky.

I am very irritable and I do not like anyone today. Its been two days, and looking back on my day today I negatively reacted several times over stuff I'd ordinarily be able to handle. I even yelled at my mom over the phone and called her a liar. I guess we both kind of blew up at eachother but I could have handled that way better. 

I should apologize. Can't wait for this part to be over but at least I'm noticing it. I need to try and fill in these smoking urges with something productive. I'm excited, though, to have made this choice. How do I get a badge?


Thanks!

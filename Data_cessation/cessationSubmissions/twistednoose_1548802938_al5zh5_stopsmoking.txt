How to help my grandmother who has COPD, and my mother stop smoking?

My mother and grandmother have been long time smokers. The latter of the two has chronic obstructive polmanary disease (COPD) which causes breathing issues. This past Christmas they came to visit and my grandmother had to be admitted into a hospital and is now on an oxygen tank and continues to smoke.

 They both want to quit and have attempted many times with not much success. Youd think the obvious health issues would help deter both from continuing smoking but addiction is a hell of a thing. How can I support them? what advice could i give? What should I do? My mother seems to be set on trying again starting today but how can I help them stay on track? I know it's a personal issue but I feel like theres something I must be able to do. I dont want to lose either of them from this. Thanks to all who lend a word.

Tl;dr:  What can I do to help &amp; support my mother and sick grandmother to kick this horrible habit?

I'm on like day 15 of chantix and day 6 of no nicotine..

I'm still feeling the urge in my bones that everything would be much better if I were to just get a little bit more nicotine. Just a little...   However day 2 and 3 were so bad that I never want to experience that again, so I'm not even tempted with smoking.  
Am I just going to have these random, feel it in my bones need for the rest of my life?  
Ugh.

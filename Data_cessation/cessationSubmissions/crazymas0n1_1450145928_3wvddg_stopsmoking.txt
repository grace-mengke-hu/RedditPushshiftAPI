19 days baby!

I've been a hardcore smoker for 17 years. I know it's not popular on these forums but vaping has been amazing for me. I'm on 6 mg Vape and only vaping when I have hard cravings. For me this has been a huge step in my life and I don't see myself ever smoking again!  I only need to tell myself two things, when around my smoking friends, "not a single puff", when by myself it's simple, "never buy any smokes". Easy as that!  I've saved a lot of money as smokes are $15 a pack in my province.

Fell off the wagon.

I was a little over a week clean. I felt better and was even a little happier.  Then I got in a small wreck and my stress sky rocketed. Though that's not what broke me. I'm a server and my nights at work can be very stressful. The other night a customer went off on me over something ridiculous. On top of that all my coworkers are very lazy. So naturally I start to cleanup after everyone and do my best for the restaurant. Then a bartender offered to go smoke and for some reason my will was gone. I broke after all the stress of the week and day of work. The best part is when I was smoking I didn't enjoy it.  I enjoyed the time outside rather then the actual smoking. 

Anyone have any tips to fight that craving in a stressful moment?

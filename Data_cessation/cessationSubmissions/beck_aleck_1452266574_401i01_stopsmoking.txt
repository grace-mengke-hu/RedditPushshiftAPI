day one...again

pack a day smoker for 7 years. and i really want to quit. so badly. tried to quit yesterday. went 12 hours without and then made the huge mistake of underestimating my anxiety. on the verge of tears, i bought a pack. smoked 1/3 of them while walking home, talking to my ma, generally feeling horrible about myself. 

then, after a lot of emotions, i lit one more cigarette and proceeded to break all the others in half and toss them away, one by one, each time saying something encouraging to myself.

"i dont smoke" *break*

"i will be happy without this" *break*

"i'm in control of me" *break*

"stop hurting yourself" *break*

and so on and so forth until the last 12 or so cigs were in the dumpster. 

felt good, if a little melodramatic, so i updated my blog with a long post, hugged my cats, took a deep breath and passed out hard.

woke up determined to kick the shit out of this addiction. but the biggest problem i'm facing is the ever-present creeping feeling that 'something' is missing. like i'm just not whole and i cant have the thing that will make me feel that way. 

but i just keep repeating: 

"stop hurting yourself, you are in control"

and pop a piece of trident and sip my water and force myself to smile. 

hopefully i will make today the day i mark every year for the rest of my life as the day i found my strength. so glad i have communities like this one to keep me honest. 

fingers crossed :)

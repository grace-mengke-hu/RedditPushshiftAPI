Funk Checking In! 4 weeks tomorrow.

3 weeks and 6 days today; tobacco free, no cheaty. 



My advice after getting this far is to want it. Really want to quit. And also, don't smoke. Day 1 sucked, plan for a suck day, don't work, just sweat in bed and watch movies. You are going to twitch, live with it.  Have a good friend around to support you and bring you water.  Day 2 half sucked, eat a lot and watch movies. Day 3, you are done. Imagine that a crappy 3 days, and you are done. 



Consider real strife.



You are done.

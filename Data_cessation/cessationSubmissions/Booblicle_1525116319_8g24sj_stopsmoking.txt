What's that smell?

It's been quite a while since I've quit those sticks. 4 years and half years I think.  I don't even think about them anymore, or even my sense of smell most of the time ( though I do love the smell of many things! ) But I still live with smokers and deal with the oders particularly when they are smoking near me. 

Cigarettes have multiple oders and smells, depending on brand, distance, and of course substances within. Most smokers rarely notice these smells, and even new quitters only identify it as "cigarette" and usually with a sense of desire.

Well, today gave me a suprise. I was sitting around browsing my phone when i started to smell something in the background. And I could not immediately identify it. It sure smelled familiar though. I looked around but saw nothing that would carry an oder. 

Then I figured it out. Someone came down with a lit cigarette,  and went back up. It was only the second time that it was strong enough to carry the sickly grossness with it.

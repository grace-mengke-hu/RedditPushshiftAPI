Ready to quit .

I'm a young mother mid 20s with two beautiful daughter's that I love more then anything . I know I can quit smoking as I quit cold turkey when I was pregnant  ( still kicking myself for starting again ) but it is what it is...but lately I've been feeling strongly motivated to over come this awful addiction for my daughters and for the sake of my own well being . Finished my last ciggerette a couple hours ago . Here's to never giving up  
I can't wait for the day I can say I've been 1 year smoke free and counting.  
Wish me luck !!

Occasional smoker with no *physical* addiction can't seem to stop smoking. Any help? Advice?

To be clear, I've been an on and off smoker since around 2010. I've had periods where I was full-on addicted, but those were usually no more than a month long and were spaced out by periods of little to no tobacco use.

Basically, I've been trying to quit ever since I started smoking, with mixed results. My problem is that I'll quit, and I won't buy any packs or anything, but then my good friends will come over and we'll get drunk and eventually someone has a smoke and I want one. That one turns to another and then another and eventually I buy my own pack and I'm back on the train.

The real issue here is that after I quit, I can't seem to stay quit for long. I always tell myself that I can't have even one cigarette; deep down I really know it to be true because one ciggy always leads to infinity more. I just can't seem to really get it to sink in; I can't seem to stop convincing myself that I'm 'over it' and I can just smoke one and be fine.

Have any of you had this problem and gotten over it? I truly hate smoking but I can't stop and I really need some help.

Thanks a lot :)

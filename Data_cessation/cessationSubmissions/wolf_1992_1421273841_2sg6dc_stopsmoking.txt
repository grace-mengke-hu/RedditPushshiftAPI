Relapsing after quitting with alan carr a year ago... help!!

Hi there. So I quit in january last year using allen carr's easyway. I didn't touch a cigarette for eight months until I suffered some personal issues and found my self smoking again. I've tried to re-use easyway but it hasn't stuck - I've tried three or four times and I'm back on 20 a day. Do any of you have any advice/help? I've also tried with willpower, telling myself it's all in my hands and it's easy etc but I crack after a day or two. Anyway, just seeing if you guys had any input?

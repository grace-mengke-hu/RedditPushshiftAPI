Desperate to quit. Struggling to quit. Hating myself.

I am stuck in a cycle of stress and smoking. I want to quit so badly. But have so much stress in my life its nearly impossible to stop. 

I just wish I could be locked in a room for a month with my xbox and food slid under the door to me.

I hate myself for how i fail at quitting. Don't even enjoy those shitty cigarettes.

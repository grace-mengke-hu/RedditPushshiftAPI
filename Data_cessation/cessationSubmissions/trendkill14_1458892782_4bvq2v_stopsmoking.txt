WARRIORS!

I'm not sorry for the spam. We are all warriors. QUIT! It's a fucking joke. Just fucking do it. Any excuse you make - fuck it. Accept what has happened, and CHANGE IT. No more excuses. Quit; be done with it, and move on. I know I have, and I would be more than happy to do whatever it takes to help any of you guys to do the same. GL :)

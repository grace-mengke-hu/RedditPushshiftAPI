Decided to quit

Yesterday I decided to quit smoking for the xxxxth time. 
I had 4 cigarettes left by today and I smoked them during the morning. However, by mid-afternoon, I was so on edge that I bought a pack. Obviously I'm disappointed but I'm not gonna give up. This is the last one I'll ever buy. So my quitting date will be the day after tomorrow.
I was wondering if some of you here that managed to quit could share a few tips that helped you, I would appreciate it a lot !

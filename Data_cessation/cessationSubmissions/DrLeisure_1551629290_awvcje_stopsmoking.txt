Bought my first Juul. Have they people who made these never smoked a cigarette?

I bought it to try and quit smoking, but the flavor is so weak, it is not a good substitute. Why can’t they make one that actually tastes a little more like a real cigarette? I mean I know it can’t be perfect, but it’s not even close.

Anyone else experienced this?

I've been smoking for a couple of years now and i've had major problems quitting before. Now im excactly 2 days 4 hours without a cigarette now and i havn't felt the urge to have one yet, it's been quite the opposite actually. Is this something someone else has experienced?

I’ve smoked many cigarettes and spliffs for 7 months. Im 16 and intend on quitting both smoking cigarettes and smoking weed since I abused both. How severely will I be impacted in life?

Ive vaped, smoked, and dabbed multiple times a day for about 7 months now. I’ve tried to quit before but temptations were stronger than my measly attempts at quitting. Smoking isn’t for everyone I guess and though I do love it I can probably quit if I find a distraction. But I’ve but my brain (and lungs) through a lot, especially this summer. Im 16 and I want to know if im going to be heavily effected throughout my life because of this rough phase of mine. If anyone has any stories on how they quit too that’d be great.

Day 50! Kinda feel like I'm cheating with my vape though...

Yep. 50 days without a cigarette. Feels pretty good, not as exciting as day 4 or 8, but it's nice. Been vaping regularly through the whole process and it feels kinda cheap? I'm on 6mg of nicotine, any thoughts on the best timeframe for dropping down to 3, then 0?

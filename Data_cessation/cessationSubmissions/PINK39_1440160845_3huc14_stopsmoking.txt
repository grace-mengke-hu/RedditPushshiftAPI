Hello everyone. Today is day 7 for me. I do use the patch and smoke a vape pen with 0 nicotine juice. I pray i don't go back to smoking and very challenging because i work at a gas station and sell ALOT of cigarettes everyday but also motivate other people to quit and tell everyone i can how many days i haven't smoked. A site like this really helped alot the last time i quit so i hope this one does as well. Willing to text a quitter for even more support. Thank you all in advance for your help and motivation. We can do this!!!

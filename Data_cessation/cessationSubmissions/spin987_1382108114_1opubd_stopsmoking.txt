Quit for over a month, now I'm having uncomfortable dreams. Advice/encouragement?

I quit over a month ago, cold turkey using Allenn Carr's book.  I've been good for a while, but for the past few days in my dreams I've been relapsing.  Like during my dream I'll have one cigarette, then feel ashamed about my weakness.  That shame carries over to the waking world and it is really making me uncomfortable.

Have any of you experienced this?  Will these dreams/worries about relapsing pass?

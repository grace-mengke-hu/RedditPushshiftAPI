Today is day 1.

I had my last smoke yesterday. In the last couple of months I have tried quitting multiple times, but in the last two weeks or so I've seen a change when I smoke. I no longer enjoy the taste or the feel that I get. In fact I've had just two or three puffs and became disgusted and put it out. I'm confident that this will be my last time. Wish me luck. :)

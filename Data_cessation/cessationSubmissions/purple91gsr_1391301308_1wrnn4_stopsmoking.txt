$14.30 per day, $100 a week, $5200 a year

As some of you may know, cigarettes are as dear as poison (pun intended) in Australia, and the government plans to increase taxes dramatically over the next few years.
Smoking 20 a day, I've been spending around $100 a week on this things. I'm a week into the Champix, and plan on dropping them next week. The money is not the only factor here of course, I'm 28, smoked half my life (yeah, I know), terribly unfit, and have 2 kids to see grow up. Money is a very helpful motivator for me though, at the end of the day, it's right there in front of you, easier to see than me on my death bed with my kids crying next to me. 
I plan on getting a lot more physical and trying to build up my fitness level, but along with that I will be transferring that $14.30 into my savings account each night after not smoking. Let's watch it grow!

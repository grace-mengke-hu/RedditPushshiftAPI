Looking for Participants to test a new quit Smoking Intervention.

I am seeking volunteers to participate in an experiment testing a new computer-based (inhibition) training method to reduce cigarette consumption. Participation is entirely online and takes 5-10 minutes a day for seven days. Y

ou are required to be over 18, have access to an internet-connected PC or Laptop (as the training task requires the use of a keyboard) and to currently smoke or use an e-cigarette once a day.

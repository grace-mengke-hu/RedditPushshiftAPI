I Fucked Up. Twice!

So I was chugging along happily with no real problems at all, and then after 5.5 months quit I decided whilst really drunk that I was going to have a cigarette. Incidentally it's the first time I've been back to that pub since this time last year where I also failed a quit. Guess that gave me an unexpected trigger that I was far too drunk to deal with. I didn't expect it.

Anyway, I smoked a cigarette (maybe a couple more, I don't remember) and had one toke on a spliff with tobacco in it. I didn't buy a pack and I didn't smoke for the next 10 days. Thought I'd got away with it. Then 3 days ago at my friend's house I ended up having a few tokes of a spliff with tobacco in. It didn't feel good and it confirmed I didn't want to smoke but I have no idea why I did it. 

Sorry for the ramble, I think I just need to express it all out somewhere to reaffirm my decision to quit. I've reset the badge. Let's go again.

TL;DR: Always be vigilant, learn from my mistakes.

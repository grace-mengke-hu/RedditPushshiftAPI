1 week and 2 days quit! Not feeling great.

So I’m feeling good about myself for having quit. But physically not so much. I’ve developed a “hairy tongue” which really sucks. It’s always some orange or green colour and it’s really hard to get clean. And also I dunno what it is but I would say just below my kidneys I feel like I have a swollen organ or something near my back left side. Anyone else have similar side effect when quitting or any other problems occur?

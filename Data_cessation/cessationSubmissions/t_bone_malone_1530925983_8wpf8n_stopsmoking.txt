Never thought I'd get here

Today marks 30 days smoke free for me. I smoked almost a pack a day for about 15 years and this is the absolute longest I've gone without having a cigarette.
My coworkers gave me a little congrats gift of candy and mints. Made me tear up :) 
Also I love this subreddit, I love reading all the encouragement in here!
We can do it!

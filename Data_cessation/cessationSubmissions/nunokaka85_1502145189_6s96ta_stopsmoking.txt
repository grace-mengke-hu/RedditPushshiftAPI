I've tried...

(This may be a long post, but bear with me.)

I've tried. I am 21 years old, and I have been smoking a pack (20 cancer sticks) since I was 13. It started just for fun, so I could hangout with the "big people". Smoking one in a day turned into smoking one more hidden at home. That then went into smoking one more at my room. At this point, everything I do I need  to smoke:

When I wake up, I smoke one before bath time. When I drive to work, I smoke one (or two) on the way. When I arrive work I smoke another one while drinking a coffee. And on and on. 

I feel I can't do this, I just finished smoking one and I feel bad about it. I always get so hyped and motivated when I decide to stop smoking, but then I just do it again. I would really just like to have the mentality to quit.

Made it past 100 days!

Man i made it to and past 100 days and i did not even realized till i checked my stop smoking app. I have been having a lot of cravings since my best friend came into town. We would sit for hours and talk, drink and smoke. We still drink and talk but it is hard to say no to the smoking. But it is half way through his visit and still not a single puff. I am proud of my self. I will be at 4 months in about 2 weeks. I got this!

26 hours in and surprised....

This quit has been totally different than the rest of my quits, I'm eating less than when I was smoking, No real withdrawals, sure I think about having one here and there but the thought disappears pretty quickly. So I think this quit will be successful!

One question though, how long does it take before pooping becomes regular again?

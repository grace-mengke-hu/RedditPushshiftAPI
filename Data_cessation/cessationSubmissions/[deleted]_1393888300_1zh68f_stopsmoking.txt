Does anyone here dream about smoking?

Hey everyone.  So I finally managed to quit smoking after 5 years of daily consumption, some times really bad, other times not so bad.  It's been two weeks since my last cig and I finally feel good about this attempt this time.  I truly don't feel the need or desire to smoke.  It's great.

Anyway, for the past few days especially I have been having these bizarre dreams.  The ones I remember involve people from high school, from over five years ago, people I haven't thought about in ages.  So much so that I can't even remember their names in my dreams!  Trying to remember their names becomes part of the tension of the dream, so to speak.

Also involved is tobacco.  Last night, for example, my office supervisor (who doesn't smoke, or at least only has like one cigarette when he is drinking) offered me a cigarette in my dream; up until that point I hadn't been wanting one.  A few nights ago I had a dream where I was seemingly chain smoking, and toward the end of the dream I was overcome with this immense guilt about breaking my streak.  I had been justifying it to myself as "just one won't hurt" for most of the dream, but then I became really guilty.

So, I guess I was wondering what others' experiences are with dreams and quitting tobacco.  These dreams don't make me want to smoke, but they certainly are amusing and interesting to me.  What are y'all's experiences?

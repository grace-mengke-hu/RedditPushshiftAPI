Any Tips?

I have been smoke free for 5 days now. I have quit drinking any alcohol as they go hand in hand for me. I am heading to Europe next week and would love to enjoy a drink or two but I am really nervous. It is worth having one? Any tips on ways to cope with the cravings when drinking (for some reason they are stronger for me then)?

7 Days!!!!!!

Guys!!!! at 7PM tonight I will have been a non-smoker for one whole week!!

Mentally, I do feel a bit saner (minus the road rage this morning but we're not talking about that)

I have a major headache but I'll take that over the anxiety and psychosis. I'm still waking up much easier and it's nice to know that this winter I won't have to be out in the cold looking at my boyfriend with sad eyes smoking while he's warm drinking hot cocoa inside!

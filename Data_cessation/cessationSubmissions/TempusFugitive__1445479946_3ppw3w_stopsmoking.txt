Badge reset submitted

Unfortunately my 5 star doesn't count as I slipped at 144 days. Just didn't get around to resetting. Just submitted my new quit day (today)

I'm very disappointed in breaking my streak but I'm not going to beat myself up too bad about it - I'd rather channel my strength toward picking myself back up. It was a stupid thing to do and I'm ready to face my demon again. This time I'll be better.

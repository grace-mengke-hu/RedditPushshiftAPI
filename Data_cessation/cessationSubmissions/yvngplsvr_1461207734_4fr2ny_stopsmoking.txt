I think I just made the decision, someone help

I'm 18 years old. I picked up my first cigarette at probably 13-14, fell in love, smoked around 2 cigs a week for a year or so, went to rehab for drug use and went from a cig a week to a cig a day, then hit a pack a day within a month. I still remember my first day being physically addicted. I opened my eyes at my friends house and everything was blurry. I assumed I needed to blink more, that didn't help, so I sucked down a parliament full flavor, and magically, I felt better. I *really* smoked for about 2-3 years, at minimum a little above a pack a day and at maximum 3-4 packs a day. Everyone around me smoked in rehab, seriously, everyone. Including the counsellors and owner, who praised smoking as a godsend. In the past 2 years the longest I went without a cigarette was 15 hours during which I was asleep. 

I've been out of rehab for ~4 months. I've quit drugs much harder than nicotine, at least legally "harder". I cold turkeyed klonapin, opiates, and a nasty research chemical with similar effects to MDMA but an addiction profile similar to cocaine. I didn't relapse once. Still haven't. 

I know I can quit this shit if I can quit that shit, but the difference I'm terrified of is how much of smoking is "part of me". I know I won't know what to do with my hands, I know I'll be very angry, but my drug use was for fun, whereas cigarettes are built into my sense of self. 

Anyone know how this feels? 

Also, I should have done this before I turned 18 when I couldn't buy a pack whenever I wanted. 

Advice is more than welcome, and support/really anything is also more than welcome. 

Thanks guys!

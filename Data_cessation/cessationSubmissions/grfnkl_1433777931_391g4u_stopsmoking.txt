quit for 6 months, smoked half a pack this weekend, got sick. do i need to reset the quit-clock?

so i quit during the christmas holidays since i got really sick then and it was a great opportunity to get over the first 3 days when i could barely get out of bed. it almost didn't matter, since the urge barely died down in the 6(ish) month span. if anything, it got worse, obviously. i didn't even have a bad day or anything, i had just really wanted to see what the reaction would be/wanted to smoke. i went to a different convenience store than normal (the workers at my closest store all knew i quit and said they'd never sell me cigarettes again) and got a pack. every cigarette was awful. i thought i had missed the morning smoke, and every day really was a struggle to avoid thinking about it, but having it sunday morning, it was atrocious. i got sick, it was hard to inhale, and it felt foreign in my hand, even though having it in my hand was the thing i craved more than anything. 

so basically, i wanted to gauge strangers opinions on if, after 11 cigarettes and a bad enough reaction to really cement the virtue in my initial choice and effort to quit, do i have to pretend i'm back at day one? or can i wait the 3 days for the nicotine to leave my system and pretend the whole thing never happened? any advice or opinion is appreciated 

tl;dr: quit for 6 months, had a few, but don't want to think of this as starting from square 1. is it?

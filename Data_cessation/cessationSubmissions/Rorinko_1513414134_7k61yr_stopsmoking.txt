Smoker, again.

My english is probably gonna be terrible but i wanna to share this. 13 month ago i quit smoking, before that moment i was smoking 1 pack per day in 8 years, but 3 months ago i had a really shitty day and i was like alright i feel so bad maybe a cig will do something good and there is no way i will be smoker again, right? No, FUCKING NOT RIGHT GUYS, it was the starter day and im a smoker again for 3 month. Tomorrow is gonna be my birthday and you know what, it was amazing year when i quit smoking and lost 140 lbs, i want to keep all this stuff. For now its 30 hours since im a non smoker and its gonna be for my whole life, lesson has been learned, not a single puf EVER AGAIN, dont do it guys even if you quit long time ago

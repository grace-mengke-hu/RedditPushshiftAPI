(NSFW) My willy works so much better

By gawd, I was starting to get worried. I could’ve had a pornstar begging me for a good dickin’ and this thing would flop out like a limp noodle. I was beginning to think I was having anxiety or worse, ED at a young age. I had to beat this soft fucker up like it owed me money to even get into half-chub territory.

Turns out, smoking a pack a day was responsible for that depressing, shriveled atrocity I had to call my penis. Every time I looked down, I imagined my dick was staring into the shadow of the glorious knob it once was.

Two days into quitting, it is no longer remotely an issue. I’m sorry for oversharing, but I’m fucking stoked about it. It is amazing how quickly the rewards start flowing in from just a few days of effort. I don’t smell like an ash tray, I can now detect when other people smell like an ash tray, shit tastes better, my feet are no longer constantly cold, and the mayonnaise-shooting python of love is perky again. 

Stick to your guns folks, smoking is not even remotely worth losing out on so much.

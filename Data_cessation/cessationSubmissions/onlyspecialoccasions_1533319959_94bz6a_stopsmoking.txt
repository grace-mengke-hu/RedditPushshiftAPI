you guys are all I got, thanks for the support

I keep telling my SO, family, and friends about how many hours nicotine free I am. which is at 60 hours by the way. I'm super proud of myself, but none of them understand how much of an accomplishment this is for me. It is just thrown under the rug. so I thought maybe you ex/smokers would understand and give me acknowledgment I'm fishing for.
 I've taken chantix for 9 days now and can't take it anymore due to underlying heart conditions. as soon as i upped the dose my heart said no. kinda nervous to stop, but still committed to being nicotine free.

24 hours without a cigarette and going crazy.

I'm posting here to find some help with quitting.  I've quit many times and many different ways but always for the wrong reasons.  Yesterday I just decided enough was enough, but even with nicorette I'm having serious panic moments, especially right around the times I used to take breaks at work.  Does anyone have any advice on what to do to relax.  The Nicorette is supposed to help with the nicotine cravings, but what about the routine of it all?

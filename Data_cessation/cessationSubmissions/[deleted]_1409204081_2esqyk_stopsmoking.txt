I've been smoking for 30 years. Today is day 2 of not smoking.

so far a little rough, but not too bad. using the patch & an e-cig as a crutch when cravings are hard. I've quit a few times, the longest before was 1 year. I'm 40 years old & started when I was 9-10ish. smoking has been in my life for 3/4 of it & surrounded by it before I started stealing my old mans smokes @ the ripe age of 9. just looking for positive support...
edit; start of day4!

I need help!!!

So I am 26 and have been smoking for 2 years.  I work in hospice and see lung cancer everyday, so this should be my motivation.  Also, both of my grandparents passed away because of COPD.  

I have tried to quit but my urges and terrible.  I wake up in the morning and take my dog for a walk and light up while watching her.  I get bored and have nothing to do so I light up.  

I am not one for exercising so that is not an option.  What are some other ways to stop smoking?

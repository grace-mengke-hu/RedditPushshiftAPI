44 Days. My words of encouragement.

I had no choice but to stop smoking, I am 31 years old, and I'm getting dental implant surgery due to a shitty kisser busting out my front tooth. The first round of surgery failed. I didn't smoke through the first few weeks of healing and then started back up again. It ruined my implant and gave me an infection in my bone. This time around I've been told over and over again that I can't smoke, not even one. And I haven't. I had no choice. 

I have the e-cig. I've used it, generally when drunk. Its not even satisfying. 

These pangs, the anxiety, the anger, the physical pain... its all temporary. YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT. A moment, hell a DAY of physical or mental discomfort is worth you being able to breathe in your 50's. It's worth you being able to watch your kids grow up. It's worth you saying "I quit smoking". Because it's hard, and you kick serious ass, and you are so goddamn strong. 

Keep it going guys. I intend to.

Going strong!

I have been rocking the quit smoking thing and it really surprises me!  I have smoked for a very long time. And have tried to quit many times. I feel good about this quit more than any others.  I can clearly see it takes so much for energy and time to smoke.  Within 3-4 day that constant voice in my head disappeared. When smoking you are always thinking about smoking. When can I smoke again , where, sneaking around.  You don't look forward to wonderful things because you are worried it will be too long until ur next cig. No more I tell you! It's very freeing:). Best wishes to all of you I am on 2 weeks and it keeps getting better

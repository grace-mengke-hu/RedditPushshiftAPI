Day 1 today...

I smoked my last cig last night.  I've been smoking about half a pack a day for 14 years.  It's gonna be tough but I'm focused on bettering my health.  I'm looking forward to better sleep, better workouts, and feeling overall better...no more sore throats, winded stair climbs, and morning retching coughs.

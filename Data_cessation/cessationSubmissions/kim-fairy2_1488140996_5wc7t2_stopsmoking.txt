Need some advice on cutting back on nicotine

I've been quitting sinds februari 12 and it's going good, I still smoke 1 per day on average, but hey nobody's perfect.

I use nicotine patches, the ones that are 14 mg (so, step 2). They work fine. 

But I'm kinda wondering where to go from there: do I cut back from the nicotine slowly (go to step 3, maybe cut the patches in half etc.) or go cold turkey with the patches?

On one hand, if I cut back slowly, my body may have time to adjust. On the other hand, if I go cold turkey, itll be out of my system in like one, two days tops.

Who has experience with this? Which one is the best approach?

Thanks folks! Good luck :)

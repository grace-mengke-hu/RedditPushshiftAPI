Update #5 - May 16 quit date

The cravings are still annoying but not as much as day 2 and day 3. Overall though I feel down. I really don’t know why cause life is okay-ish but it’s kinda like I can’t feel happiness. 

Scored a 140 bowling which is probably one of my highest scores ever but I don’t seem to enjoy it. That was just one of the things. It feels like I’ll never be happy again. Am I going into depression ? 

I mean I haven’t smoked in 6 days but I just cannot find a reason to be happy. It is an accomplishment in my eyes to be honest but I just don’t feel the “fuck yes” and I can’t understand why. 

Literally feels like smoking is happiness which I know isn’t true. Have you cold turkey quitters felt this way ? 

I would appreciate any guidance cause I firmly believe all of this all of what I’m going through right now is because of stopping cigarettes.

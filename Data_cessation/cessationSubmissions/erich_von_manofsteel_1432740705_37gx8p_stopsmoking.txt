One week and counting!

Its been 8 days since I last smoked a cigarette. Read Allen Carr and decided to quit cold turkey.

Honestly, its been easier than I thought it would be. Although I only smoked about half a pack each day, I haven't had absolutely terrible cravings where I wanted to kill myself like I thought I would. The cravings seem to be getting lesser and much more manageable each passing day. And I remind myself I am not giving up on anything, I am not missing out on anything.

The only hard part has been when drinking. I try to stuff myself with salted peanuts, spicy peanuts, wasabi peanuts and whatnot to get over that. What makes it that much harder is everyone around me smokes when they drink. Anyone has any ideas how to get over the need to smoke when drinking?

Thanks a lot for all your inspiring stories that helped motivate me to quit. And those still mulling over whether to take the leap, you might just find it much less harder than you think it is.

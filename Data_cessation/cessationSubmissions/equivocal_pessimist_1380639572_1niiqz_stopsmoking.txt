1 month * milestone reached: Progress Report

Hi /r/stopsmoking 

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge this subreddit's continuous support that was instrumental in my making it this far. You guys are great.

Secondly, I would like to share some of my experiences over the past few weeks since I quit:

* Sense of taste and smell never been better. Munching on mints all the time (I can even tell the diff mint flavors apart)
* Huge increase in appetite. Have gained a few kilos
* Been coughing black phlegm (esp in the morning)
* Am able to run much more and for longer duration than before

I've been using nicotine gums, but I'm slowly weaning myself away from them. Replacing them with mints.

I hope I keep remaining strong and never have the next cigarette again. I also with newbie quitter best of luck and implore them to use this subreddit to the fullest in their struggle to stop smoking.

Thanks, that is all.

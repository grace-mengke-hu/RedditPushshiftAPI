Aunt's dog has lung cancer

 ^(long time lurker first time poster)

I quit on my 22 birthday and have been keeping it up ever since, six days going strong.

I'm currently in the middle of a 3 week west coast travel, and have been crashing at family and friend's houses (none of whom even knew I ever smoked, I've always been a low key 0-3 a day smoker.)  I'm currently at my aunts house and today before I was going to head to my next destination, my aunt got a call saying her 10 year old dog had lung cancer (my aunt doesn't smoke.)

Now I don't believe in a higher power or anything, but this seemed like a little sign to keep this non smoking thing going.  They will put the dog down soon, RIP Cooper.

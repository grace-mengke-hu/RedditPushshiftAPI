Day 127 and had a great reward today-- a glimpse of what I quit doing.

I quit in early December.  I have had the typical struggles, especially for the first couple of weeks and then another really tough period around the 80-90 day mark.  Lately I haven't thought about it much at all.  I can honestly say that I haven't considered a cigarette or had the thought of one in weeks.

I spent the last few days in a continuing education course with 50 other people in my profession.  The first day was mostly going through material, and the next day we started breaking off into groups and doing some exercises.  I was in a group with a girl from my company and a girl from another city, different company.  We didn't know her.  Well, every time there was an opportunity, this girl found a reason to go outside.  She had to make a call.  She had to get something from her car.  From 9 to 5 this chick focused on ways to go outside and smoke.    All.  Day.  Long.  She didn't miss a single opportunity to go outside "to take a call" when there was a half a minute of not being completely engaged, and a couple of times she went when we really needed her to be present and not slipping off for 5 minutes.  I immediately suspected she was a smoker, and very soon after the first trip outside I caught a whiff of it on her which confirmed what I already understood.

Six months ago it would've been so hard for me to go through this training for three days.  And I was so ashamed of my smoking that I went to great lengths to hide it from my colleagues.  I probably wouldn't even have signed up for the course, honestly.  I'm so glad that I was able to be free of that today.  

If you're still in the earlier days where you're still constantly battling the voice of the addiction in your head, hold on.  This temporary discomfort is going to spare you a LOT MORE future discomfort!

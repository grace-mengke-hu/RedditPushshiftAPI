Stopped after 13 years!

I stopped smoking after 13 years. It was a bad decision to try when I was only 13. :(
Terrible to confirm that I smoked for half my life! :/ This is not my first attempt, but now I have more willpower to do it then I had in the past! Smoke free since 13 days! :)

Does anybody know any tobacco replacement for consuming maryjane?

Aaaaand: My first ever post to Reddit! :)

I just give up cold turkey and can stay off the cigs for as long as I want with no real bad cravings until I have a drink.

If I go out with friends, it justs goes hand in hand. One time ever I have survived going out drinking and not smoking, and that is when I use an e-cig. Any tips of how to stop this cycle of failure? I stayed off the booze for three months last year and didn't smoked once.

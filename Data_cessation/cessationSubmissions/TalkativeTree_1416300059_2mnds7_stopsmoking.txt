Missed my 2 years by 2 days

I'll be honest guys and gals. The last probably 300 days I've thought about smoking at least every other day. I would have broken on day 500 to celebrate, but when I went to look at my day count ot was 499. Numbers provide both a great excuse to relapse as well as continue on. The thing to take away is that whether or mot you want to smoke, that doesnt matter. What matters is the choice you've committed to. Also recognize the reason for your desire to smoke. Let go of those reason. Dont fight them, let them go and become bigger than them. Especially of they're self destructive in nature. Best of luck everyone!

Fear of losing friends while quitting

I'm sure something like this has been posted here before, but I'll just share my problem with you.
I'm 18 years old and I've been smoking for 3 years now. I always was the 'geek kid' with little to no friends at school, but when I was fifteen, I started to meet some people who where not from my school. I started socializing with them, (pretty much the first time in my life I made real friends). I started to listen to their music (Metal, Punk, Oi), go to concerts and festivals with them, and, of course, started smoking like them. This success in making friends lead to a huge boost of self-confidence for me, and I got so much more friends even from my school just because of how self-confident I was.

I think that bound 'smoking' to 'being cool and having friends'. I want to stop. But I'm afraid that I'll loose my old friends who all smoke. I'm afraid they'll think of me as the geek I was before.
Has anyone made a similar experience?

I was able to convince myself to quit smoking yesterday by telling myself that I would stop buying packs as a start. Does anyone have any inspiring success stories from using this method? Or am I going to feel too annoying and shitty asking to bum from friends to keep it up?

I know that my willpower isn't that strong, at least right now. I could build it up by bumming from friends once in a while, while never smoking in between by myself- I smoke the most when I'm by myself. But I also start to feel like a piece of shit pretty fast when it comes to being a shitty friend. I'm cradling myself in bed right now, thinking oh my sweet fucking God someone break down the door and shove a bogie in your boy's face

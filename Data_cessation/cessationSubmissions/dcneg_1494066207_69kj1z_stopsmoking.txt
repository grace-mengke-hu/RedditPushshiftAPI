Other people smoke

So hi guys i, just awake up so sorry if my writting sucks...It's like this i am 19 years and i've smoked since im 14 i want to stop but all my friends smoke i mean ALL , i haven t smoked in 15 days but i feel like after being a night with them i kinda feel Hangover from nicotine , i'm i the only one?
Basicly:The passive smoke makes me feel Hangover and makes a strange feeling in my lungs like i can t breath like a could the day before.

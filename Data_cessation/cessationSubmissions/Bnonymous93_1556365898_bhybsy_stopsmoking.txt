Swollen brow??????

So I quit smoking a little more than a month ago.  I’d been smoking a pack a day for about 10 years. In all honesty it wasn’t nearly as difficult as I thought it would be asides from some serious on and off irritability the first and second week. I’m not experiencing any real symptoms anymore except this really weird one I can’t find anything about. My brow is swollen in sort of a Neanderthal looking way. I feel a little bit of pressure in my sinuses but nothing that could be considered a sinus headache. Was just wondering if anyone had some insight or similar experiences.

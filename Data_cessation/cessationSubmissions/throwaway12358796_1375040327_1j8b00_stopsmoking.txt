Is a joint okay?

It's been 1 week ive stopped smoking tobacco (yay), during the 2 years ive smoked tobacco i also occasionnaly used weed.

Today a friend asked me if i wanted to come by his place tomorrow to smoke a joint (marijuana only). 

I know there's no nicotine in marijuana but i don't know if it'd be okay to smoke that joint and if it wouldnt eff up my will to quit.

Advice anyone?

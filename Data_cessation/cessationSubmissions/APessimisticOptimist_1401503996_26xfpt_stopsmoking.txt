I recently read Allen Carr's book. I would like some clarification.

First, let me say the book was far better than I had expected. I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth reading, but this subreddit has recommended it so many times. I decided to try it with an open mind. I was impressed.

In one section, he talks about cutting back. He said this uses willpower until you're able to end the "need" for a cigarette. I'm not saying he is wrong, but if looked at from a different perspective, I feel like cutting back could be helpful if the smoker gets used to it. 

For example, I smoked about a pack per day. That's what I was used to. I was used to ~20 cigarettes everyday. If I decided to cut back to 10, I understand that uses willpower, but only until I'm used to smoking 10 per day. 10 per day will eventually become normal like 20 was. Then 5, then 3, etc until I decide to go to 0. It would be much easier to go from 3 to 0 rather than 20 to 0.

I understand I could be entirely wrong. I accept that. But if I am, could someone please explain why?

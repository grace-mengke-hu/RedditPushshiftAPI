Hey crew, I noticed that a lot of people posting don't have badges. You all deserve this badge of honor for stopping smoking. It is a hard thing to do, but you do it because it will make your life better. It will. Remember all "NOPE: not one puff ever" "a puff away from a pack a day". Cigarettes are good but a healthy life is better. I smoked for 10 years, which is not a lot compared to some people but given the huge amount of information declaring that cigarettes will kill you - I think 10 years is pretty impressive. I love you all. External locus of control.

Quitting's easy. I've quit dozens of times. Question about medicine

I'm a 30 year old man and I've been smoking since I was about 18. I've never been a heavy smoker, at my absolute worst maybe a pack every week or so. Regardless, I. Cannot. Quit. I have managed to stay quit for ~1 year a few times, and I've cut way back (only smoke 3 a day now) but I keep coming back to it. My doctor asked me at my last physical if I wanted to give Chantix a shot and I turned him down. Tomorrow I'm going back and I'm almost willing to give it a whirl. Any horror stories about it?

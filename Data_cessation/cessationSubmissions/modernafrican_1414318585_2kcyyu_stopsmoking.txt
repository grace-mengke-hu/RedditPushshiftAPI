A year ago i quit smoking, today i finished a marathon!

Hello everyone. Long time lurker here. Last year i reached the point where i really didn't like what i was becoming so i made decision that i would loose weight, stop drinking so much and most importantly stop smoking. 

It was hard, i had been smoking since i was 16 (i was 24 and doing at least 5 packs a week when i made the decision to stop) and goodness knows how many times i walked into a newsagents or shop with the intention of buying cigarettes and convincing myself to walk out. 

Today i am 20 kgs lighter, i drink socially not to get drunk,I HAVEN'T HAD A CIGARETTE IN YEAR, and I finished a marathon.

I just wanted to say thanks, and that you can do it however hard and impossible it seems. I don't post much but its nice reading your posts and seeing your progress and knowing you are going through the same things.

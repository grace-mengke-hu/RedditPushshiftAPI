Smoking again after 48 days quit

It was going so well. I was feeling great and was proud of myself that I'd made it to 48 days. 

I had been getting cravings for "just one" but I was ignoring those and managing pretty well. Then, last Tuesday, I had an awful day at work. Something happened with a project I'm working on that left me with that horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that happens when things go very wrong. I'm a reasonably anxoius person at times but one the way home, thinking about the work problem, I had a bit of an anxiety attack. 

I bought a pack, had two cigarettes!  Next day, I had 3.  4 days later and I'm on 10 a day it seems!!

I enjoyed being a non smoker. I'm going to have my "last one" now and destroy the pack but... Any advice??

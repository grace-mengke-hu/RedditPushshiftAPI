Resetting my clock...

On Sunday it would've been a full month. I was out celebrating my birthday and I bummed 2 cigarettes throughout the night. 

Not happy about it, but not discouraged either. 

Forgive yourself, if you slip up, and take on your commitment to live smoke free with that much more conviction!

Drinking/social life without smoking

I've not smoked for 4 months now. I started smoking really early - when I was 13 or 14, and I smoked on average 10-12 cigarettes a day for 11 years I'd say.

I'm 25 today. As you can see, I've been a smoker for all of my adult life and all of my teens. I am the definition of a social smoker since I can hardly remember what it's like to go out and meet friends/do social stuff without smoking. To my brain, being social involves smoking cigarettes. 

  
So now, going out with the sole purpose of being social - like going to a bar, going to a party, meeting friends in the park or whatever - it constantly feels like something is missing. So much that I can never really be fully present when I'm out. It feels like a chore to sit there with those people and sip my beer without smoking. Like I'm just waiting for the night to end, actually. It's not enjoyable or fun in any way. I have romantic memories about cigarettes and about the times where I could just let go, smoke and enjoy social gatherings.

Honestly, the worst part is that I feel like it will stay like this. Like being social will always be a chore, never something that feels good.

The only time that being social feels exciting is when it's revolved around something. Like a game of football or building something or whatever. And that's great - I'm trying to get involved in stuff like that more. But I miss being able to just meet up with friends, sit down and have a beer and chat without constantly thinking about how much it sucks that I'm not smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm alone, it's not a problem and I hardly ever think about smoking.

I guess I'm writing this to see if anyone else have had similar experiences, because I wonder if this will get better and if there are any tricks to overcome it

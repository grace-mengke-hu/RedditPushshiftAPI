I tried to quit today...

Quitting smoking is the hardest thing I've tried to do. Ive been smoking a pack a day for 11 years. I tried to quit today, made it through the morning without having but after about 5 hours I caved in. I'm going to try again tomorrow.  I want to beat this habit. It's killing me and I'm letting it.

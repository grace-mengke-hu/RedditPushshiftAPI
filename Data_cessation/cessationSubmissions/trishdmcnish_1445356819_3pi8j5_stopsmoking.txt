FFS

I'm in a bad fucking mood. I'm writing a paper with my ex-supervisor and she's sending me stupid e-mails all day asking questions about things I've already explained, in great detail, numerous times. She's mucking around with stuff and making a mess. My ex-coworker is nitpicking at my work and just generally being a pain in the ass. I'm doing this all FOR FREE. It's expected, and I signed on for it, but still, very, very fucking annoying.

I paid over $1400 to a backyard mechanic to fix my car, and I get it 20 minutes away and the thing basically fucking falls apart. So now I have to drive to the other end of the city for the 4th time to get him to un-fuck it up. Should have just paid a shop. Lesson learned.

I was working on a project at my current job for over an hour, frustrating, pain-staking work, and the server crashed and I couldn't recover my work.

I burnt my mouth on my soup.

It's one of those days. 

But.... I don't want to smoke. I'm not thinking "ugh I need a cigarette!" or having a craving at all, really. This is - really weird. Instead, I'm craving a good hard sprint on the treadmill, or taking it out on a punching bag, or driving really fast on the highway. Maybe kicking a baby (just kidding!). I'm also not craving a drink (which I gave up a month+ ago). I just... feel like a normal, irritated, pissed off office worker. And that feels FUCKING GREAT!

I didn't think this day would come, and I'm proceeding with cautious optimism, but I want you quitters to know that it DOES get better, and you CAN change the way your brain responds to stress - in ways that don't involve lighting up.

Here's to another week smoke-free! And a whole life without it :)

Cheers.

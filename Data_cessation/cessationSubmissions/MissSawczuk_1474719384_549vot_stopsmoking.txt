How do I get past the point of obsessively thinking about having a smoke?

Hello you lovely people! 

Yesterday, after a long talk with my best friend, I have decided to quit smoking after 6 years. I am a 22 year old female and I work as a Chef. I went from making 25g of tobacco last me a week to having to buy another pouch after 4 days... From 10 cigarettes a day to about 20. I'm saving to buy a house next year so I have spontaneously decided to quit cold turkey and haven't smoked since yesterday. However, the environment I work in is stressful and I'm used to having a cigarette break every hour or so. So between breaks I think about smoking whilst waiting for another break, but then obviously choose not to smoke. Will it get easier? How can I stop the temptation? So much easier when I'm at home!

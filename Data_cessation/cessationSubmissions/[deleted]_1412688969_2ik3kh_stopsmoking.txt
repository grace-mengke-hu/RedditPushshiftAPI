Social Smoker looking to quit.

I've been smoking somewhat socially for almost a year, and I'm at the point in which I'm looking to quit for a multitude of reasons. 


The first of which, being my girlfriend. Her grandfather died this year, was a pack-a-day smoker for over 50 years. I had always been up front with her that I smoked as a social tool, and she was okay with it, "as long as it wasn't around her", which I was more than fine abiding with. However since her grandfathers' death, she's been more sensitive to it, and while she did not feel comfortable imposing her will of asking me to stop all together, I felt that it was something very important to her that I did stop. 

However, while I have never felt a craving for a cigarette (I've stopped for months at a time), I simply enjoy smoking. With coffee, a break between uni classes, and especially when I'm drinking. Sometimes it just breaks up the monotony of studying, or just my day in general. 

I'm sure this is all standard for a lot of people, and I know that these probably lead to a dependance and addiction. I haven't reached that point, and I'm really trying to stop before I end up addicted. I DESPISE smelling like smoke, having the need to constantly wash my hands and chew gum in order to feel like I'm not a smoker. 

I would really love any kind of support or tips for avoiding social smoking, especially seeing as I am currently in the UK for a semester (an overwhelming amount of university kids smoke regularly), and quite a few of my friends smoke back home. It's moreso the social aspect of smoking I know that I'm going to miss the most, but it's a sacrifice I would really appreciate help with.

Thanks guys.

How bad are withdrawals after quitting smoking for a year?

So I switched to vaping recently to help me quit, but thinking of going to a 0mg nicotine juice tomorrow and riding it out “cold turkey”.

I’m wondering after smoking on and off for a year how bad I might possibly feel and if there’s any time frame for how long withdrawals last?

I’m also open to hitting the patches or something instead of the vape if that’s recommended around here?

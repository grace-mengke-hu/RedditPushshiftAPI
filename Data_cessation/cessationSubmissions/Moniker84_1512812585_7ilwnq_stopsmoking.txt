Random..

I'm having a hard time sleeping tonight.  I was just thinking and it randomly occurred to me that this is the first week in the 15 years my husband and I have been together that I did not have to put out money for cigarettes.
  
Every week like clockwork it was part of the budget.  EVERY SINGLE WEEK.  Above almost anything else,  a steady $40-$80 was ear marked for cigarettes.. Never fail.. The entire time we have been together. 

This is the very first time, that as I was dividing up for the bills, cigarettes was not part of it.  THIS IS FUCKING EPIC! 

I quit for good just about 2 months ago,  but it's been about 4 since I first began Quiting.  So it's been a minute since our normal $80 a week habit.  Even after I quit though hubs was still smoking.  It was disheartening to be working so hard myself and see him still smoke and spend money we don't have.  But I couldn't force him to do it..  So I patiently,  but mostly not so patiently,  waited for him to choose it for himself. 
He joined me as a non smoker officially 1 week ago today.  I am so proud,  and albeit begrudgingly,  he too is glad he quit. 

Christmas is always something I stress over.  Having 2 kids I am constantly trying to make it the best I can for them.  This year, along with the gift of non smoking parents,  my girls will have nearly $250 that we wouldn't have spent towards the holiday.  
That just adds so much more fuel to my burning desire to forever be smoke free. 

I was also thinking that between hubs and myself, we have about 40 years as smokers.  I just did some quick math in my head,  but that's like 14000+ days @ an average of $5 a day...  Damn near $75,000 in cigarette money...  Fuck that's a lot,  especially cause we have always pretty much struggled and had to budget every last penny.  75 THOUSAND dollars... 

But this week,  for the first of many weeks,  we did not spend one single penny on cigarettes!

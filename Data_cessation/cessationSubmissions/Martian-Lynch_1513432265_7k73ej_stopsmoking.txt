How should I approach talking to my spouse about quitting, when it seems like no matter how many times we talk about it she never makes even an attempt to stop.

My wife has been smoking for nearly 20 years at this point. She willl be 37 next year and it's now getting to the point where I'm getting mad at her internally about it. It's always something I've just accepted and not thought too much about the realities of it, but over the last year or two I'm starting to get angry about her lack of effort. She hasn't made an attempt to quit or even cutback in over a decade. The reality of the tens of thousands of dollars spent to kill her and leave me as a single father is Something I can't ignore any more. It's not fair, I know, but in my head it makes me really mad at her. If she showed some effort, anything whatsoever I'd be proud and supportive. 

I smoked. On and off. 2 years on, one year off. Stuff like that. It's now been nearly 3 years since I've smoked and I know I'm not going back. Before I was casual about it and I didn't have too hard of a time stopping. This last time it took me at least 4 months to start feeling better and that really solidified it for me that it's not something you can mess with.

I have understanding and am patient and can help her get through it, but I've always known if I ever harass her about it it will not help her quit. You have to do it on your own terms, but st this point I'm not sure that's coming any time soon. 

I'm not sure my question, but I guess I'm wondering if anyone began quitting based on help from others?

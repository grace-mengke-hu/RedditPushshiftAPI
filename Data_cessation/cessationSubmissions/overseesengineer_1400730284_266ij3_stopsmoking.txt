7th day today

Today is my 7th day free of the habit. I just wanted to say I read everything here and although I'm not an active redditor I want to thank this community for the support and guidance. I want to share something that made it easier for me to go day by day, I listened to hypnotic sounds and ASMR clips, some help more than others. I'm trying to get into meditation, as of now I can only do guided meditation with the help of a sound clip but it helps eases the restlessness.

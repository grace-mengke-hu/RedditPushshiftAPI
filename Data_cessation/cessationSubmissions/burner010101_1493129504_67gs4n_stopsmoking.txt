If you fuck up, start over.

Just an update. I [relapsed a little under three weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/63w0bv/i_fucked_up_how_bad_is_the_next_month_going_to_be/?ref=share&ref_source=link). It sucked and I was disappointed but I was able to start over again. 

If you fuck up, reset your counter and do it again. That's all.

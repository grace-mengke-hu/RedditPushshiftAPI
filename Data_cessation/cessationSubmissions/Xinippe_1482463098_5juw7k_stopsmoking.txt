How to deal with coworkers that smoke

I know I want to quit, but it has been extremely difficult to stop when most of the guys I work with smoke.  Last weekend I decided I was going to quit...I had half a pack sitting in my room, but once I decided I didn't want to smoke, I wasn't even that tempted.  I left for work Monday morning feeling confident that I could continue my progress...as soon as I showed up to work  however it was like something in my brain had switched.  I had gone 2days with out a single cig, but couldn't control myself when I was in my work environment surrounded by other smokers.  

Does anyone have tips for quitting when I work at a place where smoking has become fairly engrained into my day?  I was thinking of not smoking at all when I go home for Christmas, but I am afraid all the work I put into it will be lost as soon as I get back to work.

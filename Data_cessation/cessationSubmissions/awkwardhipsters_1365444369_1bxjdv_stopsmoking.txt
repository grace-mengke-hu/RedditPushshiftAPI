3 days aaaand I flopped...

It was my worst enemy.

The lunch break with my best friend, who happens to be a smoker.
I had seen this coming all day, and it just... happened. I'd managed fine up until then, it just happened and I had let it happen. I feel disappointed in myself, but all I need to do is build up my self-control.
Tomorrow is another lunch break, but that doesn't mean another cigarette.
I can do this.

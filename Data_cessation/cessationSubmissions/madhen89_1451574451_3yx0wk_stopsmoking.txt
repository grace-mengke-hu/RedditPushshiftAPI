Day 12

So it's day 12 of no cigarettes!!! This has only happened two other times but I really think I am actually done. I haven't even slipped up once and the last few I did smoke before I stopped tastes terrible...it was even the same brand I have smoked for 11 years! My father is in the ever so slow process of dying from smoking. It's terrible. Even typing it makes me tear up. I've wanted to quit for myself forever but was determined he be alive to see me quit. Seeing him get so bad was a motivator for me to stop. I don't know how cigarettes are still on the market after seeing him struggle like he has.

Just finished my first 12 hour shift since I quit

I work at a Papermill so it's always extremely hot. 

Sneaking our for a smoke and cooling down was one of my favourite things. 
I looked forward to it like nothing else. 

Just finished my first shift, it was a rough night, but I made it.

I also went kayaking yesterday, outside for like 6 hours with a case of beer. That was also extremely rough, but I made it.

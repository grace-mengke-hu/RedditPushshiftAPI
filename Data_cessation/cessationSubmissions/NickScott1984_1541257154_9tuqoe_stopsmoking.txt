DIY Nicotine Lozenges

If your having problems quitting smoking and are looking for a cheap DIY Lozenge alternative look no further :)

First off my beef with vaping...

What the vaping community fails to realize is that their primary ingredient nicotine in VG base is not meant to be heated to a point it dissipates. Ingesting VG on the other hand is what it was designed to do. Do some research and learn about what VG was designed to be used for.

I would also like to point out, I personally use and recommend pharmaceutical grade nicotine in VG base. The final product has a whopping 4 ingredients, nicotine being one of them. I use all organic non GMO ingredients with the exception of the nicotine. I have a nicotine vendor I really like and have no reason to change up the nicotine source.

Another comment. I perfected this method over a three year period while working 60+ hours a week while raising 4 young children. I did this on the side. This was literally the only way I was able to quit, once I realized this product was far superior to manufactured Big Box Nicotine Lozenges there was and is no way I could ever go back to smoking. I tried vaping and it never did it for me, I always went back to the cigs.

I've easily made well over a hundred batches and continue to further progress down this path. I have plans to be releasing a DIY kit with patents in the near future. Now on to the recipe, nothing ground breaking but works like a charm.

Stovetop Method: Use process below at own risk and also consult a physician before any use. I am not responsible for anything that happens to anyone who tries this method. You can easily be hurt if you do not know what you are doing.

Equipment Required

1 qt. saucepan

Measuring cup

Candy Thermometer that registers to 300° F

Wooden spoon

Hot Mitts/Pads

Hard Candy Molds

Lozenge Recipe--Stovetop

2 cups white granulated sugar

3/4 cup water

3/4 cup light corn syrup

LorAnn Flavored Oils  1 Dram size

NOTE: Cooked Lozenge is VERY HOT. Caution is necessary to prevent burns. Wear and use protective mitts, gloves, etc.

Spray molds with vegetable oil spray or butter

Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in saucepan.

Cook over high heat and stir with fork until sugar is dissolved.

Clip thermometer to side of pan and continue cooking.

When thermometer registers 300° F, carefully remove pan from heat.

Cooking time is approximately 10 minutes.

Let candy set until bubbles disappear (approximately 2 minutes) or 270F

Add one Lorann Flavoring and Nicotine Solution.   Both of these when mixed will create some steam.  Use caution

Pour candy into prepared molds, use spatula to evenly distribute.  This will fill about 2 and half recommended molds

Let candy cool completely could take 2-4 hours

When candy is hardened, unmold by inverting onto wax or parchment paper

Seal candies in air tight container, or wrap individually

If your concerned that the steps above may be a little too much to handle, I completely get it. The steps above must be used with caution. I truly want to spread this message and thought the best way would be to put out professional content. I've just released over 2.5 hours of instructional video covering every aspect in great depth. I do a deep dive on the nicotine solution explaining how to measure, safety precautions, cooking, and processing. Every single detail is covered. Below is a summary of the various videos and length of time in each video

One last comment, I've ran the numbers it cost around 1.5 cents per 4mg lozenge...Thats NOT buying anything in bulk either, typical consumer purchasing sizes.

Thoughts on an unconventional method? (tattoo)

So I've "quit" a few times, but have always relapsed. I always think, "just one won't hurt" or some other stupid idea. No matter how much I tell myself not to smoke even one, I always slip up eventually. Tonight I had an idea, and I think tomorrow I'll go through with it. I don't have any tattoos. I think they're silly, but I intend to get a very small one, visible but discreet, to remind me of resolve, and will power. 

I think this has some benefits. First of which, is what an asshole I'd feel like for getting that tattoo and making it pointless. Second, is what an asshole I'd feel like explaining the tattoo to people if I still smoked. Third, I'd get it in between my fingers. Right where I hold my smoke. It would be impossible not to think about. 

Thoughts?

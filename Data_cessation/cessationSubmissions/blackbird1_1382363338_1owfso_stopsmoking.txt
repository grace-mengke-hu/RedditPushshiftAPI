Day 11. Just keep swimming.

So its day 11. Over 100 cigarettes not smoked. That is truly disgusting. 100 cigarettes! In less than 2 weeks! 
So I passed the first real test yesterday. I was at my moms house, where everyone smokes, and I told my mom I was quitting again. She gave me the look - the "oh great we have to deal with your moods" combined with the "oh great we have to feel all uncomfortable smoking around you." I let it roll off me. I even walked through a huge cloud of smoke while getting to a spot on the patio - just held my breath and tried to ignore it. This is the single hardest part about quitting for me - they're always there, always available, free and easy. Got to keep swimming.

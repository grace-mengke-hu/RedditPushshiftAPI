And so it persists...

I'm just over 2 weeks smoke free now - managed to deal with all cravings at recent functions, work and struggling mainly where alcohol is involved. 

I'm looking to those who are far into quitting as I'm now coming down with a cold, coughing, sore throat etc.  Is this common after the first couple of weeks? Plus any other tips with cravings? Currently using NRT and chewing a lot of gum! Many thanks.

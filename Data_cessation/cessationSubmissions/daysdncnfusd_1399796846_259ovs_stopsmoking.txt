I'm just going to keep trying and trying and trying.

Hey everyone. A friend just told me about this sub tonight. I just gave up after a week because the medication I was on was really messing me up. 

I've been a smoker for about 30 years. Both my parents smoked heavily. My mom was about two packs a day (quit in 89) and is now paying the price, my dad was almost 4 packs a day, quit in 87, died in 09 from COPD. 

I just want to stop. Just a week off them an I wa noticing smells and tastes. I think pills are out, because my brain is already messed up enough. Tried the patch in the past with no luck. Thinking about hypnosis, but a little scared that cold turkey might be the only way. 

I'm really worried about what I'll do with my time when I quit. Does anyone find that they actually miss it?

A question about fatigue and general exhaustion upon quitting.

So, after a very nonreciprocal relationship with cigarettes for some time (note my username), I've decided to quit (for the 1000th time) with the help of Chantix, everyone's favorite NRT.  I've made it further than I ever have, 6 days exactly at the time of writing this.

My question is, is it normal to experience a very pronounced feeling of exhaustion? My sleeping schedule has gone from 8 or so hours to 12.. to 14.  I've even missed work because of it.  It feels like my body is in a perpetual jet-lag.  I know nicotine is an adrenaline spiker, among other things, but.. I was curious if anyone else here was completely exhausted/fatigued when they initially quit? It's not something that I've seen being listed as a remarkably common symptom of withdrawal.

It's not something inspired by sadness/depression, honestly, I've never felt more complacent in my life.

Anyway, if anybody has any advise or similar experiences they'd like to share, I'd appreciate it greatly.

It's been 66 days and I can't tell anyone.

Most of my friends and family didn't know I smoked, or at least I never told them. I was ashamed because my grandmother had breast cancer and a stroke probably due to smoking. She and my mom both quit and never looked back. They were strong women and I felt weak. On New Years, I decided to quit once and for all. They'd be proud of me, but I still couldn't tell them. I just wanted to tell somebody.

Tip for not smoking while drinking?

Background: Smoked for a few years. About 7 years ago I quit cold turkey. Went for a long while (year or so) without smoking. I slowly went back but only when I was out with friends as a social thing. This tends to be exacerbated when I'm drinking. (I.E. Work all day in stressful environment and don't have a craving one bit. Drink 3 beers and I smoke like a chimney.) I know it is a mental "break to go out and get 'fresh air' when I am at a bar", or just a reason to go and talk to new people away from loud music. 

Mostly all of my friends are similar to me with this habit. Other than the obvious "stop drinking" or "find new friends" (of which neither are going to happen) what are some tips or tricks to stop killing myself every few nights?

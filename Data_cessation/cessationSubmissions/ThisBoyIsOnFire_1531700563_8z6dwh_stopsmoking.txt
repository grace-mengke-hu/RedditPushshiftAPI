Wake-Up Call

After multiple attempts to quit smoking, I am trying again today to quit smoking. I reset my Smoke Free timer to today at 4:32pm and am going to try my best to keep to it that way. I decided to also go on a run at 5pm, as I figured I should try and make more healthy changes in my life. As an overweight individual who has not had regularly exercised in about 2 years, I definitely knew that I would be out of shape. Not only was the running hard on my lungs, but it presented a scary wake-up call on my heart. While I was running, I felt a sharp chain in my chest, as if my heart wanted to burst out of my sternum. I slowed down my jog but definitely still felt the chest pains until I slowed down to a walk. As a person with a family history of high blood pressure, this was an important reminder that lung cancer isn't the only risk associated with smoking, but cardiovascular diseases were also something to be wary about. I think that this experience has definitely scared me away from cigarettes for good, and I will continue to go on slow jogs/walks to work up my cardiovascular health. It's time for me to lower my resting heart rate; focus on the health of my heart and lungs; and most importantly, love my body.

I don't like myself

I fear I have fallen into a bit of depression. It was probably already there, but now it feels like it's in full swing. I blew up real bad at work the other day, couldn't stop crying. I was on the Nicoderm patches and about 10 days in, I figured why am I on a three week nicotine program when I can get rid of it in 3 days? (that was 3~4 days ago, so I don't want to go back on the 21mg patches again) i've been an uber bitch lately and i really don't like it. i don't like myself smoke-free.

anyways. I have been feeling really empty lately. i feel like i am thinking more about not smoking than anything else. My mind feels like it's in a waiting room with nothing to do. It's already looked through all of the magazines and read all the motivational posters on the wall... now what is there to do? keep thinking about *not* smoking?

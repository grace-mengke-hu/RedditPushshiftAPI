Quitting smoking tomorrow!

I'm not sure I entirely want to quit but I know it's best for me. I'm just so nervous. I don't want to get super antsy and angry. My fianc√© has gone 10 days without smoking, with the exception of 2 puffs twice a day. I'm so proud of him! But he's using Chantix and I know that helps with withdrawals. I can't take that medicine so I have to just quit. I guess I'm just nervous about nervousness. 

What kinds of things can I expect? What are withdrawals and cravings like and when will I start feeling "normal" again? Also what are some tips to help me stay away from cigarettes? 

I've been clean (heroin) for 5 years and after the physical withdrawals things got a lot easier. But for some reason I think this will be harder.

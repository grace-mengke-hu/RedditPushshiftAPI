Approaching my quit date 😏

I’m wondering how well others did with setting a quit date and looking for some suggestions. I’m planning on going cold turkey after smoking a pack a day for 10+ years. I recently had a cancer scare and feel I’m really ready to finally give up this this disgusting habit! I’m paying outrageous prices ( figured out I work a 8 hour shift to pay for my weekly cigarettes) on something that could kill me, I have the smell on me 24/7, staining my teeth yellow.. not to mention the nasty smoke room in my house. There’s so many reasons.. I’m ready to actually quit this time. What helped or hindered your quitting process? Also has anyone used any of the quitting apps?

I've never been so tempted to smoke

I haven't had a cigarette in over two years.  I was a 2 pack a day smoker when I quit, and I only had real cravings for about 4 or 5 days afterwards.  My overall physical heath has vastly improved since then, and I'm able to do what I love to do: sing (which is good, as singing provides most of my income).

But lately I've had the most intense desire to smoke.  Things in my life have sort of fallen apart, and it's hard to find any relief, which I suppose has driven this desire.  It's taking everything I've got not to light up right now, but I can't hold on for much longer.  

Friends, what can I do not to smoke?

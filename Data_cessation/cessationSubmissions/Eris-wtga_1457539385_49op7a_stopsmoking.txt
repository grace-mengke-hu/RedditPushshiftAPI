So sleepy

I've been sleeping a lot more, about an extra 2-3 hours a day (a week in slept an extra 7). Anyone else have this issue? Is this normal? 

I am using a vape, so not totally devoid of nicotine. & also had sugar cravings (which I really don't need either) & cranky as all hell..ok now I'm just venting. Sorry

200+ days, my transition

 Here I am 200+ days smoke free and the cravings are long gone. I stopped subscribing to this sub a while back but it was a good launch point. You guys gave some good words when I needed them but there came a day where I was watching the counters and dealing with cravings and I realized I just needed to be away from all of it. The good and bad, all of it. I needed to forget this habit even existed to make it through some of the rough patches.

I was a bit of a dick to some friends, I would answer short and be very blunt about not wanting to do things and staying in. I was eating like garbage for a bit but it became easier to have control.

I know I have an addictive personality and am very habitual, I get to work at the same time each day, always take my breaks at the same time and have the same thing for lunch. So breaking something that became a habit (5 year smoker) was rough.

The biggest question that came up; What's the point? Why try to elongate my life? I could die tomorrow or within the next hour and I still think about that sometimes but the answers eventually find their way up through my bleek outlook. 

1. Burden on my family

I don't want to be some medical case my family has to worry about because I messed up my life with this trash. No longer able to care for myself due to a heart attack or stroke. I'm a grown man and I'll be the one taking care of a family member if needed but let's hope that never happens.

2.Quality of life.

Imagine having a stroke if you can. Imagine losing the feeling in the left side of your body. Imagine no longer being able to feel an orgasm all because every once in a while you needed to relieve a feeling that never existed until you put the product of a company in your mouth and down inside your lungs.

I don't know if this will help anyone or if my thought process is just a jumbled mess but those are some of the thoughts and things that came up. Best of luck to you all.

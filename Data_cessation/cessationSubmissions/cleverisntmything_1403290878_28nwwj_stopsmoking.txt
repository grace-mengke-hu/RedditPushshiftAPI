Day 5, need a little help.

Hey there, this is my (26/m) first time posting to stop
smoking. It is my and my fiancee’s first
attempt at quitting, we are on our 5
th
day and
are both starting to hit a wall. I am wearing the
Nicoderm patches, which seem to be great at
curbing the habit, so I am really just breaking
the mental habit of smoking. My biggest
craving seems to hit RIGHT after I eat. I can go
all day without so much as thinking about
smoking, but the second I finish a meal, the
full stomach demands that I smoke? Has
anyone else had this experience, and do you
have any helpful tips for combating it?

On to my fiancée: she had an allergic reaction
to the patches, so has had to go cold turkey
and it has been incredibly difficult for her. Her
family has a pretty serious history of
depression, and I can see it setting in with her.
I know that a little is normal, but I think it is
starting to take a real toll on her. She bursts
into tears at random moments, and is
becoming uncharacteristically selfish.

I love her to death, and I completely
understand that these are normal symptoms
of withdrawl; but is there anything that I can
do help her get over the hump?

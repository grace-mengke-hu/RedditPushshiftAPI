Can humidifiers help with smokers lungs?

I recently quit smoking, and I have started doing cardio to help clear out my lungs to get them back to being healthy. I was a pack a day smoker for five years, and I am finally trying to take back my health. 
The question is, can humidifiers help in this process? I was never an indoor smoker, so it's not (leftover?) second hand smoke I am necessarily worried about. 
I've tried to to some digging, but there doesn't seem to be any information about people using humidifiers to help with smokers lungs.
Anyone here try it?

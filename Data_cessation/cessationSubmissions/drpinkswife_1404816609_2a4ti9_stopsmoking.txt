The Good, The Bad, The Shit I Need to Get Over!

I went to the shop yesterday on the way to my appointment and bought a bottle of bubbly water for the walk. I brought it to the counter looked behind the counter at the cigarettes....for like 5 seconds. The only thing that came to mind was 'not my circus, not my monkeys', which is probably because it's going around FB, but it still fits. I had no urge to buy them. Besides last time I was in the shop, the guy behind the counter said 'Where have you been?' I told him I quit smoking and was congratulated by him and other people in the shop! :) So, even if I did want to smoke again, I can't buy them there.

I no longer have cravings. I just have addict brain. So maybe I'm doomed to watch that Allen Carr video every few days for the foreseeable future. My guts still haven't sorted themselves out. I eat a lot of fucking carrots nowadays.

I have a resentment with people not resetting their counters when they relapse and then making excuses. Not my quit. Not my business. I need to get over it. On the other hand I'm not going to 'blow smoke up your ass' and say well done, keep it up. Now that I've put that out there, I can get over it.

I go back to work tomorrow. Scary! Not about smoking. Just getting back into the swing of things.

That is all. 17 Days, 4 Hours, 19 Minutes

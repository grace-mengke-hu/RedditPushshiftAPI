[Day 1] First Day nearly over!

Hello :)  
Yesterday I smoked my last cigarette, since the morning of today I am not a smoker anymore!  
It was just enough, I only smoked because of addiction, no other causes, nothing else. Pretty equally spaced over the day, 30 cigs a day.  

I got into a stop-smoking program of my health insurer (started on the 11th of June), and today was my stop-smoking day. I am using a transdermal nicotine patch to ease the withdrawal symptoms better (and because I smoked very regularly over the course of the day, a nicotine patch is a good idea for that).  

And now the first day is nearly over.  
I don't have any cigarettes at home, threw away all (but one xD Some friends do smoke) ashtray.  I drank a lot of water...like 4-5 L.  
It wasn't as bad as I feared, quite enjoyable most of the time - when the urge to smoke hit me, I drank a glass of water. And sometimes a second one, or a third, or more. And it was manageable (though I would never call it "easy" - if I'd have had some cigarettes lying around today, I am pretty sure I would have smoked...).  

The next few days will be a bit tougher, probably, but still - no cigarettes, no smoking! I won't start this useless and expensive shit again!

Best luck to you all :)

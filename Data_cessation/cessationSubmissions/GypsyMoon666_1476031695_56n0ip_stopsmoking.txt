Horrible insomnia

I used the patch & gum for a week (alternating use) and quit both this past Monday . So I'm on day 6 cigarette/nicotine free . It's been surprisingly easy my cravings are infrequent and pass quick . I feel ok . But for some reason I cannot sleep for shit since I quit . It makes no sense to me . I cannot sleep for more than 45min/1 hour at a time . After 6 days of this it's getting old quick. I just want to sleep a couple of hours in a row . I've never experienced this from quitting before . Has anyone else ?

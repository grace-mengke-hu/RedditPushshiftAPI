The Habit

I have been using an e-cig with 0 nicotine e-juice for the past two days just to get me through the 1st lil bit. When I had to charge it I started spazing out a lil bit It was confined to my head only but I was definitely freaking out. Now my whole point is if anyone is still reading, I think the habit is as big an issue as the addiction maybe more so for me. After a week 2 at most I'm going to toss the e-cig I cant I just cant go back to smoking this time. This has to be it.

OK, so here's my update on day three. I went to the festival yesterday and didn't attack some smoker or anything like this. Some moments were hard because (naturally) there were smokers (and let me tell you, no, smoke didn't smell terrible to me at day 2). But other moments were easy because I watched other people and so many of them just had fun without smoking. And I remembered: I don't feel bad because I don't smoke right now. I feel bad because I smoked until 2 days ago!

So today is day 3 and it had been easier as the last two days! We went to the public swimming pool, visited my parents in law, got a coffee to go and my husband drove me around to get a few pokestops. 

It really felt easier today. I still have to put my brain into its place sometimes (...its like "Hey, it's easy today, isn't it? You could smoke one to celebrate!"), but that's ok. It's been only 3 days! And if it's easier after only 3 days, I can't wait for the next weekend.

What really helps me: I don't avoid my "triggers". Like: I used to smoke with almost every coffee I drank (hey, who doesn't) and I drink loooooooooots of coffee. I didn't stop with coffee. The first few were hard, because it felt just wrong to drink coffee without a cigarette, but how else to break this conditioning? I still sit on the terrace (where I used to smoke) every day and so on. I don't want to draw this out, you know. 

That was my "Day 3". I'm still a non-smoker. And I'm never going to smoke again!

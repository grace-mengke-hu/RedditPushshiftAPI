Extreme full body shaking after going cold turkey

Okay so I don’t have much because this just happened and I can’t find much online that makes any sense so I’m wondering if it could be this.. I know it’s not smoking but I figured I’d get more help here, I’ve been using a juul for the past year and a half, going through a few pods a week normally. Recently I sold mine to a good friend (he bought it overpriced for me) because I’ve come into some money problems.. can anyone tell me if this kind of severe full body shaking could be caused by nicotine withdrawals after going cold turkey? Thank you :)

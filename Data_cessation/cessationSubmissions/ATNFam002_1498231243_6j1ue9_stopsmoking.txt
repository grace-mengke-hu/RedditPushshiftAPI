Day 12.... fighting.

I've quit smoking and the withdrawals are pretty bad. Dealt with the usual ones pretty well now I'm dealing with Insomnia and extreme depression. I'm ok one day but the next crying all day. I feel like if I just go back to smoking I won't feel so emotionally unstable. HELP! I haven't smoked but my brain keeps telling me if I do this sadness will go away. 
IS THIS NORMAL? :(

Yeast infection from quitting??

Going on day four with no overall direct problems! I have fewer cravings each day, and I'm feeling so much better! I'm actually awake for work right now! However, I woke up this morning with the fury that only women (and I guess maybe a few men) know... A yeast infection. The only thing I've changed recently is smoking... Is it possible I've changed the ph of my body so much it doesn't know how to react? Anyone else ever experience this?

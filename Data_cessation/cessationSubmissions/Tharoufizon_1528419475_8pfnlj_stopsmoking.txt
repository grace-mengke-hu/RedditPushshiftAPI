3 days in (for the millionth time it seems) and just bought a pack

So over the past few months I have been going off and on with not smoking at all, then occasionally socially smoking, and every few weeks going back to my habit for a week or so. Every time I buy a pack and smoke I feel like a failure and I worry about my health, so I quit again, sometimes throwing whole packs out, but then I always end up slipping up, buying a pack, and starting the whole thing over again.  


 I am feeling very weak.   


I worry about my health all the time, I have convinced myself I have lung or spine cancer or something (despite my doctor's assurances everything is fine), my back is always hurting, and when I do slip up I can feel the difference in my breathing. And yet I still screw up and buy cigarettes. I need to figure out how to kick this for good, but I am really feeling like I am stuck with it forever. 

Any advice or support would be great.

Survived a trip to NYC!

Sup guys!

Just got back from a five day trip to NYC to help run some auditions. I lived in the city for almost five years before my SO and I moved upstate to save money and sanity. I smoked the whole time I lived there and it was my first time back since quitting. It was weird. And harder than it's been since my first two weeks cig-free. There were smokers and the smell of smoke *everywhere.* Every time I stepped off the train it felt weird to not light up. 

But I stayed strong! All of my NYC non-smoker friends were super jazzed on me for quitting. And my friends who still smoke were seething with jealousy at my two month triumph. I told them to text me to vent when they decide to quit and name-dropped this sub more than once. 

I hope all of you are doing well. Thanks again for all of the support! And for those of you in those first hard few weeks, keep up the awesome work! It gets SO much easier. And when a seemingly insurmountable challenge comes up and you fight your way through it, it's a better feeling than any cig could compete with. Let's not smoke today :)

(And on a completely unrelated note, if you're in the area and get a chance to see *Hedwig and the Angry Inch* DO IT. The show was fucking *fantastic!*)

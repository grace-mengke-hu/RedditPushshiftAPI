Looking For Quitting Buddies

Absolutely done with this filthy habit, smoking my last two cigarettes left in the pack, going to bed, and hoping to wake up a man of purpose and conviction tomorrow.  

Admittedly I am absolutely terrified, but I know I have to stay strong and not succumb to buying another pack ever again.   I genuinely love smoking and itâ€™s definitiey become my crutch, but after months, maybe even years, of sinus issues and difficulty breathing, I know the best thing I can do for my body is to just quit.  Doing it cold turkey and hoping for the best, really just want to have energy again.  Anyone else here in the same boat and quitting tomorrow?

Tobacco + Resine/weed smoker. Have read Allen Carr but always relapse...

Hi everyone, i'm 23yo, started smoking cigs at the age of 11, smoked weed occasionally since, but these last two years i've got addicted to weed and tobacco since i'm studying abroad and no parents to get paranoid from etc lol :D.  
  
I've managed to stop smoking (cigs) many times and for real long periods, with no real effort and a good state of mind. But the problem is i always end up smoking a joint of tobacco and resine/weed then the chain starts slowly again til i end up smoking 7 10 joints a day :'(.  
Last time i tried to quit smoking cigs was last year, i've managed to stop more than 7 months, hit the gym 4 times a week, everything was going well but i was craving weed and i relapsed...   
  
Anyone here who is/was in the same case as me? Is separating the use of weed and tobacco a solution?

EDIT: Day 9, i'm doing really great just like my last quit, i just have to never ever put a joint filled with tobacco in my mouth, i've ordered a pipe so if i really want to get blased up i'll only smoke pure hash/weed.

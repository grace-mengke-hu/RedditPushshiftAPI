Any documentary (youtube or elsewhere) recommendations about the tobacco industry?

It's 1:30 AM right now (just woke up - yay insomnia) - in about an hour and a half, I'll hit my 48 hour mark &amp; moving on into my 3rd day. Last leg of the whole nicotine thing (woohoo!). Honestly, the cravings haven't been so bad (I've done a pretty good job cutting myself off from cues that I know will get me into craves) - the headaches, lack of focus, irritability though. Woo boy. 

The headaches can disappear after some exercise, the lack of focus I'll need to work on just in general (usually after doing a lot of focused work, my 'reward' is a cigarette, so I need to totally gut that whole psych process), but the irritability: why not channel my furious withdrawing ass over into the tobacco industry with some cool videos/documentaries about how much they knowingly fuck people over? At least then I'll be irritable at the right things, eh?

So yeah! Any recommendations? :D

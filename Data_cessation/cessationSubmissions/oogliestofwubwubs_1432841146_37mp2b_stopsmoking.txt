10 days

Yesterday sucked but today has been much, much better. It's becoming "normal" to not smoke after I eat or after I do certain things.  Since I always smoked outside (never inside) I've been having a hard time hanging around with the kid outside.  Today I decided to repot some plants and weed the flowerbed a little bit.  It helped to keep myself busy. I also noticed that I was rushing so I could have a cigarette so I paced myself.  

Just a few little things I noticed. I think that I am accepting the reality that I will never smoke again.  I'm rewiring my brain and learning about the new normal.

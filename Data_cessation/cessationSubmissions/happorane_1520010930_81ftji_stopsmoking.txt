I'm lost.

Hey guys. As the title says i feel quite lost at the moment with myself and my relationship with nicotine. 

I quit smoking about 2 years ago. I went 7 months without any nicotine and relapsed. Yeah.... 

At the time i was going through some tough times and somehow convinced myself to start again to cope. 

Since then i have been on and off on snus, so atleast i havent smoked but its this nicotine that i cant just kick. Everytime i quit now i can go a week or two fine and then i get depressed and convince myself to start again only to realise what a dumbass i am for once again believing those toughts and feelings of withdrawal. 

Its like at the time of that strong craving and depressive feeling i somehow believe that the only thing that will ever make me feel normal is nicotine and then i give in. 

I feel like im in a prison. And the prison bars are made of nicotine. I feel so weak with this addiction. Everytime i relapse i just feel so disappoint at myself for once again failing. 

Today is once again day 1. Atleast im trying again. 

I dont rly know why i made this post. I guess i just wanted to tell this to someone, as there are not a lot of people who understand. 

If u guys could give me some tips to those moments of craving and despair i would appriciate it alot. Thank you.

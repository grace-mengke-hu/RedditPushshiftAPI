Going out with my smoker friends.

I quit smoking for two weeks now and it actually goes really well. But I go on a 3day-trip with my friends this weekend and most of them are smokers. We are probably going out and drink a lot of beers. 

those anybody have any tips to beat the triggers on evenings or weekends like this?

I cheated today

So I started trying to quit cold turkey last week after a bet I made with one of my supervisors over him quitting caffeine and me quitting nicotine. Since then I've cheated once but today I lost and cheated again. In a week I've only had three smokes but today was bad. I was angry over nothing at work because some guy wouldn't move his car out of the parking  lot entrance I was trying to get into, so I floored my vehicle from a standstill. I did it at work and it was dumb. So I had a cigarette. I'm mad at being mad over nothing I'm mad at driving recklessly over nothing. I did it at work now I'm stressed I could get in trouble over it and the only relief I'm feeling right now is that nobody got hurt. It was dumb and quitting smoking is probably the hardest thing I've ever done and this has got to be like the fourth time I've tried. So that's it I just had to vent. No more smokes today and I'll start over tomorrow. I really want to quit this time.

Anything ex-smokers have done to boost lungs

Only on day one, but noticing I'm gently clearing my throat all day, and I am sure worse (better) is to come. Been about 20 years, so there's a lot in there.

But has anyone done anything to try and improve the lungs after quitting? And has it worked? If so, all ears

Day 1 with no cigarettes

I have smoked a pack a day for 20 years.  Yesterday I had 6 cigarettes.  Today I have had none.  It hasn't been absolutely horrible, so it is definitely better than I expected.  I am using an ecig to help and have puffed on that thing when I need too.  I work IT help Desk and have to deal with unbelievably insane people.  I'm pretty happy I haven't tried to kill anyone yet.  I can do this.

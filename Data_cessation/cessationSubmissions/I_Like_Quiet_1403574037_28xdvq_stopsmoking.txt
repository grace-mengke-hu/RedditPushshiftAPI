What Quitting is like. (NSFW-language)

I've still not cut the habit.  I've tried a few times.  Some more successful than others (I once made it 4 months and 12 days).  I thought I'd try to explain what the first day or so is like for me.  Maybe some of you have had these feelings as well.  Maybe not, but I think it would help me if I put this down in words... thanks for reading.

I'm a ball of rage.

Today is the day I quit.  I sit at the breakfast table reading the paper.  All I can think is that I want a butt, but I don't because I'm quitting.

My wife asks, "How are you doing?"

I want to reply, "HOW THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I'M DOING.  I'M FUCKING QUITTING, YOU BITCH.  IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOUR INCESSANT NAGGING ABOUT IT.  I'M ONLY QUITTING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SHUT THE FUCK UP.  CUNT."  But I reply, "Not too bad" and get back to the paper... wanting to light up.

My kid wakes up and starts screaming.  I want to yell, "FUCK! CAN'T THAT KID BE FUCKING QUIET?!?  CAN'T I READ THE GODDAMNED PAPER IN FUCKING PEACE?!?  FOR FUCK'S SAKE!"  I go get the lad (without incident because I know it's not his fault) and the rest of the morning is fine, except I want a fucking smoke.

I get to work and my boss comes in and says, "I need that report from you ASAP."  

I want to reply "OH FUCK YOU ASSHOLE!  I'VE BEEN COVERING YOUR ASS SO FUCKING MUCH THAT I CAN'T GET MY OWN SHIT DONE.  NOW YOU'RE RIDING MY ASS ABOUT SOME FUCKING SHIT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING JUST SO YOU CAN LOOK GOOD SUCKING YOUR BOSS'S DICK?  FUCK YOU AND THE GODDAMNED HORSE YOU RODE IN ON.  PIGFUCKER."  But I reply, "No problem, I'll get it right away."  I really want a cig right now.

My boss says, "Good.  See that you do."

I want to scream out, "FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE!  I SAID I'D FUCKING DO IT.  WHY THE FUCK DO YOU HAVE TO TELL ME TO FUCKING DO IT AFTER I FUCKING SAID I'D FUCKING DO IT. FUCKING PILE OF FUCK!", but I just nod my head wanting to smoke.

the rest of the day follows this pattern.  All I want to do is rage out on somebody.  But you know what?  I don't.  All I want to do is smoke.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I make it through the day.  The good thing, is that when I make it through the day, the next one is always easier.  I hope I don't come across all high and mighty about quitting as I've not been successful, but didn't want to end this without hope.

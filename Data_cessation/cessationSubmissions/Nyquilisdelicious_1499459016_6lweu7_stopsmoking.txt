This is so hard!

I'm on day 2 of no smoking. I just lost my job (which is why i'm quitting. I can't afford fluid).

I have been vaping for about two years now and before that I was smoking 60-70 rollies a day. You know those big pouches of american spirit tabacco.

I'm incredibly agitated, angry, and looking for some way to help with the craving. All I want to do is smoke, all i can think about is smoking, and nothing interest me besides thinking about smoking.

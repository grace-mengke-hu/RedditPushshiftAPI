1 Week - Feels so awesome to be a Nonsmoker

Tomorrow I head back to work, my typical point of failure when trying to quit smoking. Not this time. I am too happy being a Nonsmoker. I never want to fall back into it again. Smoking makes work and everything else more stressful not less. My monster is dead and gone, and he isn't coming back.

All of this is straight from the book. But the book has it right. In another week, I will have been free for two weeks.

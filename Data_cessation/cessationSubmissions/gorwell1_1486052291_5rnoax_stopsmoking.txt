I hid my smoking from my partner and our child for the past 3 years. I didn't realize how much this made me avoid physical closeness until I stopped smoking last week.

I started smoking again about 3 years ago during some tough times right after our son was born. For various reasons I hid it. The stress of hiding it has taken a toll on me emotionally, but I didn't realize just how much of a toll it took on intimacy. I avoided getting too close, cuddling, kissing if I hadn't brushed and showered, and who knows what else just to make sure she didn't smell cigarettes. I'm reclaiming these gifts now and it feels great. Although I doubt I'll come clean about smoking, it feels good not to have to hide an active habit.

Oh, and the money! It's not just the cigarettes. It's the gum, the minds, and then all the other things I'd buy whenever I went to pay $12 for a pack of smokes. I'd usually drop another $6-8 every time.

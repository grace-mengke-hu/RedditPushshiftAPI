Look at that, 2 months!

I thought I would be writing a reflective post today but.....I nearly forgot that I was still counting non smoking days! It's funny how I don't crave one anymore but my memory reminds me that I would smoke; locations and situations can still trigger if only for a moment. After 21 years I quit cold turkey, and now I'm a non smoker. Your stories have helped and every victory is our victory!

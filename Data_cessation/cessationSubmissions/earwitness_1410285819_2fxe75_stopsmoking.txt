Help; I bought a pack...

So it's been merely a day... The cravings were intense. So much so that I started to walk to the shop, then returned back home because I knew it wasn't worth it... However I gave in a few hours later and bought one anyway. I didn't smoke any of them yet. In fact I lost the desire to smoke and started to regret my decision to buy a pack immediately. Actually the whole act of going and buying the pack was with utter disgust. My lack of self control disgusted me and it was a tug and pull between my addiction and myself. I started to walk back home for the second time, but then I lost the battle. I bought the pack anyway. I haven't smoked yet though... help

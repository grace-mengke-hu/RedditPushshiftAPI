Quit smoking for 6 months. Should I get into Vaping?

Haven't been smoking for over 6 months now and I guess most of the nicotine is out of the body. I do feel slight craving sometimes and thought perhaps vaping is the way to go. I just want juices and no nicotine. Does anyone have any advice of proceeding?

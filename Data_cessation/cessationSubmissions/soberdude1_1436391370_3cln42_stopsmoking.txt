The Easy Way

Allen Carr’s Easy Way

Pros: Allen Carr used to smoke 100 a day, until he stopped. Just like that. The penny dropped when he realised that focusing on distant, abstract negatives such as cancer don’t help. Instead, he explains in his international bestseller Easy Way to Stop Smoking, you should think of the immediate benefits of stopping, i.e. being richer, regaining your sense of smell, and not punctuating the day with a pointless, time-wasting activity. His fundamental point is that stopping smoking should be an enjoyable, rather than painful, process, and one that requires no will power. The best thing about it is that it works – Carr boasts a success rate of 90 per cent among those who read his books. 

Cons: There’s a self-help happy-clappiness to Carr’s Easy Way, and this puts people off. He’s also so confident of success that if you do relapse there’s little guidance regarding what to do. However, of all the methods, Carr’s has the highest success rate. Legions of successful quitters preach the Easy Way gospel.

Day 5

Today is Day 5 of not smoking!  On Saturday, I ran two miles for the first time ever and was able to breath, for the most part.

I still get little anxious feelings in my chest on occasion and I still get cravings.

I miss it. I always tell my husband I want "just one." But I haven't had that one for the following two reasons: it's gonna be so gross and I know that. It is not going to taste good and I don't even want to go through that and have that taste in my mouth. And because I've worked so hard at my 5K training and just one cigarette is going to derail all of that.  For the first time in the last 2 months, I am finally confident that I'll be able to run and complete the 5K I signed up for and I am not willing to backslide.

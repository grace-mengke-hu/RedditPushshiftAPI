Free Regal ECig Starter Pack

Edit:  Now Claimed! Good luck Stranger!


Contrary to what my flair says, I've quit for the past 8 months (I'll fix it in a bit)

My Pops had sent me an eCig thing in an attempt to help me.  It apparently got lost in the mail, and long story short shows up here 8 months late.

I now have no use for it, but if anyone is in need I would be glad to send it to them for free.  It is the Regalecigs.  It is still in the plastic wrapper.

Cheers

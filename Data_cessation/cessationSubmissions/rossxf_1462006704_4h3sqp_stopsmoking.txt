8 days cold turkey. CAN'T SLEEP!

Hi guys

today is day 8 of my cold turkey attempt to give up smoking.

The last couple of days, the cravings have become tolerable, and things are generally looking up, however, I havnt had a good nights sleep since I gave up apart from one night where I drank a ton of alcohol :(

Last night was probably the worst...

Went to bed at 10:30pm, fell asleep about 3am, woke up at least twice for 30 mins a time then up at 6:30 AM for work :(

If I could just sleep I'd be fine. Anyone else get like this when they gave up?

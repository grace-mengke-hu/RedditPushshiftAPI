It is hard to quit smoking but harder NOT to quit.

I have been smoking 44 years. I quit just over 3 weeks ago. I feel fantastic! It is the best decision I ever made. I just got to a point where I said enough. I don't want to smoke anymore.  I have now not smoked 1198 cigarettes. 
All of you have inspired me. Helping me with the cravings. I just want to thank you.

March 28

I set my smoking deadline for March 28th. 

I'm by no means quitting nicotine. The deadline is set on the day my Juul will arrive. I've quit in the past a couple of times, each stretching a month or more -- nicotine withdrawal is no problem for me, as hard as the first week can get. It's the habit of smoking, the fucking want to hold a cigarette, to roll the wheel of the bic and light one up. That's the hard part. Feeling down? Go walk and light a cigarette. Walking to school? Hold a cigarette. I'll smoke it, because I love it, and I love the nicotine rush. But it's the act that's addictive more than anything. It's the act that always brought me back, I love it and I can't deny it.

March 28th is when I'll make the switch from cigs to a Juul. This isn't about qutting nicotine, this is about changing habits. If I can last long enough without a cigarette habit, all I need to do after is quit the nicotine -- that part I'm used to.

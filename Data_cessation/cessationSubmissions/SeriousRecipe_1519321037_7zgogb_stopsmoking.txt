How to convince my girlfriend's father to stop smoking?

I myself am a non smoker, but my girlfriend's father has his whole family concerned. He has been smoking for almost 40 years, and refuses to stop. He smokes about a pack a day, and coughs like crazy. He refuses to see a doctor, and does not listen to anyone in his family about the dangers of smoking, saying that the doctors are the ones that have it all wrong. 

I know there's the saying you can't make the horse drink the water, but is there any suggestions anyone here can think of? What made you folks decide to quit?

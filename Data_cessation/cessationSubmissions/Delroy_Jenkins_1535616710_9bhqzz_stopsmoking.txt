Almost 24 hours!

Hey guys!
A few months ago, I made a promise to my girlfriend that by September 1st, I'd have stopped smoking!

I joined this subreddit like 2 months ago and it's an everyday source of motivation for me! (well, it has only been 24 hours, but you helped me prepare to it!)

So... Thank you guys!

Im on my second day, going to have a weekend with about 10 smokers. Should I give up now and start again monday ?

The withdrawal ain't too bad so far. But I wonder what will happen this weekend when there will be multiple triggers, drinks, friends, board games.

I don't want to be annoying and angry after everybody.

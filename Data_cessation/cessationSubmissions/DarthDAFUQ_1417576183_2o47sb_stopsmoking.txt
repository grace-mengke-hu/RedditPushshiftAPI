Today is the day!

I'll admit, it took a google calendar reminder of someone's birthday on the 4th of December to remind me that on this day, with Christmas and New Years around the corner, I with my balls of steel woke up saying today is the day and one year later I couldn't be happier and I've never been healthier! You guys helped me through so much the past few months, thank you for everything! 

Stand tall fellow quitters, we are the real MVP's!

Day 5. Taking each day as it comes.

Gave up two months ago for a month and thought I was fine to have a few out on a night out. A month of smoking and Â£150 wasted, I am trying again. January 1st, perfect time. 
Haven't had any cravings so far, it has been quite easy in truth. But I am also doing dry Jan, so I imagine the hard part will come next month! Good luck to those of you giving up

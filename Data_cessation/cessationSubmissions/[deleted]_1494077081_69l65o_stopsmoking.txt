7 days/ 1 week

I can't believe I'm made it this far. I never thought I could do cold turkey but it was totally worth it. With the gums I felt like I was constantly withdrawing and couldn't focus on the psychological dependence. Today has been a tough day, very strong cravings. For some reason a lot of anger too. Dont know how to control it. But I can't give up now.

Who has scared you into quitting?

I'm back to day 1. Again. Sorry for the crummy title, but I couldn't think of a better way to phrase what I'm asking for. 

I think I need to hear some tales about the horrors of smoking. We have probably all known people who were seriously affected by the horrors of nicotine. Share your story and memorialize those people. For my part, all of my grandparents smoked. My grandfathers died before I was born, but I got to get to know my grandmothers a little before they passed away. 

One had an aneurysm. During the surgery to fix it the doctors accidentally punctured an artery because her veins we so thin. She lost so much blood that she needed 3 total blood transfusions and went into a coma for 3 weeks. The family had to take her off life support. 

My other grandma got COPD and spent the last 5 years of her life stuck in her tiny apartment, connected to an oxygen tank. She was in and out of the hospital for years. The last time, she made the decision to die and had the whole family come say goodbye. 3 days later she passed away while I was holding her hand. She asked us all to quit smoking and I'll never get over how stupid I was to brush off her request. 

My father and brother currently smoke and I hope I can manage to stay quit and inspire them to do the same.

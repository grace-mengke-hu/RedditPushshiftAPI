Trending this morning: Phlegm!

Coughing up phlegm in the morning happened to me from time to time, whenever I smoked a lot the previous night, but today, after two smokeless days and nights, what's coming out of my mouth is positively evil sludge. It's disgusting, brown, slimy sludge, but I'm pretty happy to see it go. 

Haven't had a craving yet today, though three times I wanted to reach for my tobacco before my conscious brain caught up.

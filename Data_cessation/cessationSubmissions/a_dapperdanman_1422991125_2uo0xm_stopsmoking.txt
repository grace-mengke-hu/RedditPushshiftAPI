On my second week.

The urges have been fewer and in between. I have been trying to adjust myself to things that are triggers, mainly drinking. I still get cravings while doing so, but you just have to remind yourself how far you've come, and if re-doing all of that is worth a few minutes of pleasure. From my past experiences when I relapsed it was always filled with instant regret. That one cigarette you have will never be satisfying and is going to taste awful, on top of that you will feel awful, mainly because you've disappointed yourself. I still have a long ways to go, but after failing multiple times, I can finally realize that smoking was a thing of that past, and a newer, healthier me is upcoming. Keep strong everyone, it does get easier, once you smell how a smoker really smells, you will be ashamed of the scent you gave off.

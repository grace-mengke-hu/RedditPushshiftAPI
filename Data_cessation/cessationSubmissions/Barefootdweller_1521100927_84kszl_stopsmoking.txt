Hung with smoking friends

They smoked a few cigarettes and I initially felt like I was missing out but then decided right there that that wasn't the case. I've quite before but this time it has to stick. I'm so tired of smelling like an ashtray and feeling crappy. 

Looking forward to not having my addiction rule my life. Stay strong everyone!

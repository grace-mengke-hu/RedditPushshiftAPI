Finally going to quit

Hey guys,

Long time lurker, first time poster in this sub. I've been smoking since I was 15, and I'm now 28 and I am just done. Done relying on cigarettes as a crutch, or using it as a boredom killer, or any of the other ridiculous excuses! 

My partner left me last week, and I went from about 15 a day to 30, and it is that moment where I just realised I'm done smoking. 

Quit day set - 2nd October. I'm super nervous, but excited for the freedom ahead.

Wish me luck!

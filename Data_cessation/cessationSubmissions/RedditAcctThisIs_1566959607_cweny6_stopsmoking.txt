Over a year in and weight gain has me craving cigarettes

I have been smoke free over a year and love it. I've also gone to the gym more  and look more fit but my eating habits are crap.

I can't stop snacking and im not overweight, but I feel bloated and like the gym is pointless,  since my diet isn't very good. When I smoked I was thin, and it's got me craving recently. 

How do you guys  eat healthy and deal with weight gain?

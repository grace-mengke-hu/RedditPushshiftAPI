Night sweats and insomnia

Hi guys!

I'm super happy about my quit, everything is going relatively easy, I really don't want to smoke. But goddamn I wake up 5 times during the night and drenched in sweat.

It really sucks, does anyone know how long this will stay like this? I change shirts 3 times a night...Keep on quitting my fellow quitters! :)

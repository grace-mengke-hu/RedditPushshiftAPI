Quit smoking two weeks ago, feeling ill?

Hello all! I just found out about this subreddit very recently and I thought this would be the best place for advice. I'm a 19 year old Female and I decided to quit smoking on the 4th of this month and I've been doing pretty good since then! Well actually, I only noticed on the 7th that I haven't had a cigarette since the 4th and decided to see how long I could keep going. It's very difficult to stop whenever I'm drinking so I've cheated a few times but overall I'm pretty happy with myself so far!! 

The only thing is, ever since last week I've been getting flu like symptoms. Achey shoulders, sore head (it feels like a strong pressure), runny nose, sore throat, the lot! I think it might be related to the quitting? or possibly the quitting and then smoking while drunk? I need some advice. How do I get through this? I feel awful right now!

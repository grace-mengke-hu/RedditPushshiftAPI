Overused title? Help, i think my cigarettes are causing my anxiety...

My mother and my father are smokers, my grandma and grandpa are heavy smokers, my friends smoke, my girlfriend smoke and almost everyone around me smokes. Im second year medical student on college so i know what smoking does, from micro to macro level. My father is a doctor so he should know it better then i do right? Im hipohondric to an extent, just like every other medical student. I've been smoking for at least 4 years (pack a day). But i just want to quit. I've tried a bunch of times but i just can't. Read all the books there is and watch all of the videos about smoking but i just can't get it through my thick skull. 

Please, are there any suggestions without e cigs or nicotine replacement therapies, to just stop f****** smoking?

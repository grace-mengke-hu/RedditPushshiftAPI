Lozenges are harder to quit for me

I am just going to leave this here.....I was a pack and a half a day smoker for 15 years. I was able to quit with the help of nicotine lozenges. I just quit those 2 and a half weeks ago after 9 years. Yup, 9 years on the lozenges. I feel like I'm a crazy person, I feel disconnected from my body, everything really sucks at this moment. I am thinking that the lozenges gave me nicotine at a higher level and of course I had more per day than they recommended. The positive....I know physically I feel better and I am saving money

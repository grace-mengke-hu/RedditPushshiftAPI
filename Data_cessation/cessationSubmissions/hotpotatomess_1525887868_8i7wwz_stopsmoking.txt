Day 5

Picked up smoking from an ex because he did and I thought it’d be cool (so fucking stupid) 

Haven’t been with him for over a year but was still smoking 4-5 cigs everyday, or more when I was on stimulants. I’m with the most AMAZING guy now and although he hasn’t forced me, he encourages me to quit and I’ve finally decided it was time.

Within the past month or two I found the taste and feeling was putting me off even without a mindset of wanting to quit. So I finally did it! It’s been 5 days, cold turkey but still using a 6 mg vape

I really want to know if anyone out there on ADHD meds or other stimulants find it really hard not to smoke while on them? I feel I only crave them when I take my meds but the medication is helpful so I’m worried about starting it again after I get over the majority of withdrawal symptoms. They have been minimal, slight pangs of cravings but again I have a vape which tastes so much better anyways.

I’m also on antidepressants and I know most of the struggle now is just mind games. Any tips for people who are already struggling to be in charge of their brain and emotions??

Thanks for reading and any comments or suggestions would mean so much
We’ve got this guys!!!

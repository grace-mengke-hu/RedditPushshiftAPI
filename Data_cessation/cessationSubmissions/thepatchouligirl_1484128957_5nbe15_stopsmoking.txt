What has been your most useful tip/distraction for cravings?

I just started this a few days ago -  making a cup of green tea when I've gotten a craving....it's clean tasting, relaxing, and healthy.  Seems to be working really well for the cravings!  It has the same type of "ritualistic" feeling if that makes any sense.  Hope this helps someone else!

I'd like to hear what tips have worked for everyone.

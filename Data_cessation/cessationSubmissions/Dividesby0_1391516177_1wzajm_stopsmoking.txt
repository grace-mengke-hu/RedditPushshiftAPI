It's 7am and I'm done

I've been smoking for 6 years. I have been seriously wanting to quit for a few months now. I am in my early twenties and in college. I feel like I am becoming unhealthier each day. I want to be able to run miles each day and enjoy it. I don't want to smell like cigarettes, and I know now that everyone DOES notice the smell. And, strangely, I think I'd lose weight after quitting because I think I'm more attracted to unhealthy foods as a smoker. Not just because I'm unhealthy anyway, but something about the chemicals in cigs make me crave shitty food. Just a theory... But, most importantly, I have become an increasingly irresponsible person. Funny, when I was in high school and up until about age 20, I made great grades, did sports, and held decent jobs. I don't know why I've become so irresponsible suddenly, but I suppose I must make huge changes in my life if I expect to become a responsible, self supporting adult. So, today, at 7am, 1 hour before class starts and 10 minutes after my last smoke, I put on my nicotine patch. I could probably do this cold turkey, but maybe the patch will provide some assurance. This is one of the many changes to come.

Btw, this thing is fucking itchy.

2 days in, weekend is here :(

I've now been a non-smoker for 2 days! Woooo! Pretty happy with myself! But, its now the weekend and my social circle are 95% smokers and drink at the weekends (as do I), and I don't want to have to exclude myself for an extended period of time as Ill be stuck in at the weekend myself. Does anyone have any tips on how to help cravings if you are having a drink? I have an E Cigarette but I dunno how effective that will be if I am in a smokey environment! Should I just avoid it altogether?

Edit: For the record, I have not long finished "The EASYWAY" book and even though it says not to, I am using patches, more to get me out of the routine of actually smoking and putting a cigarette to my mouth, I feel that if I kick that first then the rest should be easy!

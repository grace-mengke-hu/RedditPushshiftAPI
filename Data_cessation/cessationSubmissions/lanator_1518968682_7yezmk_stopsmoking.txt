What the FUCK am I doing

I am a smart and attractive 24 year old female and I have now been smoking for 10 years. I have completely ruined my self-confidence by smoking. I have absolutely little trust in myself and my ability to achieve this, let alone other aspects of my life because of this, and I want to cry my heart out and cough everything up and take everything back.

Back in 2015 I quit smoking for nearly 3 months after watching the 1 hour Allen Carr video, but everyone who has ever relapsed realizes why I started again. This is the reason I haven't tried again. I can't believe I jumped out from the 90th floor of the quit smoking building, it has since made me feel week and made me doubt to try stopping again because I'm afraid I'll relapse again and wreck my confidence like that again. I am reading the book instead now and after being halfway through it, a battle is going on inside me. I want to continue reading so I can be free, but I am terrified to finish the book to find that I am too weak to go through with it - and if I DON'T, then what's left??? When lifelong smokers, much worse off than me, can finish this book and genuinely not want to pick up another cigarette, then if I can't, what will happen??? I already knew almost everything the book was going to tell me, yet I still started smoking again.

I am so afraid. I realize it's caused by the cigarettes, but the feeling is real. My confidence is low and I am realizing it is affecting everything else in my life because I 15-20 times a day reaffirm myself, that I am not an achiever.

Sorry for my bad English, I'm not a native speaker and it worsens when I'm frustrated.
I guess I'm just looking for a little uplift or some support for another try.
I think about how much I hate smoking everytime I pick one up and I go right ahead anyway. Fuck.

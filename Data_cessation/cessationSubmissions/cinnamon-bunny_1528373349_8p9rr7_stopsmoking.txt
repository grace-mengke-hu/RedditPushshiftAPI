My father was a heavy smoker, died from lung cancer, and I started smoking anyways. Today is the start of my quitting journey!

Lately I've been smoking about two packs a day, and I feel like a human ashtray/trashcan. So I've decided enough is enough. I started smoking when I was 18, now I am 25 and I feel like shit for doing it. Worst of all, my father died from lung cancer at 36 (he was a heavy smoker too) and I picked up the habit anyway. Lately I've started feeling like an awful person for doing the thing that literally took his life, and it's about time I throw the cigarettes in the trash. 

Scrolling through this subreddit gives me hope I can maybe do it, also my mom is pretty supportive as she quite them cold turkey a few months after my dad died, and she knows the struggles. 

Not to mention, how much money I spend on them, I don't even like to think about it as it gives me headaches. 

Good thing is I've started running lately, so I know I will improve on that when I quit smoking, and I hope that will keep me motivated. 

  
If you have some tips and tricks, feel free to share them and your stories with me, as I will certainly need it.   
Good luck and stay strong to everyone who is going through rough time quitting this junk!  


Wish me luck!

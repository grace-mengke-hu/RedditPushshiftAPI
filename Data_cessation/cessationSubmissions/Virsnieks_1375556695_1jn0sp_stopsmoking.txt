Just another day without smoking

Today after spending 3+ hours on bicycle and rowing a boat on the windy lake I felt a bit proud of myself. I was  proud I enjoyed my day in excelent sunny weather without smoking that shit. I sat in a small boat in the middle of the lake my lungs were full of fresh air. (yeah, now I can smell fart from the 1km distance). These moments are getting me going. 

I don't see going trough nosmoke as a war, I have started enjoying life- without smoking. This is what I wish for you who struggle. Start enjoying-at the moment you'll convince yourself that your life is much better without cigarettes you can claim yourself a winner. Of course there will be lots of hard work to do- nothing comes easy.


P.S. I feel like  I'm on a wave now. I hope I can write something good for you next week.

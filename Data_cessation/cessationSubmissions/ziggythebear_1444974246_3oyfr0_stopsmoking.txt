Third time's a charm

Quit for a whole year cold turkey back around 2012 (easier because I wasn't around smokers). Breakup and depression led to me relapsing. Quit for a very short period last year. Went on Chantix with great results. Only went through 4 weeks (starter pack) of taking it and didn't get another prescription. Thought I had it under control, but of course I didn't. Went back to smoking as I am constantly around other smokers and it's what has been natural to me for a decade.

Graduated university and am very close to getting a full time job in a field I love with follow up interview sometime next week! Thought it was a good time to try again. Don't want to waste my lunch breaks or company time being a slave to tobacco anymore.

 **Third time's a charm!**

Got myself back on Chantix and am 3 days clean. Funny enough, my doctor did the same thing on Chantix her first time and she made sure to prescribe me a starting pack along with a continuing pack.

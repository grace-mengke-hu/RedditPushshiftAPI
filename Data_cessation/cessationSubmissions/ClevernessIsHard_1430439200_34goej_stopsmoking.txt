Symptoms from quitting or Chantix?

Hello! Some backround. I quit 11 days and 22 hours ago according to my app. It certainly doesn't feel like its been that long. I have been on Chantix for almost 4 weeks now, and at the start of the 2nd week I cut my use down to half(from a full pack), and quit completely days later. 


I have been getting stressed and angry in the afternoons. Could it be the medicine or from quitting? I feel like after almost 12 I days should be pretty much over the worst of it by now. During the day I am great, its just the evenings. The only problems I have had from the medicine was a few dreams and then when I accidentally miss 2 doses of the medicine I get very depressed, very fast. 


I guess I want to see how long it took everyone else to feel 100% better. I remember quitting when I found out I was pregnant being a lot easier.

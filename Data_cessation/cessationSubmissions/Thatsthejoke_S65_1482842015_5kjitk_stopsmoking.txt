Serious but so serious: Feel bad when we stumble?

Brass tax. smoker for 8 years. although petty amount for some we are all in the same boat.
Some fall off the vessel of self discovery and ignore the life preserver that is a lesson, only to drift. others feel a sense of self shame for getting wet and grabbing it when they vowed to themselves never to fall again. some stay on the boat happy as a clam, lucky buggers.

Now as some of you readers that have docked on your journey only to be reminiscing on your trip might have guessed, i' am soaking wet, shivering, i fell off. but this time I'm not filled with disappointment, but find myself wondering why i should be. the way i see it is the slipping off dose not send you adrift to sea, unless this is your means.  If you have the realization that their is a choice to go back to the ship dry off you cloths and continue that is all that matters.
why feel bad? there's no point. so you had a smoke, so what. numbers, dates who cares, only you. you just need to remember when waiting for your cloths to dry is that you wanted to be a passenger on this and I'm on the right track. look around some have been on for years others for days but guess what, were all in the same boat.

please take your complains to: first mate /r/Alcohol and second mate /r/lifeissadsometimes for telling me it was ok to take a splash in the deep blue. but hey i grabbed the life preserver that is a lesson. thanks for always throwing it.

Edit. Like i said in that last paragraph.

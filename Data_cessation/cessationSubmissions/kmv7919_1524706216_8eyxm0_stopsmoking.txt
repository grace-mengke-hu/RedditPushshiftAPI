2nd day

I started smoking as the typical “social” smoker at 16. I’m 38 now and on my second day of trying to quit for good. I smoked everyday anywhere between a half a pack to a pack in a half. I only quit once in 2012 for about a month because of a pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. It took me years to get pregnant only to lose it and I haven’t been able to get pregnant again. I don’t blame cigarettes for that but smoking does lower the chance of conceiving.  Then a few years ago I was diagnosed with moderate gum disease and have been on 3 month cleanings since. It shocked me because I’m so OCD about oral hygiene.  My hygienist tells me I’m stable every cleaning. I have yet to be told there is improvement. 

My dad smoked at least a pack a day for 51 years up until this past February. He quit cold turkey the day we got the news no one ever wants to hear (especially smokers). He was diagnosed with Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer and is currently doing chemo/radiation. It’s an aggressive cancer and has a 2% survival rate if it spreads. He’s so sick right now.  He went from a 240lb strong muscular man without any major health condition to being weak, fatigued and every other side effect you can imagine from chemo. He goes to the cancer center pretty much daily. Sometimes just to get a shot in his stomach to keep his blood count up. 

 I came on here to read stories and keep myself motivated so I NEVER pick up another cigarette. If anyone is on the fence of quitting or wants to light up again; read my story. I hope no one will ever have to go through the pain and suffering like my poor dad is going through right now. 

Thanks all!

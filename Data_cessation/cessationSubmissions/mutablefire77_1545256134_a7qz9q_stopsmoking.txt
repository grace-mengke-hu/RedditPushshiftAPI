Does using the patch really count?

I’ve stopped smoking using the patch. I’m in the beginning of the journey and will gradually use patches with less nicotine over the next 4-5 weeks. So for the first month of the journey, I’m not 100% free. I struggle with idea that my smoke free status is fake while I’m using them.

Catch 22 but not.

I bought my most favouritest cigarettes online 2-3 months ago online. Clove smokes, the kind that make your mouth numb and your whole body relaxed and I FUCKING THOUGHT customs decided to get rid of them and be like we arent letting these into the country. 

In the meantime I quit smoking 2 weeks ago, cold turkey, and I can make decisions again and spend time actually doing things instead of anxiety chain smoking. And even my depression feels less blurry. Now I have a carton of basically the heroin of my nicotine addiction and I am JONESING and jesus, I dont want to do this.

I FEEL AMAZING!

After a little more than a month without smoking, and no nicotine at all, I feel fucking excellent! Please excuse the french, it seems necessary. I have made an effort to get back into gym and I have made that stick as well. I have even reduced my caffeine intake as well.

Point is, I really do feel good. I ran a 5km Parkrun this morning. I really pusbed myself but afterward I felt amazing. I'm still feeling amazing.

Thank you fellow redditors, your support certainly helped this stick.

To the smokers, do not question the benefits of quitting. Sure it feels shit initially and is seriously challenging but after you get it right... Unbelievable reward.

At this point I barely even think about smoking, even though my girlfriend vapes. I cannot remember my last craving.

If I can do it, you can! Quit smoking now! Put that shit out amd feel good about it!

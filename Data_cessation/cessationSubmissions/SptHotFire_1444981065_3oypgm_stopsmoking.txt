3 years clean. Fucked up.

Well I went 3 years, killing it. Quit on a stubborn bet back in the day and it stuck. Through all kinds of emotional shit I never had a smoke, was pretty proud of myself. Then I broke. 

Me and my lady had the worst fight we've ever had and I lost it, snagged a cig from a buddy and crushed it as hard as I could. I'm not proud, I regret it. I always thought I'd never dare touch another. Anyway, I haven't smoked since but the mental game is back. 

I even unsubscribed from this sub, but now I'm back on it. The reminder helps.

I'm happy this sub exists. Thanks.

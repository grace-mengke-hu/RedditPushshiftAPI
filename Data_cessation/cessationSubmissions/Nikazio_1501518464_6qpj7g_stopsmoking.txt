Any advice on helping someone quit?

My girlfriend is trying to quit and is almost one week smoke free!!!

I wanted to ask those of you who quit or are trying to quit, what did you find useful from friends and relatives, and if sometimes they did something that didn't help at all, so I can learn from your experiences!

Is there an app where I can keep tally of how many I smoke a day?

The most I've ever gotten to is about a pack a day. A couple times in the past there have been times where I might have a craving but it doesn't taste as good to me as it once did. Eventually without realizing it, i'll be cutting back. Until I just don't feel like it. Obviously this is my body/brain saying "Stop it already!" 

The longest I quit was a month before I began again. So I'm curious is there an app kind of like I think its called quit now so I can see how far I am? If this keeps up then I might come to where I will feel ready to stop altogether. Thanks for any help!

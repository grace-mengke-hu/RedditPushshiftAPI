Here we go again! One cigarette left and hopefully I'm home free!

Hey guys! I tried quitting last year with quite the failure, but I recently just picked up an activity that really is motivating me to quit, running. Running a mile is a challenge for me, but I can do it in ~11 minutes. The thing that sucks is running and not being able to breathe, which I realize is probably because of the cigarettes. So here it is, I am done. I'm going to finish my last cigarette tonight and tomorrow is a new smoke free day.

 *Hopefully*.

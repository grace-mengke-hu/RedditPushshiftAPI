Vaping versus Smoking

I'm now only 6 days not smoking and feeling very proud of myself! Never thought I would last 6 hours! Can't do it cold turkey though and I am using E cigarette. I do wonder how this effects my health though as I do read some bad things about them. Thing is they are really helping me keep off the cigs. I'd be interested in others views on the E Cigarette debate? By the way I've read some great posts on here from quitters and I'm impressed with the willpower of you all! ðŸ˜€

Stopping now, can't wait to breathe freely and smell things again

So I was a pack smoker. 20 y/o, male, smoked for approximately 6 years every day. It dominated my youth but it won't dominate my future. I lurked this subreddit for a few months, waiting to make my move but after several attempts without announcing it I decided it would keep me motivated to have a badge and share my journey to become a non-smoker.

Here are some goals I'm trying to achieve or what keeps me motivated:

-I started meditating in summer now I want to fully enjoy it and benefit from better breathing

-Always hated getting ill and having the disgusting taste of cigarettes in my mouth

-I want to get rid of the fact that I'm addicted, the urge to smoke when I am not concentrated. I'm currently writing a novel and plan to make a living with writing because other things didn't work for me

-I want to strengthen my personality as I suffered from depression and want to change my opinion on the world

-my time management and organisation skills are a completely mess, cigarettes dominate every schedule, it's time to change


-many of my friends who I smoked with regulary stopped as well. I was the strongest smoker but there lies no strength in a weakness. 


With that said, I hereby smoked my last cigarette. Thank you to all of you who made it through and are still trying, you people show me that it is possible to live without this most stupid decision I made in my life. I'll keep you updated.

Quit 2 days ago, but planning to smoke at a wedding next Saturday.

Hi everyone, I finally decided to quit smoking (age 26, have been a smoker for 7 years). It's my 2nd day now, and once every hour I have to fight really hard against my cravings but I think it's normal and I can manage.
When I quit, I thought that I would be able handle smoking on social drinking occasions and wouldn't start again the next mornings. On this concept, I want to share with you a dilemma of mine. Next Saturday, a high school friend of mine is getting married. This is going to be a once in a life time event, lot's of old friends are coming and I really want to enjoy it. I KNOW, I would enjoy my time a lot more if I smoked while I drank and socialized and basically enhance my fun. Otherwise I will need to spend all my energy trying to fight the urge and most likely be irritated and be negative the whole night. All of my friends are smokers too, and the wedding will be at an open place, so it would be even more difficult and irritating. I just want to spend one night smoking while I get drunk, chat and feast and celebrate my friend's wedding. My question is, would it be a big deal if I just smoked that one night, and continue from where I left off the next morning?

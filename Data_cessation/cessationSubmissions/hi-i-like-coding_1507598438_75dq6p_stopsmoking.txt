Wow, 7 days...

This is the longest I've gone without nicotine. My last serious attempt I made it to 5 days. I think I'm almost through it, although I will stay vigilant and not let my guard down.

I still find myself thinking about it at times... and I must not let my guard down, and "declare victory" and think that it's over... must... remain vigilant...

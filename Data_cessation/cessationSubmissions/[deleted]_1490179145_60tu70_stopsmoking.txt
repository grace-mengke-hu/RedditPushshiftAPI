One hundred fifteen days celebration post!

I literally feel like a new human, i had deep deepresion and got out of it only because i "killed" my old self by changing so hard and it feels just soo good, i think that throught this half a year i changed and learned more than i ever did in my whole life. 

You guys are totally awesome and helped me to achieve something i didnt even considered to be possible, almost everyday i read this sub and apply most of it to my life to be better and better, you didnt only told me how to quit smoking but also how to live happy life. 

Seriously, you're the best thing that happened in my life.

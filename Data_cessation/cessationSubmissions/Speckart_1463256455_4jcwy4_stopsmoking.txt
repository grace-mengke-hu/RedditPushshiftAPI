Did you help someone quit smoking? (and should we?)

Hi Reddit! It turns out my pops smokes since he's 16 (now 61). 
He smokes a pack a day, coughs a lot, looks 10 years older than he is, and I'm guessing it won't be long until sh** hits the fan and both our lives are affected negatively.

 


Most people say I should let him do what he wants, as he's a grown-up. But I've talked to him and realised he's uninformed and being super dumb about it.

 

Stuff he says:  
-*"Smoking is harmless. Worse is to inhale the car's fumes."*  
-*"I don't inhale the smoke, I just taste it in my mouth, like people do with cigars."*  
-*"I've seen soccer players die in the field."*  
-*"I once ran against my brother in law and won."*  
-*"It's a personal taste thing."*  
-*"The heart can't trump the brain."*  
-*"It doesn't harm me because I'm a healthy person."*  

 

So yeah. As you figured, he either has a really low IQ, he tells lies (and probably to himself) or he's just really uninformed. My opinion is: all of those combined.

 

I've tried giving him information, but he dismisses everything with those kind of excuses.

 

**Did you go through something similar? What did you end up doing?**

 

Do you recommend any **websites with cool facts** about smoking? Or **documentaries/shorts** that may help him open his eyes? 

 

**TLDR:** my father smokes a lot and I'm trying to help him quit. He's at a stage where he doesn't even realise there's a problem.

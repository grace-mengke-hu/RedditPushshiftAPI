It’s my third day

I decided last week that on Sunday at 8 am I was not gonna smoke any more. The past two days (especially yesterday) were super difficult, but I did it. This is the longest I have been smoke-free since I was 14. 
I have heard from several people that the third day is the hardest, and I’m worried I might fail today. I’m not using NRT or anything but I do keep an unlit smoke in my car for when I’m driving( I have no desire to have it but it’s helpful to hold when I’m driving) I really don’t want to let myself down.  What works best for you when you have cravings? Do they ever go away? Or do you get better at ignoring them?

The struggle is real.

I have been having a really hard time quitting. I havenâ€™t bought a pack of cigarettes since September  19. I quit for 2 weeks and made the mistake of taking a hit during a stressful situation. I smoke anywhere from 1 to 4 cigarettes a day. Some days I go with none. I quit again 2 weeks ago and went a whole week then back at it again :-/ so frustrated

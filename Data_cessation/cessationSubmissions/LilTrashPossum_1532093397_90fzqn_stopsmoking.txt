Reaffirming my smoke-free-ness in a time of stress (2.5 mo w/o cigarettes)

Today is going to be a very stressful day. I just got back comments on my MS thesis from one of my reviewers- the final draft is due today. I woke up and immediately felt that ball of dread cement itself in my stomach. It was official. Today was going to suck. 

I had  this thought, that maybe if I just picked up a pack and had a cigarette, maybe I could get through this. As I filled my lungs with nicotine, I could fill myself with the same cynical til-death-do-I-work determination that got me through most of my program. However, just because something has worked in the past doesn't mean it is still the solution. I used to be a smoker. Now I am not. 

Today, instead of smoking to relieve my stress, I will

* Get myself a good coffee to keep me alert, or
* Take a walk around campus to clear my head, or
* Compliment someone to buoy my own spirits, or
* Browse r/stopsmoking to remind myself I am not alone in this fight, and
* Repeat this mantra:

I can do this- I can live my life without cigarettes.

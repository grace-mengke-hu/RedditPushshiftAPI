Tomorrow is my quit day!

So, I've been trying, on and off, for the past week to quit smoking. I've decided that my major issue is I keep giving myself outs. "I wasn't planning on quiting today." "(This small thing) stressed me out  too much today." So, a few days ago, I decided that I would set an official day, tomorrow. I go back to work tomorrow, and I can control myself alot better at work. I'm going to reread Allen Carrs book tonight. Any tips or mantras that helped you on your first few days would be appreciated!

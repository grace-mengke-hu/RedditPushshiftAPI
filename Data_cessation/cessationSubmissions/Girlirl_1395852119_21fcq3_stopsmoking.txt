Troll Body 101: Quit a bad habit? Get sick.

I didn't expect to be calling in sick from work. So far after quitting, these ailments have been compounding: 

* Day 2 - intense night sweats and insomnia. 
* Day 3 - headache from too much oxygen, body tingling sensation.
* Day 4 - sore throat and full-body aches.  
* Day 5 - coughing. and a random, 2 secs, intensely fast heart beat.

I think the night sweats are the most alarming. I'll wake up around 4:45 and be hot/freezing because of the pool of sweat. My hair and skin and blanket completely soaked. I'm looking at it like, my body is letting me know how pissed off it's been at what I've done to it. 

Smoking since 17, over 30 now, with intermittent quits at about 1 pack a day. Over the last few years I've managed to stick to about 7 cigarettes a day, quit for 150 days, fell off. This time is the first time I've experienced the "quitters flu" and I think it's my body sending me the SOS that I need. 

I've been supplementing the dopamine lack by giving extra hugs and kisses, smiling, watching comedy, and even lifting my hands in the air to feel accomplished (learned that from a TED talk :)

If you have a passion, let that be your strength. I love martial arts and want to have the stamina to actually be great.

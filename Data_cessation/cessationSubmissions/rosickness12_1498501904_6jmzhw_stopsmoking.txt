Resetting badge and happy to do so

Went 26 days.  First night of a weekend resort wedding I craved one for a few minutes but  didn't smoke.  2nd night I did have 2 which in a way is successful considering once the streak is broken I'd usually smoke many more.  Smoked two more Sunday.  The streak durations are getting longer and the cravings are less intense.  Keep it up.

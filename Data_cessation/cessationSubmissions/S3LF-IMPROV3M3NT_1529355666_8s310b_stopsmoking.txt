Quit tobacco since June 6th, can't tell anyone in-person so I'm celebrating with you guys!

Basically I walked to the gas station nearby and they weren't selling cigarettes anymore because of a permit issue. I was too lazy to go somewhere else as I don't have a car, so I just decided to quit right then and there. 

Which got me thinking about the war on drugs. And how I held the view that prohibition would create a black market and possibly increase use over just legalizing and educating. But considering this experience, I think if you make it enough of a hassle to get something, people won't go out of there way to find shady black markets unless it's ingrained into their traditions/culture like alcohol. 

On another note, I have no idea how people chain smoke a pack a day. I just smoked for the head rush and I was content with the buzz for like a few hours. Considering 8 hours of sleep, you'd have to smoke a cig every 48 minutes... wouldn't that just make you unpleasantly dizzy and nauseous? 

Anyway, it feels good to tell someone I quit. Or at least am attempting to. I can't tell people IRL because I live with my parents and sometimes go out to smoke weed and if they ask where I went I need to have cigarettes as an excuse :P 

I do have my worries about quitting though. I've been having trouble sleeping, don't know if that's quitting related. Also, I heard that after you quit smoking you gain weight because of no more nicotine rush (I'm already chubby and don't wanna get fatter). Other than that it's alright.

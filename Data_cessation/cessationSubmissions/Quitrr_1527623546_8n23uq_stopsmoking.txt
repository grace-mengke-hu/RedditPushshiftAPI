100 day mark

Just hit 100 days. That was a big milestone for me. Everything in my life is better since I quit. I have got healthier, started exercising, lost weight, and I am a lot happier now. I am glad I left that 20+ year addiction at nearly a pack a day behind. Thanks to everyone here. You can do this.

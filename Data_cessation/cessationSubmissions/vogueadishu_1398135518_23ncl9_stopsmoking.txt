Day 5 without cigarettes.... Unexpected side effects.

I quit cold turkey after 18 years. My last cigarette was Wednesday night... I expected withdrawals (not too bad actually), I expected to be mean and stressed... 

I didn't expect to cry for 8 hours straight over nothing. I didn't expect to have to piss every 20 minutes. I didn't expect to have word dreams... 

But I can say that I'm proud of myself and I feel great. 

Sorry if the spelling or anything is bad. I'm on my phone and completely unrelated I took a klonopin and am a little in and out at the moment lol.

Blood cough has SCARED me. HELP

I've been smoking since last three years. till now the most cigarettes i do in a day is 4-5.  I've caught cough some time ago, i took it lightly but today when i spitted the cough out i saw blood and this my first so I'm very shocked. 
First thing i did was Google it and it says that it's a serious condition, no self medication points mentioned in many blogs. 
I am little scared to go to doctor because I'm scared of the bad news which is if I cut the chase then it's 'Cancer'.. 
Please can any body guide me the next steps

Advice for a completely overwhelmed person?

Hey everyone 

I’m trying to get back out of smoking and I’m looking for some helpful tips for quitting or maybe just general support maybe. I quit for a while last year and did well for a few months leading up to a major surgery and afterwards while I was recovering, to the point that I quit having the wheezing and extra mucus symptoms. I started smoking when I was 16 because just about everyone around me did and I still find myself surrounded by people who smoke because the drummer in my band chain smokes and all of my work friends also smoke. 

Work is really what drove me back to it initially because it’s a coping mechanism that I’m used to using for dealing with that stress. I hate that I fell back on it so hard and I’m just having a hard time with working 50 hours a week, my wife deciding we should get a second dog even though she’s traveling constantly so I’m stuck taking care of both of them and just generally feeling overwhelmed. 

P.S. sorry if this seems like I’m rambling, I just feel like there are so many things that trigger my desire to smoke that I don’t quite know where to start..

ONE MONTH! Thank you, everyone!

I joined this sub and lurked around for about a month before I finally took the leap after four years of smoking. I had been trying to quit for months, mostly because I'm a 23 year old with high blood pressure. Even though I was killing myself and making my condition worse, I couldn't find the strength to stick to my guns... until you.

Both my fiance and I quit on new years. I'm the kind of person that needs achievements/trophies in order to motivate myself, so I put out my last cigarette (half unsmoked) in a wine bottle and corked it full of smoke. I don't remember the brand of wine but the only lettering on the bottle is a question mark, inside of which I wrote the date. The bottle is on the bookshelf in my living room to remind me that I called it quits on my own terms. I have put myself in every single situation I used to need a cigarette to get through... and I powered through all of them. My finance was a huge help, but honestly I don't think I would have made it without this sub. I believe that every one of you deserves partial credit for my milestone. Your courage and ability to overcome struggles inspired me and I don't think I will ever be able to thank you all enough. I wish all of you the best and am here for anybody else who wants to better themselves. 

Stay excellent, my friends!

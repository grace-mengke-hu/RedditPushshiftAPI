I'm done - I've said it before...

...But I truly mean it this time. 

I've been smoking for coming up to two years. I started for the most ridiculous reasons: My ex started smoking. I absolutely (like REALLY) hated it, but I figured if I were smoking too it would no longer be an issue. Not one of my best decisions.

I've tried to quite seriously a number of times, but this time I know I'll succeed. I need to break this addiction for good.

Been a lurker for a while but never posted before, so hoping this'll give me some extra strength :)

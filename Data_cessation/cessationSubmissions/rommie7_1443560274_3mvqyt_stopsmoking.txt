Smoked for 10 Years, 4th time i quit, i always make it to 3 months and fail afterwards, Advice?

Always the same story, i decide to quit, it's extremely easy for me in the start, cold turkey, and i don't feel any withdrawal effects.
After 3 months i'm starting to feel nostalgic as a part of me has been ripped, as in now that i'm a not a smoker and I am a responsible adult, And i don't want to be one.
Going from no craving at all and no desire to smoke at around the mark of 6 months this is all i think about all day long.
So strange.. anyone has this too?

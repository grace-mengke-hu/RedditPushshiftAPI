day 1

I've been trying to quit for over year and a half. Today my father had a heart attack. I don't think he's a smoker but I know he chews  Nicorette. So I wonder if sometimes he smokes. But he's on a ventilator and is sedated now. I flew home to be with my family. And I threw my last pack of cigarettes away. I could never put my mom through this and if I keep smoking it will be me. Smoking sucks. And made a pledge today to never smoke again. And I'm keeping it.

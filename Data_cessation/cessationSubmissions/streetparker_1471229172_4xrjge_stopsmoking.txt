Additive-free cigarettes vs Regular cigarettes?

Does anybody have any actual facts on whether additive free cigarettes such as American Spirits are better than regular ones such as Camel Filters?

I looked around for more info on this online, and was dumbfounded by an abundance of most annoying and illogical answers majority of people give to this question. It's as if nobody understands the question or even English language. Yes, we all know that inhaling smoke itself is bad either way. That is NOT the question whatsoever.

It's about **inhaling smoke with chemicals vs inhaling smoke without chemicals**. Period. So is there a difference? Are lungs, or anything else in the body affected differently by the smoke with additives, or there really is absolutely no difference?

Even studies I found address this question in a very poor manner, and do not pose the question in the correct way:

It's as if the whole anti-smoking community are trying to avoid answering this very simple question. 

How can something that has less damaging substance added to it not be "safer"? So a cigarette with 6 chemicals in it is just as bad as a cigarette with 900,000 chemicals in it? That would mean that the chemicals have no negative impact on the human body whatsoever, and they're completely healthy to inhale. Is that the case? I doubt it.

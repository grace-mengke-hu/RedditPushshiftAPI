Feeling free

So I'm new here, and haven't smoked in over a week and I can't even tell you how good I feel. I'm taking champix for the 3rd time and have tried to quit so many times over the years.  I've tried to quit using the patch, the gum, zyban and made it 4 days cold turkey once.  I'm 39 and have smoked for an embarrassingly long time (since I was 8ðŸ˜ž).  I watched my mom pass away (twice actually, they said she had the flu and would pull through if we revived and intubated her...unfortunately after 9 days and many tests it was just that the disease had damaged her lungs to the point where she couldn't dispell carbon dioxide anymore) in January from emphysema.  My grandfather passed away at 72 from the same thing (my mother is took care of him and he passed away at her home) and my mom was only 66 years old. Every cigarette since then has been laden with guilt, hatred, and an ever-present vision of my daughters sitting by my bed as I take my last breath, a horrible experience to say the least.  I want to live and this past week I feel more alive, more relaxed and more comfortable than I can ever remember being.  I know that I will never touch another cigarette again. I still crave (think of) them, but as soon as I remind myself that I didn't enjoy them, I hated having to smoke and I am in love with not being a slave to them, I am free and have a chance of not getting that horrible disease now the thought of a cigarette is laden with disgust and it's gone as quickly as it came.  Not like when I've tried before and failed because I thought I was missing something...i feel free, relieved and so damn happy :-) the only thing I've replaced it with is water, I do drink a lot more water now. Going to hang out here and make sure that I stay smoke free forever, and give encouragement for those who are struggling too :-)

How to encourage my grandma to quit?

Hi everyone! So I just posted to brag about how stoked I am that I made it past two months. I just got out of the service and I'm living with my grandma, who smokes, before I go to college in a few months.

She has smoked for almost forty years now and has COPD. She sounds so awful. She'll cough until she can't breath for almost a minute and has very high blood pressure. She is 66. Last week it got up to 220 at which point she went to the hospital.

She smokes in the house and after being pretty foul about me quitting she came around and only smokes in her bathroom now. I can barely smell it. We used to smoke a lot together as we are very close and it used to be a huge trigger for me. Still kinda is but I'm very resolute in this. She really doesn't want me to start again and hides her smokes just in case.

I have tried bringing up her quitting a few times, gently. She insists that she likes it and she will smoke even if it kills her. I'm very worried about her and I am not ready to lose her any time soon. Has anyone had any success in convincing a relative to quit? I know you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves yada yada yada but hey I have to try. 

Thanks and once again you guys are amazing. This sub has been so helpful for me.

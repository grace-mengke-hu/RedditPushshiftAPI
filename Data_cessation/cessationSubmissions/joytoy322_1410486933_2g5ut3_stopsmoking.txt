How have your dreams changed since day 1?

In the first week of quitting, I had intense vivid dreams of smoking a full cigarette. Maybe even a couple before waking up sweating bullets unsure if I'd actually done it or not. 

Those lasted the first 3 weeks until I started having these dreams where I'd be with a group of friends and I'd put a cigarette in my mouth, light it, but not smoke it. 

I had that dream up until about 2 weeks ago where I started having this dream where I smoke a cigarette in the morning and come to this subreddit to tell you guys that I had one in the morning but it's alright because I'm still quitting.

Of course, I haven't (and will not) break for anything. But these dreams don't seem to follow any pattern. I mean, I not waking up panicked anymore, but they're still pretty strange.

What about you guys??

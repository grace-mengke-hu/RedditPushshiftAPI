Need an instant craving stopper?

Say you're at work, and one of your co-workers is stepping out for a smoke, and you think to yourself, "that sounds AWESOME! I want a cigarette! What harm could just one little smoke do?" But you know you're quitting, and you will hate yourself if you have that cigarette that they're just dieing to bum you. Wait until they get back from their little excursion, and just take a whiff of what they smell like afterward, and think about it. I guarantee, you'll remember at least one of the biggest benefits of not being a smoker. Carry on about your day NOT smelling like garbage.

I'm 2 months 24 days in and I had a cigarette on Saturday whilst drinking....

I've had a horrible few weeks personally and it felt almost justified, I didn't beat myself up over it and the rest of the weekend went fine. But now all I can think about is having another one. I know I don't want to, but why is the craving more intense now than it ever was in the beginning?!

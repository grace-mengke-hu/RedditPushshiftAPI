On quitting smoking...

It's been a little over 3 months since I quit and I still find it really hard to not satiate the need elsewhere. That's been the biggest problem for me quitting, I either end up drinking more, or eating more. I am not sure what to do about this, I don't have a really strong urge to smoke again, but everything else has significantly increased. Does anyone have a recommendation as to what helped them not take up something else that's either just as bad or worse?

Coughing up tar

I couldn't find another post with this topic.

I'm coughing up black specs and mucus after a month and a half of no cigs (:D) I googled to see examples if they looked similar but the specs in my mucus look different and less exaggerated than what I've found. Has anyone else who has quit had this experience? I can upload a pic of an example if anyone wants to see it.

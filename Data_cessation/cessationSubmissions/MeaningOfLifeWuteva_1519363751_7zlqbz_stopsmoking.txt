What do you tell yourself, when a craving hits?

After 1 1/2 months of preparing myself mentally, im finaly gonna quit cigarettes tomorrow and be a happy non-smoker. (sorry, i had to type it out...) I think, its all about creating an automated way of responding to the thought of smoking. So id like to know, what do you tell yourself, when you crave a cig or think of smoking? Thanks for answering and for being such a supportive community!

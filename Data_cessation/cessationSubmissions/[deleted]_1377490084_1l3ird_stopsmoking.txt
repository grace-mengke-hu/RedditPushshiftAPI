Tempted

I'm new here.  Figured there must be a subreddit for people quitting and sure enough there was.  

I quit about three weeks ago.  Smoked down to my last two cigarettes, put the pack in my desk, and didn't touch them until tonight.  

I got a bad, baaad craving and started thinking about those last two cigarettes.  What's the harm in smoking them, right?  Just two more.  That's it.  Two more and I'll never smoke again.  I fought it and then I turned on Breaking Bad to take my mind off it.  Of course the first scene is a closeup of a guy taking a drag of a cigarette.  

So I caved.  I lit up.  And it smelled and tasted so bad I couldn't even bring myself to inhale.  Took the cigarette out of my mouth, broke it into pieces and threw it away.  Grabbed my last cigarette from the pack and disposed of it as well.  

Somehow I survived this moment of weakness.  You guys can, too.  Be strong.

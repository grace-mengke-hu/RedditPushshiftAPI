I've been 36 days smoke free and I'm super proud of my achievement, but my friends think I'm very annoying cause I brag too much :(

I've been smoke free for 36 days and I'm
Craving free and I've been able to go to parties with smokers and not smoke. I'm constantly sharing my smoke free journey with my acquiantances to motivate them to stop smoking or if someone is considering the idea be of support to them (my sister who will start trying to have a baby this year and hasn't been able to quit or my over weight friend who's been dealing with health issue derived from her obessity). My sister in particulAr is very proud of me but my friend thinks that I brAg too much, and as I've told her before I only brag because I am very proud of how I've handled my new smoke free life. Have you delt with a similar situation?? Have you helped someone quit? Have you become a presumptuous quitter ??

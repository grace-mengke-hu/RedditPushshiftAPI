I am getting tired of lying...

I told my girlfriend that I would stop smoking for good, but when I am not with her the urge to light one up always gets the best of me. I tell her that I have not smoked for months, but it is obviously a blatant lie, and I am getting tired of it.

Could anyone here help me get over my urges to smoke? Any healthy substitutes would really help. Thanks

EDIT: Thanks for all the help guys, I will try my best to keep in mind all of the advice you guys gave me. Wish me luck! I will try living a smoke-free life starting now.

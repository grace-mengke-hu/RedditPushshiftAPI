Aflac: today at work

Aflac rep: Are you a tobacco user? 
Me: No

Guys, I feel good this run. I'm using Allen Carrs method. Because it basically brainwashes you with the truth, which I find is the most helpful. I've tried every method before and most recently was using a vape pen. I'm 10 days completely nicotine free. All I really did was pray and meditate for over a week whilst still vaping or smoking then one morning I woke up, got ready for work and made it to the office without a puff. Then lunch, then I made it home. I goofed off, made a milkshake, I let myself do nothing, I played gtav. Then I made 3 days no problem, and making 3 has always been the hardest to me before. All said I think I've had 2-3 craving's at all, and I was around smokers both times. The key for me this time has been the meditating I did ahead of quitting. Like I said I woke up not even thinking I was quitting, my brain was just mentally prepared to take it on and it decided to go for it. Other than that all I can say is get a copy of quit smoking now with the cd, it's about $2 less than easyway,  which is the same book without cd. Hope this help someone out there, thanks for the support.

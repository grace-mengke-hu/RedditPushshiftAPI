12 days since I decided to quit

It's been 12 days for me now and I think the first week was the hardest. I had bad headaches for days, I was irritable. It has gotten better since then. I highly recommend the smoke free app. It is amazing. I'm still struggling with the cravings everyday, but I won't give up.

My Last Pack

I've decided this is the last pack I'm buying! I definitely love smoking, but can't deal with all the negatives I get from it anymore. I'm only 20 and have been smoking for 6 years, it's time to quit before I end up smoking for the rest of my life. I'm so happy there's a sub reddit for this, because I'm going to need all the support I can get.
Congrats to all the people on here who have quit, and good luck to all the people trying.

I'm quitting today! Need a bit of advice please

I've smoked 1/2 to 1 pack a day for about 9 years. Over the past week or so, I've just been thinking more and more about quitting. Yesterday was the first day I actually started to feel guilty each time I went out for a smoke... so this morning, I just threw away the cigs I had left and bought a few packs of gum instead of my usual 27s. Been reading through this sub and it is definitely encouraging! I know I'm in for a rough road but I plan to stick to this!

One question for you guys: I haven't told anyone in my personal life about this plan yet. I've read that (paraphrasing horribly here) sometimes if you tell others about your goal, it can work against you psychologically because talking about it satisfies the same urge/desire as actually DOING it. Do you guys think I should reach out to friends and loved ones for support, or play this close to the chest and hold myself accountable?

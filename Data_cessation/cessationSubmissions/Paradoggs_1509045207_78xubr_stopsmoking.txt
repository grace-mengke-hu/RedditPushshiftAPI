Stuff to do when you're having a craving?

So long story short, I work 12 hours a day with a break of 15 min every 2 hours. I have gotten used to smoking 3 cigarettes in each break. It's my 2nd day since I quit but apart from the cravings I also have the desire to smoke because I've been doing so in since I was 18 (5 years ago). If I don't smoke, that 15 min seems an eternity and time wasted.

Any suggestions on what to do to fiddle the thoughts and cravings away? Gum or Tic Tacs don't work btw.

P.S. Been getting massive headaches and hunger.

5 years of smoking. Please help.

A little background: I've been smoking for 5 years and every time I'm home from school, I rely on my parents supervision to quit smoking bc they absolutely hate it. Recently I've heard of a friend's uncle who was diagnosed with lung cancer and that he had a mere 2 years to live. That scared the shit outta me. I used to smoke 10-20 unfiltered a day. A SINGLE FUCKING DAY. I'm currently smoking maybe once a day, maybe less. This is only bc I'm home. I'm scared for how much I'll smoke when I go back to school and with the stress and work piling up blah blah. Any REAL genuine advice? Smoking also some what's connects me to my younger years which makes it harder to quit. Can anyone relate to that? Any feedback is appreciated.

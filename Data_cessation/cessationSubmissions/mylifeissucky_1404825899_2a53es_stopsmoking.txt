What I have learned about cold turkey...

I learned that yes, you have to be DAMN ready, not just 10 percent to 90 or so percent ready, but FUCKING ready. That was the surefire way for me. I was SO BLOODY SICK of smoking that I just up and quit on the dot at the end of trying 2 nicotine gum and getting MASSIVE headache when I tried.

I was SO ready that I could have cried. All I wanted to do is use up the cigarettes as a goodbye to them and then NEVAR buy another pack.

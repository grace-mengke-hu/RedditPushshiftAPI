One week and I am feeling great

I quit on december 30th. Right now I am feeling a sense of hightened consiousness, or atleast thats how I put it what I am feeling. Smoking did cloud my mind after all. Fought several urges in past week to smoke... just steered myself casually away from the shop. Fingers crossed on how long I can continue...

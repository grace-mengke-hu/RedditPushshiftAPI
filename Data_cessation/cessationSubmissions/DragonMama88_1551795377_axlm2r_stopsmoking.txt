Any tips?

My husband and I have decided to quit smoking. 

He's been smoking for 30+ years, I've been smoking for about 10 years.

I seem to be able to cut down to about 5 cigarettes a day or less. He's cut back from 2.5 packs to less than 1. 

Stress and boredom seem to be my triggers. Stress, boredom, and driving is his. 

Any tips for us to completely cut this out? I'm ready to be a former smoker. He wants to put them down. We don't use any nicotine replacement, no gum, no patches. 

I tried the Chantix before, but mentally it destroyed me. 

Thanks all!

sooooo... I saw the dental surgeon yesterday....

When I told him I quit, he screamed with excitement and then high fived me.  He did some x-rays, and had a look at my extraction site, and then told me based on how it's healed up and the fact that I'm done smoking, he's confident that I'm an "excellent candidate for the implant to work"... So 2 more weeks until I get that done, and then It should just be 2 more months until they put my forever tooth on it.  I CAN"T WAIT TO NOT LOOK LIKE A HILLBILLY ANYMORE! :)

Okay, tonight is the night I actually quit.

I've been smoking for about 5 years now. About 2 weeks ago I decided it was quitting time and I bought a vape. The other day I was hanging out with friends and decided to buy some cigarettes. I didn't smoke them all right then. Well tonight while I was doing laundry, I found the unfinished pack in my garage. And I was bored and waiting for my laundry to get clean and my battery was charging so I finished it.

But thats it. I'm really done. I don't want to smoke anymore. It's icky and I don't like it. It doesn't even taste as good as I used to think it did.

So hello r/stopsmoking, I'm here now and I'm stopping. :)

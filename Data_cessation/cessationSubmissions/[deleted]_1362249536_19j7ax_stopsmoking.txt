DAE have dreams of smoking long after quitting?

It's been 782 days since my last cigarette, and I mind myself having dreams here and there of sitting around casually with my smoking friends, casually having a cigarette, only to discover while trying to butt it out that I broke my chain and I have to start back over again.

I no long have any cravings and I haven't for a long long time (sign of hope for all you out there just starting the process. It gets MUCH easier!), however I still have dreams of breaking my streak.  

Anyone else have or had similar dreams after quitting?

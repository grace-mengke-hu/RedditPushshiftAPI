Buy a pack, smoke one, destroy the rest..

I can't count the number of times I've done this! I'll buy a pack just to smoke one, then I'll drowned the rest with water and throw them in the trash. I can't just throw them away cuz I know I'll be digging through the trash again at some point, knowing they're there. 

This is getting to be ridiculous! I've been trying to quit smoking for the better part of three years now. I was doing really good this time around (almost a month), but I blew it yesterday, again! The guilt I feel is intense! I know this shit going to kill me but it's so hard to let go permanently. I started on the patch today, again! and I'm hoping I can stick to the plan, again! 

I hope I can get control of this before it actually does make me sick, like real sick! :(

Quit again yesterday. So far so good!

I quit last year for about 2 months. Then I joined a band with 3 smokers. It started as just having a few darts at practice on the weekends, but eventually I started smoking every day again. Yesterday morning I was having the last one in a pack (not really enjoying it that much) and I thought, "why not try to quit?" It's been almost 2 full days now, and I am feeling pretty good about it.  

The strange thing: I had a few cravings today, and I actually kinda enjoyed them (?!?!). It felt better than having a smoke. And instead of feeling guilty for giving in, I felt good for staying strong!

A Question...

Hey everyone!

I've been lurking around here for a few days, trying to get as many tips as possible - my quit date is 14 May (tomorrow!) - I downloaded a phone app which asked what my intended date was. To be honest, I actually got a slight chill, but also a sense of great excitement when I entered 14 May 2015 @ 22:30. To finally see the date that I intend become a non-smoker kinda put things into perspective for me.

Like a lot of you, I've tried and failed a lot. But I reckon I get better every time I try. But I think the time for trying is over - the time for doing has arrived! I've smoked about a pack a day for over 20 years, and I just don't want to anymore. I really am done with it. I've skimmed through the Allen Carr book previously, but will sit down with it tomorrow evening, clear my mind, and read it slowly. I know it has a huge success rate - and along with a few other things I'm going to try to get me past the withdrawal "flu/cold" stage, I'm sure I'll nail it.

There's something that is bugging me though - and this is mainly for the non-smokers on here who have stars next to their names and have been smoke free for a few years: how does it feel to be a non-smoker **now**? You're no longer addicted, and cigarettes are no longer running/ruining your lives. But do you still feel free? Do you actually feel like a non-smoker - the way it was always meant to be? Or do you feel like an ex-smoker?

I think that's my single biggest fear - knowing that even though I'm going to rid my life of this horrible drug - that my addiction to it is somehow going to follow me around for the rest of my life as some nasty, nagging memory. Like the stigma will never disappear.

Say it isn't so! Someone tell me that once it's over, it's over forever!

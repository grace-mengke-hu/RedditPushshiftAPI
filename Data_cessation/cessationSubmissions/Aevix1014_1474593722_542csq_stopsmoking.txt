PSA For Caffeine Consuming Quitters!

"In one study, three weeks after quitting, people showed caffeine levels that were about double the caffeine level they showed while smoking. In fact, if caffeine consumption doesnâ€™t decrease after quitting, caffeine levels can remain elevated for up to 6 months. Reducing your caffeine intake by at least half when you quit smoking can help you avoid caffeine toxicity."

"For example, a smoker who usually drank two cups of coffee in the morning with a cigarette will feel stronger caffeine effects from the same two cups after quitting smoking. This is because smoking causes the body to metabolize caffeine more quickly. So, when you quit smoking and continue to drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks, your metabolism rate slows and the caffeine level in your body rises. This may cause caffeine toxicity which can result in anxiety, difficulty concentrating, impatience, insomnia, and restlessness. These symptoms are often attributed to nicotine withdrawal."

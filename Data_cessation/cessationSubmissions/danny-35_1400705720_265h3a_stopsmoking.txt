Are cheap, disposable e-cigs any good? Can someone tell me the difference between a really cheap $10 ecig and a $100 one?

I want to try e-cigs to help with kicking the habit (i know a lot of people here are very anti-ecigs, please I dont wanna have a debate about this, just a discussion on the difference between really cheap ecigs and the more expensive ones).

Has anyone quit using $10 ecigs, or are they just a waste of money?

Thanks :)

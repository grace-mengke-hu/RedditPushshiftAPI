Tried quitting, but get very short tempered after a few days. Help.

I've been smoking for about 2 years now, and just in the last year I'm up to a half a pack. I've tried quitting in the past, even reaching a month smoke free, put started again on the pipe. last couple of times I tried, I would get short tempered with people, and snap at them. I want to try quitting again but also want to control my temper.

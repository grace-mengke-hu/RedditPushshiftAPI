Help

Smokefree for almost 6 weeks. When I smoked, I (only) smoked 4/5 cigarettes in the evening so I don't get it why it still is so hard now. I work out, like a lot(always have) , and have never been this tired. It seems as if things where easier when I smoked  though I know that's probably just my mind playing tricks on me.

Any thoughts/helpfull tips?

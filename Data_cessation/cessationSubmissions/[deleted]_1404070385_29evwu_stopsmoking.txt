i don't have/want a smartphone, is there a website or something similar to a quitsmoking counter app?

like the ones that say "x cigarettes not smoked, $x saved etc."  
or maybe something even cooler that i havent thought of?  
if not, that's okay, im just looking for something to pat me on the back so i can stop fishing for back-pats irl

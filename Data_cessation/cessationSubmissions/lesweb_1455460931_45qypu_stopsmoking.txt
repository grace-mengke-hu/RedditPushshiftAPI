Help out a Brother! Having a bad day.

My life is fine. Nothing putting stress on me. Just an average mundane day...but it feels like from the moment I woke up this morning I have just wanted to light up. Been really struggling to forget about the itch today. Tried all my usual tricks. That itch will not go away. Thankfully all the shops around me are closed. I have a vape stick, but I've not used it yet. I don't want any of that nasty shit in my body. I don't know what I want you to say to me. My quitting method has been to lock myself in my house for the whole month. I'm half way through now but I know if I was outside today I would be in serious danger of killing someone or even worse...getting back into my old bad habit.

Panic Attacks, and did someone say something about dreams?



Smoking for everyone is different. For this guy it was about poor stress management. Very poor. Cigarettes hid a lot of that from me for the last 12 years. 

I was in a high pressure situation at work, my attention was being pulled 4 different ways. Only 1 was of high priority and it was the one where I made a mistake. No one got hurt no one likely died. I'm fairly certain no one actually lost anything of any value besides 15-20 minutes of time. (time is valuable I know)

But when this happened and I realized it was my mistake, everyone on the planet might as well have been unable to breathe and they were all suffocating while they also plotted their revenge and my demise. That's  what I was reacting to, not a problem that had to be fixed but a world that would get me for making a mistake. That's how I do everything.

152 days ago I would have a cigarette to take the edge off, but I didn't even realize that I shouldn't be reacting they way I was. 

But yesterday I realized it because it was so damn overwhelming I had to run and hide after. As if something bad actually happened I was damn near shaking. 

Cigaretts are different for every one and for me they were a part of a life of poor stress management. A way of thinking that tied me up in knots on the inside, had me living with a level of tension higher than necessary. As I quit I'm watching that unravel. 



Also dreams are getting weird.

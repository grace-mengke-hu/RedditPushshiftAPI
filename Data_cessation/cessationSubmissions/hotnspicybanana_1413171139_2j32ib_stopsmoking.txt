Today Is the Day

I've posted that I'm going to quit before, but this time I'm serious. I bought a vaporizer today, used it sparingly throughout the day and I haven't had a single craving. I've smoked for 7 years, a pack a day. I want to start exercising and getting in shape, and I'm pretty sure the cigarettes are causing me headaches. I will become a non-smoker, and I'm excited to change my life. Every time I've tried to quit, I've failed, but not this time.

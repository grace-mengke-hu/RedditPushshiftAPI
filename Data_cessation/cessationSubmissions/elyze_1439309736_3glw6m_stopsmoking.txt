How to help my boyfriend quit smoking/how to deal with his moods.

So in one week, it is my boyfriends birthday. He has decided he will quit cold turkey that day, and I couldn't be happier for him!

I'm an occasional smoker, maybe 2 packs a month. Obviously I'm not going to smoke when I'm with him anymore. What else can I do to help him stay on track and support him?

Also, I'm a bit worried about his mood. We've only been together a month, and I know this can put a lot of pressure on a still-fragile relationship. He said last time he tried to quit, he ate 120 bagel bites in 2 days, and was incredibly irritable. Anything I can do to remind myself not to take his irritability personally?

Thabks!

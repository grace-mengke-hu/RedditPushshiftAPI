Lost count of how many times I have tried to quit but here I go again.

Pretty much what the title says. I've been a pretty heavy smoker since I was about 16/17 years old and tried to pack them in multiple times with no success. 

I was on an ecig for a few months but eventually relapsed to where I was before.  I am now on day 3 and I don't feel half as bad as I thought I was going to. Might be because this time I admitted to myself for the first time ever that I am an addict and I can beat this..

I'll admit it was probably the fear of things not being the same again with not smoking that hindered me for a long time. Only thing I'm really dreading is when I go out drinking which is a rarity in itself now because that is how I started smoking in the first place.

Just hoping the rest of this rollercoaster isn't too bad. I just can't wait to be free of this disgusting act that I wish I never had started in the first place.

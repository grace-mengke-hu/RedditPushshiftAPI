3 Weeks.

Cravings are pretty well non-existent. I'm fine around smokers socially. I feel like quitting tobacco has worked well for me this time. Did read into Allen Carr's book and got the picture of what he was saying pretty quickly, the clever man.

Thanks for your help and support, without a shove in the right direction I'd still be smoking, smelling like an ashtray, feeling like crap for ten minutes following and with a much lighter wallet.

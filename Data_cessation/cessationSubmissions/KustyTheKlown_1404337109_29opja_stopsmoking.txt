just found this subreddit. day 3.

i've smoked since about 18 years old. i'm 29. 

i went on a diet in may and decided after i lose 15-20 lbs, i'd quit smoking, so the quitting weight gain wouldn't make me a fatass.

i lost 15 lbs. but didn't quit.

then i started dating a pretty great girl who doesn't smoke and doesn't like that i do. 

i'm quitting for myself, but the girl was good inspiration.

day 3. not really any cravings. i'm just constantly hungry. i'm not giving in to snacking tho, and i'm re-revving up my diet so i don't put on weight while i quit. 

i tried an ecig on day1 but it ran out of juice too fast and money was one of my motivators (i live in nyc, hello $13 packs). cold turkey it is.

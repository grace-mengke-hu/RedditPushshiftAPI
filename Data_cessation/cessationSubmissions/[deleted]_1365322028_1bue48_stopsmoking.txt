&*&$**%$&(&

I just want to yell. I hate myself, I hate smoking, i hate the fact that it will kill me, i hate how much it costs me. (where i live $11.30 CAD for the cheapest pack of 25) i hate the constant thought of just one puff won't hurt. I hate me, early 2001, that prick.. If i could go back in time.... )*$#(&## 12 years younger me would get a beating that day. I love my children I love the idea of watching them grow up. I love the thought of my kids being to young to remember this side of me. I love my patient wife. I love the money I'm going to spend on her I love the new tastes, the good and the bad, I love the daily sense of accomplishment! I love all the rewards. Right now, I love that I have somewhere to write my thoughts to get me through this rough time. A place where I know only ppl that come to this Sub will know what I'm talking about, people that won't think I'm a wuss. Ppl that are going through the same rehabilitation from a stupid, stupid drug abuse.

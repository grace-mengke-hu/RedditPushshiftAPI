100 Days smoke free... keep getting a cold

I'm very happy to announce that I have been smoke free for 100 Days now. It is amazing to not feel chained to the power of a Cig. Don't get me wrong I still struggle with urges to smoke. BUT I know I can make it now. 

I keep getting sick though almost about every 2 weeks. I get a chest cold, head ache, etc. My doctor said it's my body getting rid of the toxins. Has anyone had this happen to them???

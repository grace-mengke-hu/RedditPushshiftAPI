I'm TWO days in!

I will start by saying that I did NOT plan on quitting two days ago. My last cigarette was bummed off a friend and it wasn't my typical brand. I was also drunk at the time and don't really remember it. I feel like I never got to say good bye which is a little stressful. I woke up yesterday and really felt sick about the idea of smoking another one. 

Also, today is significantly harder to get through than yesterday. I'm back into my work week and I usually took about 6-8 breaks during the day for a cigarette. I'm drinking about a glass of water for every craving I get and I'm trying to stay stress-free. I feel jittery which I didn't expect.

Thank you to everyone here! Seriously, this sub has been really helpful. Most of the people I would go to for support still smoke and are jokingly calling me a quitter.

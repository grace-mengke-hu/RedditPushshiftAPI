What’s the best app to help show benefits of the days I’ve stopped?

I find facts like ‘your oxygen levels are back to normal now’ after stopping smoking for a few days help motivate me to keep going..

I don’t have any apps now but I did long ago and can’t remember the name..

I haven’t smoked for 3 days and would like an app to just be by my side in this lol.. any options?

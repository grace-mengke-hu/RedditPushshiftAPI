Juul vs vapes vs tobacco?

I’m a social smoker, so I smoke on the weekend only but I’d maybe like to stop that though I suppose the harm is less than an addict. I have a few questions: I smoke rolling tobacco as is common here among people my age, so it’s higher in nicotine. I really dislike the dry, choking feel vapes have and I hate the way the smoke long gets in the air. How do juul pods compare?

I’m concerned about the cost though. As a weekend smoker 30g of tobacco costs me about £13 and generally I go through 1-2 a month so it’s not a massive expense compared what what the jewel pods seem (I’ve no idea how long a pod lasts!). I’m also concerned I’ll actually just end up smoking more since  mentally I’ll have less guilt - I know I’ll use t when stressed whereas I don’t smoke when stressed by in large.

I’m just looking for input to see if it’s worth it - before anyway says I know the health implications from studies so far are less but I am not well off and I don’t really want to spend money on something that will only increase my habit and cost more than my smoking habit does - I’d rather continue my few cigarettes on the weekend if it was going to be way more costly.

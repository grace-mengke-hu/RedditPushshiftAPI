I'm back....tail between my legs and having learned a LOT of lessons...

Hey all! Well I'm back (I can't remember my old user name from before!) and I'm 5 days into my quit..... I got to 1 YEAR AND THREE MONTHS (YAY!) and then split up with my boyfriend - and what did I do?!?! I thought I could have just one cigarette - after having it drummed into me that you can NEVER have just one.... and I smoked again for 5 weeks until I managed to get the strength to do this again!

SO I've learned lessons - you really CAN NEVER have just one - so don't ever ever go there.  PLUS perhaps the most important lesson - that smoking over those five weeks was HORRIBLE. I felt tired, sick - smelt horrible and felt like a failure and even more upset than I would have done just dealing with the breakup on its own - every day I regretted having that one cigarette. SO that is NEVER happening again - and part of the reason I'm posting is to hopefully give those people advice that for any reason think that having just one will help with something they're going through. It WON'T be just one and it WON'T help - you'll regret it, feel worse and generally regret having it.
Anyway - I'll stop waffling now - I'll be around and offering support in the future, and it would be wonderful to get reminded of any nuggets of inspiration people have. I KNOW I can do this as the alternative is awful, as I've just lived with for five weeks, I just need to keep my head up for the next few weeks and get over the worst of it.
Oh and just for the record - after the first few weeks being a non smoker was the most AMAZING feeling ever - more confidence, better health, more money, better everything - so it really is worth it people - keep going - just never fall into the "just one" trap :)

6 days down amd ifeel great!

6 days into my new smoke-free life and I'm feeling pretty good! 

I must admit I am using a crutch - the patch. But not one more cigarette for this guy.

I'm just about finished the patches in the first step. Should I step down to the next level or cut them out all together?

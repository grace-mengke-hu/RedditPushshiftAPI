Read Easy Way. Quit smoking. Started smoking again. Any tips?

Hey guys,

This is actually a thread about my dad.
When he read the book he stopped for 4 months. His friend died and under the influence of stress and alcohol, my dad smoked a cigarette.
After that cigarette he obviously started smoking again.
Currently I’m personally reading Easy Way, as I want to stop too. But he refuses to re-read it, as he thinks he already knows everything from the book.

Is there any other book by Allen which is dedicated to the people who, for one reason or another, relapsed?

And a side question:
As I’ve been smoking for 2-3 years, and I don’t believe my parents know, should I tell them? Considering this only for the reason because when a non-smoker gives me advice on quitting, it just gets ignored automatically. If I approach dad as a fellow smoker, perhaps he would listen to me a bit more, eh?

Any responses are appreciated, and thanks for reading either way! :)

Day 2

I decided to smoke my final cigarette on Monday.  It was disgusting. 
I immediately turned to reddit and got some fantastic advise. I read Allen Carr’s book within the first day of quitting. This time is very different. I am never smoking again, and this time, I don’t even fear relapse. 
I have tried many times to quit using the will power method, but I knew deep down that I was going to smoke again. 
The biggest difference so far is the cigarette nightmares. I’ve been having nightmares that I am smoking a cigarette. When I wake up, I am so happy that it was just a dream. When I had these dreams using the willpower method, I would immediately seek out a cigarette upon waking up. 
Anyway, just wanted to ramble on a bit, and recommend Allen Carr’s book to anyone that hasn’t already had it recommended to you. 
If you haven’t downloaded any audiobooks on Amazon/Audible, I believe you can score it for free!

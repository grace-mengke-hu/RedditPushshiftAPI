The weird dreams are part of the journey...

I’m one month and 27 days free, and I’ve started having the dreams. The ones where I’m vividly smoking, then feeling incredibly disappointed at myself in the dream, then waking up and realizing that it isn’t really happening. It’s happened a few times now, and each time I’ve felt such a massive wave of relief come over me as I quickly realized that it was a dream/nightmare. 

For any that have just embarked on this wonderful journey, don’t worry about the dreams. It’s all part of leaving the old you behind. 

Always remember that you are free.

My GF quit smoking 17 days ago. I'm very proud of her!

As the title says she has been a non smoker for 17 days now. As a non-smoker myself I'm not exactly sure what to say or do to encourage her other than saying "great job" all the time. It feels like it isn't nearly enough and almost feels dismissive or patronizing for some reason. What are some things that I can say or do to express how proud I am of her? She has three great kids and one grandchild that depend on and love her. It would be devastating to them if she wasn't around. 

In addition I'm proud of all of you for taking the initiative to quit as well as having this sub forum to encourage and support each other!

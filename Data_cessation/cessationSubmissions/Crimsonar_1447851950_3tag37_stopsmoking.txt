I think it's time.

I don't want to do this anymore. Been telling myself that for months. Lurking here, reading everyone's posts. And I always think, "I wish I could do that!"

I want my breath back. I don't want to stink anymore. I want to spend my money on worthwhile things. So that's it. I'm stopping now. No more. 

Hopefully soon I can post my own xx days free. Then months. Then years. All of you are inspiring, thank you helping me find the will to do this. I'll be here, soaking up your strength and encouragement. 

Wish me luck!

Edit: Thank you all so much for your support! We can do this!

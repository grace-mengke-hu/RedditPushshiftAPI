13 years heavy smoking. Have to stop.

Hey guys, just searched reddit for 'quit smoking' see who's out there, read a couple of your posts and immediately felt a little less alone in the dark..

I started smoking at 11 years old.  I had a friend at school whose mother worked at the airport, and the workers would all divvy up the confiscated booze and cigarettes at the end of the day.  As a result, my friend's house was overflowing with packets of smokes, and alcohol, and we picked up the habits quickly..

Now I'm 24.  The government has really pushed smokers into a corner in my country (New Zealand).  It's $23 for a packet of camel 20's ($17 USD)  and now over $70 for a 50gm packet of tobacco.

It's impossible to smoke.  I make fairly good money, but I can't afford to smoke.  It's been costing me $150 a week on average, which is more than I spend on petrol and food combined.  I save *every* butt, because I'll end up re-rolling them later in the week.  And it's filthy.  I feel like a drug addict, complete with the shame.

I've tried and failed to quit more times than I could count.  I made it 6 weeks last year, but still fell back.

It's kinda left me with no options.  I don't have a choice, and I fucking resent that, *real* bad.  How dare those 
pen pushers screw me like that?  

6 hours no cigarettes.  I am raging.  Literally need to find something to destroy.

UPDATE:  I've failed.   I woke up this morning, feeling pretty grim.  I decided to go and see my horse, which always cheers me up.  It was good, except for one thing.  I graze my horse on a property, with the landlords permission, who has a couple of cock-sucking meth heads for tenants.  I try to just ignore the cunts most days, but I just had one particularly stupid fuck telling me "I'll kill you bro, I'll kill you!!"  over some bullshit perceived disrespect toward their bitch.

After fuming, I found the shittiest butts on my workshop floor, and rolled a horrible, skinny smoke.

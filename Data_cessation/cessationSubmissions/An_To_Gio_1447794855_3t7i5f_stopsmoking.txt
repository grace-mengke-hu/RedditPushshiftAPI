Found out something unpleasant, but didn't cave

Today I have found that my mother and my brother have been talking trash behind my back for months:

* I got into a big fight with my father in July, I got kicked out and crashed at my brother's place; he claims I turned it into a pigpen, whereas I was always mopping, scrubbing and doing chores out of gratitude.
I even went as far as looking for a cleaning squad, but my mother stopped me.
* she has been blaming her depression on me, whereas I was the one who made her consider seeking qualified help: his husband is one of those old school guys who label depressed people as *weaklings or *crazy ones; I've recently told her that maybe meds alone aren't enough and this got twisted into 'my son told me I'm crazy.'

I feel as if someone tore my heart out of my chest and shat inside it, but... **I didn't smoke!!!**
And that's it: take this, nicotine!

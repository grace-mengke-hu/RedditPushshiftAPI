Day 4 - Hives ?

I’ve gotten to today and it’s been relatively easy. However, I have a question... have any of you ever gotten hives when quitting smoking? I started getting them on day two and they spread a bit but seem to be getting better now. I googled it and a few websites mentioned it but I’m still a bit worried. Any ideas?

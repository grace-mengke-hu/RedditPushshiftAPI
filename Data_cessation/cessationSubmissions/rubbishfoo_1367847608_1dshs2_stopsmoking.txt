Leaving work early - heading to doctor for Chantix.

Hey folks.

I've been smoking for 20 years.  I am 35 years old & one of the things I struggle with in everyday life is my energy level.  I often feel that I am in the body of a 70 year old, which is crazy because my appearance is that of a 25 year old - despite smoking roughly a pack a day for over half my life.

I want out.  I am tired of being tired.  I really like smoking, but I am realizing that it just isn't worth my money, health, and inability to participate in daily life with my family due to a declining energy level.  Screw this.

I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, reading all of your stories & trials and have seen a lot of success.

I want out.  I'll be posting on here for the first few days Im sure.  

Its really great to see a community of folks supporting each other.

Can anyone give me some tips of how to relearn my daily routine/habits?  Also - I am setting my quit date later today after speaking with the doctor and getting an idea for when it is appropriate with the medication.

Thanks!

**Update 1:**

Went to the doctor - got prescription.  Sitting here waiting for the scrip to be filled.  Going to read over documentation & decide when to start.  I want to get this ball rolling.  The sooner I start, the sooner I can be done with this nonsense.

**Update 2:**

Scrip is filled - read over documentation.  Starting tomorrow.

**Update 3:**

Took my first dose this morning.  I feel a little funny, but I really believe it's all mental.  I am supposed to smoke for the first week, making my quit date May 14th.  I will continue to update based on how the medication affects me.  **Update**  Feels a bit wonky - almost a disconnected, out of body experience.  I have not experienced the nausea or anything else that were listed as common side effects.  Day 1 is ok so far.  I have been smoking as I normally do - and have not noticed any difference in satisfaction or desire (or lack thereof).

**Update 4:**

It's Thursday - been taking my morning pill as prescribed.  I do feel a bit different & while I can't say that I DON'T want to smoke, I can say that it doesn't feel as satisfying.  I haven't felt weird until tonight.  I was exhausted from work today (didn't sleep well last night - not because of dreams or anything) - came home & passed out for like 3 hours.  Now during THAT sleep - yes I had some strange dreams... one particularly ugly, but the rest were just strange.  Tomorrow marks the day that I start a morning and evening pill.  Still doing my best to approach this from a logical standpoint.

**Update 5:**

I've been taking the Chantix medication as prescribed.  Tomorrow is the quit day & I'm pretty nervous, but want to get it over with.  I start taking the larger pill in the morning & evening tomorrow also.

So far I can say that the effects of the medicine aren't terribly large.  I feel a little funny for a while (think of it as a bit strung-out feeling) and have the dreams that everyone talks about.  Not nightmares, just the ability to remember details of dreams pretty easily & they are very vivid.

I guess we'll see what happens tomorrow.

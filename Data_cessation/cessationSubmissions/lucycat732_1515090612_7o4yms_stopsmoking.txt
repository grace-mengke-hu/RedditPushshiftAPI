Tips for recovering social smokers?

Hi y'all! New to this subreddit. I'm hoping to find some good tips for avoiding social smoking (a/k/a smoking when I drink and am around other smokers). 

Backstory: I was a full-fledged smoker from 16-18, and smoked a pack a day. Though even at that time I only smoked when I was around smokers and/or drinking. For the past 12 years I haven't considered myself a "smoker" per se (probably to make myself feel better) because I'd say 90% of the time I don't smoke at all and don't crave it. However, when I am in a situation where there are other smokers, and I am drinking, I go a bit overboard and end up chain smoking. That happens at least once a week. I always feel shitty, of course, but it's so hard to resist. My husband smokes, many of my friends smoke, and most of our social situations revolve around it. In fact, I'd say I seek it out (for example, choosing a bar to meet up at that I know has a smoking patio). 

I feel like I associate drinking and socializing with smoking so much that it's hard to separate the two. I know I am incredibly lucky that I don't crave it outside of these specific situations, but I'm still finding it very difficult to avoid. Any advice is welcome!

I feel like a 100 bucks!

Didnâ€™t realize I had skipped over my hundred day mark by a little bit. I feel great and am so proud of myself for sticking with it this time. For everyone going through the first rough patches, you can do it! It is so worth it! If it is like my experience, it is going to be extremely difficult for a while and you will need to keep fighting the urge for a long time (I still am some days) but, the struggle is 100% worth it. Hang tough and come here before you light up, that saved me several times! Thanks for all the help good people.

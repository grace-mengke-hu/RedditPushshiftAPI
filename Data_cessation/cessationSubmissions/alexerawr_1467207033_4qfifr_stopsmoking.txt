Iphone apps that can help?

Hi guys!
So I've been lookign for an iphone app that could help me to quit smoking... 
I'd like an app that will tell me how many cigarettes I haven't smoke, how much money I saved. I'd also like an app that will tell me stuff about my progress (ex: good job, you've achieve your second day without cigarettes, you now have less chance to develop heart problems).

I prefer a free app but don't really mind to pay for a really good one..
Thanks! :)

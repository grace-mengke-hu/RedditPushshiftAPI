Day 224 saved

I have a huge heap of work to do, and my brains started persuading me that
there's no way in hell that I'd manage to do that all without a smoke. The
amount of things to do, the anxiousness — it's hard to start, so let's go, go,
go and have a smoke, and then, maybe then, I'll be able to start.

And that's on a day _seven-months-and-a-half_ without any smokes!

I even drove to the mall with an intention to buy some tobacco to make my
long-favorite roll-ups, but, while I was driving, I had some success in convincing myself that I just need to get past this one evening of cravings. The
future me might be disappointed about the work I didn't manage to do today — but at least I
wouldn't let him down on the smoking.

Bought a big bunch of candies, though.

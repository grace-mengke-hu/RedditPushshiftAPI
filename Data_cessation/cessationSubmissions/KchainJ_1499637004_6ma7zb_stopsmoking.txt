I think it's time, once again.

I've been lurking here for a while and have been smoking for a handful of years now. I've tried quitting twice or three times, but hasn't lasted. I work in a restaurant, one of 2 cooks in the kitchen, and it's pretty stressful. It calms me down, relaxes me, and brings me back to focus after I have a smoke. I smoke two on my way to work and two on my way home also (hour commute one way). I go through a pack of American spirits in two days and I think it's time to stop. I just don't know what to do. Thoughts on nicotine mints? I don't think I have the will power to stop cold turkey. Some help from you good people will be much appreciated.

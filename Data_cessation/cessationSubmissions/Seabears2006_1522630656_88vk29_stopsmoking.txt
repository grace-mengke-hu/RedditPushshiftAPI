Social anxiety

Smoking was a great way to self medicate my social anxiety. I smoked for about a year, but realized that overall it was making my social anxiety much worse.

I’ve been quit for a month and 10 days but I feel that some real psychological damage/neurotransmitter damage has been done. 

My anxiety is not getting back to baseline. It is isolatingly bad. And I constantly crave bad food, and alcohol. Where as before I started smoking I didn’t crave those things. Will this get better? Did I ruin my life with a year of smoking. 

Sorry for such a depressing post I know this is supposed to be about support.

One Month Later

One month in and I'm surprisingly doing fine.  I had a dream last night that I had a pack of cigarettes and was smoking all through the dream, but that's about it for now.  Mild cravings here and there, but they're psychological and not physical.  I miss taking smoke breaks and just being outside every once in a while, but that's really about it.

Still, I feel like I could go back to it in a heartbeat without a problem, and that kinda bothers me.

Be wary of the post-quit depression because depression doesn't have to mean sadness

I noticed that after I quit, it became hard to enjoy normal activities. They were just boring, not interesting. Food was meh, parties were dull, other people were uninteresting. I was worried the world really was that boring and that cigarettes only hid the fact.

The truth is, it is a common form of depression, and its caused by your body not producing enough dopamine conpared to what it was used to while you were smoking. It goes away aftet some weeks, but your life can feel pretty dull during those weeks and might make you do risky things, including puffing up.

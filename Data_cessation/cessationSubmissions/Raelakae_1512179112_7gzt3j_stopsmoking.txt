24hours down... any incentive ideas?

I made a commitment to a friend that I have to give her $20 if I smoke a cigarette and $100 if I buy a pack. Hoping the loss of dollars will be extra motivation. Any other good incentive ideas? This is my 792475 attempt to quit. (Not really, but it feels like it) I’m trying some new strategies. I live with a smoker, so it’s really hard at home.

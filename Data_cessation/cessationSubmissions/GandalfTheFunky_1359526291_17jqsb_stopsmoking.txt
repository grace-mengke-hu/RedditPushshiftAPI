I made it about 32 hours, and have bought 3 packs since.  Please help.  

Encourage me, berate me, just let me know that this can be done.  I haven't gone over a day since 2007 when I went six weeks on Chantix, and thought this time was going to be different.  I'm furious with myself, I've been berating myself for two days.  I finished Allen Carr's book, and thought for sure that the new perspective made the difference.  But all I could freaking think about the past two days was having a fucking cigarette.  

Help me, r/stopsmoking.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but you're my only hope.

What should I expect?

Ive been smoking a good 10+ a day for about a year and a half (conservative estimate - probably more). Every morning the first thing I do is wake up, excited for that ciggarette. 

So yeah enough is enough... just gonna stop. Yesterday I had a single dart in the morning and that was it (BIG deal for me). Today I did the same and to my suprise I didnt experience the emmense relief that I normally would after say finishing an 8 hour shift and having a smoke. Like I could have not smoked and felt the same. There was no rush, no relaxation. I felt just mildly confused at my own mental sensations.

Anyway tomorrow Im gonna have a crack at no smoking at all. So what should I expect over the next week or so? In a few days am I gonna be a raging irratable lunatic? When will the worst be over? Ive read a bunch of timelines but Id like to hear some personal experiences.

Also maybe worth mentioning is that catalysing this sudden change in lifestyle is a combination of a severe flu and an eye opening book. I am determined - but cant escape the feeling that my ignorance to the withdrawals is what is fueling my confidence.

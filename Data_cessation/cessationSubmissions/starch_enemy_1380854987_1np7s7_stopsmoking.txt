3 days in.

So I stopped smoking 3 days ago using Champix and cutting down.
Champix is going well the only side effects that I have noticed with it is are occasional vivid dreams and bit of nausea if I don't have it with food.
Craving have not been as bad as previous attempts and I feel relatively good. 
The main problem I have noticed is that I was and am used to having that 5 minute smoke break ever hour or so and I have noticed that I don't really know how to substitute these small breaks, so any advice on that issue or any advice in general would be greatly appreciated.

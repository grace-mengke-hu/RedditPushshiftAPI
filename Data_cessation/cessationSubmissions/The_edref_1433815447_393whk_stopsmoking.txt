Sometimes being an ex-smoker is a bit odd

A few nights back me and my mates were having a poker game, and we were all getting pretty drunk. One of my mates was out so he offered to be the dealer for the rest of the game. He was rolling a cigarette but I wanted to continue the game, so I offered to roll for him while he dealt. I then went into autopilot, and quickly rolled, put it in my mouth as I have thousands of times, sparked a lighter, then one of my mates pointed out I was rolling it for my friend. The next words I said was "what the fuck, I don't smoke" then handed it straight back. It was a strange, but fucking lovely feeling. Damn not smoking feels good.

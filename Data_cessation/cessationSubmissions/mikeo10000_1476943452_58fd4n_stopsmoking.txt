Quitting while starting Vyvanse

So I went to the doctor's the other day for an infection I got in my eye. We got to talking and long story short he put me on vyvanse for ADHD and took some blood. He called me back with the bloodwork today and I have a high blood cell count which is probably from smoking heavily for almost 8 years. (Pack and a half a day since age 16, I'm going on 24 now). So I think it's time to put the cigarettes down. I've heard it is much more difficult to quit while on ADHD meds. Has anyone here done this before? Any tips or insight? Thanks!

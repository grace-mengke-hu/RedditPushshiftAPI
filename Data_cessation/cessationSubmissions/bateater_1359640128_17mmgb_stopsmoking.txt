5 more days and I'll finally be at 3 months.

I'm super excited for my 3 month anniversary of quitting. I didn't smoke as much and for as long as most ( 4 years about a pack a day ) but it's all been worth it! I just wanted to say thanks everyone for helping me with my journey but it's not over yet!

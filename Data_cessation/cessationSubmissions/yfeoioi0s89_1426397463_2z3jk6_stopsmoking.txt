Can't seem to ditch the habit (as opposed to a chemical addiction).

Hi guys, 

I'm 24. I've been smoking on and off since I was about 14. By that I don't mean packs. I've never finished a pack in a day, the most I've smoked in a day would be around six cigarettes. And that's only if I'm at a party. On a daily basis? Around three or four. It's gone up and down over the years. 

Now? It's two. I've been able to cut down and cut down, my morning cigarette? Slashed. My after-lunch cigarette? Cut out. My evening tea cigarette? Done with. Etc. 

But these last two? I just can't seem to break free. And I KNOW it's not the usual nicotine addiction. Because I can go the entire day without feeling the urge. I can walk past other people smoking througout the day, and not feel even the slightest bit tempted. Heck, sometimes, in the morning, if I get a whiff of the smell of a cigarette, I feel nauseous. 

I'll finish work, no desire. But, towards the end of the work day, like around 6PM, I'll start looking forward to my smoke at home. It's not even a "I want to smoke now" kind of thing. I want to go home and smoke. Once I get home, I just can't stop myself. It's like, I can't go to bed unless I've had a smoke. I feel like I haven't done something essential. I feel incomplete. I just can't seem to cut it out. ALSO, I should throw in that I uhh... fap while smoking. Like, I know that's sad. But, I dunno I look forward to that after work. Aaaaand, it's become so normal that now I can't fap without having a smoke. I'm not kidding. It just doesn't interest me. 

Please help!

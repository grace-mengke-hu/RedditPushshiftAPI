It's been three weeks since my last cigarette....

Which is great.  I have never made it this far while trying to quit previous times.  My question is to all of you former smokers is this.  I have had some physical withdrawals the first 2 weeks which consisted of headaches, minor sore throat and fatigue.  But as of this morning I had a headache that lasted all morning, dizzy spells when I walk and eyes feel so heavy. Is this what they call smokers flu?  I would really like some insight on this.  Any suggestions wold be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

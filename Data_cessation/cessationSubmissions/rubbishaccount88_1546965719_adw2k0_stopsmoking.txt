Nicotine Withdrawal after years of gum. Day 11

I quit smoking over a decade ago but swiftly replaced it with a full-on nicotine gum habit. 

I'm on day 11 100% nicotine free and feel as if I'm losing my mind. 

I remember nicotine withdrawal from cigarettes and quitting cold turkey. But my memory is that usually it was like 3 days of hell and then 90% back to normal. Now, however, the miserable feeling is being drawn out excruciatingly. Mostly I just cannot focus for the life of me. I feel scattered and spacey and a bit teary at times. Everything feel way way out of control and chaotic. I feel foggy and just strange. Like my perspective on my life and everything is just a bit wacky. Caffeine - yes I know I'm *supposed* to avoid it - has practically no effect.

Ah well. Everything I read online suggests two weeks should be a big turning point and that 3 months is the big brain re-set turning point. Wish me luck!

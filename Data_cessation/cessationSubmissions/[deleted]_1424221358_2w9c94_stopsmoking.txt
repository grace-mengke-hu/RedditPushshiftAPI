Stopped ~6 weeks ago (Dec 30th) and still can't exercise as much as before. WTF?

Hello, hoping to get some insight into what the f is going on here.  
I quit Dec 30th, haven't had a cig or smoked weed since. I exercised 3-4 days a week for ever, ran about 3.5 miles those days as well. While I was smoking I had much better runs than I do now after stopping.   
What's up with that? I am about 6 weeks in to no inhaling of any smoke, and I still haven't gotten back to where I was when I would smoke cigarettes and weed.
I think smoking weed before a run was a sort of pain relief/ helped get in the zone- but I'd think that by now I'd be a lot better off than before, and would be able to run further than before.  
Anyone experience this? What to do?   
edit: if it matters I'm 42M, smoked since I was about 18, but the healthy kind- American Spirits /s, and usually about 5 cigs per day. So moderate smoker, but eat healthy, exercise, etc...

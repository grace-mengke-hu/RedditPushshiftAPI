Will smoking the occasional cigarette bring me back to smoking every day

I had my last cigarette on January 30th with the intention of breaking the cycle of smoking a cigarette every day.  (I typically smoke 3-8 cigarettes a day)

Most smokers will identify with the fact that it's incredibly easy to make new friends by sharing a smoke break at work, outside of a bar, or while traveling to new places.

Is there a method to successfully have a cigarette every once in a while after a few drinks?  I'm always challenged to "smoke 'em if you got 'em", when I have a full pack in my possession...

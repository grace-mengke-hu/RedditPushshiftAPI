Day 4: I feel like I’m grieving

First day without the patch. I have it with me but my skin protests so much that by the end of the day I can’t tell which urge is stronger, to smoke or to rip that patch off. 

I was excited by the novelty of quitting the first few days, now I’m just sad. Sitting here at work fighting back complete tears. I didn’t want to give up but financially I couldn’t smoke anymore and still be able to eat. I feel like I’m grieving. I’m angry I can’t smoke. 

What in the ever living fuck is going on. Literally all I want to do is flip my desk, go home, and cry.

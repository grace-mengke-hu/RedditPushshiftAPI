Checking in at day 82!

Still going. I do have passing thoughts about cigarettes and how nice one would be from
Time to time, however they are literally just thoughts and easily pass.

I also notice how awful cigarettes smell now! So strong. 

Anyways feeling good, keep going guys - each day it gets a little easier x

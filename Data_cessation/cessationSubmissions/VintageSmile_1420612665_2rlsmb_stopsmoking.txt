Looking for suggestions to help stop smoking when someone you live with doesn't want to stop smoking.

So I am happily married, and both of us smoke. I've tried quitting a few times, but my spouse seems to enjoy smoking too much and I find myself struggling to stop because I watch them smoke. It's like this really strong and powerful force to fight against.  It feels like I am having to not just fight my own cravings, etc, but against the spouses as well.   

The spouse doesn't seem overly interested in quitting right now, but I really want to.  Do you have any suggestions on ways I could cope with the constant temptation, smell, and well.. it always being in my face? :)

Starting over.

Re-doing my badge because I caved last week and didn't even come close to stopping myself. Now that it is another Monday I feel I need to start over. I am a fan of the cold turkey style of quitting because every other method I've tried almost immediately leads back to smoking full time again. Any one have any "thought-redirection" tips for cold turkey quitters?

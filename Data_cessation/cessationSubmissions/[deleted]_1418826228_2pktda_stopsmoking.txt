Two years a non-smoker, and now I'm fell back into the trap.

Hi. First time on this sub, thought I'd check out this place. Mostly just here sharing and getting this of my chest. If anyone has any advice, I welcome them.

I went for about two years without smoking, for a while (little over a year) it was mostly easy, I didn't miss it and I barely even remember ever being a smoker, but a while ago I started missing it. Last week I messed up, I bought a pack and went through it in a day...

I want to stop, sort of... The stupid thing is that I'm telling myself that I could stop, if I wanted to, since I did it so "easily" before, and that the only reason why I'm not is because I *want* to keep smoking... Don't know if this is true, but I know that I don't want to be a smoker. I keep thinking, just a few more days, and then I'll quit...

I read Allen Carr's book and it helped me the last time (although it annoyed me that he was so arrogant). I'll probably go through it again.

9 days smoke free

So I’m 9 days smoke free. It feels pretty good. Been a light smoker on and off since about 15 and currently am 18. The cravings are still there but they’re a little easier to control now. I don’t have to worry about being a closet smoker anymore. Washing hands before coming home, chewing gum before talking to family, or dousing myself in fragrance to cover the smell to others. I’m free to be myself. No more excuses to “go out” for a bit at late hours. No longer feeling like the only one who smokes in the world.

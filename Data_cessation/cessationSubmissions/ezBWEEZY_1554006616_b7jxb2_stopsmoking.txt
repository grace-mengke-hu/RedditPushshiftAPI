This weekend (so far)

27 days and I’ve actually been pretty okay with my decision a few times! I went out with my old chain smoking buddy (&amp; friend lol) Friday night and proceeded to get harassed by some big scary drunk guy. Really really wanted to smoke, didn’t.  Which was nice because Saturday I was around lots of kids and pregnant women and I was happy to not have to leave every half hour. I’m able to be present more than before because I don’t have smoking to be insecure about. I also appreciate how there are times where I’m the only one not smoking, and other times where I would be the only one smoking if I never stopped. 

It’s going along, still eating blow pops and dum dums like a maniac in the car some days, but it’s nice to have one less thing to worry about.

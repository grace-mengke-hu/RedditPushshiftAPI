Can anybody answer my question please ? =)

Hi there people, Im new here and I have just a little question. Can smoking make you nervous ? When I smoke a cigar I feel very nervous to the point I get really dizzy and I can't properly speak to people or driving for exemple. I feel like my heart is about to explode after a cigar. Is there any link betwen tabaco and nervousness ? Do you think I should quit because tabaco is the cause ?


Just in case Im a very healthy 23 old guy and this is the only bad habit I have. 


Thank you for your answer ;D


Cheers mates :D

That awkward moment.

The other day I was walking my dog around the park, as I'd normally do. And there happened to be 3 kids sitting on a picnic table as I was walking by. They were passing around a joint and possibly a cigarette ( I could smell both in the air ) I paid no attention but from somewhere deep inside my head I wanted to blurt out "Stupid kids!"

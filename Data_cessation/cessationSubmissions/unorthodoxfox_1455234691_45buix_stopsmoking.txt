48 hours nicotine free

I decided to do a journal for everyone else that is just starting on quitting nicotine. I know the last post focused on how I felt better. My nose doesn't seem clogged and chest doesn't seem so compressed. Down sides right now are mushy brain where it is hard to think, joints ache like they have bruises and some other spots on my body, stomach aches like it is digesting nicotine. I wouldn't say I'm irritable because of it at this point. Cravings have gone from a 3 to a 4, which is really mild. Seems like the body is getting desperate for nicotine because of the chemical dependency. I ran about a mile at 4 mph but I had to stop because of pressure build up. Seems like bad circulation. One thing that I wanted to add is that if you're working out; great that is awesome of you but you must remember you're still in a recovery state for a couple of weeks so push yourself but monitor how your body is reacting.  Sure, I would like to loss a few pounds but this is more of bettering my breathing and circulation so I can push myself. You're all awesome and we can get through this together. 

Edit: One thing that helps me is that I seem smoking as a bad relationship. Sure, you think of only the good times but I guarantee with five minutes, you'll wonder why you even started talking to them.

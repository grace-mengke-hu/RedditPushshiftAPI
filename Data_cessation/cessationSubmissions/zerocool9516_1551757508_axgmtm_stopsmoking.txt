I decided to quit smoking yesterday and the power's been out for close to 10 hours now

So, I decided to commit to quit [a lot of things](https://i.imgur.com/XObJBCv.png) over the past week or so. It was going ok till this power cut though. I am really stressed and all I want is a toke, a drink or a puff. I haven't been this frustrated since I first went to nursery in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.

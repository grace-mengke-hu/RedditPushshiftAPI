Ran out of smokes last week and never bought another pack!

I'm 22, a mother of a little girl, and I have wanted to quit smoking for a while (I quit while I was pregnant and started 1 month after I had her). I ran out of smokes last week and I didn't feel like I needed another pack. After deciding this, I didn't really like the smell of cigarettes, and thinking about them made me nauseous! Yesterday the little bit of cravings set in, but I've concurred them. Any tips on how to keep my mind off of them? I'd also like encouragement, too! (I just joined this sub and don't know how it works!!!!) I started smoking at 15. 7 years of smoking AND IT'S TIME TO QUIT FOR GOOD!!!!

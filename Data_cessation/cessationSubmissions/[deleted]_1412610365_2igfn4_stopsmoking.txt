Unusual stop smoking story

Hello all.. Have just begun the process of quitting.

Haven't smoked in 28 days but strangely enough I have never actually smoked a cigarette before. 
I'm from Europe where we smoke weed mixed with tobacco in joints (Without filters :/) because weed is expensive and that's just how people do it! Have been smoking joints regularly for 5 years and now am trying to stop.

I definitely smoked a lot more weed than I needed to just because I was craving tobacco a lot of the time. Now that I've given up the tobacco I don't find myself dying to smoke weed like I used to because I just really needed tobacco.

I'm still happy smoking weed occasionally but decided to give tobacco the flick a month ago so thought I'd post here to see if anyone else has any advice or similar experiences..



tl/dr: Smoked many many tobacco/weed joints.. now kicking tobacco

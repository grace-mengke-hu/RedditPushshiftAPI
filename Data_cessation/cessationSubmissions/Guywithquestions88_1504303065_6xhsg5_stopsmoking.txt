I quit for two days and relapsed. Suggestions?

I read Allen Carr's Easyway, and a couple of weeks later I had my quit day.  It was surprisingly easy, and I barely even noticed my cravings.  I went over 48 hours, then I had a really shitty day...

It started with a flat tire on the way to work.  Long story short, I ended up stranded on the side of the road for two hours.  Then I had a terrible day at work.  

That night, my ex girlfriend (who I was still friends with) wanted to hang out and have some drinks.  We went out, and I proceeded to get blackout drunk due to all the shit.  I ended up getting in a friendship-ruining fight with her, and broke down.. lit my first smoke in 2 days.

Since then, I've been smoking again.  I've tried to quit again a couple times, but it isn't like that first quit...somehow, I immediately start obsessing about smoking the minute I put my "last one" out.  What is the difference now from then?

I plan on re-reading the book, but I'm open to thoughts, etc.

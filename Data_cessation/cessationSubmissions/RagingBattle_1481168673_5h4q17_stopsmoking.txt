Day 4 - Revenge of the Camelid

So. My teeth looks whiter. I guess the oxygen levels to my brain are enhanced by now, because I feel much more intelligent (tough it may be an illusion, let me live it). I got one side effect that's really annoying me: I could go on a spitting battle face to face with a llama and win by exhaustion of the opponent. How long did it take for you to clean your lungs? I feel like someone installed a manufacture of glue down my throat.

Thoughts on weed/spliffs

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 78 days. I have no interest in cigarettes anymore. But I miss weed. I used to roll spliffs (weed and tobacco) on occasion because 100% marijuana is too much for my weekend warrior tolerance. I quit both cold turkey. 

I have a friend who quit smoking cigarettes over a year ago but is an avid weed smoker and sees no issue with smoking spliffs with rolling tobacco semi-regularly. I have mixed feelings on this. 

I don't fear a relapse or abuse but I do sort of consider it cheating even if it's once every weekend or two. What are your thoughts? At this point can I view the small amount of tobacco as a supplementary drug to enhance the weed experience or is it better to continue with a zero tolerance approach? 

Thanks all

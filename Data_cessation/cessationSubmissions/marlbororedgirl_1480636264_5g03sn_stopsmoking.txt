One month in!

And despite being offered ciggs non-stop on holiday, changing jobs to a new one over an hours commute away and developing an allergic reaction to nicotine patches and having to stop using them, I'm still going strong. I never thought I would be in this position and I can't wait to check back in in another months time. All of you just starting out, you can do this.

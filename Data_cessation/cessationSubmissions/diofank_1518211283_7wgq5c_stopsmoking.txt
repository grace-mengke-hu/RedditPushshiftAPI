Kicking the habit step by step!

Today I went out for a few drinks with some friends. I noticed I kept planning my next cig but the urge never got so strong that I would actually do anything about it. Even after the drinks, I passed by three convenience stores on my way home, it crossed my mind to go in and buy a pack but I didn't even have to fight the thought I just kept on walking. It's a little win but I'm so happy about it!!

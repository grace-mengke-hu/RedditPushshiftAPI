One week- grr....

I hit the one week mark last night at 9:30 pm.  I don't know why, but the cravings I am having today are the worst I've had yet.  Had to stop myself from buying a pack this morning and now all I can think about is breaking down and bumming a cig from someone.  

Is it normal for cravings to increase in intensity like this?  When can I expect this to end, or at least partially subside?

A Pack a day for 16 years.  I am on day 6.

My last cigarette was on Sunday at midnight, it has almost been a week.  The first three days were incredibly rough.  I got a low nicotine e-cig and have been using that when the cravings get bad, mostly at work to avoid killing customers.  Does anyone have advice for me in using the e-cig?  I don't want to use it very long and want to be nicotine free as soon as possible.

Bad situations &amp; not Smoking

Today IFU when I was getting out from the garage and hit one of the mirrors. I get really mad, blaming my self (obusly who else I have to blame). Anyway after 10 minutes sitting in the car I taught I’ll smoke maybe I’ll calm down, but after a tought jump over and told for what, will give u the miror back? Will help u feeling better ? No! Will only Trow away 1 month and 5 days of non smoking and will be more expensive the miror. 

Ungrateful situation will came in life, Everybody has his bad moments, but we can’t let us down, for stupidities what has easy solutions. Quit is not easy, repair the miror it is. 

Stay strong, stay clean. And any situation can’t screw your life more than smoking.

Tried quitting three days ago, did not go well.

Three days ago, I planned to quit. And quit I did, for 24 hours.

Next two days, I have smoked. Thankfully, not like earlier, which was a pack a day almost... I did three smokes both the days.

I really don't know how you guys do it. 

Need a lot of help!!

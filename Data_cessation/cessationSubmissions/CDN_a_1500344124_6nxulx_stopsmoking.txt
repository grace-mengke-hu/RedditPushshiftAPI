25 hours ... 11 minutes and it feels fantastic!

I'd like to know where the heck did all this energy come from? Am I going to crash and burn? Also anyone with experience... is there a safe time / point where one could try to imbibe a little wine or smoke a little weed? I'm resigned to lay off for quite a while but would like to know I can indulge (without smoking) in future? Thanks.

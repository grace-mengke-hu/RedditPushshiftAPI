I've been having the same inner struggle with quitting for a few months now..

Most of my friends, at school and back home, all smoke cigs. For the longest time, I would try to quit, but push myself back to square #1 as soon as a fellow smoker would ask me if I wanted one of theirs. I was told by an internet source that to quit, it's easier to not be around people who are smoking, and to not put yourself into situations where you want a cigarette. But for me, that would entail not hanging out with my closest friends. Any tips on an angle to take this on at? Did anyone else quit cold-turkey without drastically changing the way they live? Or might that be the secret?

Does it matter where I "park" my nicotine gum?

Hey /r/stopsmoking! I've been doing pretty well so far with nicotine gum and patches (I don't really get into the whole counting days thing -- just a personal preference.)

The only thing I've noticed is that I get more of a "tingle" from the nicotine gum when I place it under my upper lip. Previously, I was getting the tingle when I placed it under my bottom lip. I'm wondering if that's just the gum causing some kind of numbness. Do I *need* this tingle, because it's so much easier to park it under my bottom lip.

Thanks.

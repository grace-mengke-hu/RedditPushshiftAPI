I really want to drink tonight but I know it'll ruin my weekend.

Hi r/stopsmoking,

Been quitting since January 8th, and I've been really struggling with alcohol. It's been 5 days, so I'm well past the actual withdrawals, but the little monster I thought Allen Carr could kill is being mischevious by clinging to alcohol. I can let the monster go, and I have, the brainwashing does nothing for me sober, but once I get that first drink into me, there's something that makes me want to self destructive things.

It pains me terribly that this is a problem, and I wish it would piss off forever so I could enjoy my beer without the cigarettes. Then again, I'm not actually sure alcohol is the best thing for me right now either. Tomorrow night's my birthday, and I want to hit the town violently and fantastically, but since I quit, something's been in me saying "slow down dude".

I also left my summer job (that was awesome) today, which has me all down and out, so I'm just generally miserable that I can't use my normal methods of coping to deal with the sadness of change.

Any advice? I could really use it.

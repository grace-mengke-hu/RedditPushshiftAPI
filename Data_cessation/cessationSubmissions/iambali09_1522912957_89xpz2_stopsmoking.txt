Help me please.

Hello,
I've tried so many times to quit smoking. My longest streak was about three weeks long. I am 24 years old and I started when I was 16... I hate everything about smoking, I already made my list about these things. I really want to stop but I can't go 48 hours without smoking and I hate myself after having a cigarette.

My colleagues smoke, my girlfriend smokes, although she said she would reduce the number of cigarettes that she smokes and would not let me smoke, which works pretty well, because I stopped smoking at home, but I can't go outside or can't go to work without stressing about it the whole day and finally having a cig. 

I don't want any replacements, going cold turkey is what works for me. The other methods just led me to finally go out and get cigarettes.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

PS.: Respect to all you guys who were able to quit, this is really hard, you fellas are like superheroes to me.

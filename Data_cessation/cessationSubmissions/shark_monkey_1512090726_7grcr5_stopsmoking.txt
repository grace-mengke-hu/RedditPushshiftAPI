First week down!

I’m absolutely pumped about making it 7 days so far. Yesterday was probably the worst day. I wasn’t working and pretty much just bumming around the house. I just kept getting the urge to smoke. I didn’t but that desire was strong. 
I knew it was because I wasn’t doing anything and I was more bored than anything else. 
I got through the day and woke up today feeling fine. I had another excellent day with no cravings. 
Champix has definitely helped me and I’m thrilled with the health changes I’ve experienced so far.

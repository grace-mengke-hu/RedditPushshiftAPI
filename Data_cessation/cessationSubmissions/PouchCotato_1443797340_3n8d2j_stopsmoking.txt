Grinding away one day at a time!

I'm done not having what I want. I've decided that I am going to thug it out and get things done at work and home. Smoking was sucking away all my energy 2 months ago. Such a time drain! 

I don't crave anymore at all! Never have craved badly after about 3 weeks of quitting. But the struggle is real. After a month of quitting, I got super drunk at a bar and kept asking my friend for a puff or a full stick whenever he went outside to smoke. Thankfully, he didn't give it to me. I felt so proud the next day about not smoking!

I am just disappointed that its been only 64 days since I quit. It feels like a lot longer.

I'm 25, been smoking and dipping 10 years, and today I am quitting.

I started using all forms of nicotine about 10 years and 5 months ago, shortly after my 15th birthday. I've been preparing to quit for a month. The one issue I for see is I have no legitimate support. All of my friends use tobacco. My girlfriend does not but she just berates me about tobacco rather than genuinely encouraging my efforts. As a result I will be relying pretty heavily on you guys here to help me through. 

The next 21 days are gonna be rough.

Boyfriend switched to vaping a few years back. Now wants to quit that as well. Trying to help him think of something to occupy his hands.

Hi, I apologize if i'm in the wrong place, as this is technically a question about vaping but i guess it could apply to smoking traditional cigarettes too. My boyfriend started vaping a few years back instead of smoking. Now he thinks he's ready to quit that as well. The shop he goes to for his fluid does custom flavor mixing and you can specify how much nicotine you want added. He's been titrating down his nicotine successfully. I suggested that maybe he just get nicotine free.

He says he's concerned about the long term effects of the inhalants, the carrier I guess. I can't stand cigarettes (which he switched off of before we ever met) but the vaping doesn't bother me at all, so it doesn't matter to me if he quits or not as long as he's happy. I don't know much about the research either way concerning long term effects of vaping, and honestly it's not super important. If he wants to quit, for whatever reason, I'll support him.

My question for you guys: he's a bit of a fidget. When he's watching tv or at his computer, he twirls his hair and puffs on his vape thing pensively. He says his first pair of eye glasses as a kid had to be replaced because he chewed up the end of one of the side pieces that sit over your ears. **So we're trying to think of something he can do/mess with.** He has some beef with fidget spinners. Not sure how he feels about those fidget cubes (and I'm a bit bothered by small repetitive noises like the clicking sound the little bits of a fidget cube make when in use). Chewing on pens probably isn't a good idea for his teeth. Chewing gum might work, but that still doesn't keep his hands occupied. Anyone have any experience with finding something to mess with after quitting?

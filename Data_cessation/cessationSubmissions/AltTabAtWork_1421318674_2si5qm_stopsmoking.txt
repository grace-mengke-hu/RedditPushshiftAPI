My second attempt...

Hey!

I was quitting smoking 2 years ago. The time i decided stopping was when i was ill and became a non smoker for 3 months. But out of an unknown reason i started again smoking about 7 cigarettes a day. So i consider myself not as a chainsmoker.

Now 4 days ago i through all my cigarettes away and startetd being Non-smoker again. Till now it's really easy, but i'm afraid that one day in 2 months i will start again out of the blue

Do you know any tips on how to avoid this? Any books, ideas, websites, apps?

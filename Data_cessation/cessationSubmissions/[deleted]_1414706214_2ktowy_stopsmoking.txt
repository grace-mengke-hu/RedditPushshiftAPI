I want to climb the walls, the cravings are so bad.

I've been cutting down on the cigarettes lately, and have stopped entirely this morning.

I have a neurological condition that, among other things, has a way of making my whole body hypersensitive to, well, everything.  

That means the physical withdrawal symptoms that come with quitting smoking are magnified tenfold with me.  Quitting smoking is quite literally physically excruciating.  I feel like I've been electrocuted or something.

Since the money to go see the doctor just isn't there, I don't have much choice but to ride this out and hope like hell it goes away at some point.  Honestly, I'd rather die of lung cancer than have to simply exist like this.

Right now I would shank somebody for a cigarette.

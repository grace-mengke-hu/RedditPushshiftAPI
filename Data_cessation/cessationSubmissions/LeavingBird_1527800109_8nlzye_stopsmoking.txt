17 days, headaches, fog, depression

I am a bit worried. I have recurring depressive disorder and managed to live with that more or less so far. I take some SSRIs for that, go to therapy like once/twice a month. 

But wow, depression has snuck back in over the withdrawal route. I have some "training" to recognize and not to take the intrusive thoughts too seriously. But it's hard, and seems worryingly close to the worst state I've been in. The brain fog and constant headaches don't make it much better.

I can't concentrate on uni/work right now and play the sick card. Yet I mentally beat myself up for it a bit, cause this inactivity may result in losing courses again and pushing back my graduation. 
Quitting and my health are far more important though. I exercise a bit each day and try to get rest.

I've read some posts here that give me hope! Thank you all for posting/commenting.

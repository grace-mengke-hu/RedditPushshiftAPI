After 5 month dreaming of smoking

Hey,

Iam over 5 month in and i still have a huge craving for cigs. Today I dreamed of smoking. I woke up and felt bad. But in my dream it was a big relieve. Sometimes I try to breath some smoke of other smokers. I think i won't smoke again. There are too many things that make me proud. But when will this deep urge for cigs go away? I don't know if i can't stand this for the rest of my live. Thank you.

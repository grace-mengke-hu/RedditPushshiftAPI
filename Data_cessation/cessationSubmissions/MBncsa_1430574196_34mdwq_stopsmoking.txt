200 days

To be honest, I still do not feel that I earned the right to post a success story to you, but browsing the sub right now, I suddenly remembered all those little stories and advices I picked up from people with triple digits when I first joined.
So in the hope that it helps someone, anyone in here:
**200 days, baby!!!**
Right, it gets better, guys. Much better:
I read about  someone comparing his cravings to a spray of water in the face: nothing major,  just dry it off and continue with whatever you did before. That analogy helped me a great deal in the past, but for me it is not even that any more:
Every two weeks or so I might remember: "some time ago, you'd have lighted a cigarette in this situation". And the next thought is: "oh, I might be a little hungry.", since you learn that there is more that your body communicates to you now than the omnipotent nicotine-craving of earlier days. And as far as 'cravings' go, that's about it.
And for crossing this rocky path now you will soon be rewarded with much more than not having cravings: You'll smell more, you'll smell better, you'll taste more, you'll look better, you'll have more money, you'll have more time, you'll gain the confidence to have overcome a serious addiction! Since I quit, I even began to eat healthier and started running again.
And the best thing is, you get all these benefits just by *stopping* to do something. How cool is that?
Before I quit, I was afraid I will always have some kind of craving - nope!
Before I quit, I was afraid something will be lost to make any moment feel complete - nope!

That is all I wanted to let you know: It doesn't take long until you don't have the feeling that something is lost; until not smoking is the default mode for you. Really!

Stay strong, I am proud of all of you for not smoking today!

Help for others - and what has helped me so far.

This is just a post for people at a similar stage of quitting to me - 20~ days. It's things that have kept me busy, distracted me and utilised my new stockpiles of energy!

**Udemy** - A website with short and long courses on just about everything, I've done some courses on programming and networking - it's something that interests me!

**Ingress** - A game/app for smartphones. The gameplay consists of establishing "portals" at places of public art and landmarks. To summarize, you pick a side, get off your ass, head to a landmark or location and capture it for your team(green or blue). I've found myself going strait out after work, driving or walking to interesting places just playing the game. You often run into other players too, it's very social and a great way to meet new people. I've also seen places/areas I otherwise never would have in my town!

**Cooking** - very strait forward, I have a renewed sense of taste and motivation. I'll browse for recipes online, I've cooked a lot from carrotsticksandcravings.com. 

**Painting Models** Almost a decade ago I used to be into painting model aircrafts/ships/wargaming models. I've taken this up again, it's time consuming and satisfying as your skills build + your final products comes together.

**This subreddit** - Coming back and commenting on here to help motivate and support other people, even posting when you're having a moment of weakness. There is an awesome sense of satisfaction from helping other people, and support for when you feel like you need to break. Also - the constant reminders of how bad smoking is for you helps :)

**Tv Shows** - I've gone on some pretty serious tv show binges to help  fill the void of just sitting around, drinking and smoking. You've all probably got that one show someone has recommended or that you've been meaning to catch up on. DO IT! It's a good distraction, and enjoyable. I've been watching; Justified, Suits, Archer, House of Cards, House of Lies.

**Swimming** - I'm fortunate enough to have a pool, instead of sitting in it drinking and smoking, I've been doing laps. Exercise is hardwork to start, but after a while - the energy and endorphins from working out become addictive in themselves. 

As I said, these are all things that have helped me, even if none of the things above interest you, they may jog memories, bring up ideas for things you used to do, have wanted to do, or have given up on.

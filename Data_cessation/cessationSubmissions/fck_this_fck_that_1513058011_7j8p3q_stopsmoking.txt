9 months - Nicotine Free (Cigarettes , Vapes &amp; Shisha) but not happy.

It's been 9 amazing months I am smoke free. I can breathe better , food tastes really good, my fitness &amp; physique has improved , I can sleep better , my clothes or breath doesn't smell like a dirty chimney . I used to be a heavy smoker for 8 years ; smoking 1 pay on weekdays , 2 packs on a weekend day &amp; 2-4 times a week shisha.

I experience majority of the advantages which comes with quitting smoking except one. Life seems to be black &amp; white , people are no longer interesting to me &amp; I am way less happier than before . Before quitting I used to love socializing with people &amp; I used to look forward to it . I was less anxious &amp; would be up for anything or everything . I used to be a YOLO person ; Even if I was tired I would be up for any plan .But now I just want to be left alone or spend time with couple of close friends. Looking back at my old pics when I used to smoke I realize I was fucking alive &amp; used to do dumbshit without giving any fuck.

The only thing which I can think of this major shift is quitting any form of smoking (cigarettes , shisha &amp; vaping). I have read somewhere the smoking fucks up the dopamine\serotonin levels &amp; the body stops producing dopamine\serotonin naturally .  Not sure if this is happening or not. 

I would love to hear views from other exsmokers too. Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to discuss but I needed to share what the fuck I am experiencing . 

TL;DR : Early 30's dude - Exsmoker for 9 months who finds life dull &amp; boring as fuck . Thinks quitting cigarettes has made me a boring person.

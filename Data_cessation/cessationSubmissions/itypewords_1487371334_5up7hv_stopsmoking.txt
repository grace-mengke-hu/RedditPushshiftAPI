Day 4. Just found this sub.

Thanks for everyone's posts. It's helpful to commiserate while getting through my cravings.

I started smoking in college when I turned 21. I wrote down all the pros and cons and said fuck it - i like smoking, I'm going to be a smoker. 

Fast forward 18 years and the habit has still been going strong. But this week I think I've had enough. 

Day 4. Tonight is going to be tough because I'm meeting a bunch of friends for drinks and many of them smoke. I hope I have the fortitude to resist even with impaired judgement.

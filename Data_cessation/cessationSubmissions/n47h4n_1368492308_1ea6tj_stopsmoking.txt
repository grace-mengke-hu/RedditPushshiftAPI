Accidental quit smoking for 1 week...

For the last week, I've been struck down with the mumps. I've pretty much been in bed for the most of the week, but I'm up and about now. I've always been looking to take the leap and quit smoking, and this seems like it.

I smoked my last cigarette nearly a week ago, and I don't really want to go back to them. I've had killer urges all week, but tried my best to stop them.

My problem is, when I get back to college, I'm afraid that I'll start smoking away. A lot of it is down to habit. It's the same routine. I start my journey with a smoke, when I leave the motorway (highway) I have another one, then before class I have one with a coffee or a Red Bull. I've been going cold turkey as it is, but I'm afraid of relapsing and just going for a packet.

I'd like to know how you guys broke the habit. I'm sure most of you had your "smoking times" during the day. If I can crack that, I'm sure that I can do this.

Any advice is welcome as I'd like to make sure that I can keep the ball rolling now that I've gave it a go.

Thanks in advance guys

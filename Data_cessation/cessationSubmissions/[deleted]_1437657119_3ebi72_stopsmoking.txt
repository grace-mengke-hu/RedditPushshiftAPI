My advice

I am by no means smoke free enough to give advices, but I guess my mark is not so small so.

I've seen a lot of posts and comments claiming "never again" or "I will not smoke. NEVER". I want to give my 2 cents.

When I was smoking I got stressed a lot once I ran out of cigarettes or knew that I only have a few of them with me. I also acknowledge that I am a human being and I can make mistakes so I told myself that I will not smoke but will not force it. If there will be a situation where it will really hurt me not to smoke - fuck it, I better smoke and have some cigs around.

As stupid as above may sound, I have ~10 packs of cigarettes in my house for the whole time and haven't touched them. I sometimes get urges to smoke but I know that I always have cigarettes nearby and it takes no dedication to get some and after those thoughts I calm down and forget the urge.

I reflect on the past when I tried not to smoke but sometimes got nervious and just wanted to have some cigarettes and so started to look around maybe there's someone smoking outside so I could borrow one, or I should go to the shop but I need to dress up.

**TL;DR: Having some cigarettes nearby and thinking that I can smoke if I want eliminated cravings for me almost completely.**

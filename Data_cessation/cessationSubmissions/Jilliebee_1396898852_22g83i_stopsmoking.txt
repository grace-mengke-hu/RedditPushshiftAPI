Smoking cessation related depression

I will start out by saying doctors appointment for it tomorrow. For the most part my cravings are nonexistent. Which should be good news for those just beginning the journey. The aftermath of quitting right now is crippling. I have had some anxiety attacks in the past couple of days. I can't sleep and feel like I can't get off the couch either. I was a pack and a halfer for a decade. I quit cold turkey and the first two weeks were far more awesome than I thought they would be. These past four days however,particularly today have been brutal. I am so depressed and unmotivated to do anything. I am wondering why the hell now? I mean every website and such says it should've passed by now. Most articles saw withdrawal lasts about two weeks. Does anyone have any good information on lasting symptoms or has anyone out there experienced long term depression from quitting smoking?

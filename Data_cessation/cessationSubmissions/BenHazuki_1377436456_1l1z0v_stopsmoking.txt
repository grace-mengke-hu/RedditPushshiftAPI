I'm doing it!!

I'm actually doing this, the countless times in the past when I've started and caved within 24-48hours but this time I'm actually doing it, I've been smoke free for 3 whole days and I feel like this is finally the time it's going to stop. It took me a countless number of times to lose weight before I kicked myself in the ass and went for it. It was really important for me to not start overeating once I quit and I've been doing really well so far. I've stuck to my calories and not had 1 cigarette. I'm so happy and proud of myself now, after smoking for 4 years I never thought I had a problem until I tried to stop. It was so horrible feeling knowing that the addiction was hanging over me and I finally think this is my chance to break free.

It's early days yet but I can honestly see this going from 3 days, to a week, to a month, to a year and so on and so forth.

I just wanted to say thank you, to this sub. Wouldn't have been able to do it without you guys, you're awesome!

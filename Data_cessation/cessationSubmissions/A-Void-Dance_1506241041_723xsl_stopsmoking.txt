Kratom worked for me

NOTE: Kratom is the powered leaves of a southeast Asian tree. Kratom is experimental. There is only a small amount of research on it and dosage is personal. It is not something you will fatally OD on but does have some addictive potential that should be monitored. 

Kratom is [legal in most states](http://speciosa.org/home/kratom-legality-map/).

I spent 6+ years smoking 10+/day...

I realized shortly after I started experimenting with kratom that I no longer had deep cravings for cigarettes. Many people report smoking a lot while using kratom and I definitely started to at first. 

But after realizing I hadn't craved a smoke for hours after a small dose of kratom, I decided to try quitting again and well... It worked.

 Frankly it was kinda easy... I didn't think about it, and I didn't feel the need. I never really counted the days.

Has anyone else used kratom for this purpose? Did it work for you?

I personally found a preference for whites at what is considered a small dose(0.5g-1g 1-2 times/day). I also started by cutting back before ceasing entirely. 

I have stopped kratom a few times without much trouble though I intend to continue using it with breaks. I find the energy and mood boost enjoyable and functional.

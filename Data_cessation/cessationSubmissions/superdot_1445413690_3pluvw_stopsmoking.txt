Quit for 2 years. Time for Round 2.

Quit two years ago, after smoking for 10 years. 

A month or so ago I had a cigarette with a colleague and then went to a wedding and in my drunken state bought a packet. I've been buying a pack of 10 every other day since then. It's so easy to get back into the cycle.

On Sunday morning after a night out I decided to stop again, so far so good. Had a few bad cravings. 

Still feel stupid for going through all the pain of quitting again.

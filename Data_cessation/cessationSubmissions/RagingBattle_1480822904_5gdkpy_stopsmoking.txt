I'm quitting today

I can't let smoke rule my life anymore. It slowly kills. It's taking away from me all that I want. I'll never be a slave again.
It'll be hard. It acts like a friend who tells you it's gonna be okay, and then he stabs you in the back. I don't want to forget about it, instead I want to remember every single moment that I'm stronger than this stupid addiction. I know I've got what it takes and I know it'll be a milestone always there telling me that I can do anything I set my mind to. I'm sick and tired of the coughs and heavy breaths and this bad smell always surrounding me. This is the day where I set myself to be a better version of myself.

I'm having a hard time and I'm constantly under pressure. But I won't give up, because hard times come from bad decisions, and this will remind me of what I'll go through if I give in and make another mistake.

To all of you in the same situation, STOP. SMOKING.
There is always a solution to our problems and smoking it's not. When we smoked we were kicking away our problems making them return stronger and angrier because of the kick :P

Stay healthy.


P.S.: just a tip. It's okay to point out the negative effects. But keeping in mind the *positive effects* will give you the drive and the focus to stay on track. And there are plenty of good effects!

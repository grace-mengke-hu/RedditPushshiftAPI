anger issues

I was really hoping I was going to make it through this without any anger issues but today has fucked that up beyond repair. To prefice I live in missouri, a pretty conservative state by most opinions. I woke up to find out that we had killed one of the boston bombers, "please let them be american" I thought to myself as I braced myself for the shitstorm that was about to ensue. In the past three hours ive heard people talk about how we need to nuke russia, how were going to end up going to war with russia, that the terrorists are really just fall guys for a bigger government conspiracy, how we need to "stop letting people like that into the country" and numerous other things along those lines. I had a pretty good handle on my emotions about smoking up until this morning. Its amazing how much ignorance has an effect on my mood. Im not going to smoke but god damn do some people make it hard.      
tldr: im at work and the ignorance of people is driving me crazy.

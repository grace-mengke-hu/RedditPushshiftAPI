I need to know how to support you

Hi everyone, my partner is attempting to quit smoking after 15 years of doing so. He says that quit lines don’t work because they cold turkey and turn you to the patch. He has been wearing a patch every day for the last 5 days but still smokes about 10 cig a day (used to be 20). He says he has a “plan”. Yet no official date he wishes to quit by. It’s so hard to be supportive and look at the positives because he is still dragging (no pun intended) this on....

I’m fed up. He gets pissed that I get disappointed in him when he smokes. And this whole thing is just making him so unattractive in my eyes...it’s highlighting all of his negative attributes and I don’t know how much longer I can support him through this “quitting” process. 

I won’t leave him for something this stupid, but I can’t deal with someone who won’t grow as a person.

Help today is rough.

I need help im 6 days in going strong and the cravings are getting stronger.  Its crazy i read peoples stories and i feel so opposite. Day 1 to 3 was a breeze 1 craving in 3 days and barely thought about a cigarette. Health has improved and i feel grest. Now day 4 got rough. Day 5 was really bad. Today even worse. I have the shakes,  aniexty is in insane amounts, no matter what i do ever 2 seconds all i can think about is smoking. No matter what i do. Feeling so down passed the point of depression. I know why i quit and why i dont want to smoke anymore. I never saw me go a day without a cig being someone who went from saturday smoking about 25 to 35 cigs a day to 0 on sunday. And now im 6 days in! I dont wanna do patch or gum etc. I just want to be done and never put nicotine in my body again. But i need some guidance because today its bad and i feel like i cant fight it. Someone help. I know to occupy my mind  i have tons to do today but the urges are so strong its almost clouding my concentration. Anyone have any tips because theres no going back. I dont wanna throw away my hard work. Any suggestions or tips would be helpful because i dont wanna go back to that life.

Also experiencing what a lot of people have and thats today im depressed like i lost someone close to me and my mind is telling me the whole is it worth it. Whats a few years? Were all gonna die anyways? 

I dont believe any of it but i am smart meaning my mind is super strong and hard to fight off. It comes up with the craziest justifications its scary. Someone help me before i make a big mistake. Guide me better please because i feel helpless right now.

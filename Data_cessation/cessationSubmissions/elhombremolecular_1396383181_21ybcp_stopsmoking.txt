Methods for dealing with fogginess/loss of focus?

College student here. 

I decided to quit smoking yesterday, and I have come to realize via internet research and experiences from today (day 2) that it is difficult for me to maintain focus. How has everyone dealt with the "quit smoking fogginess"?

I tried quitting before, but I kept coming back just so I could continue studying. I realized, that there is no convenient time to quit, and that I just had to choose a day and stick to it. I will hopefully be going to dental school, and so I realize that studying will be a part of my life for the foreseeable future, and therefore I needed to quit now, in order to stop the smoke-study-smoke cycle later. 

Any help is appreciated. I've basically just been consuming an infinite amount of coffee today.

It was easier than I expected.

I thought that cravings we're going to be like leaving for work trying to remember if I locked the front door. Running late or not, I have to check. There is no other option. 

But it's not.
It's like my fat gumpy dog running through the house with his captain obvious thoughts. Like HEY!! We're driving!! We should smoke!!! 

I thought It would kill me to be without patches. I could use a patch as a crutch, because I have the drug - i just need to get through the craving. I bought suckers, candy, gum, carrots... Anything I could think of. 

I got all worked up in preparing myself for this awful thing. 

I told everyone - after Vegas I'm done, but I don't want to argue with drunk girlyawkward. She dances to her own drum. 

I got back, and I'm not a good loser. So I kept to quitting. Got patches, smallest ones, because I just wanted this to be a bandaid, not a long term thing. I snuck one last drag that morning, and stuck to those patches.

I was so busy being worked up and worried that I stressed myself into mood swings and irritability. 

Soon I noticed one thing that got me about quitting. I felt like I was forgetting something everywhere, I never had anything to fiddle with like ashing my cigarette or playing with a lighter in my pocket. 

So I thought about it. Why am I quitting? I want to try and get pregnant. How can I have a constant reminder? How can I help my fiddle needs? 

So I went to the store and looked for a small child's toy to keep in my pocket. It just happens that I want a boy, so a matchbox car works best. I bought three for a dollar each. Two used coats and my car.

I used the patch for two weeks, then just kept a patch with me for the day to see if I could do it. With some mental high fives I did it. Then it worked for another day, and another. Today I am over a week clean!! 

So quitting for me has been all in my head. A silly gumpy suggestion from old habits. I can deal with that.

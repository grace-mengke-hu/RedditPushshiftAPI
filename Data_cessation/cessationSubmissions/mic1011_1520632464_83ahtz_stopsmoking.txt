Cold Turkey thoughts from a 1-week-in traveller

Today is one week for me, and I feel like the fight is already over. Total knockout, it wasn't even close. 

-I read the Al Carr EASYWAY book.
-I tossed out about 5 cigarettes when I was done reading.
-Began the quit on a Friday night so I would have the weekend
-used 3 sick days off of work which some people don't have the luxury of
-days 1-3 were easier than I was expecting
-day 4 was a bit rough, worst day overall, mind wanting to justify smoking and giving in.  
-day 5 was easier than day 4, and I was surprised at how easy going back to work was on day 6.
-I had my usual coffees, and still enjoyed them without the cigarettes. I still argued about stupid stuff with co-workers and didn't give in to the stress.  IT'S OVER. I WIN.
-it is completely about mindset. Once you are ready to admit that smoking will kill you prematurely, stopping is easy when you are ready.  My motivation is wanting to live a long life to watch my daughter raise a family.  Without this motivation, I wouldn't be so willing to fight in order to quit to be honest.
-find your motivation. Al Carr is wrong. I LOVED smoking. I still would enjoy a smoke with a coffee. But I know I shouldn't have it, and I know I won't have it, and that's ok. I don't want emphysema or lung cancer, and I don't want to say goodbye to my daughter forever until I have to.
-The whole idea is being ready to accept that smoking WILL kill you and cut you off from the end of your life. If you don't care about the end of your life, just keep smoking. If you do care, then stop.

-today was a week in for me. It was easy. Total knockout, not even close.  It's over. I win.

I want you to win too.  Let me know when you feel like you have achieved a checkmate, or a total knockout, or whatever your style is.  That's the moment we're all looking for.

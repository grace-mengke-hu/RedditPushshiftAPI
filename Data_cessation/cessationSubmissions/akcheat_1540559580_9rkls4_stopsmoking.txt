Almost 3 weeks in, it's a struggle

Hey everybody.

I just wanted to relay my experience and see if anyone else had similar ones. I quit over two weeks ago, and the first two weeks I was crazy motivated. I had all the irritability and cloudiness that you would expect from the first couple of days, but I powered through it.

What's thrown me off is that I still don't feel much better nearly three weeks in. My head is still kind of cloudy, I'm super tired, and I'm still having trouble focusing.

Has anyone else had these experiences? I really, really don't want to smoke. I just need to know that it gets better.

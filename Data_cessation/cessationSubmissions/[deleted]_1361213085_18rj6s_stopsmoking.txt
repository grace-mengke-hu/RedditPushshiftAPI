I gotta do this.

Hi there... I'm 42 and started smoking when I was very, very young.  I managed to quit for a year once, for nine months on another occasion, but somehow I keep going back to it.  I have to stop this madness.  It really is insane.  I'm posting this here just so I can have something to refer to when I started bouncing off the walls.

Reasons to quit:

1.  I will add about ten years to my life.
2.  I will be able to run farther and faster without getting out of breath.
3.  My daughters will respect me.
4.  My wife will deeply appreciate it.
5.  I won't feel like shit all the time.
6.  My self-respect will grow.
7.  I will save about $9.00 per day, or nearly $3,000.00 per year.
8.  I won't smell like shit any more.
9.  My breath won't reek.
10.  My sex life will improve.
11.  I will be able to taste food again.
12.  My allergies will calm down.
13.  I will be less likely to get pneumonia, to which I am prone.
14.  Everything else.

Thanks for being here!  I know how great it can be to be part of a supportive community on Reddit... I'm glad you're all here.

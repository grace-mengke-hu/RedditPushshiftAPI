Do e-cigarettes count as quitting?

I haven't had a cigarette in over a month.

It had been almost 20 years.  

e-cigarettes kind of feel like cheating, but at the same time it definitely isn't the same thing.  They don't even fulfill the same urges.  Plus my lungs are coming back, and I'm spending less than 1/3 of what I was.

For me it was all about the smoke.  Vapor ain't even close.  I crave the smoke itself.  
So I feel like if I kill that habit first, the nicotine addiction will be a lot easier to tackle.

Day one, worried about coughing for firefighting physical.

Im 24 and haven't quit smoking since 6 years ago and that was only for 3 weeks. Just recently quit smoking pot and drinking 2 months ago after smoking very very heavy for 8 years. I mean wiz khalifa/snoop heavy. I grew medical in Oregon for along time. I know I can do this because that's the only way I did it with pot, drinking wasn't that big of an issue but I stopped enjoying it so I dropped it with the pot so I didn't end up replacing THC with alcohol.. My only concern with this being day one is that I have a wildland firefighting physical test coming up on the 19th. I know logic tells me to quit right now and Ill be able to breath better but i read up on people having issues with their breathing shortly after quitting and I don't want quitting to make me fail this test. Talk about a catch 22.. Think I'll be fine?

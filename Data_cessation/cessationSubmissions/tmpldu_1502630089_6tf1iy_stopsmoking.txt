Something that helped me quit.

Hi everyone I'm at day 9 and last week was a breeze thanks to this method I discovered.
The idea is to do something different every day. Something you've never done in your life, or at least in years.
Smoking is mostly a behavioural addiction - meaning that it's inherently tied to your everyday habits. Woke up? Time to smoke. Making coffee? Let's smoke. Driving to work? Gotta smoke. Just had lunch? Lunch smoke. Important phone call? Smoke... So how does doing something different everyday alleviate this?  1 Systematically stepping out of your comfort zone will train you not to fall back to your old habits. 2. You will have something exciting to do every day instead of smoking. 3. Your brain has not formed the connection between the new activity and smoking, so you're not likely to get cravings while doing it (and after doing it). What I did last week was, eat something new for breakfast, go swimming, see a movie, golf range, buy a lottery ticket, visit flea market, spend time in nature. Hope this helps. The hard part is coming up with things to do...

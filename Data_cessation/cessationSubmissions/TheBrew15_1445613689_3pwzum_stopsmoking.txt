Chest pains after 12 hours?

So this is about my 4th or 5th time trying to really quit. I've noticed after about 12-15 hours without a cigarette I start to get slight chest pain. It's really odd, and usually I cave and have a smoke. About 10-15 minutes after smoking the chest pains go away. Is this normal? Has anyone else had this? I really want to quit, but man does that really make me want one. The cravings and everything else I can deal with, but the chest pains just make it 10x worse. Should I see a doctor?

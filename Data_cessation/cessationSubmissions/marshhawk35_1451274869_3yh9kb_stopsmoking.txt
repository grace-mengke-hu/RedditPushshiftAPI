2 weeks strong. So what do I do about my partner smoking around me?

I can't believe I passed two weeks today, and I REALLY can't believe I made it through the holidays and several parties full of smokers during that time, without touching a cigarette. It's not been easy, but it's starting to get easier. And man, do I feel physically and emotionally better all the way around.

My boyfriend smokes a lot. It was kind of our thing, actually. Something we shared. So I'm not going to tell him how, why, or when to quit. That's his choice and I know firsthand how hard it can be. The best thing I can do for him is be strong and inspire his own journey to quit.

But the more I heal, the harder it's becoming to stay around his smoking habit. It smells so bad - and wow, I never thought I'd say that. He smells and tastes like smoke and it makes my clothes and hair stink too. I can't ride in his smoky car without getting nauseated, and he can't drive even short distances without lighting up. I don't want to be an asshole about it, but how can I gently ask him to stop smoking around me? Has anyone else run into this situation?

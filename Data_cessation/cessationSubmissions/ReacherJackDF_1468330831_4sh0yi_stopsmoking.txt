Some thoughts to encourage those who want to quit smoking

Hi everyone,

I just reached the 90 day/3 month non-smoking mark after 15 years of smoking two packs a day. I'm pretty excited about it, so I wanted to share with you how I managed to get rid of the habit, hoping this will encourage those who think it will be exceedingly difficult to quit.

I didn't quit cold turkey; tried that, and it didn't work. Instead I went to a doctor and together with him we set up a sort of roadmap to kicking the habit. We started by lowering the number of cigarettes gradually (every week 10% less), while simultaneously getting me on Champix and a very mild anti-anxiety drug to help against the difficult moment. Didn't need to use the meds for long; after one month I completely quit and I felt comfortable enough to continue just with Champix.

When I reached the point of completely quitting, I took a long weekend off (my doctor advised three days of not working, so I could focus entirely on quitting). It was difficult, but manageable. My method was going out for a walk every time I felt anxious, which worked just fine.

After two to three weeks it became easy to not smoke. I only realised I wanted to smoke when I spoke about it, and those cravings ended very quickly. I continued taking Champix for another two months, after which it all went very smoothly. And here we are: three months sober :-)

Quitting smoking feel incredible:
- No more coughing, no more wheezing. My respiration feels normal, my heartbeat is low.
- I can actually climb a flight of stairs now and not feel like I'm exhausted
- Just bought a bike and exercising for the first time in over a decade. It's tough, but it feels great
- People say I look ten years younger
- I expected to gain a lot of weight, but I only gained 2 pounds / 1kg
- Sex is suddenly AMAZING again ;-)
- Where's all that money coming from all of a sudden? :-D 

Anyway, I was one of those guys people thought was never going to quit, but with some willpower and professional medical assistance, it worked. Trust me, if I can do it, EVERYONE can.

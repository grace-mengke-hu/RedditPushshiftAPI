Day 12 - shit’s getting real.

This sub is full of inspirational posts. That’s all well and good, but that doesn’t do shit for me when I’m in the moment. When my stress level is through the roof and that little bastard nicotine monster is clawing my fucking eyes out. Today was the roughest day yet. Extremely stressful day at work. I had talked myself into smoking. I used the old, “just one, then we’ll start over tomorrow.” It worked. First chance I had I was going to walk across the street to the convenience store and buy a pack. I had folded. I knew I would smoke the whole pack. But I didn’t care. 

But it just so happened I was too busy to smoke. Then by the time I had a moment to go buy some, I had talked myself back out of it again. I calmed myself down and used logic to realize I was letting the addiction control me. Nope. I’m in control.

I’ve been smoking for 25 years. I’ve tried everything. Every kind of NRT. I’ve read Alan Carr’s book at least ten times. I quit cold turkey for 2 years, then one drunken drag at a party pulled me right back in to a pack a day.

Addiction is a motherfucker. There is no easy fix. There is no solution or mantra that can save you. It’s all just you. You have to want it and be stronger than the addiction. It’s going to hurt. It’s going to drag you to your knees and beat you down. You just have to be ready and you have to be strong. Today was my proudest day. You are all strong, hardcore motherfuckers and you should be proud too. You’re stronger than addiction. Never forget it.

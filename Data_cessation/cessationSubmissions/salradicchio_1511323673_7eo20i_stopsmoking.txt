This is getting difficult again. Can I hear success stories?

I thought I was over the toughest part, but I just don’t want to do this anymore. I’ve slipped up a couple times but haven’t actually relapsed. My brain is telling me I could be one of those people who just smokes once in a while, but I don’t think that’s actually true. 

So, people who haven’t smoked in six months or more, can you tell me how hard it was for you, how you got through it, and how great you feel now?

Day 12...

Honestly, I didn't think I would make it this far.  But here we are on Day 12!

Stopped after 20 years, pack and a half a day.  

I use the Smoke Free app and it is great.  Any time a craving or anxiety hits, I will do some push ups, sit ups and open the app.  Seeing the progress you've made just makes me more motivated.

You can do this!  Keep up the good work!

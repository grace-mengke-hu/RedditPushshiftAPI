Alcohol and Cravings

I’ve recently quit smoking. I’d say it happened back in January with a couple slips here and there in the first week or two. I don’t know how many days smoke-free I am and don’t think about it or want cigarettes in my daily life and activities. The thing is, though, when I drink I get massive cravings to smoke. It’s nearly consuming. It starts almost immediately after the first drink too... this isn’t some 2:00 AM blackout drunk poor decision making. I’ve caved and gone out for a smoke with a friend while we’re drinking. To be honest, it was enjoyable and felt like exactly what the moment called for. I probably could’ve smoked a pack of cigarettes that night out drinking with my friend. The next day I didn’t want to smoke. When I’m sober I don’t crave cigarettes at all. 

I’ve cut way back on drinking precisely because it makes me want to smoke. Quitting drinking on a nearly daily basis was probably a good thing for me, but I’d like to have a drink or two at the studio with my buddies or a cocktail at dinner with a date without the consuming and overwhelming urge to smoke a cigarette. 

Does anyone have any advice about how to curb these cravings? Should I just give in and smoke while I’m drinking since it doesn’t affect me otherwise? Should I completely quit drinking and be that sober dork with an O’Douls or glass of club soda in every social situation where alcohol is involved?

Has anyone ever tried those tobacco-free herbal cigarettes? We use those at work a lot in scenes where actors are smoking so I have access to them for next to no cost.

So this is day 1 (or day 0 which ever at this point)

So. After many months of getting ready and trying to cope over losing my smoking habit. I finally went out and got the patch. If I don't quit smoking I will lose my health, respect from others, and most importantly the love of my life. So....if there is anyone out there....I hope that I can get some support, cause this already feels like the hardest thing i have ever done...

33 y/o woman here. Smoked for over a decade. Not smoked for +2 years now. I hope my experience helps someone.

I started when I was 15, for the stupid reason I was getting exhausted at my summer job at a cafe and smokers were getting more breaks. My plan was to smoke only that summer but it became an addiction that lasted for more than a decade. I still don't even want to calculate the exact number.

I tried to quit several times over the years but none except for the last two genuinely felt. I was just going by the book 'smoking is bad so I gotta quit I guess.' I read Easy Way to Quit Smoking, it's like dark comedy but I didn't finish because I felt it was really motivating me but I didn't want to get motivated and quit. 

When you live somewhere most people smoke and you see most of them don't die at young ages, fatal disease talks don't overcome your addiction. What DOES happen to faaaar more smokers (every single longterm smoker I know) is getting tortured for years. That's not always apparent to outside at first sight. Especially if you can't compare their situation to their non-smoker version and people tend to associate things with getting older more so a lot of times it's getting older that unfairly gets the blame!

I had shortness of breath here and there but it was mild enough to ignore unless there was an additional problem like a little too much gas in the upper abdomen area - when those happened I always blamed the other thing like "Oh it was gas." One day I was talking to a friend on the phone and it felt so bad, I literally got dizzy from the lack of enough oxygene. I still managed to not show it -- I kept my sentences short, spoke slowly and hung up as soon as I could. I have a sedentary life and that week I also realized some simple things like running very short distance, I couldn't do them. I just haven't realized cuz I haven't tried. It freaked me out. I thought maybe the damage was permanent and I was going to spend the rest of my life struggling to breathe even for TALKING. Around the same time I was also on the edge of tachycardia. Even "almost tachychardia" is scary enough that you think you will have a heart attack and your breathing gets too challenging, all the dizziness and stuff that follow again. I was keep getting new bulging veins, you know smoking damages vein walls. I have blepharitis and getting flare ups more (it's the smoke). I was getting infections more often than the others. I genetically have weak teeth but my dental problems started years earlier than they did for my dad. The last ones are probably not directly about cigarettes but when you literally poison your body on one side your immune system is pretty damn occupied trying to clean it a little to deal with the other shit at its full capacity.

For context, I've never been big on drinking, very little caffeine consumption, generally had a good diet, never did drugs, healthy weight. It was just the sedentary life and smoking and I know other people who have sedentary life, that doesn't explain all the health issues I was having. So I couldn't even try to fool myself like "Maybe this is that other thing." It was cigarettes. Plain and simple.

After that phone conversation I didn't smoke the next week and truly felt some improvement for the better on my breathing. More my breathing got better, the withdrawals got a hold of me though and I caved in for one puff, then started to smoke again half the amount I used to. (around 5 cigs a day) Until a month later I was stressed over something and when I was telling about it to a friend I got out of breathe again, this time my friend noticed right away. I had to stop talking just to go lie down so I could breathe. 

That did it for me. As I was struggling to breathe I tried to memorize that feeling and reminded myself of that every time I get tempted to smoke. Other things that helped:

- I had a box of cigarettes at home, still do actually. When there was no cigarette at home I panicked like "I couldn't smoke even if I wanted to" and that gets stressing. "I can smoke if I want to, I just *choose* not to." was and still is the best for me. 

- Nicotine patches. I only needed to use for about 1 month.

- If you miss the action of smoking, use a straw to drink water. I never saw anyone say that back then but for me it worked better than gums.

- Exercising. They say it's the happiness hormones released during exercise that help but I don't think it was that for me. It was more about releasing anger. I still had nicotine withdrawals the first month which made me get irritated and exercising was a good way of releasing out that anger with cardio, even if it was just taking a walk or dancing for 10 mins at home.

- Generally getting informed about healthy living more. It both gives you a hobby(ies) and makes some simple actions more satisfying and motivational. I educated myself about nutrition &amp; connection to physical and mental health, skin care, then it was like let's say I was eating a banana "Oh with this vitamin in banana, this great thing is happening to me!", "I'm gonna make this dish that will be delicious AND boost my memory and help survive a cold easier and help me get prettier hair!", "I will follow these skin care steps with these ingredients for healthier complexion"

When you generally put effort to improve your health and are aware of the good things you're doing, you get less tempted to stain it with a cigarette.

- If it's going to help you, there is no harm in making this an ego thing. I asked myself things like "Is a cigarette stronger than you that you will cave in?" , "Are you weaker than these people that they quit but you can't?",  "How confidence-boosting it would feel to say 'I  was a smoker but I quit and haven't smoked for so long'?"  

- Financial motivation is also real. Saving up the money I spent on cigarettes didn't help me as it was too longterm. Instead I saved up money for like a week at a time and by the end of it got myself something new and/or did something like going to a different museum.

- And of course usual distraction stuff like binge watching a TV show, reading books (suspense novels are the best, humor comes close), etc


**P.S.**  Don't take any "this side effect happened to me" seriously. Everyone is different. They say quitting makes some people gain weight or increase their appetite, it went totally the opposite for me. My appetite decreased and I lost a bit weight. My mom quit cold turkey and THE only side effect for her she had headache for two days an aspirin could fixed and that's all.

Good luck to you all!

I'm at 14 days and I feel awful.

I don't know what is going on really today. I've had spurts of anxiety throughout the 2 weeks so far but today I am on edge like I haven't been in years. I feel like my body understands this is forever and it's trying to convince me to not do it and to just give in to this anxiety.

I'm seriously at work shaking and sweaty hands feeling. I am now trying to drink as much water as possible and breath calmly but I feel like I am losing it. I don't feel like it's cravings but maybe it is and I'm just not sure anymore. I thought it was supposed to get easier but really today at 14 days I feel so anxious and tired and I've been getting sleep so I don't understand why!

I feel so fatigued and dizzy it's probably a reason for the anxiety though but I've been trying to get 8 hours of sleep every night and I still wake up feeling so tired I can hardly push myself out of bed. 

I'm seriously never starting again! I don't want to have to quit again! This is awful!

Cravings hitting hard

Eeeeeh... guys! 

I‘m off for 4.5 months by now. Proud about it :).

BUT... the past few days I had some rough stuff going on and the cravings started to hit hard again. Literally being close to give in some times. Glad I didn’t.

You got any tips or strategies if things like this happen? I‘m afraid I will give in somewhen :/

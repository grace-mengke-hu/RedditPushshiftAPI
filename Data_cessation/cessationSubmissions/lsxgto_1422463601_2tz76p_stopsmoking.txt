Well. This isn't gonna be easy. Day 1

Just some background on myself. I've smoked for about 3 years now, I started out with Marlboro Red's but switched to Marlboro Special Blend Lights. On a normal day at work I'll smoke about half a pack a day, but if I'm at home all day, 3 or 4 is all I really smoke. As with most people, drinking is when I smoke almost a pack depending on how much I drink. I usually get drunk on the weekends, and I don't know how I'm going to not smoke while drunk, but we will see.  

What has compelled me to quit smoking other than obvious health risks, is I recently found out my dad has COPD, and he continues to smoke. He had quit for about 8-10 years then started back up about a year ago. I feel guilty because I feel like I influenced him into starting again. So I decided to quit cold turkey today. I'm 12 hours without a cigarette and I have headache, and some trouble concentrating. I'm listening to soothing rain sounds on Youtube to help, and reading all these posts and comments have helped with my cravings. 

My trickster brain has tried rationalizing that I could just have a couple today and then none tomorrow, but the other half of my brain knows that's BS. I've also been resisting the urge to get a can of dip because technically it's not smoking....right? But no it's nicotine and just another cancer causing thing to get addicted to. Sorry for ranting, I just really want a cigarette. 

I just thought I'd post on here so everyone knows I have joined the battle!

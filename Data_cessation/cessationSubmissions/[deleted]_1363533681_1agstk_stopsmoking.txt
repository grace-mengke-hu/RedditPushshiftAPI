Licorice Root Sticks to help with oral fixation

I'm 2 days in and ordered some of these. I hope they arrive soon.

On a past attempt to quit, I used this instead of gum or sunflower seeds because it lasted longer and helped with the oral fixation. It worked well for me. 

Not a lot of people have heard of these, so I thought I'd share. I used the minty ones, but they come in tons of flavors. I provided two links as I don't want to make it seem like I'm advertising for any particular website. I hope that's ok. Just trying to help as they aren't easy to search for.

Best of luck to all of you.

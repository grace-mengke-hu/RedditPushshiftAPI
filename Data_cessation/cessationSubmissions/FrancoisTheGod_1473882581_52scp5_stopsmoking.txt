Thanks everyone

I posted here for the first time Monday morning, and it's now been over 2 and a half days since my last cigarette. Pretty sure I haven't gone this long without one in the last 7 years!

Reading other people's stories and hearing advice has been so crucial the last few days. This is the most supportive online community I've ever seen! Thanks for all being great people!

Here's to another 2.5 (and a whole shit ton more) days of no cigarettes!

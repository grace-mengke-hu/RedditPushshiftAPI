Nicotine patches make a big difference

Hello!

I'm currently 7 days smokefree!

I've smoked about 25 to 30 cigs a day. I tried quitting 3 times before, cold turkey. Unfortunately Alan Carr did nothing for me, even though I followed all his advices. I just became one ball of anxiety when I didn't smoke. After about a month I would start smoking again because it only got worse and worse every day, despite me reading his book and doing all those things that are supposed to help. 

This time I figured why not try patches. It's not going to be hurting me more than cigarettes and I didn't really think they would make any difference. I thought it would be just as hard with patches as without. 

BOYYY WAS I WRONG

These patches make it so much easier. I won't say I didn't have any cravings, but all week it has been manageable. I can still drink coffee and beer without really wanting a cigarette. I don't have the urge to eat everything I see. I don't feel anxious and restless like I did during previous attempts. I actually don't think about cigarettes all that much. I only think about all the money I'm saving, all the health benefits, about (almost) never painting my walls again because they are yellow  etc etc.

The first day or two were a bit hard, because I get less nicotine now, but now I'm adjusted and doing great. I really feel this is the one.

My point is, don't believe Alan Carr. Patches are amazing for those who turn into a monster or a wreck when deprived of nicotine and a smoking habit. Ease yourself into it by first quitting the act of smoking and then tapering down the nicotine, if you think that is a better way to go. 


I can see why people go wrong with patches though. It's easy to underestimate the addiction and to go a step down too soon. Just stick to the plan. It's easier to stick to the patch a little longer than to quit smoking all over again. Not one more puff!

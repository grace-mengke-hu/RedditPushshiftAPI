Anyone else get sinus issues after quitting?

I quit four days ago, it's been going really well, my urges are about 5% of what they were the first two days and I'm pretty confident in my willpower to stay on the path. Anyway, I started getting pressure buildup between eyebrows, I've never had sinus problems before so I think it's related to quitting. Anyone else experience this and/or have Abu suggestions?

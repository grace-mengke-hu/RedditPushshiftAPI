Starting today.

Well, stopping. 

I need some help. I smoked for around 10 years. I quit for about 20. I played with nicotine on and off a bit. Cigars, hookah, stuff like that but stayed away from cigs. About 3 years ago I got badly drunk and started again. My parents have both died because of smoking and I know itll happen to me. I want so badly to quit but I have no accountability. My wife, kids, and everyone I work with dont know I smoke. I feel like shit and a liar. I mean, it's because I am. I'm trying to stop smoking but I have no support network. 

I'm starting this account to be accountable to someone, anyone. I'm not asking for encouragement as such but I need a place where I can be honest and talk about what I'm going through.

I've gone 24hrs without cigs a couple of times but can't seem to get past that. I think if I can make it past 3 days, I'll have it licked. It wont be easy, but I'm up for the fight.

 I'm going to reply to this post every day and possibly several times a day and use it to be held responsible for my actions until I'm totally clean. 

It starts now.

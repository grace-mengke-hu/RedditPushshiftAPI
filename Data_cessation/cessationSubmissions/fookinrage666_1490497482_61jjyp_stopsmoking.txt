10 days 9 hours

10 days 9 hours. Still struggling. Surprisingly cravings aren't the biggest problem, although friday night was one long craving - it was the first time I smoked weed since quitting cigarettes and I love to chain smoke when I'm high. For a split second thought ''one won't hurt'' but then I realized F*CK NO, ONE IS TOO MANY AND 1000 IS NOT ENOUGH. I also have quit before and knew that after not smoking for 1 week that a cigarette won't make me feel any better, I will just feel the same and have massive guilt best case scenario, or feel sick and kinda want to puke. Weird feeling to crave and know that the same thing will make you feel bad.

I guess it will take a few times of smoking weed until I get no cravings while high (I guess I have to overwrite the trigger). I have heard from many people that weed helps them quit, but that's definitely the case for me lol.

I haven't experienced much of cravings since the night but the problem is I feel super depressed. I have been fighting with depression for years but now that I have quit it has gotten way worse. I feel so shitty I can't do the things I have to do and things I usually enjoy, I'm just wasting all my time doing nothing and trying to withstand the depression with clinched teeth.

I don't know why is that, I think my endorphin system or whatever is f*cked now that all of a sudden I quit smoking to which my body was accustomed and depended its endorphin delivery to.

I know this won't last forever. I actually felt more depressed than usual last year for first 2-3 weeks but then it went away, so I know this is temporary. 

Fuck is it hard right now, but I'm not giving in. Addiction is very smart, but this time I'm smarter than it. I know that one month from now I will be overall more happier if I don't relapse (Even though at this point it feels like I'm going to be miserable for rest of my life). Just speaking from the experience.

Day 14 update!

My craves are few and far between - usually I just forget that I no longer smoke and think "time for a cigarette!" then realize it's not time at all. Other than that, fairly smooth sailing.

This quit was a bit weird though. Usually I'd be hacking up a lot of garbage but this time...nothing. Is it still just in there waiting? I didn't get a single physical quit symptom that I have had in the past - no runny nose, no cold, no sore throat, no phelgm. Anyone else have this happen?

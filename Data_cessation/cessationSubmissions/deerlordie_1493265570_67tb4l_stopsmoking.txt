Day 49 and I can't stop eating.

It's making me want to start up again, even though I've had no actual cravings to smoke. I can't stand the sudden and very visible weight gain, but also know how bad I'll feel if I slip up after this long. 


(EDIT/ I have an eating disorder and posting this without saying that was my bad.)

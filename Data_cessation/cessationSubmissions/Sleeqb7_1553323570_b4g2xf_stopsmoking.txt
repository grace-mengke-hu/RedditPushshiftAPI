Thinking of stopping Champix early. Thoughts?

Hello friends, I haven't been to this sub before, but I'll likely be back in the future.

I've been a smoker on/off for a decade or so, and I finally decided to quit. I got prescribed Champix and have been taking it for almost 10 weeks. From that time I am now 60 days smoke-free. 

Most people who have tried Champix (or similar) know how the side effects can be, and I'm thinking I should stop taking it as some of those side effects are getting to me. 

Being two months smoke free, I feel like stopping the dosage 2.5 weeks early isn't going to be a big deal. Has anyone else done similar? Do those last two weeks make any real difference? Thanks friends.

1 week smoke free. Questions.

So I've been a smoker for 20 years and I last had a cigarette a week ago Monday and I'm curious if insomnia is normal. I have been irritable, as I was expecting, but I've also only been able to sleep when absolutely exhausted and even when I do get to sleep I'm back up 2 to 3 hours later. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there anything I can do to fix this?

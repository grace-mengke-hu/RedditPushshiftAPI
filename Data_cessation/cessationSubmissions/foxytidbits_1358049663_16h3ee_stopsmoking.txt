Finally made it to four days! Epic! Chantix review.

I kept getting stuck by the end of day three and I finally made it! I won't lie, I do have a chantix prescription now and it is really helping. I was scared to use it before because I have received really mixed reviews. I like it, it's effective. It has in essence gotten rid of the physical symptoms. You do still have to be aware of your psychological self and create sustainable habits for yourself while you are taking it. Also, drinking alcohol will still make you want to smoke. If my friends want to go out I either don't drink or invite them to my place instead. Since none of them smoke, it's fine to have them over. Chantix has given me weird dreams, but nothing I can't handle. I would suggest trying it.

15 years smoker here and the reason why I couldn't quit.

Been smoking for 15 years now. From a few cigarettes a day to now half a pack everyday. I've tried to quit like 6 or 7 times but the hardest part is the withdraw symptoms. The longest I've stopped was for 2 months but not only the craving is strong, I would experience some sort of panic attack followed by shortness of breath. It is absolutely unbearable and scared the shit out of me. Things will go back to normal as soon as I smoke a cigarette. I've heard it might be some kind of acid reflex or mental issue. What can I do before I kill myself?

[edit] thanks for all the suggestion guys, I am not in the U.S. And e-cigs are currently illegal in my country so buying from eBay can be troublesome. I've talked to a doctor about the acid flex and panic attack issues but he said he had never heard of it, it's all in my head. Asked me to quit before it's too late.

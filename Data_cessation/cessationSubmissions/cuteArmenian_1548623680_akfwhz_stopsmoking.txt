ever feel like quiting smoking is overrated?

I quit smoking as part of my "to perfection" journey alongside working out, less stress and well, happiness?   
...

I wasn't one of those "occasionally social smokers" tho, nor I ever smoked just for the "feel of it". I smoked Marlboros, I liked the nicotine but most of all, I liked being a smoker. I identified myself with it.  And now, after a month of cigarette free life, I don't miss the nicotine, I don't feel the urge to get it every morning or after eating, or even when drinking. I just miss the evening cigarette walks with perfectly combined playlists.

  
So, go on, tell me it's my subconscious playing tricks, making me think that it's a decision and not an addiction but aren't we pass that point sometimes?  


the truth is, I don't know.

20 years - I am done

Long time lurker, first post. 
I applied for my badge. I bought my vapor. 20 years ago I made the huge mistake of picking up smokes. I have tried quitting about 5 times now. Longest I have gone is about 3 to 4 weeks. 
So far the vapor is amazing and I have no nic fits going on. If you want advice about the vapor equipment I got, I will be happy to share.

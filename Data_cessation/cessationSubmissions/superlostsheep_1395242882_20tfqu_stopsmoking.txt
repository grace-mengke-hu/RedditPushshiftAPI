fuck you cigarettes. fuck you so hard.

fuck you cigarettes. fuck you so hard. i called the quit line my job offers and they are sending me patches. i'm done fucking up my lungs and future. fuck these things. 6.50 a day to feel like shit in the morning and 20 times throughout the day for some cheap anxiety patch. 

the phone cal with the quit line was more intense than i expected it to be. a little emotional when they asked me what motivates me to quit and all that kind of stuff. asking why i smoke. what's on my mind when i crave them.

i'm buggin right now for one.
fuck this, time to go to work.

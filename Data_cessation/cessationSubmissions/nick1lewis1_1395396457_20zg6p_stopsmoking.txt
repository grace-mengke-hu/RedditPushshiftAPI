Where to start...

I always fall back to the safety crutch of a cigarette. i've been smoking for 12 years, I'm 27, I've stopped several times, sometimes for a week, a weekend, even several months. I've tried replacements like patches and gums, i've tried electronics. i'm a nicotine junkie, but this needs to end. I've even tried reading Alan Carr's book twice and failed to complete it.  I lack commitment, but I'm a committed smoker.

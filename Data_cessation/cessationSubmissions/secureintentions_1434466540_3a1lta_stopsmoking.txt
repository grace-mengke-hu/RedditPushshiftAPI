Day 2... :-O

Ive been about a half pack a day smoker for the last 4 years consecutively. I've tried to quit numerous times but always end up falling off the boat due to self rationalization and of course alcohol. This time I plan to hold myself accountable on here to ensure that I succeed. My last smoke was around 11pm on June 14th..Cravings are pretty bad today already. Oh well.. only a matter of time until i'm free of cancer sticks!

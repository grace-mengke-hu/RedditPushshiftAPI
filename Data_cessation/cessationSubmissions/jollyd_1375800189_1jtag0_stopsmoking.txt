I'm done with this. It's destroying my life.

Okay. Smoking has put a constant stain in my life. I am 24 and have been smoking since 14. I joined the military 5 years back and had to quit. I gained 45 pounds of muscle and looked and felt great! I got out shortly, and back down to 145 at 6"1. Smoking has caused pain in my body, pain in my confidence, and pain in my relationship life. I'm ready to be done with it for good. I've been trying to gain weight and muscle recently and smoking is ruining my appetite. Why?! So here I am finally posting that I am quitting cold turkey. I want to replace cigarettes with calories and eat better. Any suggested gimmick foods I can get from the local store to eat instead of smoke? I'm done with this burden. And I won't look back this time. Not doing it.

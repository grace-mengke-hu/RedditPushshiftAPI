Hit 60 days without even noticing!

The last month flew by without a hitch, and smoking is becoming a distant memory at this point. I've taken up running and also decided to cut alcohol out of my diet (it wasn't doing anything positive for me). Quitting smoking was such a no-brainer decision to make!

To any other self-described social smokers out there, you CAN get through parties, weddings, stressful work weeks, bar nights, camp fire hang-outs, and other social situations without smoking. If I can do it, so can you.

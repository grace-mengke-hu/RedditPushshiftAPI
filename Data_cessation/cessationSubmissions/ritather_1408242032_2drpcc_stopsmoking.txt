Date Set

Having lurked on reddit for years, tonight I start participating.  I am hoping for some fellowship with you fine non-smokers.  I needed a date.  I set September 11.  I never actually counted the years I have been smoking and am blown away it has been 13.  Keep up your good work and wish me luck.

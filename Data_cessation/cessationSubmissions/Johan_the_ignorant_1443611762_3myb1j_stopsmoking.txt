Off to a bumpy start...

I got into a fender bender yesterday when a guy pulled out in front of me straight into my lane. We stopped at a gas station to wait for the deputy and what did I do to calm my nerves? Yep, went right in there and bought some smokes..... :(

I just filled the rest of the pack with water, squished them, and tossed them. Here's to day one and stopping smoking!

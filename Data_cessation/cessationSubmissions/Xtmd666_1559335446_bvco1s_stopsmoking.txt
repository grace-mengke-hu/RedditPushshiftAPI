Health scare has made me want to keep quitting for good.

It's been around 9 days since my last cigarette. I was a smoker for over 2 years, at first a very very heavy smoker, a pack a day or more, and then over time I was a drunk smoker or just a bored smoker. But, always a smoker.

Two weeks ago, I caught a cold, and it just wouldn't end. My cough was bad, and I spit up some blood. I was...nervous to say the least. Cancer is something that runs in my family, and despite my age (25), smoking is gonna get you regardless. So I went in for an X-ray, terrified I had lung cancer, but the X-rays came back ok, and...fortunately or unfortunately I gave myself asthma again. I'm still coughing, and I'm still scared, but I'm not smoking again.


I was a secret smoker, so my family doesn't know. I just wanna never smoke again.

Question: what happens to your voice when you quit smoking?

Dear ex-smokers:
It's said that voices usually become lowerpitched once you smoke long enough. I'm a 24 year old woman and I've smoked for 2 years now. I've always had a low voice, but I don't want it to get even worse.

- When do people (women especially) usually start getting that godawful "smokersvoice"? Aka can I still avoid it?

- What did you notice about your own voice? Did it change in pitch when you quit?

Thank you!

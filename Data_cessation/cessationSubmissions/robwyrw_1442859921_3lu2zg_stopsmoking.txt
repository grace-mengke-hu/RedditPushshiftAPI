Quit 4 weeks ago today!

I'm 28 years old . I smoked for 10+ years. With the help of vaping (e-cigs) I smoked my last cigarette 4 weeks ago. 
I don't even crave them anymore. The first week I had some weird withdrawal symptoms ( couldn't sleep, increased appetite, craving sweet foods, bad gas lol).
For those of you who just started quitting don't give up. 4 weeks flew by and now I feel great.

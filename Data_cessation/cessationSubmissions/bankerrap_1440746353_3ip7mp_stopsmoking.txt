3 day music festival. Time to test the limits.

I quit officially 6 days ago, after a slip up last week. I am going to a three music festival, the type of event I would normally smoke through. 

I have resolved to stay quit. No matter what. 

Wish me luck! I won't let smoking (and nicotine) get in the way of my fun.

Just about 40 hours without a cigarette and feeling great!

It almost been 48 hours and I have to say that this is a lot easier than I thought is was going to be. My theory on this is being that my anxiety has helped me cope with things so fast in the past that I've learned deal with this mentally and thats why it's going so well for me. I still have my moments of course, but they aren't like the first day. I have moments of missing lighting up a cig socially or in the car driving around but that's about it. I hope I get through it completely and never pick up a cig again. Everyone that is trying to quit just take it one craving at a time and push through it, you'll be so happy you did and you will feel soooooooo much better. Heck it's only been 40 hours or so and I feel better already. Good luck to everyone and don't hesitate to comment and ask questions if you need to. I love that everyone here is so helpful and positive, it really does make a difference. If only the entire world could be as positive as this thread we would be unstoppable!! Lol take care!!!

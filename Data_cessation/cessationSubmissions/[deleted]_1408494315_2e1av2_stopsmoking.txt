Been looking for something to fortify my quitting

And it looks like this is the sub. 

I started smoking about a year and a half ago when friends recommended mixing tobacco with marijuana in a bong (referred to as a "popper" for those who don't know). I thought I was above addiction because I had a strong will, but pride cometh before the fall. I'm 20 now and smoke mostly because I enjoy the sensations around it, but starting tonight at 22:00 I'm done. 

I live on my own. No pets, no kids, nobody nearby for me to feel guilty smoking around. I've been looking for something to hold on to, to get me through this, someone that I can be dependable to, someone I'll be embarrassed to say "I fell off the horse", and that's this subreddit. Not one particular person, but all of you quitting with me, I feel like now that I've started by making this post I have people I owe it to to stop. 

Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of friends and a supportive family (They don't know I smoke, I'm 20 and smoke in the morning before my shower and after work), but my secrecy has left me dependable to nobody. Maybe that's just an excuse I've been telling myself to keep it going, but it's changed now.

I'm not scared, I'm not intimidated, I'm not nervous, I'm fucking confident that I can do this. See you guys at my 1 week check-in.

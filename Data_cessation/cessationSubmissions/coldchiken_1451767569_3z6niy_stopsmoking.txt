What are your experiences with organic tobacco?

Hey guys!  
So, I've been a smoker for about 2 years now and recently trying to quit. At first, I tried doing it cold turkey but (surprise!) couldn't do it. So, a friend of mine who is also a smoker quit cigarettes and started smoking pure organic tobacco, and I decided to do the same. I've been smoking it for about 3-4 months now and I noticed a big difference, both in the quantity of cigarettes per day and the frequency of cravings.  
Just to be clear, I'm talking about the tobacco that comes in those little packages with about 25-30g each, not those pre-made ones with the regular cigarette paper (here's a [pic](http://d1fzrfeqgmqjkr.cloudfront.net/assets/03474/produtos/3570/thumb_145-145-fumos-fumo-para-cigarro-hi-tobacco-organico.jpg)), and I use short rolling papers and cotton filters.  
The reason I'm making this thread is to ask if anyone else had the same experience as me. Is switching from regular cigarettes to organic tobacco a good way to stop smoking knowing that it reduces cravings and massively reduces the quantity of cigarettes a day (I used to smoke about 10 cigs every day, and now I'm satisfied with 2 or 3, not to mention there are almost no chemicals involved)?  
Thanks!

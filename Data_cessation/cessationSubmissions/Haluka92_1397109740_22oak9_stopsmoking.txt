On my 11th day, starting to get a lot of mucus, running nose.

I found another thread on the top page showing the [Benefits Timetable](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html), and I'm on day 11 although I feel as if I'm one month in. Could the fact that I'm using a vapourizer for marijuana be increasing my recovery rate? Does anyone else know anything about this?

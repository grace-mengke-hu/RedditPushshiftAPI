What Can I do to support my boyfriend in quitting?

My boyfriend has been leaning towards trying to quit smoking.  He doesn't find them as attractive as he used to.  Sometimes he wants to quit, and other times he doesn't.  His project for his wellness class in college was to quit smoking, but he doesn't seem completely committed to the idea.   

Personally, I quit smoking one week ago, after a few months of trying.  We both have been smoking for about the same length of time, although we smoked before we met each other.  His best friend also quit about the same time as I did.

I know ultimately its his decision to stop, and I don't want to be a nag.  However, I do want to try and be as supportive as possible, and maybe make his resolve to quit a little stronger.  The last few weeks he has talked about quitting more, so I think its on his mind more frequently.

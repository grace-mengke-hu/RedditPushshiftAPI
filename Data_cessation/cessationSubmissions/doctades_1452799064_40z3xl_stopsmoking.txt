Joined because I am 26 days in on my 4th and final try to quit and looking to see if people have pointers or want to share quit tactics

Hi everyone, As the post says 4th time I have been fighting to quit. The frist three times were days, months and then a few more months of quitting. As I have come to find out. Quitting is the hardest thing to do overall. However I wanted to say that things that got me through quitting were to replace smokign with other activities and trying to avoid triggers. But throughout time I couldn't end up finishing it off because ultimately I wasn't quitting for me. And this go around that has changed. I know when people say they quit forever they have done it for themselves. Not a significant other or anything else but for themselves. Has that been the story with most of you guys?

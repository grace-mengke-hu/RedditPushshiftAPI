ðŸŽ‰ðŸš« 90 Days Smoke-Free Today ðŸš«ðŸŽ‰

I'm sharing this to give back to the community that helped me so much early in my quit! It is sort of surreal to look at my Smoke Free app (if you're not using it please download) and see my 3 month badge and that all but the long-term health improvements (i.e. reduced risk of lung cancer) are now drastically improved or normal again. 

At 3 months quit, I feel GREAT and no longer deal with any withdrawal symptoms. I no longer crave cigarettes; however, I still log into my Smoke Free app for accountability.

Hopefully this is encouraging to people just starting or early in this process. Stick with it! I relapsed once after a month quit and then again after two weeks quit, but I didn't give up. It's so much better living FREE!

1st Day on NRT

So here it is, today was my first day. I am using NRT(patches and gum) and even though I have not felt any withdrawal symptoms(yet), I can feel that a part of me is missing.

 it's like I am not completely me. I don't know how to express it better. Anyway, I have been a smoker for a decade and have grown quite tired of it lately and decided that it was time to quit for good.
 Now that I am not smoking, I feel like the time is passing slower, and the colors are not as bright as they used to be. A Strange feeling of nostalgia. I was fidgeting a lot today, playing with my wedding ring, trying to occupy my hands. I briefly panicked when I got off work as I was looking for my lighter that I couldn't find in my pockets, but remembered that I threw it away yesterday. 

To tell you the truth, I had to have an exam of my lungs done a couple of months back and I was scared of the result. Thankfully there was nothing, but I guess it gave me the last push I needed to finally quit.

I have used other addictive substances before and I never had any problems quitting cold turkey but I knew I just couldn't do that with tobacco. 

Good luck to everybody out there.

20 years old and I want to stop before it gets worse.

I'm 20 and in college. Not only is smoking a money drainer, it's really bad for my health. Regardless of these facts, I can't seem to get myself to quit smoking.

I was an occassional smoker until recently this summer when I slowly began to smoke about 4-5 cigs a day. Luckily I have a job that keeps me occupied for 6 hours a day so it limits me from smoking. I've already noticed that I can't breathe as well through my nose and I get tired easily doing seemingly easy workouts. What are the best ways to just motivate myself to stay away once and for all from cigarettes. I really want to quit for myself now and myself in the future.

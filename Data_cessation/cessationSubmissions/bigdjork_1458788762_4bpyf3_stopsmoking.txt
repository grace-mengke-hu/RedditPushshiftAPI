Figured out how to make time stand still

Quit smoking!! Lol. I can't believe it's only been 22 days. Thank God for this sub, I honestly don't think I would've made it this far without it. Just coming here gives me daily reminders of what I'm doing and why; really affirms my choice and I'm so glad I'm doing this again. Thank you all, and keep up the good fight!! Remember, just one is too much, and a thousand not enough!

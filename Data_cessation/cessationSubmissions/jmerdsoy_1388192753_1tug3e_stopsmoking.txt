Anyone else have this kind of 'nostalgic' experience?

I've been quit smoking for almost 3 months now. It's not my first quit but I'm really feeling good about it this time. However once or twice a day I get a craving and start to think about smoking and I generally get pulled into one of two day dreams:
1) I just fantasize about how 'nice' it would be to be able to step outside and light up, thus completing that delicious meal/fighting the boredom of the present moment/deliberating on a problem or whatever I'm currently doing. It just feels in my imagination that 'taking 5' for a smokey treat would be almost orgasmic right now. The feeling passes but while it's happening I feel quite empty knowing that I will not allow myself to smoke.
2) When I think of good times in the past (partying, travelling, hanging out with friends), I get an empty pang in my stomach knowing that the 'beloved' cigarette will never again be a part of that picture and it still seems, on an emotional level, that smoking was an integral part of those good feelings I had while doing those activities....it's as though those things will now be sub-par because I won't be able to smoke. I know on an intellectual level that this is bullshit addictive thinking but it's still convincing on a deeper emotional level.  
Can anyone relate?

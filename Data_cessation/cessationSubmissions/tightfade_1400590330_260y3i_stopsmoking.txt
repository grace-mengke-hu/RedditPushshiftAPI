I can't say enough about Allen Carr's book!

Before yesterday, I didn't even want to quit. I smoked for 12 years at about a pack a day. Someone on Reddit recommended it in some other thread I was reading and Allen just spoke my language. Every fear I had was addressed in the book and I can tell it's going to be a life changer. I threw out all of my cigarettes and e-cigs last night and I AM DONE. I'm happy to be a part of this community and congratulate all of you for giving quitting a shot. 

Now does ANYONE have a cigarette because I need one. Just kidding, the nicotine withdrawal is actually manageable but I can't imagine being successful if your first day was extremely stressful.

My commitment

I quit 21 days ago. Writing here and sharing my thoughts and feelings has been really helpful. Reading your posts has been really important to me .
So today it is time for me to make a commitment. A serious one, so everybody here can read it and it makes it more real to me.

I promise I will never smoke again! Not even a puff. I promise this to me and everybody that can read this.

It maybe seems something silly to say here but it is important to me to write this and say it here in a place that has been so important to me these days fighting against cigs.

So thank you just for reading this.

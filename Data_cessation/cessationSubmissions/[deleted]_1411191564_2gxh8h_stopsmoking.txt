Just had my last cigarette

I have been smoking the past 3 years, average of a pack a day. I made few attempts to quit, out of which the longest one lasted for over a month and it was through chimpax. Anyways, here I am, more determined than ever, and I believe it's because I have found this subreddit, where people like me successfully tried and are trying to quit. 
It's good to start, it will be tough to keep up, and it's gonna be rewarding to look back at and see what has been achieved.

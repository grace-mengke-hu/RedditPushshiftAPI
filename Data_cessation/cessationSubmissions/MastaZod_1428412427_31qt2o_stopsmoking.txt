What a nice application ! Smoke Free Beta

Hi !
I think that a lot of people already know this application but... It's for me one of the best help I received (after you guys ;) ). 
It's counting everything :
-Time being smoke free
-Money saved
-Cigs not smoked
-Cravings and severity (with graphical to show evolution)

There is also a daily mission to realize in ordre to help you to become a non-smoker (working your mind is really great!) and some achievement.

It's really motivating and I recommend it ! I wasn't on reddit before this app told me to discuss with people on /r/stopsmoking.

Btw, 24 days today :) I'm happy !

Husband hasnt gotten a full nights rest ever since he quit

He quit 2 months ago and he says hes been waking up several times throughout the night EVERY night. Itâ€™s been affecting his sleep, so he tried taking melatonin which worked but he doesnt want to rely on it. Is this a common withdrawal symptom?? If so does it ever go away?

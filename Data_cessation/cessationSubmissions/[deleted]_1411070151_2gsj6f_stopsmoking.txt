Question for those that have quit smoking for a long period.

Hi all! I quit smoking since the beginning of July. Other then the occasional craving after dinner I don't feel any need to smoke anymore. I still deal with extreme fatigue however combined with a lack of concentration. Is this normal after more then 2 months? Did it happen to you? I read on the internet that this should go away after a few days/weeks..

Day 20 - Still feels surreal sometimes

So today officially marks 20 days of being smoke free! 

What I notice most is that it is a mixed feeling at this point.Things feel different but in another sense not that much has changed. I still grab my morning coffee and feel like something is missing and I still feel that craving every time someone lights a smoke in front of me. But it is a much more mild version of what it once was. 

It feels a bit like limbo: a space where everything isn't quite right but far from horrible. It is also the time where things usually start to unravel for me a little bit. I think it is because there is still a lot of work to do but it is less obvious what it is at this point. 

Anyways - I will enjoy the day and thank you for listening and the support you all offer.

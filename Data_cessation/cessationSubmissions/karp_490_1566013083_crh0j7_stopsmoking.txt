Maybe a little bit of an odd question, where can i put my patches so they wont come off during a days work?

I basically do heavy lifting all day, and my arms and shoulders are constantly getting rubbed against walls, or moving a lot. Take today for instance, i had my patch on my right arm, and by the end of the day it had somehow worked around to my upper back from all the sweat/movement

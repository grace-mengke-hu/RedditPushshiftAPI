Any tips for quitting?

I'm a heavy smoker, had one this morning and haven't smoked for 4 hours now, bought some patches but even though it's been such a short time I think the fact me and my partner are arguing is making me feel a lot more stressed and in need of a smoke :/ any tips would be good - the patches are already super itchy :/

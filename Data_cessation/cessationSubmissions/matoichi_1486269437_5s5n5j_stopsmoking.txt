Never thought id get here but - 1 year free!!!!!

after nearly twenty years of 1+ packs a day and many failed attempts at quitting, finally reached the milestone i was always envious of seeing others reach on here. If I can do it, anyone can, i was hopeless addict. the key for me that made it possible this time - a very supportive wife. Good luck to anyone still struggling, keep at it and never give up.

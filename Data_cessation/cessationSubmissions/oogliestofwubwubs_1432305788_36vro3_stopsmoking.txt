Day 3 is not the bad day, day 5 is. Fuck you day 5.

It's taking everything I have to not go to the store and buy cigarettes right now. The toddler has done nothing but tantrum all morning, every noise is on my nerves and I swear to god if he doesn't stop crying I'm going to lock him into a bedroom.

I mean really. Who the fuck came up with the lie that day 3 was bad. IT'S NOT. It's NOTHING compared to day fucking five. NOTHING.  

I want to rip someone's throat out.

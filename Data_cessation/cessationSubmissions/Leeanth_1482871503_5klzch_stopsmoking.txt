I am planning to become a cliche

I quit for two years a few years ago. Had a few crises and talked myself into starting again.

I am going to be a cliche New Year non-smoker this year. I already know I can go for hours on end without a smoke since my failed quit. So I'm going to take that to the next level.

I remember how great I felt three weeks after quitting, when I could walk without being breathless. I remember how meditating myself to sleep felt physically, so I'm going to use that.

Am starting a new job in Jan. I will be expected to attend conferences and events from time to time and I am not going to be the stinky one there.

I did it once; can do it again. I know Jan 1 is a cliche and one that people set for failure. However, I also set a start date last time and it worked...

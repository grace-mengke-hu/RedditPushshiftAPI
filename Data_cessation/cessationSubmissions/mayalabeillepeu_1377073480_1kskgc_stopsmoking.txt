I stopped a year ago today

I was one of those that 'couldn't quit'. I would cry out of frustration, I felt like more of a loser everyday I smoked. I googled a bit, and came across this community. 

I decided to use EVERY resource I could to stop, because I was getting very sick, and still couldn't quit. 

I got Zyban (I did not smoke cigarettes with high nicotine, so Chantix was pointless)from the doctor (2 reasons - it would help my anxiety, and more importantly, it would choose my quit date FOR me, because I could not)

I made an elaborate chart documenting my progress with rubber bands for my wrists, and a little tool bag with snacks, lollipops, motivational cards, in fact, anything that made me feel like this was a mission to Mars and that I had work to do.

I did everything I could to help myself. I even dug out an old Allen Carr book, which I read after being quit a week. It made a lot more sense to me then.

After my 3 months of Zyban finished, I had a Wellbutrin prescription from my doctor for another 3 months. I needed to stay quit.

And I finally did it. It has been a year, I haven't smoked 7 302.8 cigarettes, I saved a buttload of money, and I haven't lost my breath or been sick since.

Thank you beautiful people of Stop Smoking, you started my journey.

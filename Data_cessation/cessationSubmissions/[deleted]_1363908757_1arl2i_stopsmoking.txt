Terrified about health: Day 3

Just coming to the end of day 3. Still haven't smoked at my new job. I'm taking my inhaler far less, my smell and taste are back. Concentration is dire but I'm eating lots extra to keep up my energy. Up before 8am everyday. Wierd pains/sensations in throat and lungs. Complete acid overload going on in my stomach.

Fuck it, it's better than smoking!

Christ on a bike, I can smell my farts.

All awesome, rock on the weekend.

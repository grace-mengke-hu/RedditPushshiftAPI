It's only been 3 days but I know I never need to smoke another cigarette. 

Yesterday I had a one of those seriously frustrating mornings where I couldn't find ANYTHING, I very VERY nearly got in a terrible car accident, took two exams (one of which I was shaky on the material), spent four hours in a car driving to & from a concert, and got drunk. No cigs. And it feels fucking GREAT HOLY SHIT I FEEL GREAT. 

I just wanted to say thanks, I have been contemplating quitting for about six months and subscribing to this thread really gave me some motivation to get my shit together. 

I started yoga at my school and damn, that feels great too. Fuck smoking, fuck cigarettes.

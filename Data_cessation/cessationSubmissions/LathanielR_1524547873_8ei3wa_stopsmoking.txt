Day 226 and a realisation

Its been quite awhile since I last posted, to be fair,it's been quite awhile since I last thought about smoking, let alone actually wanted to. Life has become comfortable, something I could never have imagined happening during that first hellish month. I have achieved an almost Buddhist peace, a peace active smokers cannot imagine, a freedom fresh quitters yearn for.

Something I've worked hard for, suffered the pains of withdrawal for, endured the seemingly unending anxiety of starving yourself of nicotine. To callously throw it away, by having cigarette after cigarette, with any feeling of remorse squashed by " I'll stop again tomorrow, I've done it before anyway".

Thankfully this wasn't a real relapse but a realistic dream, a dream that could easily become reality.

That dream shook me to the core, after coming so far, I was willing to give in to an urge I no longer feel. Willing to surrender my freedom to a drug I'm no longer addicted to.

My realisation is that no matter how comfortable we become as non smokers, we are ex smokers who can become re-addicted from one smoke. We cannot afford the luxury of complacency, as easy as it is, we cannot afford to forget the journey that brought us to where we are, as much as we'd like to.

Remember the pain of addiction, the inconvenience of addiction, remember the pain of breaking free. And don't smoke today, stay free with me

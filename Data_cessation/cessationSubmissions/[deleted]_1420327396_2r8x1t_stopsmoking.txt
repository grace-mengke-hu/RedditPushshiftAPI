My husband just quit. How can I keep up the support and enthusiasm while he's a grumpy ogre of a person?

I am SO happy that he quit. It came out of the blue. We were at my parents over Xmas, where he couldn't smoke, and before he knew it he was already over a week smoke-free. So it wasn't a planned thing, which is why I want to tread carefully and not blow it.

My normally very sweet, funny husband has become volatile and snappy, and I'm not sure how to handle this for the next however many weeks or months. I'm afraid that too much bickering will cause him to light up again, but I don't want to quietly suffer thorough his mood swings indefinitely (I can only take so much crap).

Former smokers or partners of former smokers: what should I do?

Feeling really rough but hanging on

For the past three days I've been dealing with what are in my case the worst enemies of smoking cessation: anxiety and emotional lows. Due to a combination of factors, I've had some pretty high anxiety peaks and low emotional lows... Every time I tried to stop smoking in the past, I went back to cigarettes when I felt emotionally overwhelmed by something. So far I've managed not to do that, but I would be lying if I said it wasn't difficult.

I've had to put in an insane amount of mental work in to remind myself that the short lived dopamine high I would get out of a cigarette is not worth it. Not worth the feeling of failure I would get from stopping my progress (which would make me feel even worse than I do right now), not worth the health risks of becoming a regular smoker again... I've reminded myself a hundred different ways that smoking is not what I *really* want, that I can totally get through all of these emotions on my own, with no crutch, that whatever one feels at any moment will always go away eventually, etc.

I'm proud of myself for hanging on to my goal, but I really hope that the moment I no longer think of cigarettes as a potential relief when feeling down or stressed comes sooner rather than later. My "normal times" cravings have really reduced a ton over the past two weeks, and they aren't really much of a problem anymore. But the emotional distress cigarettes - I am still tempted by those for the moment. And I'm worried at some point I'll run out of energy to do all of this emotion "management".

Hope I'm not going to bum anyone reading this out... But the reality is that my greatest motivation for sticking with it right now is the feeling of accomplishment I get out of not caving to my worst impulses and the desire to avoid feeling like a failure.

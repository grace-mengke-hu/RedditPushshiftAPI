Tired of my life being controlled by nicotine. I hope to quit right now.

I honestly time almost every activity around smoking. I think I am finally tired of it, and will deal with the 2-3 days of being sick as hell while I physically get over the addiction, and hope I can stick to it mentally as well. I have the next 3 days planned curled up on the couch with Netflix. After so many attempts to quit, including Chantix, patches, gum, etc, I have decided the only way is totally cold turkey and a strong mind. Wish me luck.

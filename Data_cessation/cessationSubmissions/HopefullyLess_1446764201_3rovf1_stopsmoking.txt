Having mediocre urges in the last while, but there's a thing that reaffirms my quitting

I went to the dentist a week ago and got my teeth whitened and cleaned professionally. That feeling of not wanting to ruin the cleanliness and the fact that I don't have gingivitis anymore is enough external motivation to keep me from smoking, for the time when I'm a bit unsure inside. It's great, I couldn't believe that teeth can look like this!

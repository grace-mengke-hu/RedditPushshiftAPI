Day 3 - 14 years smoker

I'm at day 3, I've been smoking since I was a kid and never stopped. I'm quitting right now without saying anything to anyone, I just do not want any expectation on me at this point. 

I feel kind of nervous tho, I do have my tabacco with me but I'm choosing to not use it, I don't really believe in throwing the cigarettes away as a symbolic gesture, I believe is way more valuable to look at it and choose to not touch it.

What do you think? I kind of like to hear some motivation story right now.

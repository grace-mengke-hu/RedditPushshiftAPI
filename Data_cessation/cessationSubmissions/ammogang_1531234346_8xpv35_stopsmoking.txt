Relapsed on the 16th day. Need your help.

I was so proud and happy. Everyone thought I seriously left smoking. But on the 16th day of no smoking, I relapsed. It was my exam day and my exam went really bad and I was too stressed about it. As soon as I left the examination hall, the first thing I did was to light a cigarette. I didn't even like the taste of it. I somehow smoked it with my friend. I didn't smoke the full cigarette, I shared it with my friend. It's my 4th day today after relapse. I've been smoking here and there since then. I didn't bought any cigarette untill now, I was smoking what my friend bought for himself but  Just few minutes back, I bought 2 cigarettes for myself. I don't know what to do now. I'm already too stressed and this smoking thing is making me more. I seriously need your help guys. I'm too confused and lost.

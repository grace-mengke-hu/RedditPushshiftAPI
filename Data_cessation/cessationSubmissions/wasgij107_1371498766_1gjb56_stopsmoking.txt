I do not have a smart-phone...

I would like to keep track of things like you guys are doing with your fancy apps on the smart phones but I do not have one and I can not find a website that would help me. I have already been over 3 weeks and the only site that I have found wont let me go back to put in a past quit date. Anyone have any ideas?

How to help?

My girlfriend is going to quit smoking soon. She's basically doing it for me because we're moving in together. The problem is she doesn't really want to and I'm worried she won't be able to follow through. All in all, I just don't know what I can do to help her other than tell her I love her and she has my support, but that doesn't seem to be enough for her to actually want to do it for herself and not me. Should that be enough? Worth noting, she recently had a scare with a mass in her chest and all her doctors told her she *has* to stop ASAP. Every day that goes by that she smokes is one day closer to that mass being cancerous. I've never helped someone stop before and I don't know how to do this correctly without pushing too hard, so any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

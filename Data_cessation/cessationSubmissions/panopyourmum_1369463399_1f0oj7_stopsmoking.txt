86 DAYS but I'm still craving badly, even worse now than at the beginning but dealing with it somehow...

So it has been the toughest 86 days I've gone through in my life - I've lost a bad habit and went through a bad bout of illness to kick it, I lost my unborn child and my fiancee dumped me, got very ill from severe food poisoning, have had to deal with severe leadership issues and an increased workload at work because my boss took off and left this huge gap which I've had to fill with hardly any cooperation from my colleagues except for those who joined around the same time as I, also have been working hard against time to complete a pilot study for a masters programme which was forced upon me by my work place (ironic isn't that pseudo-slavery in the modern world comes with the tag "masters") and am also facing personal financial issues which leaves me with just a $100 at the end of each month after paying my commitments... This shit just won't stop piling up. 




Have turned to drinking nightly(it doesn't cost anything because I take my father's alcohol from his collection, he is no longer allowed to drink, doctor's orders) not to get pissed but just to get along with work. 




What's happened is that I've been dreaming of ciggies in the past two weeks, craving them really badly and I'm fighting myself not to fall back into that trap. 




I turn 30 in about two weeks and it has always been my goal to stop all these vices, especially smoking. Waking and baking with weed was something I stopped on the first of January and to be honest I've never felt any better but just can't understand why I am craving cigarettes of all things! 




I just needed to rant...

I smoke because I get depressed about life

Long story short, but I can make it usually about a month before I get really depressed about life in general especially living in America. Currently I'm unemployed after a really bad working experience and I just can't seem to get over the fact that America is based on consumerism and people's belief that you are only as good as the job you have. I'm 24 have a college degree and have worked what people would consider "good" jobs, but everything after college has only brought me more depression. I don't know what to do and honestly the only thing that comforts me is smoking knowing that I won't have to be here much longer to deal with this. I know that this is a rather sad post,but I don't know where else to post this. I feel that the real world is a place that is only for people who are willing to just throw everyone under the bus to make another buck and there is no room for those that want to be nice to people and hope to see the best in humanity. Any helpful thoughts would be welcome.

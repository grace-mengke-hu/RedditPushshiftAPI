It's time

After smoking for 9 years, its time to quit this crap.
Im 27, still a student, living with a GF who also is gonna try to quit.

She is going cold turkey, How can I support her?


Im thinking about using Nicotine gum to help me thru the first days, is this a good idea?

Ive been lurking this place for some time, and you all seem very helpful towards others. 

Thanks

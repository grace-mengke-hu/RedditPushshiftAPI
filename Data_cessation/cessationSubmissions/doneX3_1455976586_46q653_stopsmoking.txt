Day 90. "Afgelopen"

Hey I'm at Day 90. Woo hoo.

Best advice: "Afgelopen."

[Afgelopen](http://translation.babylon.com/dutch/to-english/afgelopen/). It's a Dutch word my dad said a lot to me as a kid. It means, done, the matter is closed, no more discussion. I signed onto reddit as doneX3. Done, done, done. I was resolute that smoking was not going to be part of my life any longer. This is not the same as willpower. I just knew that smoking was stupid and had to go. I still struggled with withdrawal but I was resolute. No turning back. It helped my attitude very much compared to past quit attempts.

Find some word or phrase like that, with personal meaning. My NZ lifting instructor says, "Kia Kaha", stay strong. Say it out loud when you need it.

All the best to you!

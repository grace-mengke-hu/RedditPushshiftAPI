4th day, got drunk, didn't smoke:)

I've been struggling to go more than 2 days without smoking, even if it's only been one cigarette. It's almost like I've been afraid to commit to 'breaking up' with cigarettes. This addiction truly is an abusive relationship. I have been taking welbutrin and am incredibly satisfied with how it has helped me to quit. I have a few days left of the prescription and am eager to get off the meds as well. Just posting because I'm proud of myself :) 

I hope everyone else is doing great too! Anybody else taking welbutrin to quit?

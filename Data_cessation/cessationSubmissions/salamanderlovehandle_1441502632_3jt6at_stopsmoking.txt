Intense fourth day cravings

I started to get really serious about quitting about two weeks ago.  I'm using lozenges at the moment, which I don't love, but they're helping.  Every fourth day, like clockwork, I have an extremely strong, constant craving throughout the day, and the replacement doesn't really do it.  I smoked a cigarette the last two times, but today I really would like to avoid that.  Anyone have suggestions on how to pull through this weirdly consistent obstacle?  My toes are curling and I'm doing my best with super deep breaths, but it won't even momentarily subside.  I could really use some help.

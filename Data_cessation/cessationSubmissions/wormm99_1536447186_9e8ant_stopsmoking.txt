3 months no smoking, brain telling me it’s okay to have just one. Cant fight it

So I had been three months smoke free but the last three weekends I had been tempted and failed to have just one cigarette at the end of a night drinking. I had been drinking before with no problem. My brain has reasoned that its perfectly okay to have just one and it won’t do any damage. However, that next day I can feel it with dry mouth, etc. But I’m still lying to myself that it’s okay. I can’t seem to beat it and can’t remember how I beat this previously. Advice???

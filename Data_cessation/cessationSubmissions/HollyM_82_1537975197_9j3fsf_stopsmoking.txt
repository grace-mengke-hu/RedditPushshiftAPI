They said that the first 72 hours are the hardest. LOL. No.

I’m 12, almost 13 days into my quit. I stopped cold turkey and thought that I was through the worst after the 72 hours had passed. lol. 8 days in I was an emotional wreck and then yesterday again my emotions were ALL OVER. It almost seemed like a breakdown. I’m pretty emotionally stable most of the time and don’t freak out. Well...let me tell you...I don’t know who this girl was and I don’t know why she’s living in my body. 
When will this end? 
I feel like smoking will save my husband from the raging banshee I’ve become. I know that’s the addiction talking and that he’d rather put up with my mood swings rather than cancer but seriously. I feel like a crazy person.

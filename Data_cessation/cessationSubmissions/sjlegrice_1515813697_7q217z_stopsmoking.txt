Day 12 of not smoking and I have gained weight already!

Is it just bloating or am I really gaining this much already. I've already gained 5 pounds in 12 days!  Is that normal?!?!  I've worked out 5 times in one week too, what the heck?  Cravings werent so bad today and I only had two pieces of nicotine gum.

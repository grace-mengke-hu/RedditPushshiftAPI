How to take the last step; 1 cig a day to none?

I'm weaning off smoking as I have been for a while now. I've been a smoker for 4 years, and at it's worst I'd go through half a pack a day. Some days ago I made the leap from 2-3 a day to 1 a day, and I was wondering what the next step will be after I've adjusted to only one. It's always good to plan ahead. Do I keep weaning down? Do I cut completely after 1? (I'm also on a diet, so I'd like to prevent cravings as much as possible so I don't overeat)

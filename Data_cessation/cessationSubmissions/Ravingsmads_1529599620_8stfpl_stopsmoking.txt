[Discussion] When did you stop having cravings?

Hello,

So finding an answer for this proved surprisingly difficult. So I thought I might ask here. I know everyone's experience is different and don't take this as a "if you still have cravings after X it isn't working for you, just smoke"... because I know how the smoker's brain could work :P.

For how long did you smoke?

For how long after quitting did you get cravings?

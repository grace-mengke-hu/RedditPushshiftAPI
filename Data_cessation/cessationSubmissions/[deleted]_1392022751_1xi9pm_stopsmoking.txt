Smoke free for 3 days. Just finished a very difficult assignment for college when my brain started saying this.

3 days now (badge is being reset so that 80+ count is wrong). Being a professional failure at quitting, I have learned to see the signs of addiction. Instead of giving into the cravings, I wrote them down to analyze when they go away. 

**Just one.**


**No one has to know.** (This one is comical, because I am not necessarily hiding my smoking problem from anyone)


**Real quick, just smoke one and throw the rest of the pack away.**


**I think we should smoke one to celebrate that assignment we turned in.**


**You've proved you can quit, you need to prove you can have one and not get hooked again.**


**There is a gas station across the street; Take a quick walk and have one, you deserve it.**



Smoking is not a reward; you are hurting yourself. don't fall for these lies. They will subside and you will have one more victory under your belt!

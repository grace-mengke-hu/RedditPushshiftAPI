172 Days, I miss my only friend.

So, in short, I'm in a really dark place. My only friend seems to be smoking. 

It's day 172 of cold turkey. I'm in a country where I don't speak the language, have no friends or money. Currently I'm trying to write my thesis, which feels like pushing a rock up a hill, in a village so small as a mouse house. I have nothing to do and nowhere to be. 

I do have a boyfriend, that has no clue how dark it is in my brain. I'm also pretty sure he is with me out of pity. I sometimes think I'm with him because there is nothing else in my life. 

I'm so lonely that starting smoking again is the only thing that seems to be an option. Like I'll gain back a bestest friend, which I miss deeply. 

Can somebody please tell me that starting smoking will actually make me feel worse, than help in any way?

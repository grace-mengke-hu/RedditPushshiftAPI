Going good after 12 days of patches but...

... I have been reading a lot about the longer term failures of NRT to stay off cigarettes. I'm not sure whether at this stage I should come off the patches and revert to cold turkey method. I fear I may succumb back to the temptation of tobacco if I do this and have to start again. Does anyone have any experiences or advice to share on this? Many thanks.

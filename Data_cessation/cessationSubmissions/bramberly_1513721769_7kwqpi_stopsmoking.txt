Hot Turkey

Before I quit, I would come to this sub for encouragement. I was dismayed to find so few posts about the gradual approach to quitting. It seems that most of you have quit cold turkey. That approach didn't work for me. I slowly decreased my nicotine intake until eventually there was none left. I quit hot turkey, and this is how I did it:



Vape Hardware: *3 Smok Stick V8 (Big Baby) *3 micro USB wires *1 gallon Vegetable Glycerin *2 60ml bottle nicotine at 25mg/ml *15 Big Baby atomizers (coils) *2 30ml squeezy Bottles *App: Ejuice calculator *Data records (Google Keep)

Total cost:250$/3 months

The Eightfold Path to My Liberation

Right Thought
Recognizing the karma of nicotine motivated me to change. Every bit of nicotine I ingested made the addiction that much stronger. I realized the consequence of smoking is more smoking unless I intervened. I did not wish to be stuck in an endless cycle of satiation and depravity. I wanted the middle path. So, I moved my middle. There were times when I would increase my nicotine concentration when it became too much to handle, and times when I tried going lower than my usual rate of decrease. The practice of diluting the nicotine was a constant reminder of my goals and eventual freedom.
I only started making real changes when I was honest with myself about how much nicotine I was using. Keeping honest records was key to knowing that I could actually change. I was honest with my data. Once I accepted they were only for me, I was freed of some of the shame of smoking.

Right Resolve 
*Be resolved to quit. It helps to make small changes to the nicotine concentration frequently so that your resolve does not decay with content for your current nicotine concentration.

Right Speech 
*Until I had given the vape stuff away, I refused to call myself a non-smoker. No one cares about the difference between smoking and vaping. If you vape, then you are still a “smoker” by social standards.

Right Action 
*At any moment during this process I was free to stay at my current nicotine level or reduce it.

Right Livelihood 
*The materials I described above outline the cheapest way to quit with the vape. A decent mod will cost about 50$ at least. The biggest cost of vaping is the ejuice. Mixing nicotine in a Vegetable Glycerin (VG) solution is the cheapest way to insure your juice does not run out. Also, juice below 3mg/ml is difficult to find. I held on until .01mg/ml of nicotine in my ejuice. After that I just used pure VG until I abandoned the vaping altogether.

Right Effort 
*Slow and steady wins the race. I took this approach because I believed that the cravings would be too much. I was scared I would start tantrumming without the nicotine. The gradual decrease in nicotine gave me lots of little victories that motivated me to keep trying. This method is easy, it just takes patience.

Right Mindfulness 
*Starting out I recorded my nicotine consumption over time. Once I got below 1mg/ml though, I became all too obsessed with my current nicotine level. The math got easier over time as I practiced diluting the nicotine with VG.

Right Concentration 
*I needed a replacement behavior. The gradual decrease in nicotine gave me time to try things that I could do instead of vaping. I ultimately ended up with a long intense inhale. I highly recommend finding a breathing technique that works for you.


I gave away my vape stuff to my brother about 8 months ago, and I can count on one hand the number of cravings I’ve had for nicotine. I have no memory of that last orgasmic cigarette. I can’t even remember the last time I vaped. All I remember is how excited I was to be done with it all. The liberation is what I remember. I am free. I am free.

My reason for quitting is no longer valid. Therefore, I’m starting smoking again.

After 23 years of smoking, I quit about four months ago. My reason for quitting was that I’d taken up the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. For those not familiar, it’s a combat sport similar to wrestling. Due to the intense cardiovascular demands of the sport, smoking isn’t a realistic option. I didn’t care. I finally found something I loved more than smoking. Unfortunately, I’ve been suffering from a mysterious injury/illness for the past week. It’s likely an infected cyst. Surgery is the only option. This condition, and the fact that I have no hope of affording health insurance and receiving medical treatment mean my athletic career is over anyway. Because I’m now unhealthy, sedentary, unable to access health care anyway, and have no desire to live a long life, there’s no reason I shouldn’t be smoking.

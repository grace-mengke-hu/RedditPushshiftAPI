day 5 - thank you!

i'm on day 5 without a cigarette. i've tried to quit multiple times in the past but this time i knew would be the one. i felt ready for a long time, i just finally had enough and decided to stop.          
      
i just want to say thank you to this sub - i lurk here multiple times a day and it is so uplifting and reassuring, even if i never post or comment. whenever a craving hits, i come here. when i wonder what to do with myself when i'm idle because i'm not smoking, i come here. i lurk here at random times throughout the day just to remind myself that i'm doing the right thing. reading how everyone overcomes their challenges really helps me.     
      
so, thank you. thank you for helping me kick a part of myself that i hated. my chains are broken and i feel so FREE!

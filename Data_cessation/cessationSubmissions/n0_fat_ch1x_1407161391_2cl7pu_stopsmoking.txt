One week down!

Man, does it feel good to go a whole week or what?! It is a great feeling of accomplishment. Especially since on friday, i got super wasted... and still refused to smoke! I know that is only one time of drinking and refusing cigarettes. But it felt so awesome to just say NO! Feeling stronger on my stance than ever. Thank you so much /r/stopsmoking! Keep strong everyone else!

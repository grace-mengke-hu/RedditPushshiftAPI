Quit a week ago, can't breathe through the coughing. Other mild effects of quitting. Advice?

Last cigarette was a week ago. I got the flu, had no choice. I don't really crave cigarettes anymore, which surprises me. Though I do have the craving to punch someone in the face. Violence. Otherwise mild nausea 24/7. And the coughing. I've been fine, then have a coughing fit that sends me to my knees, gasping for air. Been told it's my celia hairs or something cleaning my lungs? Anyone know how long I have to endure this cough?

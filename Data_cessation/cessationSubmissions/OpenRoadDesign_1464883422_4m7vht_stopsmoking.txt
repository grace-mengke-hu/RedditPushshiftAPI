Feeling pretty brainwashed!

I've tried quitting so many times over the last couple of months. I go 3 days off, 3 days on and then quit again. I think because I've gone back to smoking so many times I'm convinced that I'm going to fail this time too.

Any tips or advice for folks that have quit and failed over and over?

What do you do when you crave for a smoke?

Hi,
I am 25 days in. I used to smoke 5-8 per day for about 2 years or so, depending on my stress levels. I quit cold turkey. Whenever I get a strong craving, I just sleep it off or read positive threads on this subreddit. What do you do?

P.S.: I have got such strong cravings only twice or thrice till now.

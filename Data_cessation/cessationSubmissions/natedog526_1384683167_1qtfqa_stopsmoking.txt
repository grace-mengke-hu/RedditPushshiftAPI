One Week!

It has been officially one week since my last cigarette. I'm quite proud of myself at this point and strangely a little confused. Today was also my only day off from work this week. Since I do most of my smoking at work, and none at home, I kind of figured today was gonna be one of those days where it was just best to stay out of my way. The opposite was actually the truth. Maybe this is finally the time that I get a handle on this. No scratch that... This is the time I get a handle on this. No more maybes, no more I'll start again tomorrow, no more "Damnit I'm at it again", it is finally over. I can move on with my life and enjoy the money I don't spend on stuff I actually want to spend it on. From here on, I'll make posts when I feel there is a need for me to do so, or if I just want to. Daily is all well and good at the start, but now I don't think I really need to do it daily anymore. Again though I want to thank everyone who sent me messages of encouragement and kept me focused. You all have been a big help and I really appreciate it. To those that are as far along I am, lets keep going. [Nothing can stop us now. :D](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM)

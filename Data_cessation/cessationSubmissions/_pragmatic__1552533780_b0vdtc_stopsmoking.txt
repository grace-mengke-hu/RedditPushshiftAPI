Smoke for 5 years, but also 5 years addicted to nicotine gum

I quit a long time ago and I'm now at the point where the thought of a cigarette disgusts me. 


However, I never cut out the nicotine addiction itself.  I've been using nicotine gum for years!  Clearly, it is time to finish the job.


I'm thinking of switching to patches and just regular sugar free chewing gum.


The issue with nicotine gum is that there's really no ceiling on how many you consume, if you don't check yourself.  I think I am now more addicted to nicotine then ever as I'm regularly chewing 20+ pieces a day (or 80mg of nicotine daily).


I'm planning on initially wearing two patches simultaneously (one 20mg, one 10mg). Then reduce to the 20mg patch, then step down per packet instructions.

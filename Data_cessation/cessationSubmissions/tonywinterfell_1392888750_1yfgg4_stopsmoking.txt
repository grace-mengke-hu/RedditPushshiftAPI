It looks like it will stick this time... Sweet!

So I have lurked here for awhile, but I always hate to announce when I do anything. Pressure, annoyance, all of that. Anyways, my last cigarette was 12/23/2013, and it looks like this might be the last time I quit. I love the line "Quitting is easy, I've done it lots of times!". True story. It really is a mindset thing. What did it for me was E-cigarettes, but not how you might think. I kept e-cigs as a backup, for when I have a beer and want a smoke. Then I didn't need them, but liked keeping them close. As of now, I'm all out of e-cig liquid (going on 50 days now), and I don't care. On my commute to work, passing by two gas stations and right next to one, I never even have the thought to stop and pick up a pack.

Yep, I'm done with it. I can smell a smoker at the drop of a hat, and I feel mildly embarrassed that used to be me, but mostly I just want to move a few feet away. I don't feel like being preachy. They know. I knew, and chose to smoke. Then I chose to quit. I was mildly worried about turning into a preachy bitch, but all quitting taught me was how up their own asses most of your Anti-Smoking advocates are.

As for the cliche stuff? Fuck yeah! I've got tons of that! Smelling good things! Also, smelling unpleasant things, which sucks, but is useful. I have learned that I am a better cook than I thought I was. The complexity of the dishes I make is FAR deeper than I thought it was. I am a fucking excellent cook. I had no idea, I actually thought everyone had no taste if they thought my "middlin'" cooking was that good. I don't have the urge, and I don't care.

Edit for punctuation. ,,,,,,, <- That kind. What an asshole.

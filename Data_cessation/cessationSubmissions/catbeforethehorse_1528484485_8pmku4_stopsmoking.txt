cinnamon toothpicks!

Hey guys! 

So I'm at day three after reading Alan Carr's book. 

The book was good, but I didn't feel any different after finishing it. I planned to throw my stuff away on Tuesday night, so I did. But I could have just as easily kept on smoking without feeling too disappointed in myself.

I've been impressed that the cravings are so manageable, though. 

Alan Carr says not to swap a prop for a prop, but I've ignored this advice â€“ we'll see if that's to my detriment.

I've been chewing on cinnamon toothpicks, cloves (the spice, not the cigarette), and cinnamon sticks whenever I get a craving. This has pretty much totally cut the cravings. 

I've yet to spend an extended period of time with a smoker, but not too worried! The cinnamon toothpicks seem to have me covered... 

HOORAY!

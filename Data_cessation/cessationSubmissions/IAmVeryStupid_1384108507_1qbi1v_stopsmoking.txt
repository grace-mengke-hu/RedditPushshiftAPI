After about a month, I'm starting to feel like a nonsmoker.

I took a few drags on somebody's cig while drunk at a party this weekend, and I couldn't believe how gross it tasted.  It was refreshing to find a cigarette unappealing.  It means I've got hope to stay quit.

I was never a hardcore smoker, only up to 10-15 a day, so it's  probably easier for me than most.  My nicotine dependence wasn't quite so intense.  Still, the lingering effect of the psychological addiction is strange.  I had some bad shit happen to me the other day, and I wandered around outside for a while, just walking.  It would have been the perfect time for a smoke - feeling stressed, biter, and self-destructive, at night, on the street.  But I had no desire at all to *actually smoke a cigarette*.  Just the feeling like this was a situation in which a cigarette would be appropriate... if I still smoked.

Guess I'm gonna have to find a new way to mope.

Quit smoking since January 25th. But I have 7 last week including 3 yesterday.

Last night I woke up at night with my throat all dry and when I drank water I started coughing violently waking me up. Goes to show how quickly smoking harms you. Glad I had such a bad time last night, gave me more motivation to not smoke anymore.

Question about Potential Weight Gain

So I’m still in the very early stages of withdrawals (yesterday marked the end of my first week!!!) and it’s been very hard, but it doesn’t feel as impossible anymore.

I know weight gain is pretty much a given and it’s obviously something I’m worried about. I’m already morbidly obese and for the past month and a half, I’ve been working out six days a week and sticking to my diet (I’m 5’8” and currently sitting at 300, down from 320 pounds). 

What I’ve gleaned from my research is that the amount of weight you gain after quitting depends on how much you smoked daily (for me, it was a little over a pack a day) and the state of your metabolism (which, for me, is obviously pretty slow to begin with). And then, of course, it jacks up your appetite, which has just made me all kinds of miserable and feeling like I’m perpetually stuck in a rut.

I don’t want to go backwards, but I’m prepared for the inevitability that it is only going to get more difficult to lose at the same rate that I have been. I guess what I want to know is: during which time is the weight gain most severe, and what have you done to combat it?

Note: please don’t send me a link to r/loseit or r/keto.

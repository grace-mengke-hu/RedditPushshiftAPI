Two weeks without cigarettes, using the patch.

Made it two weeks now.  I chose to use the patch to mitigate me turning into a total asshole for a week. And, I've gotta say, it seems to be working pretty great so far.  I've been able to go out and drink, and do my normal things.  Which is nice because I'm a bit of a pool hall junkie. Yes there were cravings, but I'd say they were only a fraction of the strength -- nothing mawing the shit of some cinimon gum couldn't fix.

I was a pack a day smoker, so I started with the 21mg step for the first two weeks.  But in an effort to get free and clear a bit quicker, I've decided to only do two weeks on each step. (Not to be too cynical, but the patch companies are in the same business as the tabacco companies, and I want off this addictive shit asap.) So today, I removed the last 21mg patch, waited for some withdrawal symptoms and slapped on a 14mg patch.  Here we go!

PS. I ate an apple the other day and it blew my mind! Fruit, why haven't you been in my life for the last 6 years...

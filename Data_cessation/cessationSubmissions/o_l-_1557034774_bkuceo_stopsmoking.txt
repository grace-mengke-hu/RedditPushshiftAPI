I smoked from early teens, 1990 to 2000. I quit cold turkey 2000-2010. I have smoked on and off since then. I would like to quit for good.

To quit in the past, I have often used a declaration to a witness. I am asking you to be my witness, whoever you are. My witness is not responsible for my success, and I do not ask them for any other obligation but to hear me.

I am 42 years old. Cancer runs in my family even without smoking. I am aware of my mortality every day that I wake up. I have one life project that I would dearly like to see through, preferably for another 20 or 30 years. I have friends and young family whose lives I would miss out on, and I think that would be one of my keenest losses, were I to die prematurely.

I can do this. In the last nine years, I have often quit for several months at a time. I quit last October, till February of this year. I started again in February, made two more attempts lasting weeks and days, then kept puffing. I'm dragging my heels.

If I weren't in full-time school, I would do my ritual: barricade myself in my home for four to seven days until the cravings stop hammering me. It's an opportunity for self-care in general, and I do it up right. I make sure I have club soda, lots of snacking veggies and fruit, plus an immersive video game. (I'm a retrogamer, and my go-to game right now is Stalker, the first-person shooter set in Chernobyl.) If I still get restless, I also have Netflix, books, writing projects, music, napping, and surfing. The only stipulation is no going outside, simply because being outside is a cue to smoke.

I don't have the luxury of a week to do this right. Plus I am outside and among smokers in the daytime. I will use next weekend to put this plan into action, even if it can only last two days. It would also be a good time to dig in to my homework. Being among smokers soon will be a trial of a new kind.

Thank you for reading. I look forward to following this sub.

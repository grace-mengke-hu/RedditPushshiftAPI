Smokers car

So my husbands car was having problems, finally got it fixed so I reclaimed my car, he still smokes and I am on 74 days (wooooo), I spent most of the night last night cleaning my car out really good, I just cant believe how bad it stank in there and its been so hot here, blah! I febreezed the shit out of everything and vacuumed really good, still smells. Im hoping it goes away after a while but new rule, no smoking in my car (sorry hubs)!

Quiting cold turkey today!

Well,  actually yesterday at about 5pm was my last cigarette.  I smoked for a year and a half,  rather heavily but i want to quit. I've tried before,  but i tried with the nicotine gum then,  and it just doesn't work. So instead of doing that I'm just going straight cold turkey and tough it out for a few days while the noctine leaves my system. 

Wish me luck!

Edit: 5pm last night,  so i already have 16 hours down.

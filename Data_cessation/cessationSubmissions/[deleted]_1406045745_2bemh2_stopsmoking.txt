Feeling like I still need to smoke when I wake up or I cant function? What do you do to stop it?

I've been on chantix for about a month and ran out of samples...cravings are coming back although not as strong and frequent, but the worst is when I wake up. I feel like I just can't get the energy to be productive. What do you do for energy and to help feel like a normal functioning person?

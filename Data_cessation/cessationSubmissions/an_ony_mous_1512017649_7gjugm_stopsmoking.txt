Managed three days. So disheartened.

Insomnia got the better of me. I'm so disappointed in myself. I didn't even enjoy the cigarette. I cried all the way through it but I felt as if I'd been fighting the same craving for nearly 5 hours (woke at 1 am,  it's now nearly 5 and I literally just stubbed it out). I tried so many things to stop myself and I couldn't. I don't feel better for it.

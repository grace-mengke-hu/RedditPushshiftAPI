Quit a week ago, feeling weird. What's happening?

I've been smoking for 12 years, decided to quit. I've read the Allen Carr book 2 years ago, tried to quit, failed after 2 months.

Now I've quit a week ago, I'm taking this really seriously. I don't want to smoke anymore. I've been feeling weird since then, kinda empty or something like that. I don't feel bad, I don't really feel an urge or craving to smoke (just a bit), it's just that I don't feel content. No matter what I do, I feel that there's something missing. Can someone explain me what's going on? Is it a symptom of nicotine withdrawal, or is there a problem in my head that I feel this way?

As far as I know it takes ~3 weeks for nicotine to be completely gone from my body, so after 3 weeks cravings should be completely gone right? I mean if I'm not an addict physically, and still kinda want to light a cig, that makes me an idiot right?

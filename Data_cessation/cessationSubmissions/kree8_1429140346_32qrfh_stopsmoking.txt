attempting to quit.

hi. It is day 2 on the e-cig. I have not smoked a normal cigarette since. 

From yesterday I have noticed that my voice sounds hoarse, I think I may have strained it during teaching high school grade 9. I'm not asking for medical advice and will seek out professional help if does not resolve itself by next week but the wife thinks it may be the e-cig. I hope I'm not breaking any rules. so far my wheezing is improving, morning cough sputum seems to be clearing up. 

Next is a  disciplined realistic exercise routine but trust me at work my students keep me on my toes constantly.

I am looking forward to sharing my experiences in this sub.

P.s.
I'm gonna try using a data projector in my grade 9 classes later today maybe even show them a few appropriate TED talks.

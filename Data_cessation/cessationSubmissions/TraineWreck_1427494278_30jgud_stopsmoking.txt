My star has a 4 on it now :D

I can't say that it's been a cakewalk, and I can't say that I've been peachy keen and smiles and giggles the whole time.  

What I can say, though, is that I haven't smoked in 4 months.  Cravings come and go, but the claws that were sunk deep into my brain 15+ years ago don't have a hold on my brain anymore...

That is what makes my days awesome lately... happy Friday everyone!

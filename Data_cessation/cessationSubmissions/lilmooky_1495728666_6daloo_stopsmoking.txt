Don't undercut your $avings

I know that I used to buy a redbull or 2, some diet coke, a candy bar, and maybe a lighter or something else every time I bought cigarettes.  Now that I have no reason to go into corner stores, I'm not making impulse buys either.  All that gas running to the store adds up too! Treat yo self!

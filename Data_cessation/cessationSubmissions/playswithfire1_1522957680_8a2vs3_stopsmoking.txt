Question for “chronic quitters”

On your various attempts did you feel that notifying friends and family really made you more accountable? When the irrational urge hit, my promises to people never really got in the way of a smoke, sadly. I just hit two weeks and have told no one, I prefer this silence because I want to show my family real results, because I’ve told them “I’m going to quit” about a hundred times. Anyone else?

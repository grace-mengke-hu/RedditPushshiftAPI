Got food poisoning and ended up quitting, hopefully for good!

So last Tuesday night I got food poisoning and haven't had a cigarette since! I wasn't a heavy smoker anymore only one or two a day but a smoker none the less. Today was my first day back at work and I had some pretty serious cravings but I resisted. I feel good :)

My brother [17] wants to start smoking. I think I may have influenced him. I can't talk him out of it, what do I do?

Our father smokes and all of his friends do. So do I, but I don't do it in front of him. What can I say to him? He knows it's bad, but he says he'll "quit in a few years."

What do I say to him?

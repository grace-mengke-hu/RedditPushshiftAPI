45 days free

Feeling great and 45 days smoke free, I had been using the NRT patches but forgot to put one on last Saturday, then was busy with my grand kids  on Sunday so forgot again, went swimming before work on Monday and forgot to take one to put on after! Have now been without the patches for one week so completely nicotine free. And not suffered any cravings eitherðŸ˜€

Do not smoke ultra-light cigarettes if you're quitting

Why? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F4qzPbcFiA

I was smoking 20-a-day Pall Mall Blue and cut down to 5 unfiltered Amber Leaf rollups in the afternoon for the past 3-4 days. My goal was suffer until 5pm and increase the hour. I managed to increase uptil 7pm and smoke until I slept.

Things were going well, yesterday I had almost no physical withdrawals only cravings and so to make more progress, I bought a packet of Silk Cut Silver is 0.1mg Nicotine 0.1 mg Tar as part of my nicotine reduction method and ..... I fell into Big Tobacco's insidious Trap. 

They are full strength cigarettes (I currently have a nicotine buzz with them) and the reason they have low nic ratings is because of the holes. There is no way you can smoke it without covering those holes and it got me hooked again. My physical withdrawal came back and my cravings are much stronger.

These type of cigarettes with the holes in the filters should be Illegal. Off to buy Amber leaf, because even though I smoked them unfiltered and had higher nicotine, I found them easier to wean off cigarettes.

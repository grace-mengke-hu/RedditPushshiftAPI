New to this sub and have been a smoker for 3 years. I want to quit smoking but have been finding it difficult. What are some tips you can give me on easiest ways to deal with the crave?

I am also a bit of a drinker and smoke when I drink so I would have to stop drinking too if I was ever to stop smoking, at least until I move longer crave ad cigarette.

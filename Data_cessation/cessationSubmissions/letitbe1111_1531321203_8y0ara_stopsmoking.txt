I have a love/hate relationship with smoking!

If been trying for so long to quit smoking.  I love it...but I hate it.  It’s been 19 hours since my last smoke and it’s all I think about.  I don’t want one more cigarette ever....but I also want to smoke a pack.  How do I get through the first couple weeks?

Not Lunging as a Method of Quitting

Question for those of you with much more experience at this than me. Little background. 20 year old, Army National Guard. I picked up tobacco products after Basic Combat Training in August of 2017. Started with dip pouches then quickly escalated into regular dip. Then I began branching into cigarettes. I do not smoke very often, mostly when I am stressed out or at drill weekends, but now whenever I become stressed I immediately associate it with needing to smoke.

As a method to quit, because frankly I think the taste appeals to me the most, does anyone think smoking without inhaling is a good method to ween off? Or am I just talking out of my ass. Let me know! Thanks all!

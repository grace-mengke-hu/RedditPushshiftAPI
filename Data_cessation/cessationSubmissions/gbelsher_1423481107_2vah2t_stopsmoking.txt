Scared (long post I guess)

I've been coughing for the last week and spitting out phlegm that's like gunk.  My breath is real short. After suggestions from you nice people I'm reading Allen Carr's book. (Pg66 now) and I've come down to 3 from 6 per day. I'm 23 with no physical activity my whole life.  But I'm working out now. 
Is the gunk phlegm a good thing? Or am I going to fucking die? (Like are these cancer syndromes)

I keep changing my opinion about what these symptoms mean but I don't want to live in fear. I'm actually taking care of myself now so if I shouldn't bother then I want to know. I don't want to go to a doc yet. I want to give my body some time.

It's day 79 and I want a cigarette really bad.

I don't get it but I'm craving. I have been for a few days. I still have a vape pen or two around the house. It's been a long time since I used one-- day 27 of my quit I dropped the vape too-- I'm considering charging it and using some nic free juice to satisfy the urge. I don't know. Just want to smoke so bad.

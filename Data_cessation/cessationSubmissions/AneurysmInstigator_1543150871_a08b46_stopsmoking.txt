Advice to quit soon

I've been smoking for 4 years about  10-15cigs per day, not too heavy i'd say.

Nobody has been asking me to quit, i just want to start family with my fiance a few years down the road and i want to have quit before that time comes.

I don't want any of the vaping, e-cig, nicotine patch stuff, i just want to stop cold turkey.

The thing is that i've been dreading what side-effects that'll give me and i want to plan it in accordingly.

For example, i've heard that stopping cold turkey might make you very irritable for a while and i already have a short-fused temper.

I'm currently going through a rather stressful time so i don't want to risk not being able to do it successfully.

If i quit cold turkey being the moderate smoker i am, what possible side effects might i endure?

Also, tips to ease those effects are welcome.

How I made my mom stop smoking when I was a little kid

My mom started smoking when I was around 12, I hated every second of it. I hated the smell, the way that the cancer sticks were killing her and just how she behaved in situations were she couldn't smoke. Started with one cig at the beach and it evolved to 1 to 2 packs a day.

I stated a Guerrilla war against it. At first I tried to hurt her pockets by stealing the packs and destroying them, she grounded me, hit me and screamed at me but I didn't stop. This didn't stop her tho, she stated locking then in a "smoking room" she had at home.

So that's when It hit me. What's the only thing that only I can provide to my mom? Affection!

I gave her a ultimatum. Stop smoking and go look for help or I would never talk to her again. At first she laughed it off and so I shuted my mouth, stopped hugging or giving her my hand, started distancing myself from her. She lasted 3 months until she started crying for my attention "My son, oh my dear son please talk to me". My father also hated smoking and joined me in this mute fight (many years later I found out that he did a sex strike, what a strong man)

She became clean quickly after that. Been clean for 8 years now. I don't know if what I did was ethical, I was 12 at the time so I didn't knew if that was right or wrong.

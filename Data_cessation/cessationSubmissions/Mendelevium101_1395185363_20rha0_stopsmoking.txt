Alan Carr criticism (May not want to open this if the book is working for you) and general rant.

I couldn't seem to get past the 'brain washing' aspect of the book. Like the repetition was so blatant that my smoking brain just kind of shut off each time he reiterated something.

I've read the book twice now, and though it has made me feel positive, I can't seem to actually make the steps to quit. It still feels like I will always be a smoker. I've educated myself on why I smoke and the benefits of quitting, I realise that this belief I have of 'smoking is so hard to quit' is only reinforcing how hooked I am and I feel I truly do not want to smoke anymore. Yet every evening I know I won't smoke tomorrow, and every morning that just kind of goes out the window. Almost like I simply don't allow this resolution to enter my thought process until i've smoked a cigarette or two.

I guess i'm looking for advice from anyone who truly feels, or has felt, like they are their own worst enemy. How do I get past that feeling of 'the enormity of never being able to smoke again' when I consider not smoking the next cigarette. I don't seem to be able to 'trick' myself into believing that I just have to get through today, and can't help but consider that its not just this craving I'm facing, but every subsequent craving that will inevitably follow.

I know its worth it, but 'now' just always seems to take precedent. How do I take the next step when I keep sabotaging myself, smoking just seems such an integral part of 'me' and i don't want it to be anymore. Thanks for reading.

Literally so fuck this

Haven't had a cigarette for almost 3 days and I swear to god I will stab someone's eyes out if I don't get one soon. I know why I'm quitting and I know it's gonna be worth it but jesus I've almost convinced myself like three times that at least smoking is more healthy than bashing my head into the wall. I just needed to vent but AAAAGGGGGGGHHHHH WHY IS THIS SO SHIT

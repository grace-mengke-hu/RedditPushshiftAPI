Slight slip-up this weekend, but ultimately a good thing

So the past few weeks I've found myself kinda craving smokes. Missing them, I guess. I just haven't been in a good place overall.

On Friday, I went out with some friends and got pretty damn drunk. At some point I was fiending hard for a cigarette. When I was ready to head home, I decided to stop by the convenience store and bought a pack of smokes and a matchbook.

On my balcony, I unwrapped the pack and lit one cigarette. The first puff was rough; I haven't smoked in like 7 months. I got about three more puffs in and realized that these things suck! It tasted bad, it hurt my throat, it just wasn't good. I went inside, soaked the rest of the pack and tossed it in the garbage.

A bit sad that I broke the fully tobacco-free streak, but I ain't resetting my counter because in a way, this confirmed to me that in some ways I'm really clean and quit.

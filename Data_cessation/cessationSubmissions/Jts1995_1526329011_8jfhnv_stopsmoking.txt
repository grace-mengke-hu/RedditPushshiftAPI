It’s time to quit for good.

Hello, everyone. 
My addiction to nicotine/tobacco started about 6 years ago when I joined the Army. I started with chewing tobacco, but ended up switching to cigarettes, because in my mind, it was less repulsive. 
The longest I’ve gone without smoking is around 5 months. Over the past 2 months, I’ve been actively trying to quit, but can’t seem to make it more than one week without smoking. It is getting really annoying, and discouraging. 
My girlfriend does not smoke and  is very supportive of me, and tells me to not beat myself up when I have a cigarette. 
Enough rambling. I’m coming here to seek any advise, success stories, and encouragement. 
Anything is much appreciated!

So I'm a quarter of the way thru Allen Carr's book and...

I really want to just quit now...but he said to keep smoking until you finish the book.

Any reason why I should keep smoking if I'm convinced and ready to quit now? Any specific things he discusses I should have in mind before putting the pack down?

Disclaimer - I have PTSD issues and last time I tried to quit, my brain chemistry when absolutely haywire.

A small, unintentional victory.

So I've been lurking on /r/stopsmoking for a while now. I've been smoking for about 5 years now, with some occasional breaks, but have had no real success at stopping. The last time I smoked was Saturday night. Afterwards I made no conscious attempt to stop, I just didn't feel the urge for another cigarette. Then today, when I was walking home from work for lunch, I was suddenly hit by a series of very strong memories from when I was a kid. 

I was confused by this. I couldn't pinpoint why I was suddenly remembering all these things until I realised something very simple: I could smell again! It hadn't even occurred to me that I was missing out on this sense until I could suddenly appreciate the subtle fragrances when I was cooking, the burgeoning smell of spring on the air, and even the exhaust fumes from traffic on the street.

I'm only a few days off the smokes but I not only feel a lot better, both physically and mentally, but have I have absolutely no desire to start up again!

breathing

I'm finding this helpful.  Umpteen years ago, when you could still smoke everywhere, I'd heard a tip that I've been using now.

Instead of deep breathing when you have a craving...You inhale through the mouth then exhale w/ two puffs.  It simulates the way you inhale/exhale when you're smoking.

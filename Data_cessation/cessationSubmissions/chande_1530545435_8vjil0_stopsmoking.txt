Trying for the 8th time - Help!

Have to get this one off my chest...

Been a smoker since 18, now 36, waiting for my 1st kid. Tried several times but always got back to cigs... Stopped 4 years ago for 3 months then started again (stupid)...

Now, I've tried everything. Gums, patches, cold turkey, warm turkey... Last time was very hard but I did it - nicorette combo and running every other day.

But... I really love f**** nicotine. It's like my brain just adores the stuff... Cannot imagine beer or coffee without it.

Now I'm determined to go all the way through - any tips for hardcore smoker here?

Has anyone had any success with wellbutrin?

I started out taking 150mg at first and it helped a bit, but I didn't completely quit. And I never got the bad taste or upset stomach that's supposed to happen after you take it for a while. I upped the dosage to 300mg a few weeks ago and it's like nothing has changed at all. Had anyone had any success with this or anything similar?

Day 23

It has been 23 days without a cigarette and I have to say....I’m so damn proud of myself. What makes me prouder is that I used no products or e-cigs to accomplish this. And let me tell you, the first week I thought I was going insane. First came the withdraws - the physical signals where my body was telling me I was crazy - such as the tremors, the panic attacks, the headaches, the irritability, etc. Then came the psychological issues - where my mind was telling me I was crazy - the loneliness, my crippling anxiety, a nervous depression, a terrible sense of dread. 
But let me tell you. It’s been 23 days and I haven’t felt this good in a very long time. I feel woken up, like I was in a dream for the last few years. My appetite is amazing. My sense of smell is super outrageous. My energy? Ha, awesome. And also, I’m getting really weirdo comments about my skin looking good from my co-workers. My point to this quitting story, is that this is a journey. And like all journeys it has obstacles. It will not be easy. And some days it will come down to your will power alone. But you can do this. And you are worth this.

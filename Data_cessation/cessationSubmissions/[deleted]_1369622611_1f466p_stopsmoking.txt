What do you know about Chantix/Champix (Varenicline)?

It's called different things in different countries.

I've read the wikipedia page on it, and the advice from my GP was basically that Champix is **the only** way to successfully quit. And it sounds like the perfect drug!

This is an e-mail I sent to a friend earlier when we were talking about it (I've used square [] brackets to denote things I've added for specifically for reddit):


[RE: Champix]

*When I said to* [my] *doctor that I knew people who had used it and failed, and he explained that those people, the reason they still smoke is because they wanted to. As in they would have quit 'successfully' and then decided later after that that they wanted to smoke again... They probably never really wanted to quit to begin with. And he finished by saying that, in order for it to work you needed to really want to quit.*

*Well I figured, if I really wanted to quit, I would anyway. The only reason I haven't up until now is that I enjoy it, I haven't really wanted to quit, and haven't really had a reason to - as in, practically it didn't effect my life in a negative way. Where as now, it kind of does. I can tell that, after the gym, I feel sorer the more durries I punch* [Note: to 'punch a durry' is an Australianism for 'smoke a cigarrette'], *and I can't run for nearly as long - as in on saturday morning when we went to the gym, I felt like I could run for ages, and I hadn't had a cigy for about 18 hours at that point. Yesterday, on the other hand (and every other day we went other than saturday) after a few mins on the [treadmill], my chest was cramping up, I start breathing way more heavily than I should have to, and I just feel like I want to give up.. Plus the next day I feel way sorer due to the way CO effects how nutrients are passed through your blood stream. What I'm getting at is, now I have a reason that actually has real world practical implications, and the only reason I have to continue smoking is the sheer chemical craving.*

*Champix seems to be designed to stop people who want to smoke from smoking, by making it taste horrible and do nothing for you chemically. But it seems to me that the main thing you need to quit is motivation. Nicotine cravings work against your motivation, but as long as that can be managed, then it should be sweet as.*


What I'm getting at with this is, with the way the doctor explained to me that you need to *want* to quit in order for Champix to be successful, is it really necessary? Like if you really wanted to quit, you just would, right? My issue is that I haven't wanted to (up until now).

I also have concerns regarding the way it messes with dopamine reception. Does anyone have any knowledge regarding this?

Quitting has thus far been really easy...

I'm about three days in. I've been smoking for four years, and ive been smoking about 15 cigs a day for three years. There are always fluctuations, there were times that i tried cutting down, there were times that i smoked more, but 15 is about right for an average day. I tried quitting about a month or two ago, using this sub, reading all the horror stories, and when i tried, i felt physically ill, and i felt powerless. I caved at 25 hours and i busted outside and smoked, and continued on to smoke nearly a pack the next day, and smoked on every day as if nothing happened. 

I recently got a job requiring me to quit (working with kids) for this summer, and I just stopped when i found out. That was it. I left my pack at home when i went to class on monday, smoked one with a friend at lunch (he offered me a rollie), and havent smoked since. I'm at about 2 1/2 days now, and have yet to go through any sort of withdrawl. I had a moment when walking to the post office (always a smoking walk for me in the past) where i thought 'its beautiful out, i wish i could smoke' but then i just thought 'whatever, its still beautiful out, ill enjoy the walk'. and that was that. I've been absolutely fine, and havent even considered having a cig, even though my friends are smoking around me 3-4 times a day. 


This turned into a ramble, but I just want to say, I think a lot of the struggle is in your head, and could even be made worse by other people telling you how awful an experience quitting is. All it takes is to not smoke anymore, and though it may be on your mind, that is just because youre used to it being a part of your life, not because you are miserable without it. Don't be scared, it doesnt have to be hard

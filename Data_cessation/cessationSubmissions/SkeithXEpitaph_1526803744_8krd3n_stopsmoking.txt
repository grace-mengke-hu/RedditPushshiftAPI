After 4 years of smoking i finally had my first day without a cigarette

It’s been less than a week since I decided to quit(it’s the 3rd attempt to be honest) but I made a promise to my mom on Mother’s day that I would try my hardest to quit so this milestone is huge for me. It’s still so hard to fight the urges but the nicotine gum helps a bit. I find myself getting irritated/short tempered with people more often but I know that will pass.  I know there’s a long road ahead and that scares me but there’s a small part in me that knows I can push through. Here’s to my first day not smoking a cigarette in 4 years

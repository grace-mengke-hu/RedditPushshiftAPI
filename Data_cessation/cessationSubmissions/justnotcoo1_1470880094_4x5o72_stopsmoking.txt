It gets easier! I got past a week and feel fab y'all.

The first week just absolutely blew. I smoked for 26 years and quit cold turkey a little over a week ago. I obsessed about smoking about 4 days. Just thought about that shit non stop. I was a hot mess emotionally and cried sometimes like my dog just die for no good reason at all. I slept in bursts of 2-3 hour spurts. I never felt rested. I had weird ass dreams that made me feel claustrophobic in my own bed.  I got wicked heart burn and TMI Alert, could not really go to the bathroom. I hated my husband for no good reason at all. I knew it was irrational hatred so I quarantined myself from him till I returned to sanity. I became depressed and may or may not have had an existential crisis. Then this morning I woke up, I felt pretty darn good. I had slept and rested a full 8 hours. I I did not have dark depressing thoughts, just a list of shit that needed doing. I brushed my teeth and admired how white my teeth are looking. I did not feel like I was in haze. I feel pretty damn good y'all. It gets better. Hang in there if you have just begun. It is going to be fine. Today, definitely did not suck.

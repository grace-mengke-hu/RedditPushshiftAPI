day 5 has been a tough one.

I had to withdraw from my college due to my depression and I am living at home. I have been doing yoga, i am trying to eat as healthy as possible, and been chewing nic gum for the withdraws. Quitting the weed as well and that is making it worse but I know that I need to do this to make my life better.

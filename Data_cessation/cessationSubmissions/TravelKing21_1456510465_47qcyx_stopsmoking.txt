My younger brother smokes weed around the house and in the car and I'm sick of it

My younger brother smokes weed around the house and in the car and I'm sick of it. I've approached him numerous times about it and it hasn't stopped. All of his friends smoke weed and now it seems as though our mom doesn't care whether he smokes it or not. I don't like being around him as much anymore and I also don't trust him at all. (He also lies about what he does or where he's going). What should I do?

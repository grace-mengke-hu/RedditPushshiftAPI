3 months off nic. Not looking back.

I’ve been smoking cigs and vaping nicotine on and off for 3 years. Quitting cold turkey was hard as fuck. Pretty much quit my job because I was so riled up about the width draws. But I think there was more to it than that. Place sucked anyways. And I was sobering up. I was going in the place half the time baked/tipsy. Wasn’t looking good and just quit everything all together. Looking back at it I’m proud but I’m slipping. I keep having the cravings especially when times get down. And I feel like I turn to unhealthy habits to keep me going. Fast food, sex, ect. Everything but drugs and alcohol so yay I guess. It’s hard. But I’m proud of quitting. And even tho it’s hard I’m trying not to look back. Just going forward. 

I’m 21.

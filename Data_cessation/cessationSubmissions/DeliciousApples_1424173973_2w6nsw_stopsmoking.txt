Day 3 - depression starting to kick in

I wonder if it's totally not related or a pure coincidence. I'm quite poorly at the minute. Been in bed for the last few days which has made it a lot easier not smoking. I do keep getting it in my head about going for a cigarette but not only can i not be bothered I also don't want to. However I feel utterly horrifically depressed. I keep crying because I feel so ill and pathetic and I am wondering if it is partly due to going cold Turkey. 

Anyone got any insight?

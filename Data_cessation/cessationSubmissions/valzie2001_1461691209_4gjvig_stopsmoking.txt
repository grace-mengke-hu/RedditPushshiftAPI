If I can do it SO CAN YOU!

 I haven't been here in a while, but I wanted to stop in and throw some encouragement out to everyone that has decided to make a healthy life style change by quitting smoking. It is the best thing you can do for YOU!! Hard work in the beginning but it gets so much easier and YOU will feel so much better! I have been just over a year SMOKE FREE, I was a smoker for 35 years, and it is the one best thing I could of ever done for myself. I never thought I would be able to quit, but here I am, a year later, hitting the gym and loving my life, I can breath, I can go places and not worry about if I'm allowed to smoke, I don't smell like stale cigarette smell anymore, and most of all IT DOESN'T OWN ME ANYMORE!! You can do this, do it for you, one day one hour one minute at a time, every minute that goes by that you don't light up is a healthy breath of air for you!!!

50 days and I'm done with that shit!

To anyone in the earlier days I just want you to know it gets better. If you can get to where I am (7 small weeks) you've done it. It crosses my mind like once every other day now and those aren't cravings just thoughts. All my cravings have gone and I am free, you can be too. Don't give up, your life is too important!!

Beginning day 5. Starting to miss my reward...

In my previous post I briefly mentioned how dependent on cigarettes I was at work. I’ve actually overcame those cravings pretty quickly! In fact, I’m no longer biting my nails, counting the minutes until I can take my next break. I have encountered an unexpected craving...

I live a 10 minute walk from where I work. Both ways, as soon as I stepped outside I would light up. So now, my biggest cravings occur the minutes before I leave the house and before I leave work. These were my “reward” cigarettes. My, “Good job! You’re out of the house and on your way to work!” And my, “Phew! That was a long day, but you’re done!” cigarettes. I haven’t found an adequate replacement yet so (especially after work) I’m left feeling a little... disappointed?

Has anyone found anything that works for them?

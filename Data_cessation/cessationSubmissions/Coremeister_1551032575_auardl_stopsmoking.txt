6 months FLEW BY after a certain point

I was so scared initially because there are all the people that go "mannn I've stopped for 20 years and still crave"; plus I have an extremely addictive personality. But I wouldn't dare touch a cigarette now, all it took was a month or two of thoughts creeping in and me batting them down with facts and it's all over now, the illusion has dispersed and I've got a much longer and healthier life. I was in a very dark place and managed to do it. YOU CAN TOO, I PROMISE YOU!

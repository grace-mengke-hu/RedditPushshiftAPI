Tried to quit 100s of times

I’m 28 and been smoking since I was about 14. Tried to quit so many times. My last quit was last night from 9pm to the next day.


Read Allen Carr’s easy way, researched whyquit.  Even posted a few quit posts that were deleted the next day while mid smoke. 

I’m just an addict. My addict brain tells me to ingest poison. I know for a fact the withdrawals aren’t so bad physically because I felt  good last night. 

This is more of a log than anything. From now on it’s all positivity because I will be a non smoker ridding myself of a drug addiction.

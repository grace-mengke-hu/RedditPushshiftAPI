That's it!

That's it. I am done. I am so fucking done. I am fucking killing myself. I am giving myself black lung. I am going to give myself cancer. I am ruining my life. I can't breath properly. I can't exercise. My chest hurts. My throat hurts. My fucking everything fucking stinks. My teeth are as fucking yellow as cat piss. Na uh. No fucking more. I am done. I have an e-cig. I'm going to use that. No more of this, "I just need a proper cig to get me up when I'm tired or because I've had a beer." No way. No more. I am fucking done. You hear me. I am fucking quit of you. You make my life shit. Go fuck yourself, smoking. Just go fuck yourself.

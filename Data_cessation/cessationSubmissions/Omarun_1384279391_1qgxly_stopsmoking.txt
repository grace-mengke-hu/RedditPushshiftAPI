Day 1: again

I've been smoking a pack  a day for about a year. Only been smoking for a year and a half. Last night I smoked my last cigarette before bed. I didn't have time to pick up a pack this morning. So I'm not going to. Using  the opportunity to quit cold turkey. I've done this before and I usually only make it a couple of weeks but a new job and outlook on things makes me really want to better myself. Typing that out really makes it stick in my head. I'm done with cigarettes.

"Giving up smoking is easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it a thousand times" -Mark Twain

This is probably the 3rd or 4th time im trying to quit in this month alone, i always give in to my cravings, im thinking of replacing smoking with another habit, maybe chewing gum or doing crosswords. ive heard a lot about this community and how helpful y'all are to fellow quiters :)
looking forward!

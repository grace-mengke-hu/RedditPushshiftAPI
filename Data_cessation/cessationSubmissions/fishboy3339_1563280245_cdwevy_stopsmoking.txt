about 24hrs in, feeling good.

I had moved to nic lozenges about 3 years ago. I think i liked it because I could still keep my smoking. I'd smoke when I'm out of town and smoke at the casino. in the last month I'd started smoking at home after my GF left for work. It was too much and mixing the 2 was not good. I made a goal and quit yesterday. 

Just keeping strong, yesterday was tough. I woke up this morn and I'm feeling better still like someone is standing on my chest.

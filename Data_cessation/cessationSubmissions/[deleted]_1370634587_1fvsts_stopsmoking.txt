Nice alternative to carrots/gum/celery

Been smoke-free for almost 4 days now (yaaaay) and I still need stuff to occupy mouth and hands. Besides the obvious i bough myself some dried goji berries, they have a shitload of vitamin c and are delicious. A bit expensive tho. nearly 10â‚¬ for a kg... 
Though i let you know :)

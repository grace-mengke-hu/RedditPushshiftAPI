Suggestions for smoke-proofing the house

So I have been smoke-free for 1 month and 5 days. I had not chosen a quit date, but had a botched surgery choose for me (I have been in the hospital since October 26). I figure, now is a good time to not go back to the cigarettes. I have had my boyfriend remove all the cigarettes/ashtrays from our house, he has also deep cleaned the carpets and furniture. 

Is there anything else that can be done/stocked up on (like gum or something) at the house that will help me stay quit?

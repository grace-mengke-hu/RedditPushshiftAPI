Help a Bar Musician Quit: Day One.

Hello reddit. 

For what seems to be the millionth time attempt, I'm quitting smoking. I've held onto this habit for far too long and it's time to put a stop to it. I have been lurking around this subreddit for quite some time now and figured that I should officially join the ranks of the brave quitters. 

The biggest issue for me quitting smoking in the past is that I am a musician who performs in the bar scene about 2-3 times a week. It's a big hurry up and wait game. I'm down at the bar at least two hours before showtime for sound check. What better way to kill time than smoke? That's the attitude that most musicians around here take on. It is set in my ritual of playing. Before I play, I smoke. After I play, I smoke. 

Then there are the rehearsals. The worst are rehearsal spaces that allow smoking. I go on a smoking rampage when this setting is in front of me. 

In the end, I was smoking about twenty cigarettes a day. That thought grosses me out. Playing music without cigarettes will be tough but I can do it.

Anyways, wish me luck reddit. Your posts have inspired me to take the proper steps to living a good life. That is one without cigarettes. 

Day one! Whooooot!

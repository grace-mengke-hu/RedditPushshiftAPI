Cannot believe to say this - I am quitting cigs! First day today

I was trying to quit for like 4 years, 1 year with the help of internet,redddit,books (basically - knowledge). Longest streak was half a year without cigarette, and one month nicotine free. It is 9:45 a.m where i live, im awaken for almost 7 hours now and have not smoked today!

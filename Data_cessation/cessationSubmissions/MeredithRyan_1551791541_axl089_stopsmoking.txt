Looking for a new “relationship”

I’ve read several times smoking is like a relationship. I’m looking for a new relationship. Someone like me that we can talk on a steady basis to keep each other honest and motivated. 

I’m 39. I quit on Valentine’s Day (a day before my bday). I started smoking at 15 :(. I’m a mom and I work in the Army.  I’d like to have someone we can text back and forth and be a steady support.

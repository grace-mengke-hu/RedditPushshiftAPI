Occasional cigarette; your opinion?

So I'm currently a student at university and I bought my first pack of cigarettes in March of this year. My initial reason for buying them was to help relieve stress and anxiety when studying for exams, and I feel confident when saying they helped tremendously. However towards the middle of May I realized that I was beginning to smoke more often, and that I would begin craving a cigarette at points during the day; so I stopped smoking until this past week because I'm taking summer courses and have small minor anxiety attacks when studying for extended periods. (Note: I just smoked the last cigarette in that first pack today)

I come here because I feel as though this subreddit will be the most honest with me when I ask your opinion of do you view this as any kind of a problem? I know of all the health side effects related to smoking; and to be quite honest if it wasn't cigarettes it would be something else equally destructive to my health so I can live with the knowledge that I'm damaging my health. 

But my main concern is addiction. As I mentioned previously when I noticed myself starting to have cravings I quit immediately (and began drinking copious amounts of caffeine. One of the other health damaging options I had available) if I were to continue down this path of managing all substance intake so as not to become reliant for the next 3 years would you say I stand at a great risk of becoming addicted? 

Also to add (because I assume someone will bring it up) the anxiety attacks are nothing large enough that I could be medicated for. They only appear at select times thus not requiring any medication (I asked).

TL;DR If I am extraordinarily careful as to manage my smoking habit do I stand at a substantial risk to become addicted?

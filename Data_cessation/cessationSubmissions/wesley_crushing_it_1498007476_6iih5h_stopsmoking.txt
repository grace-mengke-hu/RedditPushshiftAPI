44 Days in, my blood pressure is back where it should be

A few months ago I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was around 140/90. That's a pretty bad number, especially since I'm someone who's always been on the low side of normal. Yesterday I went back to the doc and got 120/65. Score!

It's nice to actually see quantifiable evidence of my physical health improving. Tell me all about the improvements you've seen or hope to see in your vital stats! Have you found it useful to keep track of any other metrics?

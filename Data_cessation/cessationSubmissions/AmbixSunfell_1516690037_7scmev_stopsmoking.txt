Going Cold Turkey

As of this moment my goal is to quit smoking cold turkey. I have tried quitting multiple times in the past, but always get back to smoking because of stress. Reason I wanna quit is because I want to get back into Muai Thai training and don't want to be fatigued or breathing heavily during training. Longest I've gone for last time was one and a half months, but that's because I had a vape which I would constantly smoke from and the battery runs out too fast and it takes hours to recharge, and it doesn't satisfy my cravings. Root of the problem is the stress, I used smoking as a means to cope with it but I'm not sure how to deal with stress in the work environment without having to constantly go out for two or three cigarettes.

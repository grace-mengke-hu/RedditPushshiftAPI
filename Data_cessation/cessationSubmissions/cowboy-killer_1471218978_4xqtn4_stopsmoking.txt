2-weeks update, my jar of money.

I made it two weeks and am still feeling strong and committed. Feeling stronger, and more committed, in fact. 

This past week was harder than the first week. I don't really have strong cravings, more just a generalized crankiness. I figure as long as I don't feed it with nicotine, the crankiness will go away eventually. 

I use the smoke-free app and one of the missions is to put the cost of a pack in a jar every day. I thought it was stupid, because the app already tracks the money you save. But the mission said that doing it with cash (exact change!) every day would demonstrate commitment, so I am doing it. It's crazy how fast the jar is filling up and seeing the concrete $$ right there in my kitchen is sobering. I'm in the US and like many here, have strong feelings about the current presidential candidates. So, I decided that if I slip up and have even one puff, I have to give the contents of the jar to the candidate I hate most. It's extremely motivating in my moments of weakness :)

Looking at my app now, I see that I have now saved myself the pain, expense, and trouble of smoking 300 cigarettes. 300!!! Stay strong everybody! I'm very happy to be here, logging smoke-free days with the rest of you.

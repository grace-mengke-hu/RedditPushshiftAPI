I want to quit smoking tobacco but not weed. Is this possible?

I'm on page 67 of Alan Carr's book. I think I know where he's getting at. I haven't been enjoying any of my cigarettes since I've been reading his book.  If I quit when I finish the book, am I going to be wanting to smoke a cigarette because the joint reminds me of it? Any quitters who still smoke weed have any advice for me? I really enjoy smoking weed, I don't want to quit that.

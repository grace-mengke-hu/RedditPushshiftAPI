Today's the Day + Notes on Champix

Well, I started taking Champix (based on testimonies of friends and coworkers who had taken it). I planned to quit 8-9 days after starting, but I've gone over one day. 

So far, my side effects include nausea (after the a.m. 1mg dose only) and crazy vivid dreams every night. *Every* night. Sleep is interrupted and I often don't feel rested enough, but I'm getting some really good material out of it. 

I would totally stop taking the Champix because of the possible side effects (the most concerning being suicidal thoughts) and the nausea I'm already experiencing, but I've found that **my brain is starting to associate nausea with smoking**, which is awesome. I got a whiff of a half-smoke (I don't usually save them, but this was a Djarum Black, which are really expensive in Canada) and I almost threw up. Rejoice! For I am gagging at the smell/thought of cigarettes. 

Wish me luck! Also, I'll be reporting any additional side effects as I go. Let me know if you guys would be into that. 

**Update: Sept 6, 2014**: Almost done the starter pack. Champix is making me feel sick, even with Gravol. Might not be able to continue, but I'm confident that I'm done smoking anyway.

**Update: Sept 7, 2014** - Today was super easy. The boyfriend and I watched Farscape all day, didn't have a craving at all. I have, however, been eating a lot more, which is bad for me because I'm prone to easy/fast weight gain. Champix only made me mildly sick today and I think it's a food thing. I ate a huge sandwich before hand. 

**Update: Sept 17, 2014** - Lately it's been pretty easy not to want cigarettes. Old lady gets on the bus reeking like butts, and I can't stand it. However, sometimes I see someone 'cool' smoking and I want it. Strange how our perception of people can change our own habits. See old man hacking and smoking - don't want. See cool dude smoking - do want. I think it can also be attributed to a social link as well. I've met a lot of people on the smoking bench in the past. 

BUT, I'm a lot more productive and I actually have time to do other things instead of taking that 5-10 mins almost every hour to take a break. It's overall going well, and no signs of the dreaded depression side effect of Champix.

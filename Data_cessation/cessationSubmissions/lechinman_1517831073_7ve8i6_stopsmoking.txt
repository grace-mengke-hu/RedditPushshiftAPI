Last serious attempt.

Last month I lost my nan. Ultimately it was cigarettes that took her life. She was in hospital for over month which was the longest month of my life. All through it I knew I had to quit, but I still smoked. I smoked at her funeral. I smoked at the wake. I smoked the cigarettes she had left behind, the ones she had stock piled. I have quit before but this time is hard. I kept telling myself this is the last pack. A couple of weeks ago I saw a flyer that asked for people who wanted to stop smoking so they could research the effects of e cigarettes. Long story short it's helped I'm in the nrt group and have been taking champix. They have completely removed any sense of satisfaction from smoking and I couldn't be more grateful. So in six months time I'll meet the research team again, theyll do a load of tests and I'll see and have proof of how much healthier I am. Can't wait.

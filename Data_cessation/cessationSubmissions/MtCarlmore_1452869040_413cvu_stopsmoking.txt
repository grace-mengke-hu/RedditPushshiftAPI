Quit day tomorrow - I'm not sure I can really do this

Hi All,
A few weeks ago I set myself the goal to quit starting tomorrow morning. Why then? I have a drinking function tonight that was non-negiotable so I felt comfortable waiting. Plus, I smoke most during my Mon- Fri, 9-6 office hours, so a weekend start feels smart.

The problem? I've been feeling less and less confident that I can actually do this the closer tomorrow gets. I guess I'm looking for a little encouragement from those who've felt the same way. I'm 29, and I've smoked just short of a pack a day for about 14 years. I've never quit with any real effect for more than a week before, and never felt such conviction about doing so until these past few months. 

I've set myself the goal of being truly smoke free by the time I turn 30 this September, and I know I'd feel incredible if I could pull that off. My SO is a heavy smoker, so I know that's going to be an obstacle, but I feel like him seeing me pull it off will really help him feel like it's possible for him too.

So any tips? Any confidence tricks from you guys? I've written down the maths I did on what I'll save moneywise, and that's a huge drive for me. What did you guys do to celebrate meeting goals? Thanks!

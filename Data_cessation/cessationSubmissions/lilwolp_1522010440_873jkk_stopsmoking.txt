So my life insurance company wanted a blood test....?!

My life insurance lady got in touch with me about updating my policy since I am a non-tobacco user now. It will save me like $25 a year or something. Ok fine. 

Then she gets the paperwork out to schedule a blood test. Wait what?! Although I am tobacco-free, I said SCREW THAT and told her to keep me as a tobacco user on my insurance. 

Isnâ€™t that weird?

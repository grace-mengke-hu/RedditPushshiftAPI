I goofed

Hey. Never posted before but here I am. Wasn't smoking for a long time but then realized I was addicted and that I couldn't afford it much longer so I had to stop. I was doing pretty well (I think I'd gone two weeks with no real issues other than headaches?) amd then the day before yesterday I went out with a friend and ended up smoking five cigarettes in a row. I wouldn't do that even when I was smoking every day! I'm so mad at myself for liking it so much.

2nd day smoke free

It's not a big achievement for most but it's really looking like I can get through this without it being a huge headache. So far i've been following everyone's tips and tricks and it's going well. Even the smokers at work are encouraging so I'm extremely positive about this. Best tips os far is drink a lot of water and chewing gum.    
Thank everyone you guys rock !

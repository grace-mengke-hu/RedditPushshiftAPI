So, I've finally had enough. 8 years in, time to get out.

I'm a 22 M who was stupid to start smoking at age 14 to be one of the "cool kids" (yeah, I know, fucking stupid.) So, as I look at my last pack with 1 cigarettes left. I need to quit and I spend 60% of my time browsing reddit. So, after two weeks of lurking in r/stopsmoking, I've decided to make the plunge. I'm going to finish my last smoke and request a badge. 

If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, please feel free to say what you got to say, I'm not a dick and would appreciate it.

Wish me luck, guys and girls.

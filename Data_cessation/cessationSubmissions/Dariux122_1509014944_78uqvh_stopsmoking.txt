Sad to be True /just few cigs wont change anything

Hey everyone , i want to share my story with all of you who are willing to quit/new quiters/and those who quited long time ago. So my story begins at previous summer around july. At that moment i was a happy ex smoker whos abandoned this habit 1,5 years ago . I was so confident and proud of myself that I finished killing myself . But that summer me and some of my lads desided to go to a festival. We were drinking having fun , and my lads decided to stop the car for a cig , i felt pretty strange as i started to feel disadvantaged that all of my friends can have a cig and I dont. After all that time (1.5yrs) i didint smoke any of them. I thought maybe it will be ok , because we are going to a festival , having fun , so I allowed myself to have few cigs during that night. THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WHICH EVERY EX SMOKER DO!!!!! NEVER THINK THAT YOU ARE DISADVANTAGED THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO KILL YOURSELF. After this festival , i didint start buying and smoking cigs , but I allowed myself time from time to pick one or two from friends. THAT WAS THE START OF THE FALL. After a month i came back with smoking a pack per day. MORAL IS THAT EVEN 1 CIG CAN BRING YOU TO THE START LINE , ITS NOT WORTH IT. Now I'm 6 days away from having any cig , I hope i will be able to reach that milestone of mine which I had before. (Srr for mistakes :))

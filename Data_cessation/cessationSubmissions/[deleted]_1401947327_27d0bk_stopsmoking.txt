Quick question regarding mind-games you play with yourself.

When you decided to quit, did you tell everyone in your life that you were quitting? Or did you keep it to yourself? 
For some reason, my mind is telling me that if I quit I shouldn't tell people that I'm quitting; rather, just quietly make the change. 
Somehow I've equated telling people with a lack of will power, and in turn, setting myself up for failure. 

Any suggestions on this matter?

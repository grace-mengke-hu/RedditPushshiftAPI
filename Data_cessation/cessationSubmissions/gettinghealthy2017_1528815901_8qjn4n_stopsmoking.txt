6 1/2 days

i’m sorry for so many posts but this sub is really helping me stay accountable. i feel awful this morning but i know it’s from binging on pizza last night and that i would feel even worse if i had smoked. my sleep was also a mess - the insomnia started hitting me last night and then i couldn’t force myself out of bed this morning. i’m a grad student and my classes are online this semester so luckily i don’t have anywhere to go while i’m dealing with this but it’s also a bit of backfire as well. i’ve also been experiencing a lot of dry mouth, especially at night. anyone have any tips for that?

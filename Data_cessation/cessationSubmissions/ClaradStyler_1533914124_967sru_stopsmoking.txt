Tried to quit for over twenty times.

I guess I am not ready, now I can not make it through the first day. I also tried with gum and patches but I really wanted to smoke so badly. I am too weak, maybe it is because of my schizophrenia. I picked up smoking 14 months ago. More than three years before I was diagnosed.

I just see how it helps me structure my day and not having the delusions be so loudly to me. I once was off for two months because my father bought me Tabex in poland. But all I think now is that it is something helpfull and not something destructive. And I always think about quitting when I smoke, if I quit then I just think what I am missing and all about smoking. 

I feel like I am so done with it, yet I can not quit anymore. It is expensive to relapse. I have no point :(.

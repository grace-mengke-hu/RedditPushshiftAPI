Quitting after 22 years of smoking, finding out that the addiction is not what I thought

Hello all. :)

I'm writing this post for two reasons. First, I hope that someone can find some help or inspiration in my observations, and second, I need a supporting network for my own quitting process and ideas for my next step in the process. My apologies for any writing errors, I am Norwegian. :)

**The Decision process - how to quit when not fully motivated:**

For the first time in my life, I'm quitting smoking. I've been smoking approx 15 cigarettes a day for the last 22 years. I do not have strong reasons to quit, I just know that I need to quit at some point in order to have my own family, and quitting now is as good as quitting later. I also have a bunch of "would be nice to.."-reasons. Would be nice not to feel the need for cigarette-breaks all the time, would be nice to not need to go out in the snow just for a cigarette, would be nice to not be embarrased by my own smell and so on. The problem is, no matter how many "nice to"-reasons I have, none of them are strong enough to make me WANT to quit.

Because of the lack of strong reasons to quit I know that I would loose the battle immediately if I were to suffer from the anxiety of never being able to smoke again. Therefore, I found it critical to find a way to quit as painless as possible. So I developed my own plan where I will break the habits one by one, and I started with the biggest one; breaking up with my old friend Cigarette. I decided that I would smoke as much as I could during my three weeks of Holiday in Turkey this summer. I was going to enjoy every bit of it, and what better way to say thank you and goodbye to my old friend Cigarette who has supported me through everything in my life. And I did. I smoked 30 cigarettes a day for three weeks and enjoyed it while my subconscousness prepared for goodbye. I decided that when I went out of the airplane at home, I would change my smoking to e-cigarettes, as this is the ONLY substitute that actually fills my need to smoke. I decided that I should not even think about the next stage until I was 100% sure that the new habit had replaced the old one, because my tendency to do everything at once usually leads to total failure and I find myself being even worse than when I started. 

**The tools I used and their effect on my thinking:**

I read a fantastic book about habits during my vacation, which profoundly explains how they actually work (Charles Duhigg, The power of habit). That the habit kicks in by triggers. (Seeing a pack of sigarettes, feeling bad, last chew of dinner, a special time at day). And that the triggers demanded the reward they were connected to. I decided that I would remove the most obvious triggers to tobacco, and started clearing my house of lighters and ashtrays the minute I got home. I donated my extra cigarettes to other smokers. But for now still keeping all the other habits, using my ecig at the same moments and same places as I would smoke cigarettes before. I downloaded two quit-smoking-apps to my cellphone in order to keep my motivation. One of the apps sent me to this forum on reddit. After a day or two I found that even with the e-cig I got a lot of the same health-rewards as those who quit entirely. My mood got better, I don't reek of tobacco, my sense of smell is better, I do not get exhausted by running, and so on and so on. And still, I don't feel like I've lost anything, the e-cig gives me the feeling of still smoking, even though I don't. I found that these bonuses gives me a little extra motivation for taking the next step. 

I then read the book of Allen Carr, "the easyway to quit". And I found out that smoking is NOT a habit. A habit is NOT difficult to change. You can easily start driving on the other side of the road if you are in a country with the opposite driving direction. It is very strange to do so, but it is not difficult. You will not have cravings for still driving on the right side while you were on vacation in England. If smoking was a habit, it would be very strange to not smoke, but it would not be difficult to resist. Thereby the conclusion of smoking not being a habit, but an addiction. I think he is right. Another point I thought was good was this: a smoker can ignore the small nicotine cravings for many hours, it's not that bad, it feels like a small sense of hunger. BUT, in the second a smoker is told (s)he CANNOT smoke, the cravings are huuuuge. The second a smoker says to herself/himself that "I can never smoke again", the cravings are so big that they are almost impossible to overcome. In my case this is very true! This is driven by fear. The fear of lacking something, the fear of not being allowed to do the best thing in the world; smoke. The fear itself drive people nuts. Luckily, my e-cig makes sure that this fear does not win.

**This phace has given me some conclusions about my smoking addiction;**

1) Nicotine is not the main reason why I've smoked, because if it was, my body would be perfectly happy with nicotine patches and so on.

2) Tobacco itself is not the main reason, because if it was, I would have cravings even though i used e-cig. I still think it smells lovely when others smoke, but I do not have craving for the taste myself.

3) Habits surrounding smoking tobacco is not the main reason, because if it was, I would have huge urges to smoke cigarettes when I smelled it or spent time with other smokers - and I have not experienced that at all. And believe me, I've tested this on purpose in order to figure out my addiction.

**The remaining question:**

4) The strongest addiction turns out to be the feeling of pulling the tobacco smoke or vape/steam from e-cig down the throat. I have no idea why the need for this is so strong. But I do know that when I crack this mystery or find other ways to satisfy the subconscious need trigging this, the remaining of the quit smoking process will be easypeasy. 

I would highly appreciate every comment and every idea regarding this post as I need both support and ideas to crack the one remaining mystery. And thank you for taking the time to read all my babling!

A question about vaping

Since i startrd vaping I am not smoking ciggarettes. I probably vape like 5 to 10 minutes maximum a day. Maybe more if im at a cafe where other ppl are smoking. Anyway 2 people in the past days have told me that they stopped vaping and started smoking because they claimed that it is more harmful than smoking. One of them also said that it can damage your lungs more than ciggarettes due to water vapor piling up in your lungs. Can anyone send me some resources to prove these claims or are they actually fake. Im very curious.

Tl.dr: is vaping worse than cigs??

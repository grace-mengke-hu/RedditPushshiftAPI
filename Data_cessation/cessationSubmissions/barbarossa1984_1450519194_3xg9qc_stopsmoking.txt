Stopped smoking ~4 months ago after about 15 years and I've had low grade cold symptoms almost constantly ever since. Anyone else had this?

Blocked nose and sore throat but clear mucus. When I've stopped previously I've felt great after about a week, breathing improves, taste buds come back etc. About the only thing that has improved this time is my cough has gone. I don't want to start smoking again, but I wonder sometimes why I bothered going through all the withdrawal for this.

EDIT:Thanks for all the reassurances everyone. There's no danger of me starting smoking again this time; despite feeling like shit I'm just so glad to be free of the addiction. Good to know I probably don't have a tumerous sinus.

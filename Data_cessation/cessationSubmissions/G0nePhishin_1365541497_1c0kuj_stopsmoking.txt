Day 10; first run complete failure

Hey everyone, just found this sub and very happy to be here with you(wish I had known about you guys on day 2 that was the hardest!).  So I am on day 10 now cold turkey, I have been smoking a half pack a day on and off for 4 years(all thru college) and finally realized I didnt even enjoy it anymore, and I was a slave to the packs.  

Well I decided to go for a run today being so nice out, and it was a complete failure.  I barely ran a mile, my chest was closing up and my throat was on fire.  It took me half an hr to catch my breath.  Should I be concerned or is this somewhat normal?  I am kinda concerned because it was a complete failure of a run.  Thanks so much for reading and helpin out if you can!

How long for our brains to recover?

I am wondering how long did it take you to be able to concentrate without issue and work without feeling like dying inside? Did you notice if your working memory improved? 

Im an aspiring software developer and I am struggling to do any work because I can't seem to concentrate for longer than 20 minutes and i feel like i have shit working memory.

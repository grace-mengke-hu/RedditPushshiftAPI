3 Weeks

I'm 25. I've been smoking about 20 a day since I was 17, which I think about now with a heavy heart because the last few weeks have been amazing. I am the fittest I've ever been and the ratio of happiness v. sadness in my life favours happiness and I don't remember the last time that was ever the case.
I know there's probably other factors at play when it comes to feeling happy, but I'm certain that the perpetual cycle of smoking is what has kept me down for so many years: 
..Feel bad (or good - let's celebrate!), smoke cigarette, feel worse, smoke another cigarette, pair it with wine, talk about life's issues/achievements with friends over more cigarettes, hate yourself as you wheeze for air in bed, struggle to wake up in the morning as your body sends 'help me' signals to combat the poisoning (which you decide to subdue later the next day with another cigarette)

I've been depressed for years. I'm a reasonably attractive & intelligent young guy but my self-image has been horrible. I secretly judge those stupid enough to smoke cigarettes, so every time I lit my own I berated myself for being a stupid, worthless, unachieving piece of crap - which was silly for a man with a great career, who has travelled the world and realised some of his biggest dreams. The self-hatred from smoking was dark and I felt it constantly, each time I had a cigarette, saw the packet on the table, smelt it on my hands, breathed heavily, every morning from the moment I woke up feeling my body's call for help, 200 times a day before falling asleep.

Anyway, I just hit the three week mark and I feel incredible. I exercise daily, I laugh daily, in the mornings I feel like I've actually had a night's sleep, and I feel extremely proud of myself. I wish I'd done this years ago, but I'm so glad I'm doing it now.

You can do it. Please do. Do it today. There's nothing but good that will come of it, this stranger assures you.

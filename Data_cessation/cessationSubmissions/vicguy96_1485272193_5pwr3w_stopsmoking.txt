Maybe you want this now, I even want it a little while writing this. But you started this for a reason, well actually many reasons. You know you don't want it and that's the addiction playing tricks on you. Notice these desires are only fulfilling in the moment, while quitting is fulfilling all of the time. Wait it out and try and distract yourself and soon the rational you will be back in control. Even if it feels like it's never going to get better- it will. We don't know how long it's going to be until then, but the more you smoke, and the more you fixate on it, the longer it's going to take. The only thing smoking is going to do is make it harder for you to quit, and I promise you you will feel worse and want to quit more if you do smoke. You WANT to quit, you want to take that road to better health and a more fulfilling life.

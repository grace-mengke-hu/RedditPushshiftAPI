Today is the day

I’ve been a smoker (6-8 per day) for over 8 years, and am finally ready to be free from this nasty habit. I am constantly clearing my throat at work, my chest is sore, my car and clothing smell awful, and I’m sick of living like this. 

I’ve tried to quit in the past, but the moment I have an argument with my wife, or get stressed at work, I go right back to the cigs. Today I wrote down a huge list of reasons to stop smoking, and I am going to read it every time I get stressed out or have cravings. 

I can’t get rid of the stress in life, but I can decide how I react to it. Today I am done relying on cigarettes to make me feel better. I am making a promise to love and care for myself from now on. 

That’s all I’ve got for now. Thanks so much to everyone on this sub for all the great advice. You guys are saving lives.

90 days!

It just gets easier every day. To those who are just now quitting, you can do it. I believe in you.

I think that the most valuable thing I've learned is to not even think about smoking. If you imagine how it will taste and feel, you'll crave it. If you catch yourself thinking about smoking, IMMEDIATELY turn your mind to something else. Every day that you don't smoke is a victory.

Keep busy. Eat a snack. Drink water. Go for a walk. Meditate. You can do it. I have come far and still have a long way to go, but I'm going to make it. One day at a time.

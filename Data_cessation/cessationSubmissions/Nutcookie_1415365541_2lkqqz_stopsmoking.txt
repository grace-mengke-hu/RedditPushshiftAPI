Long time no smoke...

Realised it was a while since I looked at my counter... 642 days! 

Have no urges anymore, not even when I go out and drink and my friends start smoking. Just wanted to give you hope that things will get better. I have so much more money every month, my energy is way up and food tastes amazing... I cant believe that I smoked for 7 years...

and for the obligatory tips on how i did it... After wanting to stop for a long time and trying different methods I just realised that it was pathetic that I didnt have enough willpower to say no to something that harmfull to myself. Was my willpower really that low? So I just stopped one day, it helped alot that I did this just when I moved to a new town so I had no already intrained smoking patterns, if that makes any sense...

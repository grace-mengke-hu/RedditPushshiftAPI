Gonna try again

I've thrown out all my tobacco, lighters, papers, filters, everything. I'm keeping my ecig tho. I subscribed to a monthly supply of 75mL of 3mg nicotine ejuice for this month. The next month, I will subscribe to 0mg nicotine and see how I go from there. If I can handle going with 0 nic, I will eventually sell my e-cigarette by the 3rd month.

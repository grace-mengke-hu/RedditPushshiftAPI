Young smoker wanting to quit.

Hi r/stopsmoking I am a young smoker (22) hoping to make some positive life changes now that I've graduated from University. One of those change is to give up smoking. However, what's worrying my is how I'll cope when socializing, bored or anxious. What tips do you have for these scenarios?

I really need to rant right now.

I’m so fucking annoyed of how much I feel like shit. I feel like my head is in a funk, my brain is bounce off my fucking skull like a ping pong ball. I’m sweating like fucking crazy. I’m trying to pack of my apartment because I’m moving next week and I feel like I’m going to pass out. I’m so irritable. I don’t want a fucking cigarette but I want to stop feeling like complete asshole. 

Excuse my language, NSWF.

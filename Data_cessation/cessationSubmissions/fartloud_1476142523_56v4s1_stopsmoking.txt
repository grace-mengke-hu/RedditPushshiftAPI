How do you get back the body's ability to regenerate skin's flexibility?

might be one of the weirdest titles i have written in my life. i, as a smoker have experienced my skin being pretty damn derpy. i might be getting older as well, but im suspecting that smoking has affected that a whole damn lot. whether its facial or other skin on my body its just... idk... not very flexible.

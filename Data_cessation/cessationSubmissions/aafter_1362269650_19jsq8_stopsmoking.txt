Finished reading Allen Carr's book while smoking my last cigarette.

Smoked that last cigarette while taking in the fact that it tastes like shit and that I can't breathe (I'm an asthmatic, that was pretty easy). I'm pretty stoked and this feels like it's going to be easy. I'm sure I will experience some ups and downs, but fuck it, I'm a non-smoker. And that's pretty much totally fucking awesome.

214 days smoke free. Tried to quit many times before, even with chantix, gum and patches. The Easy Way To Quit Smoking

This sub introduced me to Allen Carr's book, The Easy Way To Quit Smoking. At first I was skeptical but I really wanted to quit so i bought the Audiobooks version of the book. Listen to it the first time without commitment. I just wanted to know if the book was really that powerful. It was. Second time I listened I stopped smoking halfway through the book. 

This book was first published in the 80s and 30 years later still works. It's been updated since then. I hate the fact that i haven't been introduced to this book years ago. 

I recommended it to my brother and he quit 30 days after i did.

What are good motivators for a spouse to stay smoke-free after quitting?

Don't get me wrong, we both "smoke". I won't say we quit just yet, it's only been 3 weeks. Plenty of room for failure. We've already saved probably $175 on smokes! This initial horrible phase has passed. It's just the deep longing that remains. We use e-cigs when we really can't handle it any longer. Last week was rough. This week is much better.

However, my husband has already made it perfectly clear that he "will start smoking again when summer really starts and we start hanging out at bars and BBQs and stuff". 

I have smoked for 9 years. He's only smoked for 5, but quite heavily in comparison to myself. (I smoked maybe a pack every few days, he smoked a pack/pack and a half a day). 

We are still a few years away from having kids (I just started going back to college), but I told him and I am absolutely positive I will never ever *ever* smoke again the day I decide to start trying for babies. He isn't sold on the idea. I do not want him to smoke when we have kids. Not just not around them. No more smoking. Ever. Sometimes he agrees but sometimes he really seems sure he will still do it while drinking or whatever.

What can I suggest or hint at in the nicest, most supportive way possible to keep him from falling off? Even if I can't win this summer, I'd like to win in the long term. Please, no mean comments about trying to change my husband when I knew he was this way or whatever.

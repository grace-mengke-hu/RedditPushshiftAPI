Thank you guys

This is around 4 weeks after my last post . Still hadn't have a puff.I stay with 2 chain smokers and drink quite regularly. I was afraid that I will relapse when I am drunk. Now I enjoy drinking without the need to smoke. Even it is easier not to think about smoking while drinking, when friends are smoking around me. Took your advice u/Armison. Thanks, you beautiful people. Without you guys, I would not have come this far. Whenever I have a craving, I come to this sub. But the problem is I still enjoy passive smoking. How long before when I hate the smell and don't even subconsciously pay attention to someone smoking?

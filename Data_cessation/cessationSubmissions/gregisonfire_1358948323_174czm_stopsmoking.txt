Day one and counting

Last night at 9 pm I decided to give up for good. Got rid of what i had left, the lighters and ash trays. Today is day one, I'm feeling hopeful and I'm ready to do this. The cravings this morning were pretty bad until I showered but things are looking up. Any tips besides "read the book"? Thank you all for the support you've given me through your stories and experiences that I've read.

Is this normal withdrawal or like the flu?

I haven't smoked a cig in 2 days and I'm going to stop now no matter what. Right now I'm using step 2 box 14mg/day and I think I have the flu. All the symptoms lead me to believe it was just withdrawals or my lungs trying to clean themselves out but earlier I had 102.1 fever and now it's down to like 100.9. I don't think withdrawal is supposed to give u a fever tho so I think I might have strep throat. Also I have really bad headaches, I get cold sometimes randomly, throat hurts really bad, nose stuffed up, can't swallow without pain, cough that hurts my throat and haven't eaten all day (opposite of withdrawals which make u eat more I think). Should I go see the doctor in the morning or ride it out?

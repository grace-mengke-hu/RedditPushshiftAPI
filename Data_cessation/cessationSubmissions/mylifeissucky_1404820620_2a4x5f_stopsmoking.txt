A trick I use to keep from smoking...

I get those sudden urges. I then think to breathe through pursed lips like it was on a cigarette, but there isn't a cigarette, and the breath is deeper than if there had been a cigarette. I find this helps a lot. Most of this happens because of triggery situations.

Common triggers are getting up for the bathroom and getting up to refill water and coffee cups.

Today is my 20th birthday and I'm also 30+ days no smoking!

I wanted to thank you for the unbelievable support that you have given me and I have tried to give back to you. I have never seen a community come together and give such amazing feedback like /r/stopsmoking has done.

In the last 30 days I have seen all sorts of different people post in this subreddit! 16 year olds, 20 year olds, 50+ year olds and you always give them the same advice. Your advice isn't biased to how long they've smoked and you don't judge them for their opinion on smoking.

Your only goal is to push them in the right direction and for that I want to say thank you.

This sub has helped me realize that a big factor (for me at least) was supporting others in the quit as well and reading others progress.

Again thank you /r/stopsmoking!

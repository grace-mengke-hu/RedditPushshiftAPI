First real day, Using a vaporizer

So this is my first day of completely abandoning cigarettes.  I've tried so many different ways including the easy way and I've never made it past the 2 day mark.

Over the last week, I've had 5 cigarettes and, surprisingly, I __can't__ smoke anymore.  They taste awful.  


I've caught myself halfway through a cigarette and realized what I was doing only because it tasted so bad.  I couldn't finish it.  It's actually happened a few times now.

So for those of you who have just given up, I urge you to atleast attempt it.

I do not want to quit smoking.

I like smoking. I really do. It's my way of escaping my current situation (whatever it may be) for a few minutes. It's my way of taking a break, because as someone with ADHD I constantly need brain breaks even if I'm doing something fun. I can't smoke during work so I do it on my lunch break as a way to recharge myself for the last 4-5 hours of work. It gives me a reason to go on my back patio during the weekend when I'm off work. 

I don't smoke as much as I used to. It used to be a pack a day now it's half a pack... well that's what I was saying before I switched locations for work. Now that I have a 45 min drive to work, I will smoke 2-3 cigs on the way there and one before I go in, 1 or 2 on lunch break, and 2-3 on the way back. So I've managed to (subconsciously or not, idk) find a way to go back to almost a pack a day. 

I feel like smoking is the one thing I can control. I have no control over anything else in my life. My family has had control over me longer than most people's family due to having a late start in life (I'm 26F and just moved out on my own 3 months ago). And I want to be the one who decides when I quit smoking. It's stupid, but it is what it is.

And yet I'm posting here because I want someone to convince me to at the very least WANT to quit. I have the small nagging fear in me that I could die from COPD or emphysema. I'm a medical assistant, and when I was in school I had to actually write a short essay on carcinogens. I chose cigarettes, thinking that would motivate me, however it only made me fearful but no less addicted. I have to spray myself practicly soaking with fabric freshener and perfume before I go into work, where I drown my hands in sanitizer so that the alcohol erases the smell.

Please, someone help me hate this thing.

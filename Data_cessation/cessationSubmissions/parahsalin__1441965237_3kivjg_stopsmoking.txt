Quit without even realizing it!

I have been a smoker since I was 19. I'm now 22. I hated smoking, really. But like so many of us, I just couldn't stop. I would always say "This is my last pack" but in reality, I knew it wasn't.

I recently set off on a 4 month adventure to SE Asia. I stayed with my parents a few days prior to the flight, therefore couldn't smoke (they hate it). Add in 2 days of flights and layovers, in which I never found the time to go buy a pack and smoke. When I arrived in Thailand, I didn't even have a craving. I didn't even realize I wasn't smoking. I've been here for about a month now, and I've only smoked once, and honestly, it wasn't even relieving or satisfying. It kind of made me sick.

Anyway, here's my success story. I accidentally quit, and I'm so happy I am not a smoker anymore. To those who are having trouble quitting, I can't really offer much advice because my circumstances are odd to say the least, but perhaps put yourself in a situation where a) you can't smoke and b) you'll be too distracted to even consider lighting up (maybe take a camping trip, and don't bring any smokes?)

Thanks for reading! Cheers!

Just checking in with an update

It's been four days since my last smoke. I've been focusing on the positives My sense of smell has become heightened my taste buds are exploding. I have been moody and irritable though and I'm developing quite the sweet tooth worried about piling on some weight. I chew gum a lot and play with a pen at work. 

Right now I feel like I'm on this edgy WIRED energy vibe where I constantly feel twitchy and like I have too much energy. Can't sit still kind of energy which is frustrating as I have a desk-job mostly! But yes. Thanks stopsmoking. I've been reading people's posts daily and it really helps motivate me to push that extra day. 

edit* This is my 5th attempt at quitting. I've tried patches before 4 times!, I've tried champix but I became really suicidal and dark on it. This time I am Cold Turkey. My nicotine now is my daughters smile and knowing I'm doing this so I get more time with her :)

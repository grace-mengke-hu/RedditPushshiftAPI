HELP!! I really want to smoke

I quit 6 weeks ago and am having a harder time lately. I crave stronger and more often. Is this normal? Maybe I was feeling too cocky. It was finally the right time for me to quit and it has been relatively easy compared to past attempts. The last week has been tough though. I did have 2  cigarettes on different days at work. Almost used that as my excuse to quit quitting. I’m stronger now so it’s just an oops and I’ll carry on.  Thanks for listening to me. It helps

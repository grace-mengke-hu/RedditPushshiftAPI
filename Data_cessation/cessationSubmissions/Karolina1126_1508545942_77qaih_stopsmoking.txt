Emotionally Drained-Day 5

So I'm new to this Reddit thing and I'm sure I'm not the only one the smoke free app has guided here but it's day 5 for me and I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster! It's so frustrating, I always told myself I wasn't that dependent on cigarettes and "I can quit anytime" ,but when I actually smoked my last cigarette on Sunday, within an hour I already had anxiety. I never smoked at work so going through the work day is no problem for me, but the mornings and afternoons when I'm out of work are the toughest. I literally cried driving home from work today because I can't get over the fact that my entire "routine" around smoking has been shattered and as stupid as it sounds I just feel lost, and I dont know what to do.  Anyone else feel this way when they started the quitting process?  Tell me I'm not alone!!

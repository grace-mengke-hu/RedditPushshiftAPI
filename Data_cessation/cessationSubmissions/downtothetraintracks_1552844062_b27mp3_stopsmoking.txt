New job, recently single, might as well give it another shot

This is a time of great change. I'm a little scared, actually, especially about starting my new job tomorrow, but I think this is a great opportunity to try and quit smoking. I don't think I need to tell you guys about the benefits of quitting, but for me the most important argument is to improve my stamina. I started jogging again and it's absolutely disgraceful how quickly I need to stop to catch my breathe. And I'm not even obese, just totally and utterly out of shape. So, please wish me luck I guess?

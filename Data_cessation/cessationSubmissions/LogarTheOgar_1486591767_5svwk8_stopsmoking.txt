How do you take the edge off in the moment?

How do you do it? I've made a hundred posts here and reset the badge an equal number of times; I can't quite get it right.

There's times where I'm ok, and then there's times where:
"Jesus fucking Christ I need something, I need something, I need to put something in my body so that I feel different."

Nothing satisfies, nothing makes me feel better. My skin starts crawling and I just neeeed.... SOMETHING. Eventually it's a cigarette.

When I'm out, and I feel even the littlest bit anxious or nervous, immediately I'm reaching for cigarettes. I honestly don't know what else to do, I've never done anything else. I take a quick break from where I am, get in some cigarette, and then come back.

Sure, when I get home, I'm going to take a shower and eat something and feel better. I'll be relaxed. But all day at work, when I'm constantly doing stuff, there's very little time to relax.

How do you calm down in the moment when you're so used to putting something in your body to make yourself calm down?

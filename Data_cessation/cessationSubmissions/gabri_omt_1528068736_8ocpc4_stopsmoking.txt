Time to focus on it

Well, I think it's hard because a habit is a habit. I have quitted on september then I have started again after a month due to my bad attitude.
 I was feeling Like a new person, because it is a better life without smoking. And now, every night I go to bed repeating myself tomorrow Will be a new non-smoker life. 

I want to ensure it to me. This time it is. I'm having the last puff. If you feel stressed as I'll be, please Write down here everything pass on Your mind. Good luck 🏁

The smoking dream

I don't know if this was psychosomatic but I recently read something in here about smoking in a dream and last night I had my first one (that I remember).

It was such a vivid dream. I was willingly smoking a rollie without guilt. Enjoying the smell and the nicotine hit. It didn't disgust me and I remember thinking I could just quit again.

Then I woke up and had the momentary confusion about whether it was real or not. I realised it was a dream and carried on not wanting a ciggie.

I want to stop being dependent on cigarettes

Being an on off smoker for years now.

I'd been smoking cigarettes since college.  I'd quit and be cold turkey for a few months or even up to 2 years, but then something would trigger it again, like during the time I was going through a break up with my then long term girl friend, or when I got fired at my last job, or when I found out about my cheating girlfriend (always has something to do with relationships, go figure).. I've kick the alcohol habit a long time ago, but just can't seem to quit smoking.

I've finally decided to truly kick the bucket this year, and took a different approach.

I decided to encourage others to live a healthier lifestyle.  Instead of me needing help, I thought I'd be the one helping others, and being accountable to others.  I started an online community, [IMFitness Club](https://web.facebook.com/imfitness.page)

I'm not sure if this is the right way to go, but I believe in the spirit of giving, in that the giver actually receives more, without directly desiring the result.

So I'd like to ask for your tips on what I can start sharing with the community, or maybe links you might have that I can regularly share with the community I'm building.

Any information, advice, or recommendation is welcome.

This is me hoping to finally and truly kick the habit good bye.

Thanks to all in advance.

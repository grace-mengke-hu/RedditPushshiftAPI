Finally signed up for a badge, realized I'm over 100 days, this feels better than smoking ever did!

I just want to thank his subreddit for existing, I've quit for good this time, and even though I had tried to quit and stumbled before, I would always see your posts popping up, and it would remind me of what I knew I needed to do.

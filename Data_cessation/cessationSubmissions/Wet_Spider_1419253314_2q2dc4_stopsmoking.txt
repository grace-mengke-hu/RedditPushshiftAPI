Fishing This Weekend

I'll be three weeks in this weekend and it'll be my first time fishing since I quit. It will also be my first time being around other smokers since I quit.

I used to chain-smoke on fishing trips. Although I've had a handle on my cravings so far, I'm somewhat worried and would appreciate any tips you have or your experiences with facing such triggers early on.

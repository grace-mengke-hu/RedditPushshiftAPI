First month of being an ex-smoker

Well, this forum has been really helpful to me, so it's my turn to post my quitting story.

I've been a smoker for 12 years (I'm 30 now). I had associated smoking with probably everything in my life: morning coffee, alcohol drinking, working, sex, chatting with friends, before catching a flight, driving, listening to music, reading a book, being happy, being sad, even relaxing after gym. 

I would smoke 15 cigarettes a day, some days 20, and I could not imagine myself without a pack of cigarettes on me. 

The case is, one night I returned home and I simply decided that I could no longer be a smoker. It wasn't dramatic, there wasn't any extensive thinking about it. As I am practicing meditation and I believe in a greater spiritual force, I remember asking from anyone hearing me that moment, to help me go through that decision easily. And so it happened.

I knew I would start eating more, so from day one I started cycling for an hour or two. And after regaining some of my stamina, I started jogging for an hour each morning. I would literary put on my running shoes the moment I opened my eyes. So, although I doubled my meals, I lost a couple of pounds, became fitter and starting building some muscles that were long forgotten.

I still miss smoking after lunch or when working late at night. But I also still wake up with that horrible taste of nicotine in my mouth, as my lungs keep trying to clean themselves. And that taste is something I have to leave behind. So smoking is no longer an option for me.

So, today, after a month and a day of being an ex-smoker, I made myself a gift, an emerald green bracelet (the color of love in the language of meditation), to remind me that I have started loving me, protecting me and taking care of me.

And if I can give you one sole advice, that would be: just quit. It won't be difficult. It will be as easy and pleasant as loving yourself. 

Good luck to you all!

Day 1 starts tomorrow and I'm stressing

So yeah. My quit day is in five hours and I'm nervous. I've managed to convince myself it's a battle against my own mind which I feel is the most familiar battleground because after ten years of fighting schizophrenia, I feel I know how to fight that battle. I feel it's ironic I fought that battle and won, but have been unable to quit smoking. I have the app, my quit day, stocked up on juicy juice until my body starts making it's own sugar (that shits fantastic) and I understand what I'm going to be going through. I've tried patches, and ecigs and vapes and it still left me addicted and lead me to smoking again. I've tried cold turkey a few times, and I feel the best way this time will be cold turkey again. I was sitting on the fence waiting to see what would happen before I decided if this run was going to result in a quit or a fail until last night my girlfriend handed me an ultimatum. She's diabetic and a nonsmoker, but said for every day I smoked from then on she would smoke as well. Having the new understanding of nicotine from reading this sub, that scares the ever loving hell out of me. It's one thing to be doing this to myself, but something new all together to have my bad choices directly effect someone I truly love. I guess in a way they do effect them, but it never seemed so direct. But I feel the tough love is the best encouragement she felt she could give me and I don't doubt for a second shell do it. I really don't have a purpose for this, just hoping to be a part of this sub while I fight this battle and a bit of thought vomit. Here's to hoping right?

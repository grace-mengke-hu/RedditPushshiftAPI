Feeling like I can’t do it/no faith in myself [rant]

I’ve smoked for 10 years. I’ve tried to quit so many times. Logically I know I need to, but truthfully I don’t want to. Trying to quit and failing so many times has eaten away at my self-esteem, and now I’ve lost all faith in myself. I HATE that I’m a smoker. I’m so ashamed of it. It makes me hate myself. I feel stuck. If I didn’t succeed every other time why would another attempt be any different?

I’m so lost. I need help.

Everyone who has quit for good, I admire you so much for having the strength that I can’t find in myself. 

Rant over.

Another heart attack ? NO THANKS !!

Gave up smoking very suddenly (and very effectively) at precisely 6.30pm on 7 March 2016 having Smoked 20 a day for 30 years up to that point.
I'm 47, female, and do not recommend my quitting method which was Acute Myocardial Infarction which occurred at....yep, you guessed it, 6.30pm on 7 March 2016 !!
Surprisingly easy to quit after that.
Now... You lot out there can quit too, but without the pain, inconvenience  and hassle of my particular method, so do yourselves a favour, huh ? Go on, you know you can ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

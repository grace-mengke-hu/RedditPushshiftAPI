Goin on day 6!

I am over the physical withdrawal but I still want nicotine mentally.

The other day I got to day 2 and then i found 3 cigarettes. So I said fuck it I want to go out with a bang. I smoked all 3 at once and got a super buzz. In doing so I also realized how high my tolerance is and it only gave me more motivation to stop forever.

I asked God to help me to quit smoking and then I quit.

One quote I like is this: Id rather be a non smoker who thinks about smoking every once in a while than a smoker who thinks about quitting every day.

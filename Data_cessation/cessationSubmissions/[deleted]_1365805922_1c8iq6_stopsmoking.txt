How about friends? I feel so lonely now because I'm avoiding my best friends and lovers because I don't want to smoke.

Its getting kind of lonely.  How do you handle it, what do you do?  I haven't told my best girlfriend yet that I quit....We have been friends since we were little, more than 30 years.  Does anyone have tips for handling this?  I'm not willingly to ever give up this friendship btw, she is the most special person in my life.

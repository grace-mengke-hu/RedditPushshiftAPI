Nice Shiny New Star for Me =)

5 months.  I was going to write it's hard to believe I made it this far, but then I thought it's actually getting easier to believe it.

I'm 59 and after 45 years of smoking I quit cold turkey.  Never tried to quit before. 

I quit because I could tell smoking was catching up with me, even though I exercise and am not overweight. Coughing, clearing my throat all the time, being out of breath, being a slave, wheezing on awakening.  Every day, all day.  Sickness was starting to become my normal. 

Well now... it just gets better and better.  I'm so fortunate that my body has been able to repair itself as well as it seems to be doing.  My breathing is righteously free and open!  I have more energy and stamina.  For the first time in my adult life! Finally I have given my body a break. 

I still think about having a puff now and again.  But I just remind myself.  It's over.  Done.

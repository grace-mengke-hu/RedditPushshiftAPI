Next week it should have been a year, but I decided to reset the counter today

Durint the last couple of months I started smoking when I went out with my new colleagues to get drunk and have fun. At first I thought I could control it and smoke only when I drink, and I actually made it work for some time. 

But lately I started smoking even when I wasn't drunk and well, I fucked up. Today I quit again, I had enough cigarettes and I already feel bad for screwing up, having in mind that I almost made it an entire year.

Well, fuck it, shit happens, I will be more careful this time.

Started smoking after 5 years of non-smoking

So here's my story, reddit gives me a weird sense of help, when i tell random strangers my story...so here goes...

I smoked from age 14-26. I quit cold turkey after a friends wedding, and never looked back. The first day was certainly a struggle, but I had amazing will power (aka wanting to quit for so long) and after everyday I wasn't smoking, I didn't want to break that stream, so I kept on with it. 5 years later, I had forgotten how much smoking took over my life and how proud I was of myself.

Fast forward to today, I started smoking again. Let me provide some context...I recently moved, a big change for me, and a happy change. I moved to a city that I wanted to for so long. I recently got a girlfriend, and life couldn't have been any better. Starting a new life in a great city.....so I shared a cigarette from a friend while we were out...shared another one...and on to today. Today is about 3 weeks....keep in mind, when I had quit, I really QUIT. I didn't take any drags or shared a cig, I had quit and I could be around smoking no problem.

I imagine my case is rare, but I started smoking because I was SO happy, not sad.

I know what it takes to quit, but airing my story out will give me some motivation. I absolutely love smoking, but I've been able to see all the effects it has had on me. I'm constantly tired day in day out, and definitely notice shortness of breath.

I've read some of the posts on here and congratulate everyone who has quit or is trying. I support you & I appreciate the help. Let's quit!!

TL;DR - Started smoking after 5 years, due to happiness, and need to quit VERY soon before the problem gets out of hand.

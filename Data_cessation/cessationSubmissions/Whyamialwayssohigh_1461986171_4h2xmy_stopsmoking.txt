DAE feel like they keep relapsing over and over?

I quit for 3 months a couple years ago. I let stress get the best of me and started again. Slowly I became a pack a day smoker again. Quit four months ago and here I am again. Finals plus hanging out with smokers got the best of me. I know um stronger than this. I know I'm better than this. But I just can't stay. It seems 3 or 4 months is when I break even with a vape/e-cigarette. Does anyone else feel like it's the only coping mechanism they have for extreme stress?

I was 14 when I started smoking so I think maybe that's why it feels like my only way of truly handling stress. Maybe I should see a therapist, but I'm already covered in medical debt. Has anyone else felt (or feels) this way? I just want someone to tell me I'm not alone and maybe offer advice?

Remove the brainwash!

Hi y'all.
To give you a bit of context, i'm 27 and smoking 20 a day for the last 10 years, roughly.
I never had the ilusion of enjoying it and always knew i want to stop but im one of those people that is not verh strong minded when it comes to things like this.

What i want to tell you is, you can not only stop but enjoy the process and not have withdrawal pangs. 

How? 
I was gifted this book called 'Easy Way to Stop Smoking' by Allen Carr.

I not the 'self-help' type at all but this ws the only thing thay actually made me go from 20 to 0 immediately and without withdrawal pangs.

I know it seems too good to be true and I dont want to make this post too long, so my advice is GO GET THE BOOK and you will understand.

Every single person i know that read it managed to stop, myself included. Go for it and enjoy the rest of your lives smoke free

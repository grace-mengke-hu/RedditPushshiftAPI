Just an advice

I am 19 years old, have been smoking since I was 14, I have been almost-free for the past 9 months, I smoke when I drink but I  think I have the stallion under my control, I should drop that too, I know.

Anyways, I succeeded on my first time and the key was to replace it with some other activity. When I really felt the craving I would just fill up a huge fucking bottle with water and drink it slowly, just sipping it and by the time I was done I'd forgotten about the craving. (I would also study/play LoL at the same time).

I'm glad if this 'method' will help anyone out there, I wish you all luck

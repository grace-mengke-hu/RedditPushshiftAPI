Popping in for a look.

I am to the point where I am going long stretches without looking at my badge. 707 days without a smoke.....I can sit around people smoking and it does not even faze me until I smell my clothes then gag from the stench. Keep pushing yourself to stay away from smoking, start exercising (this helped a lot), stay motherfucking positive, never listen to others who are negative about you quitting, and as always [never give up, never surrender!](http://hardcorezen.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/nevergiveup.png)

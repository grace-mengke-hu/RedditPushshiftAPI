I found my answer to quit smoking. Today is six months without cigarettes or nicotine replacement. Woo!

Woke up today to six months cigarette-free. Wow. Wow. Wow. Two full months longer than I've ever had.

In January, I was tired of my half-ass attempts to quit, and decided that I would really quit on February 9th, my 24th birthday. On February 1st, I got sick and couldn't stop coughing. So I said "What's a week?" and tossed them away. 

The sickness kept me smoke free for a week, as did the excitement of celebrating my birthday without a cigarette. But a few weeks later, I came pretty close to justifying that "just one". So I wrote [this post on my addiction/recovery blog] (http://buildingsomethingfromnothing.blogspot.com/2013/02/smoking.html) in order to create some accountability for myself and just vent in general.

When I've struggled since then, I've just read it back to myself to reaffirm what I already know: there's no more reason to smoke. Writing has definitely helped me get off of drugs and alcohol, and I'm glad to see it helped with smoking, too. If you haven't tried it and you're continuing to struggle, I'd definitely recommend it.

On to the next six months! Thanks /r/stopsmoking!

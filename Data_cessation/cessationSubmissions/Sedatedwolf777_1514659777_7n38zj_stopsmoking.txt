I have now not smoked for 24 hours and the effects have convinced me to quit once 2018 starts!

Hey there everybody, first post on this sub!
I have been smoking for about 2 years now, but this year it really started beating my body up, i constantly had headaches, felt more and more anxious, couldn’t go to sleep if i didn’t have my “goodnight fag”
And well my wallet was becoming quite empty too, which stressed me out even more!

So now i have decided to completely quit! Cold turkey, no excuses.
I do not know what i have to face, how bad the withdrawal will be, but i know i will thank myself after the worst weeks of quitting.
Because i have spent hours in bed trying to sleep trough my headaches etc wishing i never touched those expensive worthless cancer-sticks.

So any advice would be welcome! And i hope anyone who decides this too for 2018 or is quitting right now can pull trough because you deserve your health! You’re awesome! And you’re gonna show yourself that!
Hope you all have a great day/afternoon/night!

Edit: not gonna stop once 2018 starts. Quitting right now at this moment. No more!

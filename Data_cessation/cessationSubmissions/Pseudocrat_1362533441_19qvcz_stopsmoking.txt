Why did you quit?

I am a current smoker. I actually enjoy the act which I imagine is not that uncommon of a statement. I understand that it is unhealthy and that it costs a fortune, but it serves as a kind of meditation process for myself. Also, I have met many interesting folks through smoker's circles. (i.e. Adam Sessler at a Gearbox event)

Which brings me to my question: Why did you quit? I want to hear the practical reasons that led each of you to quit smoking. 

I will clarify that health and monetary concerns are indeed practical. I would like to stop eventually as well and your reasons just fuel my motivation. My mother was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and I have no intention of going through that hell.

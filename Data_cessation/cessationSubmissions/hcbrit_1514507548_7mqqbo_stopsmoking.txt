Take 2

I quit 1026 days ago but back in May this year due to life situations that I won’t be taking about, I began smoking again. 



I hate myself for starting again but as I was sitting having my last cigarette before bed I realised I had become a version of myself that I wasn’t happy with. In that moment of realisation I decided to redownload Smoke Free and as it began loading it suggested the quit time as now. I discarded my cigarette halfway through and took the plunge. 



It then dawned on me that this subreddit was a wealth of support and the sense of achievement I felt when I was ‘rewarded’ with the series of badges. 



I am once again a nonsmoker and it feels like I can breathe again. (In a poetic sense of course) 



Tomorrow will be tough. I will be leaving my cigarettes at home and working a long shift. Hopefully being occupied will distract me from cravings. 



I know I can do this as I was smoke free for over two years. My difficulties remain however as both my partners are smokers. 


I’m trying to think about what I did successfully during my last quit but as it was over 1000 days ago I can’t really remember. If you could share small tips I would be grateful and hopefully they’ll jog some memories.

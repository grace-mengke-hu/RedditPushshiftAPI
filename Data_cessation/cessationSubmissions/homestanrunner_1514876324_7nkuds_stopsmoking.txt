Day 1 comes to a close and I’m feeling optimistic. A word of advice for anyone else traveling down this road...

Don’t glorify that last cigarette. All cigarettes are doing are harming you, so don’t put them on the pedestal. After smoking for about 7 years, and numerous times of trying to quit, the one thing I did differently this time was not make a big deal out of my last one. I smoked it by myself before going to bed and when I woke up it was a new year, a new day, a new me. I’m both excited excited for my new healthier life and terrified of the cravings that are going to come, but I’m more ready now than I’ve ever been! Let’s kick smoking’s ass!

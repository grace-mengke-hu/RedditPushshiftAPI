Has anyone here had success with the patch?

Hello all. Starting day 2 on the patch and I'm at 27 hours without a cigarette. I've had multiple failed attempts at quitting over the past few years but this is the most confident I've felt about it yet. The patch is absolutely helping to take the edge off however I'm fully aware that I'm just postponing the inevitable withdrawals. 

Has anyone had any experience going through the full 3 step patch process? How hard was it weening off the patch? So far this is the best quit smoking aid I've tried but I'm concerned that at day 2 it seems a little too easy.

Any feedback pro or con would be appreciated. Thanks!

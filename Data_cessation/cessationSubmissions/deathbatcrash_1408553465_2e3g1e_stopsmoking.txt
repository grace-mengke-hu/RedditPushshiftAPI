When does the feeling of wanting to snap go away?

Was on the patch for 7 days. Kind of cheated the first few days. Today is day #3 completely smoke free. Took the patch off last night and refuse to wear it because I'm getting rashes and itchy all over. Agitated as fuck though! When does the feeling of going crazy go away?! I'm on edge but trying to keep it in because I don't want to be the stereotypical bitch now that I'm quitting.  Smoked over a pack a day for 12 years. Pretty much quit cold turkey. I think I'm just typing now because it is keeping my hands busy... /rant

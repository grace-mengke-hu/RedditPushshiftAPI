4 months today. Wow! If I can - so can you. :)

In the few first days, I couldn’t imagine getting this far. I was a pack a day smoker for 35 years. Now that I am, I’m surprised at how fast time has passed and how much I’ve changed. 

The road has had its ups and downs. I had days where I didn’t think of smoking at all. And other days - like two weeks in and receiving a life altering diagnosis - that I white knuckled through my urge to chain smoke. 

And then there’s today ... nursing a broken heart, wanting to just curl up in bed and cry ... but I have no urge to smoke. 

When it’s you decide it’s your time to quit smoking, nothing life throws at you will stand in the way.  

Be strong. Stay strong.  Good luck.

Tonight at Midnight I'm done

I picked up again 2 or so weeks ago after accumulating 2 months and 4 days smoke free. I've been using a juul to help slow down my cravings for cigarettes but I feel a large pain in my diaphragm after every cigarette. I need to stop. Tonight will be the same as all the previous nights. I say its my last one and keep smoking the next day. But this has to end. Here's to quitting for the last time I hope! Love you all.

19 days in. Here's what's been working for me so far and the reasons why...

1. NRTs - simply because of the nicotine addiction 
2. Exercise - because of the physical distraction and the rush of endorphins 
3. Deep breathing - because of the calming effect and the reminder that I CAN BREATHE üòÅ
4. Mantras like "Not another puff no matter what" and "I choose to take care of myself and look after my body" and "I will not let myself down" - because it is a reminder of my goal and to stay focused.
5. Eating sunflower seeds - because of the hand to mouth motion... And simply because I love them!! (Personal favorite: Spitz Chili Lime)
6. Using worry beads, reading or playing a game - because of the distraction 
7. Using the Smoke Free app and visiting/posting to this subreddit - because it keeps me focused and motivated. Also, giving me a place to vent and receive positive feedback/advice/support from others fighting the same battle. Plus, reading the success stories from others give me hope and inspiration that I can beat this!

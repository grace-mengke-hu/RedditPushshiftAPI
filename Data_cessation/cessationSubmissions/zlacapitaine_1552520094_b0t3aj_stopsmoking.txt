Quitting again, somehow have myself convinced in this moment that I need cigarettes

I'm having insane cravings...and thoughts like "it'd be so easy to walk to the gas station and buy a pack and just smoke one"..."its ultra-light anyway"... "you can just make tomorrow your quit day"(lol)..."i just have to have something like that".

I'm imagining how great it would feel to go out and smoke a cigarette, in detail. This is so stupid!

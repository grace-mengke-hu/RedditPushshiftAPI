Don't knock it 'til you try it

I quit smoking three days ago.

I smoked daily for 10 years, pack a day, minimum. For last six months there wasn't a day when I didn't think to myself: I should quit this, I don't even enjoy it anymore. But yet I smoked and put off quitting for a long time because I thought it would be too difficult.

 
Last Friday, out of the blue,  I decided to quit, cold turkey. I was nervous as hell. I felt mentally unprepared, but I didn't want to put it off anymore. I expected this to be the most difficult thing I've done in my entire life. I loaded up on snacks, threw away my lighters, set up on my couch with blankets and Netflix, called in to work and said I might not come in for a couple of days next week and waited for the shivers to set in, the addiction to start fighting me.
 
And I waited.
 
And I waited.
 
Then I got bored of waiting, called up a friend and went for a beer.
 
The next morning I went for a hike in the woods.
 
The third morning I went to work.
 
 It's been 72 hours since my last cigarette, and I'm amazed how easy it has been so far. The physical withdrawal symptoms are negligible, the cravings are easily dismissed. I have not been seriously tempted even once.
 
I'm sure the battle is far from over, and I don't want to appear cocky. I know there are cravings and temptations ahead. But at the same time had I known how not-difficult this has been so far, I would've quit months, maybe even years ago. I had psyched myself into thinking that I wasn't up to it, that I was too addicted, too weak to do it.
 
 And I know many of you must think the same about yourselves.
 
If you're putting off quitting because you think it is too difficult, or that you possibly couldn't do it, give it a try anyway. That little voice that's telling you that you cannot do it is your addiction speaking. 
 
 Don't listen to it.

Its been 41 hours and 43 minutes

I feel like my brain is on fire every few minutes. It's taking so much willpower for me not to ask my co-workers to bum a cigarette. I feel like the cravings come every 10 minutes. I'm sweating, and angry, and want to cry all at the same time. I know this will get easier, but I don't know if I can make it to that point.

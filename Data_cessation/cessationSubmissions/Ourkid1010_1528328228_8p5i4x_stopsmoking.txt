Just turned 30 - giving this a real go

Wow. 30 years old and still smoking. Well not any more!

Time to really give this bastard hell for leather and grow the hell up.

Life is pretty good right now - i had a good job, a good woman, a business on the side. I just need to kick this habit, and get fit, and turning 30 is as good a time to do it as any.

Stay strong brothers and sisters!

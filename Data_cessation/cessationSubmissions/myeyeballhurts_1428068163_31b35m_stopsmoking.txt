5 days since my last smoke. I think Im gonna make it!

I last had a smoke Monday morning and I also quit my longer than smoking addiction to Diet Mt Dew (smoked for 7 years, diet Mt Dew 11 years). I really feel pretty good. I have strangely enough lost 4 lbs since Monday (but I think that is the diet Dew fault). My stomach ache went away, strangely too, even though it is the highest allergy time of the year, my allergies arent bothering me at all (even after mowing the lawn yesterday, I wasnt sneezing or anything). 

I think for me, I dont really even crave a smoke, its more the habbit of smoking. Both hubs and I are quitting at the same time, but hes been using nicorette (I hate that stuff and it gives me a worse stomach ache). Like yesterday after mowing the lawn, sitting on the porch, cooling down, we both really wanted a smoke so bad, just because that is what we would usually do, not that I was necessarily craving it, just because that is what we would normally do. 

This weekend will be the true test, really neither one of us smoked that much during the week, as we both have jobs we cant smoke during the work day, but on the weekends, relaxing, having a drink, this will be the true test.

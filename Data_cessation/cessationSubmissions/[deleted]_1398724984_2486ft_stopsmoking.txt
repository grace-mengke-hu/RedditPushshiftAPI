I have been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day since I was 18 and I just did the math and over the last five years I have spent $17,640 on cigarettes. I could have bought a car.. I'm going to quit. Got any advice for me?

$10.50 x 7 packs = $73.50 per week

$73.50 x 4 weeks = $294.00

$294.00 x 12 months = $3,528 

$3,528 x 5 years = $17,640

That's also also not including all the times I have paid a dollar or 50 cents for a single smoke. I saw a question on /r/askreddit today about what question do you not want to know the answer to? I commented "How much I have spent on cigarettes?" and people kept replying to me about how much they have spent and it got me curious since I have been a pack a day smoker for give or take 5 years. I can't believe I have spent that much money to slowly kill myself. After this last pack that has 4 cigarettes left I'm quitting cold turkey... I could have a car, that's what blows my mind.

I have come here looking for advice, I'm going to need it. I'm 22, it's time for me to stop.

Edit: Tomorrow is going to be my first cigarette free day!

Is an occasional indulgence in Hookah risky?

So Its been a week since I quit. I will never ever smoke a cigarette again, but sometimes really really miss the hit of smoke on my throat. I know its the nicotine monster talking and all it really cares about is the nicotine but I feel that if something could replace that hit maybe I wouldn't feel so jumpy all the time.

That led me to thinking, can I smoke non-tobacco non-nicotine , flavoured hookah occasionally or will that lead into a full time relapse ? Or is hookah indulgence considered cheating ?

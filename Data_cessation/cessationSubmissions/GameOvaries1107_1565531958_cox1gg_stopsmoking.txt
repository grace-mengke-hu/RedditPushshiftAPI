Started smoking again...in my dreams

Exhibit #0871 of my brain being a total asshole. Iâ€™ve begun smoking again. Not in real life, just at night in my dreams. I walk around telling people how dumb it is and that they shouldnâ€™t do it. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Anyway, itâ€™s dumb and you shouldnâ€™t do it. If anyone has any tips on quitting dream smoking Iâ€™m all ears ðŸ˜†

Back in reality, 10 days left until the big 6 month mark. Keep on keeping on to those on the same mission, you got this.

Need some help ladies and chaps :(

When I smoked I had maybe like two or three a day. I have now stopped since October, as part of a group thing with three other people. I am the only one of the three that still hasn't smoked (They caved in after a week).

Anyway, after all these months, I have suddenly started REALLY wanting a cigarette, this is actually more difficult that when I originally gave up. What the hell?!

Please offer advice or help or facts or something argh!!

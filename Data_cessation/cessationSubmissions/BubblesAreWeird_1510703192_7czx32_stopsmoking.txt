Help with after effects of quitting

It's not new to find out when you give up a habit, you pick up a new one.
I've  managed to quit smoking but I've started over-eating a bit, mostly because one of my habits were to have a smoke when I was hungry. I really want to quit this habit too but I don't really know how to. I thought this would gradually go as time goes by but it seems to be getting worse.

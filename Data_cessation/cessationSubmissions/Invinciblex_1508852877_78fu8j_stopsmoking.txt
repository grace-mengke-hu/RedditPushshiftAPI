It's been a while

Smoking doesn't enter my mind the second I finish a meal or get into my car.  Seeing someone light up nearby actually nauseates me with how bad it stinks, even if someone is in a car with the windows up driving past, holy shit does that stuff stink.  You don't even realize how bad it smells while you're addicted because it doesn't smell bad, but instead good.  I can kind of remember what it feels like and occasionally I have a dream where I slipped up, waking up in a panic; then I remember it was just a dream and I'm still doing ok.  I still crave it sometimes, but those times are far and few between and easily squashed.  Just decided to quit and threw out half of the pack I still had and here I am 900 days later, completely cold turkey.  It was hard at first but it feels good being able to smell the grass.

I guess it only gets easier from here.

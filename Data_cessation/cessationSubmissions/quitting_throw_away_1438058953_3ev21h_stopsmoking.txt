It's been two weeks and I'm freaking out about my future...

....it's been two weeks (almost) since I stopped smoking....I'm 27.  I don't know how it happened, but I ended up doing research in to cancers and now I'm freaking out about my future (yes, I probably should have thought of it before I started smoking, but oops).  I smoked ~5 cigarettes a day for 3 years and a lot of hookah (a bowl daily) before that (for a few years).  I've really worked my head up.  This sucks.

But at least the cravings are gone...

First 24 hours gone, need advice!

Hello everybody!
I have finally decided to quit for good and for now I've been smoke free for 24 hours. Now, the first part of the day was not incredibly difficult, but the second even more so. I feel confused, a little bit nauseous and not extremely reactive to what happens around me. I also need a suggestion regarding cravings.
The times I have actually wanted a cigarette today were 5/6 at most. However I cannot shake away this restlessness and generally bad feelings I have. Any advice??

Thank you very much and sorry if this post doesn't really make sense, my brain is really fatigued!

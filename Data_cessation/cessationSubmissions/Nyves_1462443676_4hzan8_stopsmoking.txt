I write this as I walk to work (Day 1)

No, this isn't going to become a daily quitting log. Just saying. 

I'm listening to Postiljonen. It's raining a little. Kind of cold. The perfect weather for me to embrace my only friend while I trek to work. I never realized how much of a trigger loneliness really is. I've quit once before for about 3 months and it was loneliness that brought me back. 

Solitude is a hard thing that embrace and a cig is like a friend holding your hand, slowing down your thoughts to make them a bit clearer. Comforting but deadly. 

I'm determined to kick this thing. I'm prepping myself for every moment of my day. This walk, for one. Now, I'm going to be in work for the next 10 hours making coffee for people. There'll be those smokers sitting outside tempting me. That's gonna be tough. I remember reading on here if I repeat "I'm not a smoker" it throws you into perspective. 

I am not a smoker. Yesterday I was. Today, tomorrow, forever. No longer.

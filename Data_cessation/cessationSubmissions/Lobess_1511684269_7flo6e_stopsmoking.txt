11th month of being clean

Today marks the 11th month of being smoke free.  That is I have been a non smoker for 11 months today and kicked a 31 year old habit.  Just read some diaries and the first week was pure will to do whatever I had to in order to not smoke.  That horrible desperation and verge of self destruction has totally gone.  I am in total control.  There are, time to time fragments of missing the puff.  But not the heavy need to smoke.  Just a random tug here and there. I feel so much better smoke free.  Mentally, physically and emotionally.  I will never go back.  That chapter has gone and I am grateful.

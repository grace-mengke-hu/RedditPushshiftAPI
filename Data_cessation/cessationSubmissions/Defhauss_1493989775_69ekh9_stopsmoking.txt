28/M/UK - 2 weeks cold turkey after 15 years

Guys, I have quit both benzos and SSRIs cold turkey in the past but nicotine takes the lead for most difficult/consuming to quit...

I thought I'd weigh in here as my situation has been pretty notable! After realising I'd been addicted to nicotine for over half my life, I seemed to suddenly have a complete change of mindset and now here I am two weeks in...

I've had near constant dizziness/vertigo, I've been cold to the bone, my lypmh nodes are swollen, my throat and chest are always tight, I'm coughing, I'm hyper-irritable, I'm foggy/not thinking straight, I'm craving junk food (which I rarely ever eat), I'm lethargic, I'm achey but I'm NAILING IT.

I spent nearly a quarter of my life going between gums/lozenges/eCigarettes until I finally realised that it is ALL or NOTHING for me. And that's fine. For some it just is.

If I was to give any bit of general advice that's helped me...

Stay motivated! It is you who has the final say, not the addiction. Step back and witness it, embrace it, own it! And give yourself a tonne of slack - it's only temporary.

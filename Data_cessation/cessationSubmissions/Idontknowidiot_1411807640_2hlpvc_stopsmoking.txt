Suggestions and advice welcome... Needed

I am 30 and have been smoking approx pack/day for approx 15 years... My husband is in the same boat.  I am currently in nursing school  and suffer from anxiety, depression, and ADHD.  I want to quit and so does my husband, but my anxiety gets so bad in regards to stress from school and work and family issues that sometimes the thought of not being able to have a cigarette to calm me down makes my anxiety almost unbearable.  I truly do want to quit for mine and my husband's  health but I never seem to have the willpower for more than a day!  I am just looking for some advice from those who know what I'm going through.  (Did I mention that my grandpa is in the hospital and the prognosis is not good? -more stress, depression, anxiety)

I'm not looking for pity, etc.. I know you folks are supportive and I can't wait to read your responses... Just please understand that with everything that is going on in my life I may not respond to you, or I might take a long time to respond.  Please don't take that as me blowing you off or being ungrateful.  I am grateful to anyone who takes the time to help me!  Thank you in advance for any ideas/support!

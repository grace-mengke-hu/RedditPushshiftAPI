3 Weeks!

Can't wait to get a star!  I'm almost there.  The cravings are finally dissipating, it's almost like a cloud has lifted and I'm just suddenly thinking about/craving cigarettes less.

Still hacking up gross stuff in the mornings, I wonder how long that will last?  

My sense of smell is stronger and breathing is MUCH improved!

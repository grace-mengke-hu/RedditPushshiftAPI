Hate smoking, need a cigarette

Well, it's been almost 4 months now, since my last cigarette. 
My life has definitely been improved, I exercise much more, I lost a few pounds, regained my physical strength and self-esteem. From a casual cycling of 5 km per day, I am now having a weekly routine of 100 kilometers.
I've been through a lot, through moments of joy and rough times, like anyone does, either a smoker or not.
The thing is, although I can no longer stand the smoke of other people, although I am disgusted by the smell of my clothes after returning home from a bar and even though passive smoking makes me literary sick, these last days I really need to smoke.
I don't like smoking anymore. 
I am having a much better life as a non-smoker.
But I really -really- do need a cigarette..
And the worst part is, it is as if I am already counting the days until I relapse..

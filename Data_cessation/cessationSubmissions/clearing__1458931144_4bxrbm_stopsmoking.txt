Relapsed :(

I couldn't take the crushing loneliness and depressed feelings that came out when I stopped. It had only been 12 days. I thought I made it through the worst. I never felt like myself, and I think stopping the emotional suppression brought up a lot of feelings I've had bottled for far too long. Also, I turned to drinking to numb those, which became problematic for my relationship.

I will try again soon and make it, I just needed to know that these things were hiding under the surface.

Good luck everybody. I'll reset my badge when I start over.

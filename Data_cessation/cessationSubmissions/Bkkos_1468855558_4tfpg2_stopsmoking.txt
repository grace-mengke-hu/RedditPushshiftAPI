1 Day puuh

Hello everyone, 
I've read some posts and i think its just great how everyone support each others. I decided i need to stop smoking and its now been ~2 hours since the last cigarette. Starting to feel like shit. 

Cigarettes have been like a best friend for me. When you have to go to places that you dont like or you having some trouble dealing with situations cigarettes were always there for me. Like an Guardian Angel. 

I would be very happy if someone has maybe some tips or adice for me.

Love

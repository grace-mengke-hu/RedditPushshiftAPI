I bought a pack.....

..... exaclty 14 days ago :D

day 1 was hard and at lunch it was so bad i couldnt do my work appropriatly. so i went ahead and bought a pack. my pocket just felt empty. carried it around with me since then and didnt touch it once in those 14 days. I just realized that and i kinda proud of myself :)

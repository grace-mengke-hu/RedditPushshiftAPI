Anyone has the pdf of Herbert Brean's book "How to stop smoking"?

I'm just purely flat broke (main reason I'm trying to quit) I found the free pdf of Allen Carr's book and read it but I'm still not confident I'm gonna hold without smoking and since I saw another redditor saying Herbert's book gave him the final push I was hoping it would have the same effect on me. I know this sounds like I'm being cheap but I will definately buy it later on as a thank you I just can't right now and want to quit as soon as possible.
Thanks a lot guys!

unexpected withdrawal symptoms few days after quitting?

After I quit 5 days ago I anticipated the 'normal' symptoms: migraines, bad mood which I did get.    
**However** there are the symptoms that I did not see coming at all. The first, unexpected laughter throughout the day for dumb jokes. Really, really dumb jokes. And the laughter is contagious. And I keep laughing 2 minutes out loud, really genuinely so much that my abs hurt. The second, BAD insomnia. I could not shut an eye last night. It's been almost 24hours, I am dead. So dead. Back from work now and ready to pass out in a long coma.    
But curious to hear from you, *have you ever experienced 'unexpected' withdrawal symptoms* when you quit cold-turkey???

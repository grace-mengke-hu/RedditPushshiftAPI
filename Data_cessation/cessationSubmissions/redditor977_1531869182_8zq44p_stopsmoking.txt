Consider using essential oil aromatherapy if you’re experiencing withdrawal or cravings

That was a quick tip I’ve recently discovered and it works wonders! I made a diy spray bottle with some lavender oil and baking soda and sprayed it around my room; on the couch, on curtains, on my bed and pillows... It calms me down a lot (I think lavender oil is proven to reduce anxiety) and smelling something nice is obviously better than inhaling smoke. Peace!

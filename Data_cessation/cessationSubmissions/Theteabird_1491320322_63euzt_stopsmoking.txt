Set my quit time for one hour from now.

I've smoked for almost 18 years. I'm listening to the Allen Carr Easy Way audiobook. I drive quite a bit for my job and in my car is where I do the majority of my smoking. 

I've quit several times trying to will myself to quit when I really didn't want to or see the need. I'm so tired of spending money and lying to myself about how much I enjoy it. 

Any pointers from non-smokers on the first day?

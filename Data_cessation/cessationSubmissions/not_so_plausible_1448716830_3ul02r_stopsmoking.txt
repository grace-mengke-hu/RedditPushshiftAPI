Day One, I'm going to bed now and when I wake up its game on. LET'S DO THIS SHIT!

I read somewhere to post a lot because it helps. Well, this is my first post. Hell I might make another when I wake up. Another on my way to work. Then a shit ton while at work because that's when I smoke the most. It's going to be hard, and it's going to suck,  and I meant no sexual reference  by that, but I need all the support I can get. LET'S. FUCKING. DO THIS.    
     
Update Day 2: Still haven't touched those fuckers. I laugh at the temptation they bring, I LAUGH AT THE CRAVINGS BECAUSE I'M A GOD DAMN CHAMPION. I WILL NOT SURRENDER. THIS IS A FUCKING WAR AND I WILL SHIT ALL OVER IT. I KNOW IT'S ONLY DAY 2 BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP GOING FORWARD. I WONT SURRENDER. I WONT GIVE IN. I WILL WIN THIS SHIT.

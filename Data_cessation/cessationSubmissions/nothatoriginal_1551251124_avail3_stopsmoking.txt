My first time drinking since quitting

It has been 7 days, one whole week since I've enjoyed the feeling of a cigarette. I decided that I would reward myself with some wine but feel myself yearning deeply for a smoke. I am so proud of myself because the last time, I lasted 2 days before smoking again due to the intensity of the headaches and panic attacks I had. I had spent hours under a blanket in complete darkness crying in pain. I really don't want to fall back to smoking so if anyone has tips or tricks to relieve these cravings without smoking, that would be awesome!

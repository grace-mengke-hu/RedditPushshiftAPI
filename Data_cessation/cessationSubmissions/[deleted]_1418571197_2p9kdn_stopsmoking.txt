I made it through the weekend with some help from StopSmoking

I felt like really tired and listless Friday and Saturday and was looking for a reason, time or place to smoke. I was actually trying to set myself up for trigger places (horseraces) so that I could smoke, most of this only somewhat subconsciously. 

Each time this happened I would check my notes for why I quit, browse SD, and also think realistically about the experience I'd have if I smoked: 

I'd regret it immediately, especially when putting the first one out in the ashtray, feel dizzy, lungs would burn a little, smell like smoke and everyone would know I failed and probably drink and smoke an entire pack out of disappointment. When I woke up today a huge wave of disappointment would've come over me and I'd be chained to the habit again just like that. 

Instead it's 7am, my energy is starting to come back, my confidence is up , and I'm proud of myself for not giving in. If you're struggling remember to do the following:

1. Write or read your notes. Really remember or feel how you felt when you were so sick and tired of smoking and ask yourself what would be different this time

2. Read Stop Smoking or Alan Carr's book, anything that will appeal to your logical brain and quiet your junkie brain. Reminders that our addict brains are all the same is useful, and that none of us need or even want to smoke.

3. Something someone here said: imagine the end, not lighting up! Don't imagine lighting up the cigarette, imagine stubbing it out in the ashtray when you're done. Nobody ever feels great after smoking a cigarette,  but we addicts always focus on the lighting up and not putting it out . Help rewrite your brain by associating smoking with the negative and not the positive!

Thanks SS, glad you're here!

100 days. Keep going guys, it's totally worth it.

I'm at 100 days and I can't even remember the last cigarette I had. It was just a decision I made, threw away my pack and asked myself what the fuck I was doing. I'm glad I am no longer a drug addict. I'm glad I am free. 

The hardest part were the first 2 weeks. After that it just became easier. After a while you start to smell people who smoke and realize how much they smell like shit (If you smoke, you smell like shit). I've had numerous girls approach me and tell me that it's great that I quit because now they can finally have a conversation with me.

Keep going guys. Whether it's your first day or your 10th year, remember that being a non-smoker beats the living shit out of being a drug addict.

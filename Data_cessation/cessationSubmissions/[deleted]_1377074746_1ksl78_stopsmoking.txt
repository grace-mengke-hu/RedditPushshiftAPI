My first day!

Hi everyone!

I'm relatively new to this sub, I decided yesterday that I'm going to stop smoking, so this will be my first (hopefully) smokeless day. 

There are a lot of reasons why I want to stop, being expensive (I'm a student, previously almost **all** of my money went to cigarettes, if I ever had money, I spent it directly towards smokes). If I didn't have the money, I was borrowing smokes from everyone, from friends to complete strangers on the street.

Next would be the obvious health reasons. Not only in the long run I don't want to end up with lung cancer, I'm always feeling tired, sleepy, dizzy and I feel like I just don't have that much energy since I started smoking.

I'm thinking about going cold turkey, I guess it won't be easy, but it's worth a try! ;)

EDIT: Aaah I screwed up, smoked one, couldn't resist :/ :(

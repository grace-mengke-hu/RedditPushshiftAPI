Up to day 6 so far, what to expect?

Hey fellow quitters. I'm on my 6th day of not smoking so far, I'm going completely cold turkey, no patches, gum, vape, anything. What and when should I expect my body to do/experience? I'm already getting mood swings, which I've been told to expect, when do I start coughing up shit? What else am I going to do?

Thanks guys.

Also, thank you all for inspiring me, from the people who have only just started, to those who have quit for years. The ones who have stumbled and caved in, but come back stronger and more determined, each and everyone of you have inspired me to make this change in my life, after 12 years.

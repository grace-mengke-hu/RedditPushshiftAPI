The $1k wager - Mid-way through Day 3 is hellish

The first time I ever heard Day 3 was the hardest was in SuperSize Me - Morgan Spurlock was talking about the "3 day hump." Well folks, here I am at day 3. 

AND IT FUXKING SUCKS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

I want to give up so badly. Seriously, I have zero personal desire right now to stay committed. This sucks. It sucks so much. It sucks donkey balls on a hot summer day in the middle of Phoenix, Arizona during a dust storm.

But is smoking a cigarette worth a $2k swing?

No. But it's very fucking close. I hate everything. Especially past me who made this stupid bet. Even though I know it's good for me, I don't care at this point.

I think this is what people call a cry for help. My craving is going away right now so I don't feel as strongly as all the above text. But I'll post it anyway.

I'm okay.

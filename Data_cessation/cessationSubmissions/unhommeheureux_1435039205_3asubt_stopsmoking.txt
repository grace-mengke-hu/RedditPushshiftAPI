What worked for you?

I have tried to quit so many times and I always go back to smoking. I am a 21 year old male who has been smoking since I was 16. I recently quit for over a month and before I even realized what was happening, here I am smoking a pack a day again. I've tried everything: cold turkey, vaping, etc. But here I am smoking again. I want to quit. I want to quit more than anything in the world, but I don't know how. What did it for you? What advice can you give someone who desperately wants to atop killing themselves?

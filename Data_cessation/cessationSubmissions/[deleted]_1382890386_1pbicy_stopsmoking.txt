Stopped smoking and dipping cold turkey

It's only been four days, but I've been absolutely craving free, and this feels much different than other times I've tried quitting. I was a truck driver, and I used to dip non stop while driving and then smoke non stop once I was parked (I didn't like the inside of my truck smelling like smoke). But, I just came off the road to start a new job that doesn't involve driving, and I knew I needed to stop the tobacco addiction. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not in that familiar driver's seat, or if it's because I'm less stressed out not having to deal with traffic in a big truck everyday, but the cravings and difficulties that I've experienced when trying to quit in the past have been completely non existent. Here's to hoping it stays this easy. Even if it doesn't stay this easy, I'm done with the damage to my wallet and my health that tobacco has caused. I'm no longer an abuser.

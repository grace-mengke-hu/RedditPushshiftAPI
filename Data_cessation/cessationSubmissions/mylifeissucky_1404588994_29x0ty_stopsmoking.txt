I 100% succeeded at the c-store today

I went to the c-store down the lane. I have no other stores close to the house that is both accessible by walk and has NO smokes. I vowed last night to do the darnedest ever not to buy a pack.

 Well, I succeeded in NOT buying a pack OR even NOT asking ANYONE for any and felt nothing but pure exasperation as people bought packs and cartons. I would've felt the same about myself had I caved in to it.

I've a party tonight. Any advice for avoiding social smoking?

I'm not particularly socially awkward/reclusive, but I've nearly always used "going-out-for-a-cigarette" as a crutch when I'm not sure how to act or if I'm bored or if I want to met someone new.
Many of my friends smoke so I know I'll have fierce cravings when I'm around them, but I don't plan on avoiding them altogether solely for that reason!
I'm worried that the social pressure will make me crave this time, even though I haven't really been suffering from any heavy withdrawal since I stopped.

Any advice?

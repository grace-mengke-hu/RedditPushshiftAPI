I just smoked my last cigarette.

And it tasted like shit. It burned my throat. I have no energy. I can't get out of bed in the morning. I smell horrible. I avoid situations where I know I can't smoke.    
  
FUCK THAT.  

It's over. I don't smoke anymore. My baby girl can now grow up without smoking being a part of her life. I'm so happy to be finished with this disgusting and expensive addiction.  

Badge reset. High-five yourselves everyone. I know I am!

I gave up smoking and drinking and weed all at once and it backfired :/

So two weeks ago I went to Amsterdam on a stag do and totally wrecked my body. After 13 years of drinking and smoking tobacco and weed I decided to quit tobacco I had enough. I had not planned on giving up drinking but every time I thought of having a beer I knew I would smoke and that stopped me drinking. Then like a domino effect once I gave up the tobacco I dident need to smoke weed all the time it was great,

 BUT

after two weeks I realised the way I stopped I dident get a final send off and of all my cravings the worst was that I needed that one last spiff n beer and yesterday my best friend came round all torn up after breaking up with his GF and brought beer and weed and I crumpled almost instantly, i smoked tobacco weed and got hammered.

As I woke up this morning all I felt was a pounding head a heavy chest and a ton of regret I wish I dident do it and I'm not sure what to do, continue to kick all 3 or start with tobacco then drink them focus on cutting down on weed "I don't want to stop all together " I obviously have a real addictive personality and I'm not sure if I'm capable of stopping one without the other.

Day 2 and craving hard

Had a terrible night at work and the only thing I wanted to do was light up... Splitting headache, irritability, and overall frustration. Hating that I feel the need to smoke and hate feeling that I can't unwind. I want to punch a hole in the wall but instead I'll try and sleep for I still have a lifetime of this shit cycle ahead ....

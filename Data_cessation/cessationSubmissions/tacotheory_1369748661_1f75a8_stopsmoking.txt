A Different Perspective

Hi /r/stopsmoking 

I've been subscribed to this subreddit for around a month now, and I'm really proud of what all of you are going through. I on the other hand, have been having some problems quitting smoking.

It is constantly mentioned throughout Carr's book that smokers disdain themselves for smoking, and don't enjoy smoking at all. In fact, his entire book is written on these simple premises. But what I've found out after 1 week of not smoking is that I genuinely enjoy smoking. I will admit I am addicted to nicotine, but it goes further than that. I enjoy a cigarette after an intense workout, after I wake up in the morning, watching the smoke exhale through my mouth, and just smoking in general. I have no willpower to quit, in fact, I don't even want to quit right now. Maybe a heart attack will change my views, but I think I'm way too young to have something that dramatic happen to me. 

Now, everyone knows that smoking is bad for you. It's been negatively affecting my lung capacity and especially my skin. I know I should quit. But I can't because I don't have the true, deep desire to quit.

Is there any hope for me? Can any of you help me? Any other quitters out there have any advice? I'm sorry if my post seems demotivational or even contradictory, but it is truly how I feel at the moment. 

TL;DR: Quitting smoking would be great, but I don't have the deep desire nor the willpower to quit at the moment. Any advice?

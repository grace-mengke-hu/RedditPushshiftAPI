I fell right back in, But i'm back!!

I gathered about a week or so and for some reason, thought it a good idea to celebrate by buying a fresh pack. I think i was thinking I could be a "scaled back" smoker, the type to only have a smoke every other day or so, but by the following evening, I had smoked the entire pack. 

I realized 2 very important things that day, that 1. I am severly addicted because i lie even to my slef about it and 2. that i get absolutley nothing fro smoking cigraettes!! 

I'm done ya'll !!!! For good.

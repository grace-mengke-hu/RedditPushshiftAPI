147 days in, desperately want to smoke.

So I didn't find the whole 'quitting' thing too bad. Day two was the worst, but ever since then it's been fairly simple...

However, the last week or two I keep really wanting to smoke. I suppose they're cravings, but they're more like little idea moles in my brain, burrowing in deep for hours at a time before leaving. 

I'm having another one of those 'cravings' right now, and I live around the corner from a supermarket...I know I shouldn't, but it's a really strong urge. 

Support would be great, but I really just wanted to get this out there. Fingers crossed I'll stay strong.

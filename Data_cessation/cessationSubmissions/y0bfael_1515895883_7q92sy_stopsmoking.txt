Day 4

I started Sunday with the patch.  But still had a few smokes that day. Monday morning was pretty much similar. 

Wednesday was the day. No more smokes.  Last smoke was Tuesday night.  Wednesday and Thursday 0 smokes and wore the patch. 

Yesterday(Friday) for whatever reason I decided to see how long I could go before I put the patch on. Managed to make it all day. Although “I’m freaking out man” was kind of a common line for me to say and I was incredibly hyper.   I also realized a lot of my ADD management was done via smoking. This will be an avenue I’ll explore later. Not bad day though pretty easy. 

Today was a pain in the ass though. I found myself snapped while at work and a bad mood. Managed to calm myself down around 30 minutes after the fact but I was def on edge till about lunch time. Rest of the day was pretty chill. 

Still 0 smokes since Tuesday night. Going strong

If I can do this. So can you

Starting day 3

It's been 3 days, 6 hrs and 57 mins since my last puff..... still having thoughts but am able to get through them,  even got pissed today that my phone died, was close to saying to hell with it, but had time on my side, and I didnt have money on me to just buy a pack, I was able to talk myself out of it. I have done days 1 and 2 over and over again through out this year,  now that the hard part is over, I have suffered to much to just give up now.

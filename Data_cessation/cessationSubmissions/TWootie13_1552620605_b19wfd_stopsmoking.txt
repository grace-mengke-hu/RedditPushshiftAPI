The dreams have started

Last night I had my first lucid dream about smoking, so realistic with so much detail that I cried IN my dream bec I had ruined my 4 day smoke free streak. When I woke up, I genuinely thought I had gotten up that night and smoked. I was convinced that I had raided a stash that I had forgotten about and had smoked a cigarette. It took literal MINUTES for me to come to my senses and realize that it’s impossible for me to have smoked, my house is nicotine free, so I was legit about to cry bec I was then so HAPPY that it was just a dream! I even smelled my own breath to make sure. That’s how realistic it was. 

Holy shit this stuff is real LOL. Does this happen to everyone? And often? That was seriously intense. I’m 4 full days smoke free and working on day 5. Had that dream last night. I could really do without all that noise tonight. Here’s hoping.

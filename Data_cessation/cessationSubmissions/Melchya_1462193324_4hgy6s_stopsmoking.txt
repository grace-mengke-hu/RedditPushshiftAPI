A quick question

Hi guys, congratulation to everyone who quit smoking, and to those who are finally about to do the final step. 

Because i'm more or less interested in ways of quitting, no reason to upvote this post. 

My question is as follows. Do you guys consider a person who quit smoking, just to turn over to e-cigarettes a smoke free person? Even if vaping is a 'healthier' alternative. Or would you consider it to be just as damaging, in the way that said person is still a smoker. I dont buy cigarettes anymore, as the vape felt better for me in alot of ways. And in some ways i do consider myself 'free' of the smoke. Well my apartment isnt so rank of the cigarette smell, and i dont have the frog in my throat anymore. Anyway, what's you guys' opinion as a community on the matter? 

Best regards!

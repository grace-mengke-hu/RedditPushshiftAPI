Today is the moment of truth... 1 month smoke free/2 weeks nicotine free, first time taking ADD meds again.

I have been putting off taking adderall after my quit (usually take it 2-3 times a week as necessary) because historically the days I would take it I would also almost double my cig intake. I've been lucky that the holiday season is slow at work so I've been able to coast the past few weeks without it. I need to start up again today but I've also built this moment up in my head as "the moment of truth" and I'm nervous. I finally am starting to feel like normal human being again after horrible weeks of withdrawal (insomnia, "flu", laryngitis, etc) and I really don't ever want to go through that again. Send me strong vibes please! I already feel the cravings. So thankful for a community to vent.

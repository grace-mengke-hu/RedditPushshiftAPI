It's been 35 days, and I don't feel well...

Don't get me wrong, I feel accomplished. I haven't gone this long without smoking in over three years, but I think the negative aspects of mental health problems I've been dealing with for almost a decade have been hitting me full force. The past two weeks, I've been what my therapist when I was sixteen was prickish enough to call "brain sick", but it's a good way to describe it. I feel like my friends are not interested in hanging out with me anymore, and it's so hard to tell whether it's true or if it's really just me. I'll just wake up and feel this overwhelming depression, or I'll be more irritable and aggressive. I never know which it will be.  Generally, I've been feeling worthless.  I thought I was over this years ago, but it's been hitting me like a bus lately. I don't feel like I have anyone I can talk to anymore, and my support system is practically non-existent. I'm not sure why I'm posting this really, maybe I just needed to vent.

19 days. I am wondering.

I did it 19 days ago. No patches. No nothing. Nicotine free for 19 days. Compared to previous (failed) attempts I'd say this time it's a lot easier. I am genuinely happy.

But I am wondering. Am I a nonsmoker now? Because when I see a smoker part of me feel happy for myself but tbh part of me still feel envious. On some level I still miss smoking. I know I've made the decision for myself. I'm not going back to smoking. That's just not worth it.

So, fellow quiters, do you have the same problem? Do you at some point know for sure that you're not a smoker anymore? Can you share the experience?

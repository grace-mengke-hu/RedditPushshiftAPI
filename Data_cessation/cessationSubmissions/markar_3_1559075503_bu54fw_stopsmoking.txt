Smell of others

Hello again, almost 3 months here feeling like never smoked before... I only miss the smoke breaks... Anyway, as I said I feel like i ve never smoked before and I ve reached the point when the smell of other smokers discusses me... I have to deal with my supervisors bad breath and smell every morning this sucks... I Cant believe I used to smell like this all this time

Sick after quitting

I quit smoking 2 nights ago. Yesterday, when I woke up, I felt sick. Stomach ache, bones hurting, insanely sore throat but almost no headache (still a bit). Today it's pretty much the same. 
Is there anything I can do and is this normal? I have work tomorrow and I cant stay home sick :(

Newby! Question regarding vaping to quit cigarettes.

Hello everybody! I'm a decade long smoker, and have constantly worried about what smoking is doing to my lungs, my skin, my body. I hate everything about smoking. The smell, the taste, everything..except how a cigarette makes me feel! Hence, I just couldn't get myself to quit. About 3 months ago, I came across an article about the Juul and decided to give it a shot - seemed like a better option than quitting cold turkey. Within 2 days, I wasn't smoking a single cigarette a day. I vape Juul pods with 3% nicotine, and a single pod lasts me about a day-day &amp; a half. Apparently vaping gives you the nicotine hit without the other nasties of a cigarette. Has anybody else tried quitting cigarettes &amp; switching to vaping/Juul? 3 months in, I can't help but worry about what vaping does to my body now?! Any thoughts/advice would be appreciated. Best wishes to all!

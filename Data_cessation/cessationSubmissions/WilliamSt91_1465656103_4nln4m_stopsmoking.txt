Almost in triple digits thanks to you guys!

Hi everyone! This is the first time that I'm posting something and I just want to say thank you to all of you who have been posting topics on the page. They were comforting in times when I needed them the most and they gave me strength in times I thought I wasn't going to make it. 
Now, I'm not one to brag but I've always said to myself "If you make it through 100 days, share it with everybody." So, unless I fuck it up these last couple of hours, my first 100 days are done.

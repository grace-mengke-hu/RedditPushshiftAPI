I’ve been quitting for six years straight. Help.

Hello beautiful people,

As the title states I am in my own nightmare. For six years of my life I have been in and out of quitting, literally every day buying a pack and saying it will be my last. Just torturing myself at this point. 

My whole family smoked, my first cigarette was at 12 and started smoking heavily at 16 along with a drug habit to deal with anxiety and depression that was largely ignored by my smoking family. Those issues are still very much with me. Now I am the last one smoking, every single one has quit and they will not leave me be about how “easy it really is”. I feel so weak in comparison. They chuckle when I say “I’m quitting for real this time”, that’s how many times they’ve heard me say it and continue to smoke.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Wellbutrin was wonderful at first but I had a delayed allergic reaction, that wasn’t fun. I smoked with a patch on, Allen Carr is wonderful but that hasn’t worked either somehow. Vaping gives me a migraine every time, even pure VG. Valerian etc haven’t been effective. 

I understand the logic and can go without smoking but I can’t stop the flow of tears and rage even weeks later.  I have to go to work every day and I don’t like exposing my coworkers to that, it’s not fair to them. 

Has anyone tried hypnosis? I’ve seen conflicting reports. It’s so expensive that I’m hoping to gain some clarity before I dive in. I’ve also been advised to try TRE (tension release exercises) to try to deal with the underlying problems. 

Thank you to anyone who gives even a little bit of advice, it’s very much appreciated.

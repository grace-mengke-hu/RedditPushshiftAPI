Doing this again. Strapping a patch on.

So fucking sick of cigarettes. I hate smelling like them, looking like a smoker, struggling to find money and time to smoke. Fucking awful! I am so done. This is the last one. I have come too far in life and have overcome so much to let a petty cigarette ruin shit for me now. This is mostly a rant but I am so fed up. It's time.

Decided to quit vape because of recent chest pains

Hey guys so I ran out of pods for my vape so i had already been two days off when on the third day (yesterday morning) i started feeling pain in my chest... last night i took the last hit of my vape because this morning I realized how my chest was still hurting and how smoking definitely wasn't helping that.

I guess my real question is, when quitting did anyone else experience sharp chest pains? I read online it might be a side effect but it didn't seem too concrete... not sure if I should be worried about my BP or not.

Anyway, happy to finally make this decision and I'm looking forward to frequenting this subreddit!

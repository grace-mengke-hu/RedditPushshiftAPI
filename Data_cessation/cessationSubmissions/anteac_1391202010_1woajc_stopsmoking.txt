quit my marlboro's yesterday

Hi, I started at age of 15 and now, 2 years later I decided to spontaneously quit smoking after reading the summary of allen carr's opinion about quiting.

I do crave them a little bit now, but not like i normally would crave for one when i used to be a smoker :)

Let's hope this will be easy with my mindset atm

Feel like smoking again

The main reason I am trying to quit smoking is because of my girlfriend and for my health too. But now we got into a huge fight and I out of anger asked her not to call or text me and kind of broke up with her. Now I feel like drinking and smoking. I don't know what to do. Please help

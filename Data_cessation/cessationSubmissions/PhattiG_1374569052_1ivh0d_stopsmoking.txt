A, I'm sure common post... a warning... Keep it up!!!

Congratulations, and great job all that have quit!!!  I had quit 29 days!...  I had actually quit before reading Allan Carr's easyway to quit smoking, but I wanted to reinforce how great that read really is.  I knew much of it, but there really were gaps I'm truly thankful for, that I did not know.  This is a sad post for me, but hopefully a good one for others; don't smoke - even one drag.  I went 29 days, and after a breakup of 5 years, I smoked one for the freedom.  I'm now smoking again.  I thought I'd be safe, but I wasn't.  I quit another 48 hours of the tried and true 72, but the depression of the lost relationship overtook me, and I regret it...  I was strong in the breakup, and not smoking.  But with that feeling of overcoming, I got too certain in my strength, and smoked one with a girl I was talking with.  The cards have fallen, and I'm depressed and smoking again.  I wish I hadn't.  Please, don't feel strong in your quit enough to take it for granted.  Great job all that continue to be quit!  And please, those that have, don't feel too complacent and strong in your will overcoming that nicotine monster.  I knew better, and I regret it, every day.  A week today.  I quit 48 hours of the 72... and caved again.  Don't do it.  Even with Alan Carr's easyway, if hard times hit, stick with it...

Alright, I think I'm finally gonna stop.

For some reason if I tell someone I'm going to do something I'm more likely to do it, but I don't want the pressure from telling someone in real life. I'm 25, smoking since 15, and this is my first real attempt to quit. I've half tried in the past for others but this is the first time I actually want to. 

My reasons why this time is different, I'm sick of being broke because of it, $5 a day sucks. I'm sick of being sick. Every time I get sick it's for 5 days minimum. Two days ago I was sick in a hotel room for a celebration (will explain later) and didn't feel like walking down to smoke. Slept like 16 hours, woke up actually feeling better when normally I'd be worse. Blew my mind, like I had symptoms that I usually get on the 4th day the 2nd day and I didn't get nearly as bad. 

The last one is basically my brother died from smoking. So did my grandmother but I was young so it didn't hit me as hard. The celebration I mentioned earlier was for him, and I'm still super sad/pissed I missed it. I had one job, to get overly drunk and have fun. Instead I had one shot, puked, and ditched out earlier then my 75 year old grandfather. 

I have those e-cigs, seem to be helping me. I told myself I'd quit after my super busy time when I could take a few days off work. It's not quite here yet (two weeks away) but being sick makes me already smoke less so I'm not passing this up. 

I have 15 left in a pack and another unopened one. Would love that to last the two weeks, but I think that's a bit of a long shot (from about 20 a day to 2-3), so I might get one more. Hopefully I'm done after that. 

Going to tell my SO, he already smokes less then me and has already tried quitting so I'm hoping we can quit together. Will be better for us and our dogs. Here's to hoping we don't end up murdering eachother. 

Typing this I already want one. Fuck

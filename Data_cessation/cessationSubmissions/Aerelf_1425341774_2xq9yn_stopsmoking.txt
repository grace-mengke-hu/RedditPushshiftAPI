5 days in. Quitting sucks.

Being a smoker for five years, I decided to quit five days ago. It is not my first attempt, but I never managed to last more than 24 hours.

And I have to say, quitting sucks. The thing that most people can relate to are, of course, the cravings. There are times where I feel like I need a cigarette SOOO badly. I usually end up chewing some gum or eating a kitkat, but it does affect the quality of my work. I have a lot of trouble focusing during those urges.

Another big thing is the coughing. I actually cough waaay more than I was before quitting. It's not the loud, painful cough where you just know your throat is irritated too, it's the little, scary smoker's cough that makes you fear for your longevity.

And the last thing are the pimples. Being in my twenties, I still suffer from very light acne, but quitting made the god damn zits rain on my face. I went from one or two of them on the chin to more than ten all around my mouth area. Some pretty big ones appeared on my chest and my shoulders too.

Of course, that doesn't even hurt my determination to never touch a cigarette ever, it kinda reinforces it actually, as I'm thinking that those problems I'm dealing with are not because I quitted smoking, but because I smoked in the first place. It just fucking blows, and I truly hope all of this will be over soon.

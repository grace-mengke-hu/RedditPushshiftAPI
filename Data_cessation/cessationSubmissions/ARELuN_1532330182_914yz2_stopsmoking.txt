21 days in. I fucked up, kinda.

So yeah, yesterday we were out, drinking. I had pretty strong cravings past few days, when I was on vacation, but didn't smoke, as I was with nonsmokers all week. 

And yesterday I bummed a cigarette from my friend. I had two puffs and then killed it, because, honestly it was disgusting and it gave me nothing of that past sensation I had when I was smoking. 

These past few days have been pretty demanding on me, constantly on the move, driving, so I'm pretty happy I didn't cave in completely. Also, the taste of cigarette now serves me as further motivation to not to give in to the addiction. It tastes horrible and has absolutely no purpose in my life.

Artificial relief

I think that's what a cigarette is. It's like how people think they enjoy taking a shit when really they enjoy  the relief that they no longer need a shit. 
one cigarette creates an addiction or need for nicotine,  then the second subsequently relieves it, so on and so forth.

we don't like cigarettes, we like that when we have a cigarette we no longer crave a cigarette. That's why it always feels like "ahh, i can finally relax" when i smoke.  


Relief is a great feeling but there are better ways to achieve it. My nicotine substitute will be getting the shit that's weighing on my mind done. I hope it becomes a 20 a day habit.

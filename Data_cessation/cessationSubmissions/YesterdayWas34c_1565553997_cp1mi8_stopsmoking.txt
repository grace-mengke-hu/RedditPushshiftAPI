Need advice, one month free of smoking and feeling really fatigued and nauseous

Just wondering if anyone else has had these symptoms a month or so after you quit smoking? I’ve tried looking up on google but couldn’t get a specific answer. Also I have anxiety so not sure if that could be a reason for my withdrawals being so intense.

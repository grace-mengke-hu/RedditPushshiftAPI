2 weeks, no cigarettes

However, I have been hitting my vapor e-cig so I don't know if it completely counts that I have quit. I've quit buying and smoking actual cigarettes. Probably gonna do this vapor thing for another few weeks, but it has definitely helped.

Now, if I could only get my live-in boyfriend to quit smoking too, but he refuses. I have banished him outside or to the bathroom, so I imagine it's only a matter of time.

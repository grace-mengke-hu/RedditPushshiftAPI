Fed up

Hello all.  I am new to this site so I'm trying to figure out how to post.  I am fed up with having nicotine and alcohol run my life.  Any suggestions on where to start?  Found some leftover Chantix so took my first dose today.  Hope to be able to quit nicotine cold turkey.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

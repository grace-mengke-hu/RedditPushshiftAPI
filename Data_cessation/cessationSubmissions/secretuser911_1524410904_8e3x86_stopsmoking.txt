16 days!

Hold f@!k. Im so happy to have come this far. 

I really almost cracked on days 12&amp;13 due to very heavy cue induced cravings and pms, but help strong against the justifications my addict brain was making. (I fully expect these types of days to return where it’s just bad, but hopefully they will be farther and farther apart)

Also - my digestion is regular again (Thank God! I actually got a case of diverticulitis that just cleared up in addition to quitting making me constipated). 

I started a probiotic so I don’t know if that’s helping but it feels good to be one step closer to feeling normal again. 

Also had my first drink since quitting and cravings were minimal :)

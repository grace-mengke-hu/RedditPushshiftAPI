So far so stopped...day 8

Although it feels like cheating as I am using patches and have an emergency e-cig for something to turn to when I am out drinking - which is not often only the odd social occassion but is 100% the reason I have started again every time I quit before.  This is probably my 25th attempt to stop (I really hate the fact I am/was a smoker).  My longest break was about 18 months.  I consider myself to be of reasonable intelligence but can hardly say that when I consider the sheer stupidity of this habit/addicition that I have had all this time...I smoked for (and I am super embarrassed about this) 21 years on and off, which admittedly is mostly on.  I turned 38 last week, and this time enough is enough... I am lucky enough to not have any ill effects of all the countless smokes I have had over the years and it's time to stop relying on luck and treat my body a bit more responsibly...

Anyways, just saying hi to fellow non-smokers... I have a phone app that told me to come on here so just doing what I'm told ;)

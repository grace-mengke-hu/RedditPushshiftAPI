Officially 2 days smoke free. 2 pack a week smoker. My farts are disgusting.

Throw away for obvious reasons. So far I have symptoms of irritation, some stomach cramping, constipation, gas like craaaaaazy. Anyone else get awful smelling farts after quitting? So far so good though. Glad Iâ€™m smoke free!

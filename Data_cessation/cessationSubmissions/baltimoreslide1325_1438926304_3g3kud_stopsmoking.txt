2 weeks tomorrow night, takin' myself to a movie

Tomorrow night will mark the first time I've ever made it a real 2 weeks without smoking. (I made it two weeks *once*, but I had mono and truly *couldn't* smoke for 10 days of that. This is the first time I've made it two weeks of daily life without smoking since I started 11 years ago.)  
I'm giving myself quit rewards on Fridays. It's nice to daydream during the week about what my Friday reward should be (and that daydreaming is a nice antidote if cravings do come). I decided tomorrow I'm taking myself out to a movie (alone, 'coz I love to do that sometimes) and maybe a fancy coffee or glass of wine along with it.  
Yay.  
Somewhat unfortunately I'm choosing to see "The End of the Tour" and I'm pretty sure both main characters smoke a lot throughout. But whatever. People smoke in movies. I have to get used to that some time anyway. I still don't want to smoke in real life.   
Join me in not smoking this weekend?

[[In interest of honesty: I'm still on a 7mg patch (the very lowest level one) for part of the day. But I still have a badge and count days to cheer myself on because it just helps.]]

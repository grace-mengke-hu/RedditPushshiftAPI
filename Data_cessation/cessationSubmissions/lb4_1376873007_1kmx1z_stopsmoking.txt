Day One Complete.

I read Allen Carr's book last night and decided to throw out the rest of the pack and have my final ritual then and there. I had done tons of "Last Smokes" before but I always approached it as saying good bye to a friend rather than focusing on being happy to be free.

It's already been around a full day and I feel different than the times I tried to quit before. There was no panic. I still feel that tightness but it's just been irritating, and I hope it goes away within a week. That being said, I feel optimistic that this attempt is the last attempt and I wanted to make a post so that I'd be able to remember the date I quit. I've decided not to count the hours/days/weeks/months on the regular, I find time goes slower when you're watching the clock.

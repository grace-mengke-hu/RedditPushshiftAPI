what did you do to replace smoking when in traffic, at breaks at work, waiting etc..

been lurking this sub for a while cause it motivates me to one day be like all of you.

what alternative ways did y’all replace time you’d use to otherwise smoke a cigarette? 

i cant imagine not lighting a cigarette or 3 while in heavy traffic going home. or what would i do on my breaks at work?

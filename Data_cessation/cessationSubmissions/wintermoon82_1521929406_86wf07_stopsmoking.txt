relapse

Well, I relapsed after 10 days of being smoke free. I'm also quitting alcohol. It's hard to quit both at the same time, but I think quitting drinking is more important than quitting smoking at the moment. But I plan to lay the cigarettes down once again on Monday. I'm gonna keep doing it til I quit for good! Wish me luck 😁

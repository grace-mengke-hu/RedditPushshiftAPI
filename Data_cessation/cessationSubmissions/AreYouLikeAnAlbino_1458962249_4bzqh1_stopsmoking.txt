Its been 1 day

I had my last cigarette yesterday afternoon. Just so happened, i got this stomach bug. So i was up throwing up all night. Which kinda helped me not smoke the rest of yesterday and today. Today, i have really bad chest pains. Just feels like a huge pressure in my chest when i move and breathe. Is this from not smoking? How long will this last?

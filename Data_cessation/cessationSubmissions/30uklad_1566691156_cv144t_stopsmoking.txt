Why just why

So after 6 days of not smoking I started again on Friday (last week Friday) but it was different this time I was shaking and going dizzy unsure why but it don't stop me going back on then now I feel like I've let myself down as a person. I've try every thing to stop even got some gum ðŸ˜¢ just don't think I have the will power tbh

I recently quit smoking weed and drinking alcohol, now I also want to quit smoking cigarettes. Any tips appreciated.

I'm attempting to quit smoking after smoking for about 5 years. I've already took a major step in the right direction by quitting all other drugs in my life (except cafeine and nicotine).


I've gradually decreased smoking from a pack per day to about half. Now whenever I try to avoid going for a cigarette I get very nervous and everything starts to annoy me. I go into really bad mood and I simply eventually go for a cigarette. Maybe I'm attempting to quit too many things at once but that's the only way I see myself actually becoming a better person. I've attempted to quit by buying a vaporizer but I simply get no buzz whenever I smoke that. 

I'm looking for any proper tips on how to quit or maybe if I should continue smoking cigarettes until I'll be sober from other drugs longer (nearly 1 month without any other substances).

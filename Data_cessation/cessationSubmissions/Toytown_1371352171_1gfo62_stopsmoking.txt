Nicotine gum addiction

Hey /r/stopsmoking. Growing up my dad always struggled with nicotine addiction. During one of his attempts he tried nicotine gum and when he relapsed after that attempt he was not only smoking but also chewing gum. I have a friend who tried to quit a few months ago and also started chewing gum. He has now relapsed and is both chewing gum and smoking. Is nicotine gum just another thing smokers can get addicted to? Have people had success quitting with gum/lozenges?

Taking that (scary) step leaving cigarettes behind

I'm 28 and smoking regularly since I was 17. I think I actually always knew I'd smoke - my parents did and, of course they would never encourage it, but I loved the smell of my mum's cigarettes. I remember the thrill of trying the first one, but looking back on over ten years, I regret buying that first box. Since then, as a diligent smoker, I've always known where my cigarette box is - God forbid I have to go to bed without cigarettes in my possession! I did quit for three months three years ago,the same time I lost some weight, put on some muscle by going to the gym for a few hours a day over the summer. When I got back to college I bought a box of cigarettes to go with the beers we had to celebrate renting a new apartment.

Tomorrow is my first day trying to right my life again by parking the cigarettes to one side. I'm going to pack my bag for the gym after work and be a non-smoker. I'm scared.

It's three months until my girlfriend is back from travelling - I'm going to use that as a positive as a timeline to get in shape, lose a little bit of weight,and feel better - the achievement of not smoking is going to be a big part of that person I want to be in three months and I want to look back at this time as a success story amongst my other failed attempts.

We all know the feeling - you don't want to build yourself up too much in case you don't live up to your expectations. Good to know I'm taking the same step as a lot of us here. For those that have taken that step before me, continued success on not-smoking. For those yet to take that step or are thinking about not smoking, I'm testing the waters for you.

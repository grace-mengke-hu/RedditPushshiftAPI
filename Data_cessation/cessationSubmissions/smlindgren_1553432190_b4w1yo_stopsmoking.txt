Stopping Wellbutrin after 2 weeks?

So my dr prescribed Wellbutrin for me to kick my occasional smoking habit. I’ve been on it for just over two weeks and I just can’t sleep. I don’t think I’ve slept more than 3 hours a night for two weeks. 

I want to stop the medication as I can’t live like this. Is it ok to just stop taking it or do I have to taper down?

Got REALLY Sick and Caved 45 Mins Ago

Sorry to be graphic here, but let me give you a quick run down.  

I quit earlier this week and 2-3 days into it I got the night sweats.  Then, about an hour or 2 ago (I'm at the 5-6 day mark), I got INCREDIBLY SWEATY.  I felt mentally whacked out (like drunk, almost... i'm sober,) and got diarrhea.  I ran to the store and grabbed a pack and smoked 2 cigarette.  I didn't enjoy it, but I figured I would rather smoke than keep feeling ill.

I'm better now, but REALLY chilly.  I've been smoking since I was about 12.  I wouldn't call myself a heavy smoker, though, until I was 18, since I was legal to buy them at that point.  I'm 30 now.  I've stopped smoking here and there in the past (never longer than a year or 2.)   

Is ANY of this normal?  Maybe the first case of sweats was withdrawal but maybe this time I had food poisoning?  I have no idea what's going on.  I'm not going to beat myself up for smoking 2 cigs today, because I really didn't know what else to do to stop everything.  I already threw away the rest of the pack, since I don't want to smoke.  Dang, y'all, I don't want this to happen again.  Should I ween myself off versus going cold turkey?  will it be less of a shock to my system?  I just want to quit already, though.

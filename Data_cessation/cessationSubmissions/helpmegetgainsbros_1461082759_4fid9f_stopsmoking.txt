Everything smells bad lol

I haven't smoked now for a week and a day after having been a hard smoker for 10 years. And then I guess I'm proud of myself, though not really, it's the first time I've tried to quit, and it's super easy so far, so... Basically, it doesn't feel like any accomplishment at all, but it still beats having been a smoking idiot for 10 years...

But the fucking smells, man. Did I just forget that summer literally smells like dogshit and sewage? I'm checking my shoes constantly thinking I've stood in dogshit, but no, it's the fucking air... It's kinda funny, to be honest. People bitching about the smell of smoking. Man, smoking was sweet fucking relief from this other bullshit! lol..That's all I really wanted to share.

Anyway, keep it up brothers and sisters. Quitting is pretty damn easy. (Don't call it quitting either, by the way. Read Allen Carr's book.)

Jaw soreness quitting?

Hi all, I am on day 4 of quitting, and I have a withdrawal symptom question.

I smoked for a few years, then dipped for the last year also. This New Years, I vowed off real tobacco and decided to go with gum. I've been slowly phasing it out and stepping down the nicotine dose, chewing my last piece 4 days ago.

My jaw has been very sore starting about 4 hours ago, and it's pretty uncomfortable. Did anyone experience this? How long is it supposed to last?

I feel so much healthier in some ways, but way worse in others haha. It's been hard so far, but I'm really committed to doing it.

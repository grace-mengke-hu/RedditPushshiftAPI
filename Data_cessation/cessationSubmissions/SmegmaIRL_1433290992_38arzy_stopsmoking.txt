Cigarettes make me sick but I keep sparking up

I detest cigarettes. They make me feel sluggish and slow after lighting one up. I always catch myself thinking about negative things when I smoke. I can't finish a whole cigarette anymore, but always find myself lighting one up. I want to quit, but something is always triggering my need to light one. What can I do to reach cessation?

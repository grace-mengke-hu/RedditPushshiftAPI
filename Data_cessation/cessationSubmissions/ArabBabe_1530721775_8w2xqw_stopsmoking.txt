Is anybody else’s addiction as bad as mine?

I smoke because I’m bored, so it’s hard quitting because I’d be bored most of the time. I’m so dependent on cigarettes for comfort and I HAVE NO IDEA WHY!!! literally breathing into a cigarette somehow magically makes all my problems disappear... and it’s so hard to quit

I want it so so so bad even though i’m award how bad it is for me. It is like a war in my mind.

I’m so young, yet it’s got to the point I have to smoke one pack of cigarettes daily (and even then I’ll finish the whole pack in the early evening and have to buy more) 

ALSO it’s gotten to the point where I’ll take the biggest hit, and no smoke comes out anymore,. To the point I don’t even feel like I inhaled anything, and I’m desperately trying to feel the nicotine... where I end up finishing the cigarette in 2 minutes.

Im horribly addicted 
Horribly horribly addicted

What are some other alternatives?? I don’t wanna do the food thing where you munch on carrots to replace your hand to mouth habit. It doesn’t work for me

Also is anyone else’s addiction this bad?

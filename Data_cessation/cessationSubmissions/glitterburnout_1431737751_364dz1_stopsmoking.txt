Quitting for good this time

I've been an on and off again smoker for 10 years. More recently I was smoking half a pack a day and I'm just fed up with everything about it. It's expensive, I smell, I can't breathe when I run, my family hates that I do it and it's just all bad. It's been about 4 days since I decided to quit and quit for good. It's been rough especially at work where I smoked the most but my taste seems to be coming back and my lips don't hurt anymore. I just hope I can make it. Lots of temptation at work with coworkers who smoke and would kindly give me one if I wanted. I'm just trying to focus on that day when I see a cigarette and I will have no desire to light up. Wish me luck!!

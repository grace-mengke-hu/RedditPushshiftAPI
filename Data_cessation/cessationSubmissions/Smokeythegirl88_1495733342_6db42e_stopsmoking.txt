One more, (hopefully) last try...

 I've been a smoker for 14 years, lately I've been smoking a ridiculous amount...1-2 packs a day.
I've tried to stop many times in the very recent past, but I get grumpy and find an excuse to give in, this time has to be it! I just need to get through the first few days (that's what I keep thinking anyway) support and advice are appreciated :)

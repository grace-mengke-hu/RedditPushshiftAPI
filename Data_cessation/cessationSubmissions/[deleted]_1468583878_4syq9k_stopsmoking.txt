I'm a party girl, is there any hope fo me to ever quit? I feel hopeless

So, I'm 22 and I live on an island in europe. Nightlife here never stops and I'm always going to clubs/parties/events and EVERYONE smokes. Men, women, old people, even 13 year old kids. It's crazy.

I've been smoking since I was 17, it used to be a pack every two days, then I cut down to 10 a day, then 5, and eventually stopped smoking on weekdays altogether. 

I don't get cravings during the week AT ALL. Not in the morning or night or after food, (i get them after sex for some reason but I don't give in) 

The smell of cigarettes disgusts me, and it makes me feel sick. I can't stand it and I feel dirty after I smoke but whenever I'm out (usually friday nights or sat nights) I drink and end up smoking like 5 cigarettes, I don't smoke the next day when I'm sober but it seems that whenever alcohol is involved, I CRAVE them and I give in. 

I feel hopeless, I hate cigarettes, I hate their smell/taste but I can't seem to NOT SMOKE. I've had TWO successful weekends with no cigs (I got an e-cigarette and didn't touch actual cigs) but then I stopped using the e-cig and just started smoking at parties.

Is there anyway for me to ever stop? Stopping cold turkey doesn't work for me, cause I tried it over and over and I end up smoking anyway. What do you suggest?

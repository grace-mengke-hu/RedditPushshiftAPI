After 5 months, I still cannot accept the fact that I'll never smoke again.

I'm 5 months in, read Alan Carr's book thrice, and I still cannot accept the fact I'll never smoke again. 

I smoked for 15 years, one pack a day. I have social anxiety and smoking has always been a crutch during social situations, and helped me to cope with depression.

But I don't know, even after 5 months the cravings are still there and it's still a struggle, not every frigging minutes like during the three first  weeks, but it remains very difficult. 

I'm still depressed, gained a ton of weight, and I find it more and more difficult to hang out with my smoking friends. As a consequence I'm lonelier than ever, stuffing my face with junk food when the cravings come and I fucking hate myself. 

Sorry for the rant, but I don't really have a place to vent without being judged for being a "pussy with no willpower" by people who have never been addicted to anything and have the guts to tell you how to deal with addiction. 

I hate Mondays and I want to smoke.

Here is a sample day, this is when I was smoking:

Notice, I went to bed at around 10PM, got up at 7:30am or so, and got only 3.5 hours of solid sleep.

Now, here is when I stopped smoking.

As you can see, the difference is amazing.

To show you consistency, I took a screenshot of some days. You can see light blue color is not a good thing. It means, I sleep light.

While smoking. look at all the light blue!

Amazing, isn't it? 

I stopped smoking and my sleeping changed DRAMATICALLY. This causes you to be more active, because you have more energy since you slept better! It just snowballs from there. You have more energy, you start to excercise and eat heatlhy, in effect, you start looking good and feel good, you drop weight. People start to notice, and that brings your self confidence up. You feel confident, you carry yourself differently...you GET.SHIT.DONE! You dropped weight, you feel good, you smell good, you start to wear nicer fitting clothes...you feel even fucking better! 

Do it...just stop smoking those fucking things. Look at the difference it makes in your life!

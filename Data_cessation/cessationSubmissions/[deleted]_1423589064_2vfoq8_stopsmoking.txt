A little help?

Alright so I've been quit for a while now but recently I've been having a few drags here and there and I just smoked my first whole cigarette in a while. Obviously this counts as a restart on quitting but I'm just finding it super tempting lately. Can I get a little bit of help? I don't want to do patches or gum, nor can I cause I'm 17. I live in a home of tobacco usage (mom smokes, step dad chews) and it makes it difficult. I'm soon moving in with my biological dad a few states away but he smokes too. Can I get some help for how to resist while living with smokers?

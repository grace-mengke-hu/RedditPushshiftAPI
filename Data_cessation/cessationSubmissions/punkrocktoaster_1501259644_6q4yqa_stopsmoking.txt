I just realized it has been 2 1/2 years.

I haven't been on this subreddit in a while. Just wishing everyone trying to quit and big virtual high five! It gets better! I smoked for 15ish years and I haven't had a craving in over a year. I really recommend the Couch to 5k program, bodyweight fitness, or yoga for anyone wanting to pick up a good habit to replace the old one. I have been running for a couple years now and wouldn't have been able to fully quit without it. In the beginning my lungs would give out before my legs and now its the complete opposite. Good luck to all!

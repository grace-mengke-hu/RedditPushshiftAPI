I'm scared to quit smoking

Hi, as the title says, I'm scared to quit smoking. I'm scared I'm going to lose a part of myself. I'm scared I'm going to be a different person. I'm scared of a psychotic relapse. I'm down right terrified and get emotional when I fight with myself about quitting. 

I've smoked for the past 15 years. For the first few years it was socially. Then I had a psychotic episode and found out I have a form of schizophrenia. Cigarettes became my saving grace. Fun fact: About 60% of schizophrenics are smokers, Google says it's more. Odds are not in my favor. 

I want to quit. I have to quit for my father, who just had major surgery in part because of smoking for 45+ years. We nearly lost him twice this past month and I've clung to smoking like a security blanket, spending long days snd nights at the hospital. But I need to quit for him and with him, like I said I would.

Do other people have a fear when they quit smoking? I haven't found many resources about being afraid to quit. It's a gigantic mental roadblock for me. I'm scared of going off the deep end into a spiral of despair.

How do I get over it? 
How did you emotionally prepare to quit smoking?

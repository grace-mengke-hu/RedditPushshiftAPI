Today is the day.

I am getting over a case of Bronchitis...and I'm scared of having cancer.  I've decided today is the day for me.  I went to the doctor and got him to prescribe me Chantix just now.  I haven't had a cigarette since this morning.  I've been using cough drops and will power.  Just wanted to say this to a public that cares.

Thanks.

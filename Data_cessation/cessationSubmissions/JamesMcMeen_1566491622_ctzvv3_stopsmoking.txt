Day SIX of my "Triple Quit!"

To add: I will be x-posting this to /stopdrinking &amp; /leaves, I'm not karma whoring, I don't give a shit about that stuff, I just want to put myself out there. See who can relate, share similar stories and find additional encouragement etc as this truly is the hardest thing I will have ever voluntarily done in my life. Thanks!

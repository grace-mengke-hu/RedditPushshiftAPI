So proud guys

So last week I was ready to go buy a pack because of a work issue that had to be readdressed today to “clear the air” sort of speak. The other party was completely rude and inappropriate, but I kept my cool. I explained myself calmly and rationally while the other acted very uncharacteristically. If I would’ve been smoking, there’s no way in hell that I would’ve been able to maintain composure. No f**king way. So today, I’m very grateful for not smoking just for not getting as agitated as I know I would’ve of been not so long ago. I didn’t even really want a cigarette after it was over. A minor craving but no big deal. Stay strong y’all! We can do this!

The thing about psychedelics

I hope this doesn't come off as a bright eyed hippy fueled monologue on how groovy psychedelics are. If it does, forgive me, but you've been warned.

I've tried to quit by cutting down and by vaping time and time again. On Saturday i dropped acid and realized i'd been killing myself with drinking and smoking and it made absolutely no sense. I stayed up all night, cause acid you know, and in the morning i threw out my tobacco and filters and papers.

Now when i see my friends smoking or smell it or think about it, it doesn't have nearly the same pull as it has since i started smoking four years ago. I get occasional headaches and was tempted to turn to vaping during the third day but, for some reason, after Saturday i just don't think of myself as a person that smokes.

I've noticed a similar effect when i've taken shrooms as well, i just wasn't committed to quitting back then. I was wondering if anyone else had experienced this. I know they're looking in to psychedelics for depression and traumatic experiences, maybe using them as a quitting aid will have results too

Is it unethical to get a loved one to stop smoking?

I care deeply about someone and have wished since the day they started that they would stop. I literally beg them. I know they have the freedom to do what they want but if you're addicted then, I feel, you don't think logically therefore their will to quit doesn't exist fully and they like to live in the naivety that it won't happen to them and they refuse to see the consequences. I love them so much I don't want anything to happen to them.

Do you guys think that I'm being a bit immoral for bugging them to stop all the time and trying to get them to quit?

Be nice in the comments please, I already feel selfish for wanting this so much.

One whole entire year!!

I've saved £3,099, saved my lungs from the effects of SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CIGS (insane!), been able to buy my children all sorts of lovely things, and possibly put on a couple of pounds because everything tastes fucking amazing now 😁 Quitting is the best thing I ever did and without being able to read this sub for support, I might not have made it this far so THANK YOU EVERYONE!! We can all do this!!!

11 days! Scared of triggers tonight

I have 11 days not smoking, yay! I never thought I could make it this far, I initially quit on 1/14 but had a few slip ups so started my count over. Sooo here I am. I am going to my sisters birthday party tonight and I will be drinking, I'm scared I am going to get drunk and smoke.  

I guess my question is, how do you handle being around triggers( other people who smoke, drinking, etc.) ?

Thank you ^-^

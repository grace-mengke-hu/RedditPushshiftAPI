Tight chest and laboured breathing, normal when quitting??

I’m a few days into quitting and my chest feels incredibly tight, almost as if breathing has become difficult. I’m regularly having to inhale deeply and kind of yawning to make myself feel normal ... does this make sense and has this happened to anyone else? It’s just worrying as my breathing and chest feels more laboured than when I was actually smoking!

A few studies you may be interested in

Hi all - 
I thought you might find these two studies interesting. Note: I work for the place that funded these projects but still... I think they are interesting. What do you think? 

* Informing Tobacco-Treatment Guidelines for African American Non-Daily Smokers - http://www.pcori.org/research-results/2014/informing-tobacco-treatment-guidelines-african-american-non-daily-smokers

* Dissemination of Effective Smoking Cessation Treatment to Smokers with Serious Mental Illness - http://www.pcori.org/research-results/2016/dissemination-effective-smoking-cessation-treatment-smokers-serious-mental

Oh yeah, and I used to be a big smoker. Took many, many tries but 
it finally stuck. (constantly getting bronchitis helped make me get my act together)

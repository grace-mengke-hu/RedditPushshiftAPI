Closing in on four months - last couple weeks been coughing up a lot of stuff

A bit confused, went through coughing during the first month, all that good tar and stuff coming out... but now around three and a half months the coughing's come back - tons of phlegm, just sooooo gross. Wondering if this is normal or there's an explanation for this or I might just have a lingering cold?

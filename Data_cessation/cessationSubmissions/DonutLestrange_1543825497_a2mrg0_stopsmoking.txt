Funny night patch wearing..

Just thought I’d share to those of you who have vivid dreams.. your not kidding. I haven’t dreamt in literally years and for the past 2 nights I have.

My subconscious tried to convince me my family only lived in houses shaped like crop circles and the community was having a funeral but only sheltie dogs were allowed to attend (wtf)

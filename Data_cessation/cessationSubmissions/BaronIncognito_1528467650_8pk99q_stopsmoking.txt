The rationalization that’s kicking my ass

I’ve posted a few times before.  In December I had been nicotine free for 1y6m, although I had 2 cigarettes on separate occasions and felt no need to start again. I played with fire a 3rd time and have been smoking half a pack a day ever since.

I’m taking Wellbutrin/Zyban but it hasn’t worked for me like it did last time.  It’s how I quit before my 1y6m streak.   Last time I actually couldn’t keep smoking after 10 days on it because cigarettes tasted so bad I would literally throw up.  That hasn’t happened this time and I’ve been on it for almost 2 months.

So the rationalization that keeps making me mess up is this: every time I get a little streak going my mind says “you’ll never be throwing away this little progress again if you have a few more. “.  So I just keep failing over and over so I can enjoy “just a few more” without throwing away too long a streak.

5th day cold turkey, and I can't stop coughing

So it's now my 5th day without a cig, longest cig free period in a very long time. Yippee. I haven't been feeling too horrible, but yesterday I started coughing up this nasty phlegm type stuff, all day yesterday and now again this morning as well. I don't feel sick at all, it's just this cough which is bringing up some really nasty stuff. Is this due to a lack of cigarettes? Just wondering

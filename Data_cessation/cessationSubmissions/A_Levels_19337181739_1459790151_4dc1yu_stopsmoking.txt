Does smoking actually help relive stress?

I'm 17 and thinking of starting.

I used to play video games for an hour a day, but my parents took it away. I have tried other things to relive stress running, masturbation, sleeping even cooking. I am thinking of trying smoking as I am desperate.

Any advice is appreciated, I am in the UK.

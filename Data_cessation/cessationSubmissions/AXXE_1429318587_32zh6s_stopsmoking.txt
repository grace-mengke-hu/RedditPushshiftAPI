Patterns in cravings

wow, i just experienced one of the most intense cravings i've had this whole time quitting. I've fallen off the wagon after having quit for almost 4 months before, so i know i'm not out of its grip entirely yet. 

it's amazing how my brain connected seemingly disconnected dots to justify my buying a pack of smokes. and seriously, i'm genuinely surprised i haven't caved yet! It's not unordinary for my quits to last 2, maybe 3 weeks and then i'm back at it. so i'm kinda scared and confused and determined at the same time. although my determination is slowly slipping with each passing second the craving lasts. it's like it'll disappear for literally as long as i distract myself and then resurface the chance it gets. 

anyway, just wanted to come and post this bit b/c it would seriously suck to go through all the shit i've been going through during the past 2 weeks AGAIN; the insomnia, and the night sweats.. the cravings, the weight gain (i've been eating like an asshole) all this just sucks ! i don't wanna go down that path so I hope I can remain strong.17 days in...17 days in!

Fourth time lucky?

Hello, 
I'm back for some support here. I've set tomorrow as my FOURTH attempt at quitting. I've decided I'll go through the grind and try to quit. This habit has been irritating me over and over again. I'm not going to try the NRT or the phasing out method this time. I'm going cold turkey and I finally hope to succeed. The problem is, deep on the inside, I'm afraid of withdrawal. The lack of focus, snapping at people, maybe over eating and worst case, buying a smoke and lighting it up. I'm quitting for two reasons. I want to get back in shape and start playing soccer again and for my girlfriend who I think deserves something better than a slightly out of shape chimney. Help guys!

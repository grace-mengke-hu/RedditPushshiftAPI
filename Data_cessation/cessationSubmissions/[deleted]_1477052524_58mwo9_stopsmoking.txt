Almost a week since my last cig.

I quit cold turkey after 9 years of smoking.  I always wanted to quit,  in the back of my head,  but never found the right motivation for me until last Saturday.  

I haven't had any cravings for nicotine,  or any bad ones anyway (I've gone through worse withdrawal symptoms than this from pharmaceutical drugs),  but my issue is getting out of the mental habit.  

I'm such a habitual person.  Make coffee,  take the dog out,  have a smoke.  Take a break from school work,  have a smoke.  It's been really difficult to deal with the habit part,  more than anything.  I can handle the craving for nicotine,  but my minds desire for routine is killing me. 

Anyone have any suggestions to combat this?

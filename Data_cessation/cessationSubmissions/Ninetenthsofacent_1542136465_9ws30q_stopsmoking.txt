Massive anxiety (If you want to call it that?)

I had to go cold turkey (allergic I think to both gum and patch, doctors and I couldn't figure it out) but yeah, here I am, 22 hours in and for the last 2 hours I have just been hit wave after wave with anxiety and almost like a fear type feeling.  I'm assuming at some point here I might get depressed, or have that type of thing, but for right now, I've tried to walk on the treadmill downstairs, which worked until it didn't, I had a pretty decent panic attack (and having dealt with anxiety earlier in life I thought I'd be able to cope better) and now I'm about to head outdoors for a similar adventure.  I wasn't quite a pack a day smoker... but I'm just curious if anyone has had this and can share their own story or words of wisdom, because I feel like I'm going crazy at moments, like I'm just going to "lose it" and start freaking out.  

So yeah, I'm doing great.

Thanks!

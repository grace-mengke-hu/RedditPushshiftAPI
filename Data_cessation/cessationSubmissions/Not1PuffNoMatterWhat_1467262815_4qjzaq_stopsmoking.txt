3 Month Checkin and Thank you

3 months smoke free, and wanted to say thanks to everyone on this SR for sharing so freely and helpfully. To the smart@ss who told me not to smoke a hookah, thank you. And to the people who have shared stories of triumph and failure, I continue to learn from you. Thank you. This is a really special SR to me, and it keeps me going strong, functions as an accountability forum for me, and encourages me when the cravings come-and they still do. I manage by coming here and reading. 

As a newbie quitter, my top five tools have been: 

1) hard candy, gun, and mints
2) this subreddit
3) walking (sometimes furiously, looking like a maniac) 
4) meditation with a simple mantra ("I am fortunate and grateful and proud to be a non-smoker" is mine bc all three statuses mean something different and positive, but whatever works for you. Say it over and over in your head when you have a craving)
5) telling other people-it makes you less likely to slip. 

So, basically, if you see a crazy woman walking down the street speed walking and talking to herself saying the same thing over and over while aggressively chewing gum, introduce yourself to me! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™ˆ

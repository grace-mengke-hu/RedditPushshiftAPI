How many people succeed their 1st try?


I didn't give it much thought when I quit, it was just spontaneous. 

Someone asked to bum a smoke, I opened my pack to only one left, and gave it away. "They said are you sure?" Since it was my last one. I said "Take it, I quit." And they just laughed at me. 

Was feeling great till about 24 hours l8r, then I got some serious cravings. And started looking for help which has led me here. 

I already consider myself a nonsmoker but Im only 3 days in. Do you believe I am doomed to fail or is it common for people to quit their first attempt?

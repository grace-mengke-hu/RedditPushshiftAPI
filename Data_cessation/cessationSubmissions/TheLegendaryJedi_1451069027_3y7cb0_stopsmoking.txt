Does passive smoking affect quitters?

Hey!
I have quit smoking 13 days ago and since some of my friends are heavy smokers, I'd like to know if passive smoking affects how hard it is to quit. What I mean is I'm curious if passive smoking triggers the brain the way active smoking does.

Edit: Thank you for your answers, I'm glad it doesn't make you crave more but still, I will try not to be around those friends when they are smoking.

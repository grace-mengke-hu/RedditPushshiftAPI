33 years-

That's how long I've smoked, since I was 14.   Quit when I was pregnant, went  back both times after weaning.  Quit on Chantix last year then went back.   I need to start exercising and lose a little weight and I've been seriously thinking about quitting for a year now knowing I needed to but as much as I hated it, I loved it.  I *liked* smoking.   I hated being short of breath and not wanting my clients to smell smoke on me, hated the money I've spent on cigarettes over the years.  And yet, they were my companion when my son was arrested, as he fought his own addiction issues, was in and out of rehab.  Just knowing I could light up a cigarette when things got bad was a relief all on it's own.  

 I've smoked through colds and the flu and bronchitis, but this week when I got sick (just common cold), something in me didn't want to smoke.   Today is 3 days without smoking.   All the ashtrays have been tossed, I have an unopened pack that hasn't even really tempted me until now, I want one, just one, just a drag.   But I'm not going to.   I'm not trying to quit, I've already quit.   Already, it's so much easier to breathe that I'm amazed.   I keep telling myself, you can do this, just wait a few more minutes, you can do this.

5 months to the day and...

I feel sick, exhausted, stressed, depressed, bloated, irritable, overworked, underpaid, lonely, bored, frustrated, lazy, hungry, asthmatic, whiney (if you can't tell), and SO EFFING HAPPY AND GRATEFUL I NO LONGER SMOKE!

For real: the best thing on this day when I feel bad in all sorts of ways is that at no time did I want to smoke. If you're at this point, congratulations! For those of you just starting out, I know this seems impossible, but you can get here. It's a good place to be. 

Take care, everyone in the ether!

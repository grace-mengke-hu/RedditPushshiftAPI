I've been sick since I stopped smoking

So it's been about a month since I officially stopped smoking, I sort of eased into it, smoking less and less till finally stopping altogether, but I've been sick for about a month too. My head is clogged up and most of the time I can hardly hear out of my left ear, some days it clears up a bit though. on top of that I generally have low energy and i'm super depressed, not sure if any of it's related so I thought I would ask if any of you had similar experiences with quitting?

Four Years and still going strong!

I honestly can't believe I actually have stopped smoking this long. I won't lie there are a couple times once in a while that I might want to hookah or smoke, but then I just remind myself that one puff will get me back to the beginning and starting to smoke again. 

Stay strong out there, even if you do cave it took 10+ attempts for me to finally be done with it. You will know when it's time just keep trying.

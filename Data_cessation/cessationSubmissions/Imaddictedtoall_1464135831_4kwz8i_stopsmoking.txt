I've always wanted to visit Australia

I'm nor sure if a post like this belongs here, mostly because it's just some thoughts, but here it goes:


It has always been a huge dream of mine to go to Australia and find a shitty job during their summer. 

Then I found about how it's hard for smokers to live there and _enjoy_ smoking, you aren't allowed to smoke in bars, you have to distance yourself from your table (even if it's outdoors!) and cigarettes are really, really expensive. 

The conclusion: _Well, I guess I'll pick some other place_

You know what? I won't. I'll quit smoking. I can't believe something that harmful is controlling me this much. It's not ok, it's not normal, it's unnatural.

I'll get to Australia one day, maybe even with money saved from not smoking cigarettes. I quit today!

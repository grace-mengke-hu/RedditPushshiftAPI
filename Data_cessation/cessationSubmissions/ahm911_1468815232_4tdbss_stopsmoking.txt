Update on quitting been over a year now

With you guys i shared my first month post stopping.. here https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/363r3d/1_month_quit_by_coincidence/

Now its been a year and a couple months! I still have a cigar here and there for celebratory purposes but no cigarettes! I also am signed up for s half marahon in october and my training is ahead of schedule! 

To whoever is thinking about it, i wish you the best of luck. It feels great and the idea is to really replace it with something else and altering the enviroment. 

For me the hardest times where when partying with friends or being ona  beach or camping to fill in the slow time, but break the cycle once and the rest is power of will.. Goodluck :)

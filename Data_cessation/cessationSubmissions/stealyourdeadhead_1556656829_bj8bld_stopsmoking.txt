Vaping almost feels like I’m cheating my way through quitting?

I’ve been able to cut back from 24mg on quit day down to 6mg, after almost 2 months. Is anyone else using a vape to quit? I’m afraid I’m just replacing the habit, so those of you who have used a vape, how long did it take to stop using it completely or cut down to 0mg comfortably? I’m trying to leave it out of my sight as much as possible at this point. I know I’ll never go back to smoking just based on the changes I’ve already seen and the money saved, but this feels like a cop out, because it’s still kind of like smoking.

I have to quit.

I grew up around a lot of people who smoked like freight trains. My mother, grandmother, father, one of my two brothers as well as my best friend as early as age 12. I never in my childhood went a single day without seeing at least 3 separate people who were close to me light one up.

I suppose its a miracle that I made it to 16 years before I started myself. Woe is me that I started with roll your owns as well. Actual roll your owns, not the little machine that you insert pre-made filtered tubes into, no, big old, honking hand rolled cigarettes.

This went on for about 2 years, until I was old enough to purchase my own tobacco, at which point I attempted to move to regular packs of cigarettes, they worked for a while but were never as satisfying as the roll your owns were.

"They just don't hit hard enough. They don't even give me a buzz on the first drag of the day." I told my friends, one of them suggested I try a smoke-pipe, which is what he used when at home. I agreed and he and I drove over 40 miles to the nearest  head shop at the time and that very same day and I picked out the pipe I've smoked tobacco from 20+ times a day, every day for the last 8 years.

The lowest I ever got was when I was so poor that I had to dig through supermarket ashtrays, sniping shorts that were worth unrolling and dropping into my pipe to sustain my habit.. It was shameful at the time, but I didn't think twice about doing it.

I don't know how I'm going to quit, but I have to. It takes very little to get me winded, I can feel and hear myself developing a wheeze and the coughing fits are beginning to result in blood droplets.

Any tactics that anyone might be able to provide would be much appreciated, I'm coming up on 24 hours without a smoke, which is a truly terrible feeling. 

This is my first time truly trying to quit, I've been wrestling with the decision for a while now and I believe I'm mentally ready to kick the habit, but some extra help can never hurt.

Thanks.

Having this sub in my feed has helped me cut back from a pack a day to a half over the last 4 days. I just tell myself "wait a little longer" or occupy myself with small DIY projects. 

Hopefully soon, I can just kick it all together. I've been smoking since I was 8. Its time to knock it off and grow up.

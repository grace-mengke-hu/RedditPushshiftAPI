Day four and my personality has somewhat changed...

I'm not craving cigarettes at all.  I still hate them.  Stopped cold turkey after about 15 years of smoking.  

The thing is - my personality (which is usually very easy going and polite) has changed to an unholy beast-demon that will instantly attack anyone who talks to me in real life.  

Right now, I'm sitting alone.  It's best for everyone around me if I do so.  Only one thing - I work on a cattle station in the middle of Australia.  My work-mates and I all live in the same camp - about 200 km's away from the nearest town.  It's us, and the outback.  That's all there is here. 

I am also the only non-smoker here now.

I feel so bad for being an asshole to them.  I know things will get better.

Still, the lack of cravings is kinda weird, and I do enjoy a challenge.

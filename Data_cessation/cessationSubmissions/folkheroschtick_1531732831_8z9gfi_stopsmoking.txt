Quitting as a ‘social’ smoker

I currently only smoke when I drink (usually 1-2 nights per week), but when I do, I smoke huge amounts and always wake up regretting it. I have zero desire to smoke when sober, but as soon as a drink hits my lips, the cravings hit. 

A few years ago, I quit for 18 months after reading the Allen Carr book. Then I moved interstate at the beginning of last year and started social smoking straight away. It’s not that I made new friends who smoke, as I used to hang out with smokers after I quit and had no problem. I am just finding it so hard to stop this time.

I’m about 2/3 through the book again but it’s taking me forever to finish it (compared to a week last time). I go through phases of being desperate to stop and then not caring at all. I can’t work out what is different this time. Does anyone else have this problem?

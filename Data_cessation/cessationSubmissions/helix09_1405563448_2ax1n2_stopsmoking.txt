After 6 years of smoking, starting my journey today!

Frankly, not the best time to quit smoking since I am under extreme pressure. But, I'll always have excuses so might as well do it. 

Any pointers on what I can do when I get the urge? Also, last time i tried quitting, I was hungry all the time. Hope, I get through that as well!

Today I woke up so disappointed!!!

Today I woke up feeling awful! I had dreamed I smoked and had to reset my clock ! I was so mad at myself , the dream was so real ! I could actually feel the smoke going into my lungs and the disappointment that I was smoking . What I’m happy about is s that it was a dream ! Today I’m going to remember how that felt when I have a craving to motivate me ! 21 days smoke free !!!

Seeing as I can't trust myself...

I posted this as a response in a couple ways so far.  This morning was a horrible morning failure.  I not only failed, but started the, "I'm so weak, I'm so worthless, I can't do it..." whining to myself.  I mean seriously...  Am I going to turn around and start blaming Marlboro for my addiction now?  I was US Army for 7 years. During that time, I never once backed down from a challenge.  I never whined that I couldn't do it.  I never blamed anyone but myself if I failed to reach my goals.  So why should I start now?!?  That being said these are my thoughts:

I smoked one this morning. Now, I've decided that I'm going to take my stress, frustration, anger, and the other emotions caused by quitting, and direct them at myself in the form of determined disappointment. 
After all, I have no reason to be mean to other people about quitting, when I'm the dummy that did it in the first place. Lol! 
So, basically, I'm quitting because I'm not going to sit here and be an idiot anymore.

I hope this mindset helps. I have decided I'm not going to sit here and feel like a helpless child drowning in water anymore. I'm getting mad, and I'm going to beat myself into submission if I have to.

I WILL NOT FAIL!

And for any one that is Active duty or a US Army Vet...  HOOAH!

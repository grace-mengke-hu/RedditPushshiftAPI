Day #4 and this shit sucks.

Edit* just realized my title is almost identical to another posters from today :D we’re all in this together and it makes me feel good that we can all relate to one another. 

I don’t crave cigarettes like I have been but man the physical pains are bullshit! My neck is so stiff, my throat and chest are killing me, and it just makes me hate the smokes more. So happy to finally be free, and I can’t wait to feel better than I ever have! I love this sub, thank you all for always being so encouraging. I love watching everyone’s progress.

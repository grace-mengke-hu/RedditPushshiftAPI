Have any of you guys started running? What kind of improvement did you see?

So I quit my e-cig a little over a month ago. I'm going from total nerd who never bothered to any physical activity, to setting a goal of running a 5K.... Soonish. About a week ago I manged to get a mile without walking. Even hitting a mile is hard, and that's at about a 10 minute mile. I'm trying to run every three days at least.

/r/running while helpful as it is, just said to slow down the last time I asked for help (about a year ago). Do any of you guys have some recommendations? Is running a 5K by spring doable? Does anyone have a realistic idea on how long it might take to do a half marathon?

Thanks!

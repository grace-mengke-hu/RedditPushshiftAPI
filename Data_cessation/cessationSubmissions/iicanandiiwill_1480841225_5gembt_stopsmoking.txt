Last one, had enough of this

Well I've been smoking about 7 years now and I'm done with it, I'm promising myself that after today I will become smoke free. I'm tiered of watching myself slowly die and I'm tiered of seeing my family living in pain for the fact that their son/brother is killing himself slowly. Thankful I found this sub Reddit, wish me luck, I pray that all of us beat this cancer.

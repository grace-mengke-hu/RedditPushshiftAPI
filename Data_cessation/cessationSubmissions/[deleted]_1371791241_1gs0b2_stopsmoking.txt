You guys must be getting this a lot but, today, I'm quitting.

Heya everyone. I peeked around the subreddit for 'guides' and tips on how to make it through at least the tobacco free day but couldn't find anything. 

I've been smoking for around three years now and it's finally enough. I'm tired of my room smelling like shit at the end of the day, of not getting enough sleep because of respiratory problems, of burning my finger every 30 minutes to crush that cigarette butt. I've been trying to delay the time where I'd quit, using my severe depression as an excuse along with the fact that my mother smokes constantly and it'd make it too hard. But today's the day I finally try and get better, at least in that part of my life. 

Now, I'm diving into this headfirst and quitting cold turkey, as I know it's the only real way to do it; that decision has to be based on reflection and then impulse. Now, I'm wondering what I can do to make things easier when the cravings start happening... My first plan is to do a series of pushups/squats/situps whenever a craving happens, and keep drinking water over and over. Has anyone here tried a similar method? It might help with the physical feeling, though I'm not sure how 'up here' will react. 

Anyways... Just wanted to make a post, to mark my first day of being free. It's been about an hour since I threw the last one away, half smoked, and I do feel a bit empowered, though scared.

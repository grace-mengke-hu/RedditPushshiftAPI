welp, tonights the night..

its 10:33PM where I live. I get off work at 11PM. im going straight to the gas station, grabbing a pack of marlboro 27s, and proceeding to the bar. Im going to have a drink, or two, or three, and chainsmoke the pack down to 1 final cigarette to keep as a reminder of the ball and chain i (hopefully) freed myself from. wish me luck. will return tomorrow with updates on how my first day (starting tomorrow morning) went fighting off urges.

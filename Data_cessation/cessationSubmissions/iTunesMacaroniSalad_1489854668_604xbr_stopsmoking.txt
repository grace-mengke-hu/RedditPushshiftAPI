Trying to quit

On spring break visiting the family, left my cigs back home where I go to school but still wound up getting cigs a couple nights ago when I went to a bar :/  

Returning back to school today and I KNOW I am going to want to smoke when I get back since I have an open pack on my counter.  Man, I really don't think I can fully quit.  I keep rationalizing it bc I only smoke "two or three a day" but that usually winds up being five or more if I go drinking.  Occasionally I'll have a chain smoking day and go through half a pack.  Hoping to get some motivation by posting in this community.   Thanks.

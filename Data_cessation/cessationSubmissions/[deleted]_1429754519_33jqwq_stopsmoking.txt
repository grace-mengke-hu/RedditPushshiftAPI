Occasional cigarette?

So I'm a [20M] in university and this particular semester has been extremely rough. Due to this difficulty I bought my first pack of cigarettes two months ago. 

I don't smoke regularly, but I average about 3 a week. Normally when I need to stay up late to study, or do homework. The habit hasn't become a problem yet, and I plan on giving it up as soon as the semester finishes.

My question to all of you is how bad is smoking the pack (I assume after finals I'll only have 1 or 2 left in it) for me? And to further urge my giving them up did any of you start off in a situation like mine, and if so what happened? Thanks.

TL;DR Occasional smoker plans to quit; advice? 

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who commented, when I first posted this I thought "I am the exception, I only smoke when I decide to; not socially." At first even after reading the majority of comments that was still my mindset, but a couple of days after posting I got severely stressed and my only thought was how bad I wanted a cigarette. I've since realized that because I haven't begun smoking regularly I can still say no; but if I allow it to progress any further I'll begin falling. For this reason I thank all of you for helping make a difference. I've just thrown the remainder of the pack away and I don't plan on picking up another again.

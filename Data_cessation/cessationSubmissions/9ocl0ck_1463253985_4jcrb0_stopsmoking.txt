40 hours.

I had my wisdom teeth removed yesterday and stopped smoking 12 hours before surgery as I was asked to. For weeks I've been planning on using this surgery as the jump off to quit for good. I have smoked a pack a day for about ten years until now. This is the longest I have gone without smoking in at least 3 years. Today nobody wants to be around me because I can't stop being irritable. I'm lying in bed in tears and have been all day. I'm frustrated and I feel so alone right now. I'm going to take some more vicodin and keep crying I guess. If I leave the house I'm going to wind up fucking up. Today sucks.

But you know what? I've never tried this goddamn hard in my life. And that's something.

Edit: 48 hours! I can't believe I did it! I know tomorrow is gonna be hellish. I'm just gonna keep taking it easy. I was getting down on myself for not using my day off to clean house or work on my music but I think I need to just make not smoking #1 priority right now and not beat myself up over anything else I may or may not do.

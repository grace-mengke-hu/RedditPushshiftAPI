Having difficulty taking deep breaths after laying down. I've quit for 2 months. Has anyone else had this issue?

I'm in over 2 months now, I've been working out 3 times a week, but I'm still having some breathing issues. Although most of the time I feel MUCH better, after I take a nap, my lungs still feel heavy and although it's not hard to breath compared to when I was smoking, I feel it is hard to take a deep breath.

After an hour or two of being up and around, this feeling goes away and I'm able to breath fine, but if I were to try to run after taking a nap or waking up in the morning, it would be impossible.

Has anyone else had this issue? I'm fearing the worst.

This time last year I smoked my last cigarette. It was around 8 am when I did it, standing outside in the cold fall air. I just had enough. 

The past year has been tough at times, more in life stuff than in not smoking. 

To be perfectly honest, the thought of smoking almost never passes my mind and when it does it passes quickly.

Thank you all in this sub for the support over these 12 months. I hope I can give you the same strength in your journey into a smokeless life.

e: thank you everyone for your kind words again!

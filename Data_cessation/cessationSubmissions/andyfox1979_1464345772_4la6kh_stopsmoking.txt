20 Days Quit, Overseas, Finding Myself Rationalizing Reasons To Have A Smoke

Let me start by saying that I don't want to be a smoker again, that said, I do feel like I want to have a few cigarettes. 

I'm in Saigon, Vietnam on business, its rainy outside, the main sports here are hanging out in bars or coffee shops, I have been thinking about smoking for about 3 days, prior to that I didn't think about it much at all. 

I guess I feel like i'm not letting myself go out or have fun because I know i'll want to smoke, and yet, much of my brain does not want to smoke at all. 

I'm pretty sure that if I have some smokes tonight I'll be back where I started tomorrow, and I hate that I can't control myself. 

Anyhow, just venting. Quitting smoking is easy, staying quit is hard.

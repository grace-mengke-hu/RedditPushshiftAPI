Need to stop, finally determined.

Found this subreddit while looking for ways to stop smoking. I needed some motivation so I want to post my story, as I started cutting back today. I normally smoke close to a pack of cigarettes a day for the past 10+ years, I am only on 2 smokes so far today when I would normally have had 4 or more by now. 

I plan to spread out the few I have left in my pack for today and tomorrow ( I think I only have like 3 or 4 more left in there) and go completely smoke free by the first of June, or before, if I run out sooner. I'm broke and so tired of smoking and I have no reason to buy another pack. 

So far I'm keeping the urges at Bay with sunflower seeds, soda and Starbursts. Anyone have any great small snacks like sunflower seeds to help keep me occupied when I'm wanting to smoke? Any car smokers have any good advice? I think the one I'm gonna have the most problems with is my morning cigarette while I'm driving into work. Any advice helps :)

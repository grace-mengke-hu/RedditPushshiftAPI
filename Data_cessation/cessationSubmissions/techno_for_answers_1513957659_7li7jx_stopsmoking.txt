Gearing up to quit

I quit after reading Carr’s book and stayed quit for 6 months after 15 years of the habit. Quitting was easy with little withdrawal and no coughing. I’ve been back at it for over a year now and I’m convinced I’m going to die whether I stop or not. It’s awful to have this level of anxiety and feel like I doomed myself at an early age. Regardless, I have to stop to know I am at least trying to be the best me I can be. 

This community was helpful then and I know you guys &amp; gals will be supportive now. 

I can go all day at work without one but as soon as I’m in the car or at home I pick it up. I’m a closet smoker so Home is the only place I’m comfortable smoking. My plan while I’m off is to learn how to be home without stepping outside and picking one up. My quit date is 12/26 and then I’ll have over a week to adapt to being smoke free. 

Can anyone lend advice about how to navigate the boredom at home that triggers my urge to smoke? I need a mindless activity that I can focus on in lieu of smoking. I considered coloring or picking up needlepoint, but I tend to get antsy sitting. 

I look forward to joining you all on the side of freedom very soon.

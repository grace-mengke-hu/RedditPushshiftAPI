It's been three years!

Today is the 3rd anniversary of my quit date and to celebrate I'm being taken out for a meal tonight by my boyfriend. Because it's awesome. 

Quitting has meant that I've had to spend less time worrying about finding ways and time to smoke and have stayed warmer and drier. People are way less rude to me in the street (not that they should have been in the first place...). I have saved so much money and I'm using it to pay the fees for a masters degree to develop my career and continue making my life better. 

I smoked for 9 years from the age of 14. For a significant proportion of that time fairly heavily, up to 20-30 a day. It has been very hard, but I can chalk this up as another personal achievement and feel really good about it. 

For everyone just starting out, STICK WITH IT. A lot of days are going to feel difficult but it's totally worth it for days like this where you can feel proud of yourself because the cumulative weight of all those 'not todays' eventually adds up to entire years. 

This sub is an amazing, supportive and positive place. I love reading through people's stories and am really proud of everyone because we're all trying so hard. Go us.

Drinking again WITHOUT smoking???

Has anyone been able to reestablish drinking wine or whatever you enjoy WITHOUT smoking? I suddenly had this huge fear crop up that what the heck am I going to do when I do try drinking again? I love to drink a bottle of white with my lady friend and laugh and carry on one once or twice a month. And I don't have a problem with not drinking for a year or so... it's just I'm soooo afraid that when I finally do... WILL I FAIL AGAIN? I know this is way in the future but drinking has always been my downfall in starting to smoke again! If anyone has some ideas I REALLY need to hear them. Thanks so much!!!

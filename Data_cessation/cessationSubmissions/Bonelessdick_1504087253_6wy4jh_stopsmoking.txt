Tobacco free cigarettes?

I think I am more addicted to the motion of
lighting one up and smoking it. Because I have a vale and all though I got a head rush at 3mg and the focus and rush, something was missing.

Is there fake cigarettes available with like organic paper and no tobacco? Someone should do that if not already. 

cheers

Alright guys I'm at 7 months now without cigarettes and I don't feel the need for them at all anymore. I'll tell you how I did it, it may help you.

Alright so this may not work for everyone. First of all, you've got to have the willpower, you've got to want to quit otherwise it just won't work. You've got to drum it into your head that you're a drug addict, that craving you get, like a piece of you is missing - that's your dirty drug addiction kicking it, wanting it's fix. 

I decided one day I was fed up smoking 20 a day, smelling like shit and being dependent on this stupid fucking drug that other people could easily live without. 

I used nicotine patches, some say these don't work but they really worked for me. You have to go on them for the specified amount of time. Don't give them up early, it's like 2 months. 

Slap a patch on, the highest dosage, and the first couple of days will be hard, but not as hard without the patches. If you've got a craving - make yourself a cuppa or chew some gum. 

After a month or so of the patches some days I'd totally forget to put one on! I kept going until I was officially off them but it wasn't a big deal, because I'd got out of the idea that my life revolved around cigarettes. 

Sorry this is long I just want to drop in now and again to see if I can help someone. I never thought I would be able to live without smoking. But then I realised that other people have enriched lives without needing them, intact - their lives were better! They were healthier, wealthier and they didn't smell like a fucking ash try. 

Honestly, if you're struggling cold turkey, slap a patch on, stick it through, no giving up because you honestly don't need it. If you're reading this and contemplating it... FUCKING DO IT NOW! Don't be a slave to your drug addiction.

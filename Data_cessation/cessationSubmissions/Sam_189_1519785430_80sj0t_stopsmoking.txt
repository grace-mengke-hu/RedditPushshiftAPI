"It gets easier" ... Okay, when?

63 days and it's only getting *harder*. The first few weeks were a breeze. Now that the weather is getting really nice, all I've wanted to do for the past few days is go outside and smoke. I would have already had one and probably started full-on smoking again if I wasn't pregnant. That's really the only reason I haven't picked it up again. I really don't care about my health that much, but I do care about hers. I hope it actually gets "easier" by the time she's born or else I can seriously see myself becoming a smoker again...

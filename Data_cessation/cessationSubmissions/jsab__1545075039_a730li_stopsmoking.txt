Nrt to stop e- cigarettes

Hi everyone I'm trying to stop vaping and I have issues. I've been able to reduce the chain vaping but unfortunately I still can't stop cold turkey.
I went today to the pharmacy to pick up nicotine patches but I have been told that the amount of nicotine will be too high. the pharmacist told me that any nicotine replacement products would deliver and amount of nicotine major than what I get vaping.
I'm not sure because I paid quite a lot but she didn't want to sell them to me.
I can always try different pharmacy but I wanted to hear your opinion.
I do understand that many people don't like NRT but I still would like to try.

Thanks a lot

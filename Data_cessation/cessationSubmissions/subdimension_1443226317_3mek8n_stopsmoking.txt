As of right now I'm done smoking.

Day 1 starts here. I'm tired of risking cancer, being out of breath, smelling awful and couting like I have the plague. I always procrastinate and say I'll quit when I've finished these or on Monday and that kind of attitude is never going to work, I want to quit so I'm throwing out my half finished pack right now. Stay strong everyone you can do it.

How can I help my mother stop smoking?

My mother has been smoking for many years now. She's quit before when she was younger, and for a long time, but it's been a while since then, and she hasn't been clean for about 8 years.

I try to help her, but I never approach it the right way. She wants to quit.  
She feels guilty on account of the money it costs the family and the toll it takes on her health.

She says when I approach her, she feels even more guilty, being reminded of what she's doing. I don't want to make her feel guilty. I don't mean to. What I'm doing isn't working, and I realize that. I want to do better.

I know I can't force her to stop, and I'm not trying to force her. Only she can make that decision, but I want to be there to help and support her.

How should I go about doing this? Are there any good resources online?

Thank you, friends.

How long will I be so annoyed?

I haven't smoked in years.  But I quit drinking a little over 4 months ago, and when I did, I started chewing nicotine gum.  Dumb, I know.  I've been chewing 4-5 of the 2 mg pieces a day.  Not as much as a full on smoker like I was back in 1997 when I quit, but I don't want to be addicted to nicotine.  I had my last piece sometime last night.

I know how to ride out cravings.  But man oh man I am feeling REALLY ANNOYED.  I mean, holy shiznit am I cranky.

I thought I wasn't ingesting enough to make a huge difference, but I was clearly wrong.  How long on average does this FECKING IRRITATION last?

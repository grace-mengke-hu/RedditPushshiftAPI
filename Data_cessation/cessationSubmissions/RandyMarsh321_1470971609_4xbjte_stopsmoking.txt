Thoughts on replacing cigarettes with chewing tobacco.

I smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 10 years and recently decided to give it up. I started using the patch but it kept falling off so I decided to use smokeless tobacco products. (Copenhagen Wintergreen) I'm on day 9 no smoking but have been going through a can of chew daily. I figure this will be a good starting point and might have an easier time quitting chewing tobacco. Was wondering if anybody has any experience substituting smokeless tobacco for cigarettes or any thoughts?

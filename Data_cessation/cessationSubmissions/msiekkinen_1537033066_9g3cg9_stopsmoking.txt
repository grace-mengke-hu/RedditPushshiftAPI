Day 7 - Still night sweats, insomnia, feeling tired by noon on nights I did get sleep and woke up feeling refreshed (20 year smoker)

How long did it take you to get past all these?

For night sweats I'm sleeping on a towel so I can quickly throw that off to try to go back to sleep quickly on the dry sheets below, keep a smaller and towel to wipe down arms/chest.

For insomia I've given up trying to go to bed at 10 or whatever, instead take 3 bendryll and do what ever until I start to feel tired (usually around midnight or 1; beats lying there for hours)

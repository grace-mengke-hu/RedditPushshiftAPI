A month clean, but feel awful.

So as the title says I’m a month clean which is alright I went from smoking 20-30 roll-ups a day to quitting cold turkey using the easy way book which is great. But it’s now well 5 weeks but my emotions are still all over the shop, I’m lashing out at people still and generally being argumentative which I feel intensely guilty for afterwards but pride prevents me from apologising. Then when I’m home alone I feel awful and intensely sad at moments I don’t have the urge to smoke anymore but everything I’ve read suggests these feelings should have long passed by now. I guess I’m wondering if these feelings will pass or if I should seek further help either way I know I’m not going to smoke again.

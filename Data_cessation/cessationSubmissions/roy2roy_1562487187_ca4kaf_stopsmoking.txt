Needing some help right now

So, it's been 7 months now.   


But this last month has just been a constant craving. I'm craving far more than I'm not and it's starting to feel like a losing battle. I haven't gone back yet and don't think it's quite bad enough to actually get me to start again quite yet but the daily cravings are getting pretty shitty.  


Any advice?

Anybody got positive results to show for that nervous energy of nic withdrawal?

So Far:
 
* I've done a major closet clean-out/reorganization, including a GoodWill run.

* Cleaned out/reorganized the sunroom.

* Vacuumed more often; cooking, grocery shopping, staying on top of the dishes.

* Have been making my bed EVERY morning right when I get up, instead of going out for a smoke.

* Cleaned out all the drawers in the bathroom, put down contact paper, and reorganized in a way that everything fits and has a place.

* Staying on top of laundry... folding and putting away right away.

I just have all this nervous energy, and don't know what to do to take a break from things now that I don't smoke. I'm sure I'll settle down when I'm completely free of withdrawal, but I have to say I'm pleased with the way my house is shaping up due to nic withdrawal, lol.

Anybody else have positive results from their nervous energy???

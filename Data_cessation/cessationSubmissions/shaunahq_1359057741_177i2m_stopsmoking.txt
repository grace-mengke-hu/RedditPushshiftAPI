It's been over one year!

I didn't realise it has been so long! I came on her to check how many days my badge said and really can't believe it's been so long. 
  If you're just starting out and finding it hard all i can say is STICK AT IT. I found it such a srtuggle at the begining. But, one day you'll wake up and realise it has been over a year and the sence of acomplishment is second to none.

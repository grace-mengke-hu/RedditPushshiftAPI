Is cutting down a good first step?

So, I went to the dentist recently and had to have quite a bit of work done - partly because of smoking. Anyway, I had a cigarette beforehand and then I got some patches and applied one almost immediately having left the dentists. Its now been three days since the dentist. I have had one cigarette a day for the last 3 days and just applied the patch after I got out of the shower in the mornings.

1 a day is a serious cut down from 15-20 and I'm pleased with my efforts but I'm sad and angry at everyone still.

So, my question is, is cutting down a good place to start?

One week strong

One week has gone by without a cigarette. I feel great. I only had withdrawal symptoms on the first day, but since then, I haven't even wanted a cigarette. When I see people smoking, rather than telling myself "man, I wish I could be with 'em right now lighting one up", as I told myself at my previous quit over the summer, I'm just happy to no longer be in their position. Especially considering that it's getting prety dang cold here in Canada. 

Honestly, it's easier than I expected. If you're in the process of quitting, don't forget that you aren't giving anything up; you're only gaining time, money, and most importantly, health. 

(Can you gain health? I dunno. You know what I mean)

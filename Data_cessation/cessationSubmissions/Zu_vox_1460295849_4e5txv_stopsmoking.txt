Toothpicks

So I quit smoking yesterday, started chewing nicorette gum and having a toothpick in my mouth all the time, as to replace the cigarette. Tastes bad and the texture is fairly unpleasant, so I ask of you, /r/stopsmoking, do you have any suggestions to what I could break or replace the "cigarette routine"?

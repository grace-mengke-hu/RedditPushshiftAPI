Finished Stop Smoking with Allen Carr Last Night

Timed it so that my Final Cigarette was a few minutes after midnight. I'm going on 11 hours without a cig. I've had minor bouts of frustration throughout my work day so far but nothing I've never faced before. This isn't my first time quitting, either. The last 2 attempts I made to Day 3 before I fell apart. What made it worse was having roommates that smoked. But now they're gone, so I don't have them to use as an excuse for falling off anymore. I guess what makes this time easier is the knowledge that it's all fear that's keeping me from quitting; the fear that I'm "giving up" something or that life is gonna suck without being able to smoke. "Stop Smoking" put a different spin on quitting smoking for me, and it's really helping me cope. I'm not like a lot of folks who finish reading and are like "WOOHOO, I'M DONE WITH SMOKING FOREVER! F*"CK YOU, CIGARETTES!!!". I'm more like "As long as I can get through today I'm good. I'll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow". But overall, I'm confident this is the last time I'll quit. The record is 6 weeks. I want to at least double that. We'll see how it goes....

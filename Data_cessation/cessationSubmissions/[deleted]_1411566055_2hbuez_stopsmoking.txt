It's enough! Stopping today.

Okay a little backstory for you guys:

I've been smoking for 9 years. I started when i was 15 and now I'm 24. 

I've never been a heavy smoker and the most i smoked was probalby 10 cigs per day. Sadly this changed two weeks ago when i went on vacation with a few friends. In this time I smoked nearly 2packs per day and at the end of the trip i bought ten packs because compared to germany the cigs in croatia are pretty cheap.

I smoked the last cigarett of these ten packs 5 minutes ago and I'm already craving for another. It's insane! In just two weeks i nearly tripled my intake! I'm coughin all day, my lungs feel like shit and i 
noticed some really extreme effects on my stamina. 

One of my problems is that I like to smoke weed (3-4 times per month). It helps me relax and i prefer it over alcohol. Here in Germany it's common to mix it with tobacco if you're smoking a joint and that pretty much sucks if you try to quit smoking cigaretts. 
I now bought a MFLB to get rid of the tobacco when smoking weed. 

I hope you guys can help me through the hard times that will come. :)

Smoked for 8 years, it's time to leave it behind.

Having said I'd quit before 5 years and now overshooting that by 3 years I think it's time to be very serious about what I'm doing to my health. The longest I've ever quit for was 2 weeks and every other time was a matter of days if not hours before caving in. The thought that I've not given my lungs and body a break for more that 30-40 minutes on average every single day just astonishes me and really makes me wonder just how much more the body can really take from this constant bombardment of toxins. I'm 23 and the last 2 months of my life have been dreadfully tough for me as I've had to realise a few quite unbearable truths about myself and I've found myself smoking as much as 30-40 a day. I have a lot of changing to do with myself and quitting is the most important one and will also serve as my declaration of taking my first step down a very unknown path for myself.

Thank you to anyone who reads this, it is written more for myself though.

Good Luck to everyone attempting to make a positive change in their life.

Day 4 - wow.

So day 4 seems to have been REALLY hard! Craving like mad :( I need to keep a check on my eating too though as I'm very worried I'm replacing the cigs with chocolate! Today I have craved and craved and craved. I'm still craving now which is kinda why I'm typing this! It's been harder than ever in lots of ways. 

Some positives though is that I haven't been in a shop for days, I haven't checked my bank balance for days and my work day has been really productive because I've not been trying to rush off home to get a ciggy! 

How's everyone else getting on? Any advice to beat the 4 day blues? Xx

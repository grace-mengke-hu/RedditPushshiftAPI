Couldn't sleep last night because my throat hurt so bad, I QUIT.

I threw my bag of tobacco into the trash, along with my tubes. I'm a paranoid person and live day to day concerned that i'm developing cancer, and that is no way to live. No "comfort" I get from a cigarette overrides my worry for my life, especially at 20 years old. 

I got my throat checked out, it's strep (caused by a weak immune system). But it was more then enough for me to never want to see tobacco again. I'm glad I can finally stop lying to myself, and take charge of my health.

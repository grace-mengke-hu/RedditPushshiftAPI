just a little confidence boost for myself.

im gonna stay today smoke free/overnight, with my smoking friends at the party, its going to be easy breezy beautiful, im gonna show them how strong im and keep my inner strength untouched even if they try to offer me a ciggarette. its a poison, with no benefits what so ever, not smoking has positives only. Im non-smoker.

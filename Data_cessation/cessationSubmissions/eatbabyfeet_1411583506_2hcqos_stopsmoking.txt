Can we compile a list of reasons why nicotine is bad for you? I need support.

I've gone 121 days. Some of those days were absolute hell. I've abstained despite stress from home, work, and emotional issues I've had for as long as I can remember. I've resisted even though I've spent every weekend around friends who smoke. 
For the most part I'm ok. I miss it, I miss having something to rely on, a break when things got to be a bit too much. It's still a struggle. 

I guess I just still need some encouragement. Had an incredibly rude and disrespectful person try to tell me in a condescending nature that nicotine in itself is harmless and there's nothing wrong with having an addiction. I wanna just sit down and cry, like all my efforts were wasted, how stupid am I to try to overcome such an awful thing that disrupted nearly every aspect of my life, possibly caused irreversible damage, and would've encouraged my daughter to make a horrible choice to start smoking had she seen me do it. 

I'm not wrong am I? Nicotine addiction is horrible isn't it?

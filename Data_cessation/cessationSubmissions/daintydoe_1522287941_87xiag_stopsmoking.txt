I want to quit but I'm scared.

I've been smoking for way too long considering how young I am, and it's gross and unhealthy and I want to quit. However, I'm not the only smoker in the house (boyfriend also) and it'll be hard on both of us. I'm scared the irritability will cause problems. How long did it take you guys to get over it? Should I/we go cold turkey or start cutting down? I've quit cold turkey before because I was pregnant and that was easy enough because I was doing it for the baby and even the smell made me nauseous if not throw up. I should have never picked them back up. Honestly pretty disappointed in myself for that. We don't live in a legal state so the "other" smoking isn't an option :P

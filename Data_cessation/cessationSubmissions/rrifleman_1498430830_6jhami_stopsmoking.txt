Nicotine Gum

I started using the gum 2 weeks ago and the past week I'm having symptoms of asthma and its getting worse, I've not had these symptoms since I was 7, put on this machine and it cured it 90% besides a flair up when I get into thin air.

I've smoked for almost 20 years and not one issue or symptom of asthma till I started this gum... I'm so confused and I have 6 unopened boxes of gum lol.

Anyone else had issues with this thrive gum?

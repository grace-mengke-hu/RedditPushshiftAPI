Furious at work colleague.

Just wanting to vent really. I was a pack a day (25) smoker and stopped smoking 7 days ago cold turkey. I'm a bit grumpy today at work and my work colleague asked me what was wrong. I explained that I've quit smoking and it's been 7 days since I had a cigarette. Her response? "If you're grumpy maybe you should go buy a packet of cigarettes, you can't stop smoking until you are ready. If you are grumpy without cigarettes then you aren't ready to stop smoking. Go across the road and buy some". When I said "no I'll be fine" she offered to go and buy a packet for me. I couldn't think of a response to her so I just walked away and I'm grumpier than ever now. Grrrrrrrr.

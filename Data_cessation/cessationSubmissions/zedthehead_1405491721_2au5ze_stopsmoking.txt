One Week

I successfully quit previously in 2012 after dental surgery, but was assisted at the time by patches and a week of vicodin.

In March, I found myself on a road trip to Texas when, in the absence of my preferred trees, I gave in to the oral fix with a cigarette... or fifty. My living situation got wrecked pretty immediately upon my return home (my roommate decided to just break the fuck down), and I failed to quit as I came off the road.

Last week, I simply decided not to get another pack. I'm pretty sure it was Tuesday (I've been burning many trees to compensate).

I have an e-cig, which covers cravings, but... *the rage.* The way I described it earlier was "the entire world feels like a porcupine's backside, and it's definitely rubbing me the wrong way."

I feel like a champ nonetheless.

Day 13. Almost caved.

Got drunk last night. Walked to the store and got a pack of cigs. Sat there with one in my mouth for probably 20 minutes. Couldn't bring myself to light it. Went to bed. Repeated the process this morning. Sat with one in my mouth, couldn't light it, ate breakfast.

They're just sitting there. I scattered the whole pack to kinda show myself, "if you smoke one you're gonna smoke em all." Even though smoking them all was the intention. I was doing mental gymnastics. Saying I would quit again on the 1st, after this pack. Well WHAT'S THE POINT IN THAT!?!?!?

You know it's crazy, you get these cravings and all of the sudden you forget how bad you've wanted this your whole life. You forget the 5 days of hell you went through to even get to this point.

Drinking hadn't been a problem with my not smoking but I suppose it's time to cut it out for awhile. It feels like the cravings are worse than ever. I know there's no way that's true, I just hate having this short fuse. I get stressed at work and there's no going back. It turns into a 4-5 hour nicotine craving.

Clean and sober until this is over with. I've been drinking too much to compensate anyway. I can't fail now.

Skating with some friends later today. Giving the pack to one of them.

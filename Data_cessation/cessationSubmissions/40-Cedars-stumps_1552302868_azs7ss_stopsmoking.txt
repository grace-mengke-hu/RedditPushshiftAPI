It's been 3 day's

Last night we went drinking at a friend's house, got a bit buzzed. Most times that's one of my triggers, but I didn't get that nagging pull. 

I've divided a kinda plan for myself, where I recognize what triggers my cravings. So in the future it won't sneak up on me. If that makes sense to you'all. I feel if I know it's coming I can cope with it better.

I also started writing on the top of my hand every day that goes by without a smoke. It's kind of a ritual and a reminder.

You see I quit smoking around 8 years ago and stupid me started casually taking drags of my friends smoking at partys and now I'm here. But I did it once so with some effort in some work I can probably do it again. 

If you'all got question, just ask.

Stay strong!

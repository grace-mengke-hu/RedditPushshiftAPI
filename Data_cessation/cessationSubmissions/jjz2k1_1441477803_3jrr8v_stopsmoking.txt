So I've quit for 4 months 5 days. There's a problem I've come across.

So today marks 4 months and 5 days. My problem is that normally I don't hang out with my smoker friends much but when I do I usually get small cravings. However these can be stopped easily when I go hit the gym later that night. The problem is when I head to bed that night and wake up in the morning I get cravings again?? It's most likely associated with those morning cigarettes I had when I was a smoker. What should I do?

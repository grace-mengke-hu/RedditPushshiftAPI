What benefit did you notice most when you quit smoking besides money and easing the cancer threat?

I need to quit. I love the sidebar info, and would love to hear some unexpected benefits you had after you quit to give me as much to look forward to as possible. 

When it came to diet, and working out - what kept me on track was focusing on the rewards so please tell me some rewards!

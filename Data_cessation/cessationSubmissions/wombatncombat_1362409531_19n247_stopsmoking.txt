Today I woke up and went for a run.

I was the type of smoker who would have a smoke first thing in the morning. This morning I didn't feel the urge. To celebrate I coerced my roommate (trying to loose weight) out of bed and we went for a short run. I feel awesome! I just want to keep this momentum going.

[Question] Risk of blood clots after quitting smoking

Hey guys.

So my mom has been smoking since her teens, she only stopped when she was pregnant with me and my brother. Shes 54 now. 

My dad is adamant about helping her stop smoking, this time it might me the real deal.

Now, the thing is I just so happen to watch a YouTube video about quitting smoking and it mentions the "for long term smokers, the risk of red blood cells increasing in size and causing blood clots" (paraphrasing). I couldn't find any mention of this, over my 30 or so minutes of searching for it on the net (even in the links the video uploader provides, I just skimmed the several-hundred-page-dissertation).

Gonna check with some medical doctors about it, but I don't think if their not specialized in the field they wont know much about it (specially here in Serbia).

My thoughts: The blood cells are already increased in size and its already a risk, I'm just misinterpreting that part of the video.

Hope ya guys can shine some light on this topic.

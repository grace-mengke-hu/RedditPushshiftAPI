To all of you New Years Quitters: You can do it! It will soon be 5 years since I've had a smoke.

I quit January 13th 2011. It was my 38th attempt to quit smoking. I had tried everything before, the patch, the gum, the lozenge, cold turkey, hypnotherapy. Eventually my uncle told me he was able to quit with Chantix. I tried it myself. I had no side effects other than some incredibly cool dreams for the first week. After that I just forgot to smoke about 8 days in realized it was working and tossed what was left of my carton in the bin. I have not looked back since. Chantix is not for everyone I know but your solution is out there just keep trying! Good luck.

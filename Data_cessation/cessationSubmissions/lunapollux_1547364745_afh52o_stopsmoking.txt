I smoked again after 10 days and it tastes like shit

It's like seeing your ex after a few months and found closure. "Why did I even start this?"
I've been vaping(3mg) for 10 days and it has helped me wean with a few nicotine while trying to quit the habit itself. However, I left my charger at work and it's a weekend. My battery has been depleted and I didn't know what to do. So I tried a cigarette. It tastes so bad I puked. It didn't experience the thick smoke, which I realized is the part I enjoyed about smoking in the first place. I was fixated to the puff and huff. After this experience, it made me more confident that I will be able to quit cigarettes for good. Hope I get to quit vaping too. After this juice I'll be switching to 0 nicotine and try to kick the habit once and for all. Anyway I hope you are all doing great and I'm proud of all of us here. Have a great Sunday!

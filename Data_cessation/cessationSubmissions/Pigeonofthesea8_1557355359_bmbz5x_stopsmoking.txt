Literally can’t smoke?

I’m quitting (day 5, using patches as part of a treatment program). I tried to smoke today - I actually couldn’t, I took two puffs and coughed and gagged (almost hurled!)! 

This is great for my quit, but I’m curious if this has happened to anyone else? Anyone know why it could happen? 

Last time I quit my body could still process the odd cigarette, now it’s like it’s completely rejecting cigarettes

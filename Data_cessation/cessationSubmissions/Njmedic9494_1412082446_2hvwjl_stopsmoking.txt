Some advise for new quitter.

Hey all,  I'm new to this sub. I see you all have a nice little community and wanted to see if anyone has some advise. I'm 26. I started smoking regularly at 17. I did stop from age 22-24 but started up after a devastating life event.  Anyway the advise I'm looking for is how you handle not smoking when it comes to stress and being exposed to it?  A lot of coworkers of mine smoke and I feel so gross when I'm smoking nj uniform (paramedic). I feel terrible going into people's homes after I smoke and of course the health risks and money spent. 
Thanks in advance!

Vaping good or bad?

I started to vape with a vape pen. I vape Mint and Grape flavours with only 1ml of nicotine inside. I have read countless of rumours and articles highlighting the negative side of vaping and saying that vape can cause cancer and can cause smokers lung and smokers mouth. Is that true? Or are they just another rumours? I really need somekind of facts straight. Help me please?!??!

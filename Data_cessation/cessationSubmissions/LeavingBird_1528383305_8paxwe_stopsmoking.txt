3 weeks plus

I'm proud to almost be on 24 days. It was harsh sometimes, but it's a lot better today. I don't really have cravings, but I got all the other fun! 

I am prone to depression, so that got to me, headaches, insomnia and energy loss too.

So my advice here: Really stay active. Even when you're depressed or tired. Try. It's fine to take it easy, but non-activity begets depression. Exercise and staying active is the essence!

Thanks for reading, thanks for being a great community.

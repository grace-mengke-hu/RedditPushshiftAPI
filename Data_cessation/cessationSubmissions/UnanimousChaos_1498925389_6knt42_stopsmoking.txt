This is for me and you kid

After 14 years of abusing my lungs, today it ends. My wife and I are at the point in our life where we want to start a family. After extensive research, I've found that not only does smoking reduce my fertility chances, but could also lead to major health risks in our future baby. I cannot in my right mind pass on harmful genes due to my addiction and stupidity. Today I become a non-smoker. Not one more puff. I'd ask for luck, but that's not necessary as it's all self motivation and will power. Thank you in advance to this sub for future support!

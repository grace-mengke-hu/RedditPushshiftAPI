3 Weeks 'checking in' post.

Don't really know what to say sometimes... I just like checking in here every now and then. It reminds me how well I'm doing!

It's been 3 weeks since I've quit and 2 weeks since I've had no nicotine. I've still been getting cravings but they are fading. The little monster inside, as Allen Carr would say, is dying. In fact, I wouldn't even call them cravings. They are more like urges when I realise that "Ah I haven't smoked in X days now". 

Been going out drinking ever since I've quit. I'm surprised this hasn't been a problem! Sometimes I get asked to come out for a cigarette but I'm quite happy to say no. Unfortunately it seems as if I have been enjoying my alcohol more. I hope this doesn't lead me to another addiction which I would arguably consider worse... Might have to keep an eye on how much I am drinking!

In general I am feeling real good. I look healthier. I have toned skin, and I look at least 2 years younger (I'm only 21 but people always thought I looked older). I've been keeping fit and healthy and feel good mentally too - something that it considerably different compared to the last few attempts to quit.

I'm a non-smoker now. There's no reason why I can't go on happy like this forever!

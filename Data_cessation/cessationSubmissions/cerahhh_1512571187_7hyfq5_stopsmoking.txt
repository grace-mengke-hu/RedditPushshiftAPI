I'm quitting on Friday

I hate being paranoid about my health

I hate that I'm worried about premature ageing

I hate that I get headaches from smoking too much but still reach for another cigarette 

I hate that I'm more prone to infections because of smoking

I hate that I feel I need these to get me through the day

I hate the little brown spot between my front two teeth that tobacco has caused

I hate that I smell

I hate that guys I like don't smoke and that's obviously gonna be offputting

I've set my quit date for Friday. I was going to do it in the New Year but I'm sick of having 'quit smoking' as a resolution so I want to be done with cigarettes before then.

Today I'm clearing the ashtrays out of my room and making it smell nice. No more smoking inside from today.

Tomorrow I'm going to sit down and read Carr's book cover to cover. 

Friday morning will be my first day smoke-free.

Wish me luck!

P.S. should I tell my friends my plan? I always get mixed reactions. Some say do it so I stick to it whereas others say don't because my smoker friends may try and encourage me to smoke.

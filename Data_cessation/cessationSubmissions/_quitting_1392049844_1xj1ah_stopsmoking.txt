I almost finished Carr's book and have a question

I smoked the last cig in the pack and then started reading, until I finished most of it. So now I'm sitting here without smokes and I'm wondering about "the final cigarette". 

I guess I should go and buy a pack for it? 

I't feels a bit backwards to go buy some just to quit and throw it away. I guess the "closure" is good but I think it might as well be "me" hoping for "just a last one", although that shouldn't be a problem.

Edit: Also, which is the best "quitting" app for android?

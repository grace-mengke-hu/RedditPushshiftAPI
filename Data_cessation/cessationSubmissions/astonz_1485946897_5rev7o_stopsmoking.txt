Day 3

Hey.
I stopped smoking last Sunday, and it´s being easier than I expected. I have tried many times but I think this is the definitive, because I´m starting to really hate this poison.

The only thing that is being hard to me is the insomnia. I can stay 6 hours turning in the bed without sleeping. Do you know any advice about this problem? When could sleep well again?

Never made a quitting post - Today is 150 days.

Never made an initial post, but I did lurk quite a bit and comment on other peoples ... I smoked for 8 years (since I was 18). I never thought there would be a day I didn't want a cigarette, and honestly it wasn't that hard. The most important thing I did was change my perspective of smoking ... for nearly a year before I finally quit I internally scolded myself every time I lit up, convincing myself it was bad after 7 years of telling myself it was a reward. The only cravings I've had in a couple months is in my dreams ... weird dreams lol.

Nicotine is so addictive it lies to you in your own head, it's really nice not being chained to a pack of smokes and having anxiety because I don't have a working lighter.

EDIT: I quit cold turkey, no vape, no patches or nicotine replacements. First week sucked the most ... following 3 sucked pretty bad.

A question about an alternative.

Hey guys and gals. I recently stopped smoking (been good for 3 weeks as far as cigarettes are concerned), but I seem to have taken up hookah as a bit of a substitute.

My question is, does it also count towards my usual smoking? Meaninf, is smoking hookah the same as cigarettes?

Thank you, sunflower seeds

Sunflower seeds have been an awesome replacement for smoking for me so far. I keep a bag in the dashboard of my car for when I crave a cigarette while driving, I keep a bag in my work bag so I can pop them while walking to/from work, and I keep a bag on the coffee table at home for when I get the urge to go outside and smoke. Salt is great, maybe better than nicotine.

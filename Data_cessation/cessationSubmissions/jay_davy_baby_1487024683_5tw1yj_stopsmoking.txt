How Normal Is This...?

Hi fellow quitters!

So I am still going strong quitting, most days aren't too hard. One odd thing has happened the last 3 nights in a row and I am just wondering if this is common or my head is messed up more than most...

OK, here goes... For the last 3 nights in a row I have had dreams about smoking. The first night I smoked one, put it out and thought awww sh*t (all in the dream, no real smoking). The second night I smoked a few and when I was putting the last one out the same thing. Then last night it was almost half a pack before the realization in dreamland kicked in.

Anyone else dream of smoking?

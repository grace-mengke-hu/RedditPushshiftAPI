10 days

It’s been 10 days since I quit smoking. I’ve done a couple weeks or two months here or there but it never felt permanent. I’d always have a puff here or there because of stress.  I just turned 35 and am getting married and we want to have kids.  But what really clicked was some birth control commercial on tv where it said something like “don’t smoke when you’re on birth control. It increases your risk of a stroke especially for women over 35” and I was like l, shoot, I’M 35 and that pushes me over the edge. And I don’t even really want one right. I crave 5 minutes of peace or a way to relieve stress when I’m an anxious mess but I don’t miss inhaling all of that into my lungs.

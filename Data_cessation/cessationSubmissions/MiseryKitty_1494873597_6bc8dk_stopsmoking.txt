Nearly half a year of non-smoking, and I am just absolutely giddy about it.

I feel great today about my decision to stop smoking. I've quit a few times here and there, my last time before this one being for about half a year. 

It just feels good to be able to say that not once have I given in to a cigarette in nearly half a year. I can say that I am going through with my decision.

Now, it feels weird and I honestly still crave cigarettes every once in a while. I mostly avoid this subreddit now because it reminds me that cigarettes exist. I tend to do pretty well forgetting about cigarettes but I do feel tempted to relapse on some days.

I do believe that with discipline and consistency I can keep building toward healthier lungs and a healthier life.

Keep going, friends. I know you got this.

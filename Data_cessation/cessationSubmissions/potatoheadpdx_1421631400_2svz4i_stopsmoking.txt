Reframing

I'm trying this: whenever I catch myself thinking, "I really want a cigarette," I change it to, "I'm addicted to cigarettes." It helps me acknowledge that I'm having a craving without romanticizing it, and it reminds me that I don't want to be a smoker anymore. It's helping more than I thought it would.

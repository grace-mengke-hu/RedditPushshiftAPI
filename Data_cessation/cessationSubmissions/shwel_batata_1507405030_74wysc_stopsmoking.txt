I feel like I’m cheating

I haven’t smoked in 4 weeks, my husband is proud of me. This is the longest period I’ve gone without cigarettes. But I feel like I’m cheating because I’m vaping instead. I feel like I just replaced smoking with another bad habit. It’s too easy, I don’t crave those disgusting smelly cancer sticks. But come on, it can’t be healthy to fill your lungs with vapor. What do you advise.

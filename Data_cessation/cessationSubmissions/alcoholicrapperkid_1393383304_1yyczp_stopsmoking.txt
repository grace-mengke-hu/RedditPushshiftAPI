How long will it be before my chest stops hurting...

I smoked about a pack a week for a year (not much but still enough to do damage) and i recently quit. I'm only 19 but my lungs hurt pretty bad after running for a mile or two, which sucks because i like to run. Anyone know how long itll be before my chest doesnt hurt while running? if ever?

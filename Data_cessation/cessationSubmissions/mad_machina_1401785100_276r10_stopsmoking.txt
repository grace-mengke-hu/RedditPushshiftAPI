Quit smoking half of the year ago and don't know what's happening with my body

I quit more then half of the year ago, not really planing to get back. But(!) health issues started to appear, like I learned that I am celiakie - so I am on lifetime diet and quit drinking alcohol. Which is good, BUT I started to gain weight and I have no idea why and what is going on with my body. Anyone had a similar problem or can explain?

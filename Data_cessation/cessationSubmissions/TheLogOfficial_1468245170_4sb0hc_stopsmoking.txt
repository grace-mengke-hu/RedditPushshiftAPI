Day 1 and I need advice.

Today I have come to the bold conclusion that I am done with cigarettes. I just have a few questions that I hope somebody can answer. I have been smoking for less than a year, Im 18 years old, and I am wondering how hard its gonna be basically. How long for someone who has been a fairly moderate smoker for about 8 months until they feel back to normal again? How many weeks/months is estimated until the cravings go away and cigarettes are obsolete and I dont get challenged if I am near one or see one? Thanks everyone

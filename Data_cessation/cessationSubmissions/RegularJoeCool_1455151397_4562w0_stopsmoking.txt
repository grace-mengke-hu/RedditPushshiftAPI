Had my wisdom teeth out this morning. Figure it's time to finally cut the cord completely. Been working up to this for a while.

In the past I've been a pack a day smoker for about 10 years. One of my new years resolutions was to quit smoking cigarettes and starting on New Years I cut down to roughly 1-2 a day. One in the morning. One in the night. I got my wisdom teeth removed this morning and I know you are not suppose to smoke because smoking causes you to get dry sockets. No clue what that is but I've heard awful things. Really craving a smoke right now and just curious if anybody else used wisdom teeth as a tool to quit. Any stories about you quitting or advice you feel might help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!

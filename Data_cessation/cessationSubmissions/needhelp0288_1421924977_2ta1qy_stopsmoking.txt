The urge to smoke

It has been 4 days since I stopped smoking after 10 long years of excessive inhaling the poison. Small changes are visible in four days - breathing, etc. The problem with me is I did not feel like smoking for 2 days, I hated cigarette but in third and fourth day, I kind of have urge to smoke. how long does it last? how do you guys tackle it?

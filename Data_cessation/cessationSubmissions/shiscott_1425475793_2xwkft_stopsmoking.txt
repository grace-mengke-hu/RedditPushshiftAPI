Swapping nicotine addiction for something a little more fun...

So as I've happily smoked marijuana socially and with a decent level of control (couple of times a month, usually not more than at weekends only), I always thought I couldn't give up smoking tobacco.  Then lo and behold I discover vaporising.  

I have managed to not smoke any tobacco or nicotine since 30th January, but the cravings are being suppressed by having a nice bag of goodness from the vaporiser.

Now having been one month clean from nicotine, I do feel properly narky if I don't have anything of an evening.  I can manage a couple of days, but I wonder what I'm actually craving now!?  I don't mind that I'm smoking weed everyday as I've been here before and can just stop (although that sounds like addict speak, I genuinely can and have as I always wish to be the one in control).  I will stop this daily weed smoking, but I don't want to do it too soon as I want to be sure that I won't want to return to cigarettes.  Anyone have any suggestions as to what point do you genuinely feel as if a cigarette is a horrific idea?

I've got to quit, hope this is the right place...

I really need to quit smoking (duh). But my problem is that ever since I was 16, smoking has been a major part of my identity. Whenever I'm angry or upset, I smoke. Whenever I use marijuana, I smoke. (Not going to quit Mary, so don't bother.) When I wake up and I'm drinking that first cup of coffee, I smoke. Just thinking about quitting, I get tight in the chest, and feel like I'm suffocating (ironic, right?) I'm very much an INTJ and whenever I think about people I regularly encounter congratulating me for quitting smoking, I want to smoke out of spite. When I think of douchebags like Rob Reiner getting high and mighty about the dangers of smoking, I want to light up and blow it in his face. I *need* to quit. It's costing me too much money, it's costing me my health. Can anyone advise me on how to go about this? Where the heck should I start? How can I separate smoking from my identity?

Day 2

This is like my 10th time trying to quit. I realized before I never really wanted to, but my family pressured me to. I hate cigarettes. I hate buying them and I hate sitting in my car freezing while I smoke. I'm trying the patch again. The first night I tried cold turkey and ended up smoking the butts in my car to finally sleep. I refuse to vape. Wish me luck!

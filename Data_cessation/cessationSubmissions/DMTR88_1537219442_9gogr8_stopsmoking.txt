Didn't smoke for almost two years, yesterday I bought cigarettes

So I had the willpower to stop smoking cold turkey on January 3rd 2017 and didn't touch a single cigarette since then. Still I always wanted to smoke, I just never did. 
Two days ago I bought cigarettes, smoked and I felt great. The clear minded-ness, the elevated mood. It was a noticeable difference to well-being and I am now shocked. Many people say this is just imagination but it isn't. 
I can quit smoking anytime I want just like I did two years ago, the willpower aspect is not the problem. The problem is I want to find something that matches the effect of these cigarettes on me without killing my lungs slowly. 

Does anyone have a tip on how to replicate that effect? Please don't say something funny like "go for a walk","breathe deeply" or "drink a glass of water". While these help to distract you, they do not kill the craving, they just make you ignore it better.

So I heard about patches and chewing gum. Do I have to take them for the rest of my life or is there a different way? I have to get my brain to like other stuff that has the same effect on me but is not killing everything else except my brain.

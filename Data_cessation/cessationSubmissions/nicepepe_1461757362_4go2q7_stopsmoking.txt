When do the mood swings go away?

Hi all, I've survived another day (completed a week today!) without smoking. I say "survived" not because it was hard to live without smoking but I was constantly fighting with my addiction the whole day. I'm disgusted by cigarettes unless I get random cravings. At one point it begged me to smoke one but I didn't. I missed a lecture and went for a walk instead. (probably shouldn't have done it but I would have ended up smoking otherwise, so I had to make a sacrifice for my health).

But I acted like a pregnant woman all day! I was overly emotional and was really upset about everything. A guy in my class accidentally knocked my backpack off the table and I started crying. I couldn't concentrate on anything. Also on day 5, I didn't smoke while having a beer but even the thought of a good coffee causes me to crave for a cig.

When do these mood swings go away? I feel VERY emotionally unstable, thanks.

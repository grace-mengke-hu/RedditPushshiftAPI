How to complete withdrawal in 24 hours

I quit nicotine last Tuesday. (10 days ago) I spent 24 hours in and out of the sauna, steam room, treadmill, hot tub, weight room, and shower.  I sweated for about 30 minutes every hour for about 19 hours and continued to hydrate.  Extremely severe withdrawal symptoms occurred after about 19 hours.  I smoked some herb and passed out. Since then, I haven't had a single craving that lasted longer than 3 seconds and I have not been using any herb or other substance to numb myself.  Today, I am in a much better mood than I have been in for a very long time, my face is more colorful, I can smell/taste, I can breathe deeply from the stomach, I have saved $70 (formerly a pack a day smoker), my muscles have increased in size, and on the treadmill I have gone from running 2.5 miles in 20 minutes when I smoked to my new personal record today of 3.5 miles in 25 minutes!

What say you Reddit?  Sweating gets rid of the nicotine? Perhaps cycling out gallons of body fluids without damaging the kidneys ends addiction?  Whatever the science, this method worked for me.


TL;DR

Spent 24 hours sweating primarily in the sauna, treadmill, steam room, hot tub, hot shower.  Withdrawal ended in 24 hours as opposed to the normal 72.

Day 8 and feeling rage, is this normal?

So I'm at day 8 now and so far I've been pretty good. Get the odd craving, but nothing I can't handle - very mild. Thing is though, I woke up in a bad mood this morning, went to work and have been consumed by supressed rage all day. I just want to yell and scream and throw things. I mostly manage to contain it, but have been noticeably grumpy and short with people today. I feel it's because I'm getting jerked around at work, constantly being called in to fix other people's problems, answer people's questions and fight fires - so much so that I can't get any of my own work done. This has been coming to a head for me for a while though. 

But I'm wondering if the rage I'm feeling is actually withdrawal and that I'm just frustrated with work, rather than angry at it. But I expected that if I was going to get rage, I'd have gotten it by now - apparently I'm already through the stage wherd my body is no longer dependent on nicotine. 

Any similar stories or experiences you can share? Or some advice? 

I've tried to substitute smoke breaks with walking breaks and I didn't walk today...

Faced a huge challenge this weekend...

I went to Atlantic City this past weekend. Every other time I have been there, I have smoked a ton. That city pretty much means tobacco to me for some reason. I would search out a smoking section and have it. Add on top of that the fact that we drank a fair amount up there, and that was always when I amped out my drinking. I was worried before heading down that I would lose all of the progress I made since New Yearâ€™s.

I am happy to report that I did not slip up at all! Not a single puff or drag. Feels really good to know that I am able to stay strong even in conditions that would normally have me sucking them down.

24 days, very proud but feeling really down.

Well I am at 24 days and I'm really proud and happy with myself for the accomplishment. My only issue is that for the past week and a half I have been having very depressed feelings and thoughts.

I cant seem to be "happy" and I'm always anxious, like I cant relax. Its mild, but its really bothering me. Its my couple days off from work and I should be happy I get to relax, everything at home is good, I have no reason to be down but I am.

I have also started to remember or think about negative things my family or people have said/done to me which has made me stop spending time with them. I haven't visited family in a while now and I just don't want to. 

I wondering if I should see a doctor but I don't want to be put on medication or something, especially if this is just a withdrawal symptom from quitting. I am using patches though which helps. Did anyone else feel this way around the month mark or are you also going through something similar? Did it get better? 

Thanks for listening.

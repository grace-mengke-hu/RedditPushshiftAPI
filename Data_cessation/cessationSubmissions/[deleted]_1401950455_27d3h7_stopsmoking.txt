Dreams about cigarettes

After smoking for roughly 17 years, I quit about 11 months ago. I weaned myself off using an e-cigarette, and now have been completely nicotine-free for the past 5 months or so. 

I've been having somewhat frequent dreams where I smoke cigarettes. I feel guilty in my dreams as I'm aware that I fell off the wagon. I get pissed off at myself before waking, afterward realizing it was a dream. 

I'm wondering if this is common among those who've quit smoking. Is this a temporary thing? I've been handling not smoking pretty well. No cravings, I can be around other people who are smoking with no problem, etc. I am bothered by these dreams, though, as they give cigarettes more brain space than I am comfortable with.

Thanks!

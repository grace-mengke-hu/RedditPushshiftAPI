Just past three weeks

I've dealt with the itchiness, the coughing, the cravings... but I'm here. I tried the mantras I read but came up with my own: whatever it takes. I felt an intense craving one day walking home (city dweller over here) and ran to the nearest nail salon so that I couldn't do anything with my hands for 45 minutes. Weirdly, it worked. I do the lozenges when I need lozenges. I eat decadent foods when I need a comfort-release. I splurge on some expensive exercise class so that I can feel my new lungs. Whatever it takes. Whatever. It. Takes. I am DONE. Done with smoking. I'm gonna keep this going.

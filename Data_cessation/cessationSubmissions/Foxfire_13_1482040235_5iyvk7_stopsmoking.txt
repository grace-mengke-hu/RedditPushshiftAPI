Heart Palpitations

Hello everyone. I quit almost six weeks ago and couldn't be more proud and excited. I have definitely noticed changes in my health, and for the most part they are positive. I have more energy, wake up naturally and earlier than before, can exercise without coughing afterwards, etc. The one negative (and disturbing) change I have noticed is heart palpitations. They occur almost daily, and I have had several episodes in a single day. They strike at different times and situations. Some even hit when I am relaxing and reading or upon waking up in the morning. Has anyone else here experienced this? If so, did it improve over time? I have done research and found that some doctors consider it a normal part of quitting. I just never saw any discussions about it during my pre-quit quest for knowledge. I also know I should have a workup just in case. Thanks in advance!

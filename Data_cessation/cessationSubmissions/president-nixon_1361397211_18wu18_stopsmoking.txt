e-cig recommendations?

Hey r/stopsmoking,

I've been a lurker for a while and I know many of you are against e-cigs. That's fine. This text post is not for you though.

Most of my buddies I hang out with smoke a lot. I've tried to quit and "cut back" multiple times, but the temptation to join them when they smoke is too much. I haven't been a smoker for too long (a few months) and don't think I'm addicted to nicotine, though I know I am definitely addicted to "the act" of smoking itself, as I can't help but grab a cigarette when bored or around those friends. So, I'd like to find a good, inexpensive but not "cheap" e-cig, preferably nicotine free, to use instead of the real thing.

So, if anyone has recommendations on e-cigs they've used or heard good things about, it would be much appreciated. Looking forward to the day I can finally ask the mods for a badge of my own :)

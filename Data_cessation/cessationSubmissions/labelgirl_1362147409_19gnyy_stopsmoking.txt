DAY 14 

Well, I have made it to day 14.  It has been crazy.  I am finding it hard to resist temptation while at work at my night job (bartending) but I have been quite proud of myself for resisting!!  No e-cig, no cheating....straight up QUITTING!  

I wish you all good luck in you journey and appreciate having a place to post my progress!

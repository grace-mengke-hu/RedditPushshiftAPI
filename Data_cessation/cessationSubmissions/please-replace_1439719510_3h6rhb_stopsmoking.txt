The morning smoke will be missed/5 minutes with my thoughts. Any Suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I'm going to quit smoking tomorrow for many many reasons, the biggest is that I think that it will help with being less lethargic as my body will be getting more oxygen.
My favourite smoke is the one in the morning sat outside with a coffee or cup of tea.  Can anybody suggest what else I could do just to give me 5 minutes with my thoughts in the morning that will help suppress the craving?

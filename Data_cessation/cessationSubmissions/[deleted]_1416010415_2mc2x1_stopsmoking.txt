Two, almost three, days without a cigarette. First time I've really tried to quit. Any advice?

I've been smoking for about two years now and I know I've gotta quit while I'm young (like my dad says, who has been smoking since he was 15), but I don't really know what I'm up against here. That, and my Thanksgiving break from school is coming up meaning a 3 hour drive from school to home. Driving is a big smoking trigger for me, especially on long drives. Any advice to help through that as well?

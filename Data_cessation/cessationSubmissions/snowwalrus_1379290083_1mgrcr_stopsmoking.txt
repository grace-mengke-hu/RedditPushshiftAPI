Cold turkey clearly isn't my thing...need alternative methods.

Over the last nine months, I've tried cold turkey five times.  I've lasted sixteen days, and I've lasted four hours.  My last effort was a nine hour affair of misery.

I've read Allen Carr's book, and I know all the stats about how it's the best method for quitting and staying quit.  Just doesn't seem like it's going to work for me.  So my question is, what's the second best method?  I want to hear from people who have tried something else, like cutting down, weaning, patches, gum, anything.

Thanks

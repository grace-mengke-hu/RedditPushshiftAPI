1year, 3 months, 4 days and 8 1/2 hours (approx. who’s counting, right?) and I still get cravings?

I’ve heard this kid normal but it just can’t be. Sometimes it’s just a 30 second moment every couple weeks,  Other times like all day today it’s that stressful feeling in my chest like I never had stopped and am going about 6 hours past where I usually had one. I’ve heard you want one for the rest of your life but days like today I have to nail my feet to the floor to avoid going buy a pack. Is this natural??
My apologies if this is a negative post.

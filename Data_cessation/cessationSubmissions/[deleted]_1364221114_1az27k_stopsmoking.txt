Today is the first day!

So, I had my last cigarette a few hours ago and I'm making the decision to stop. I've only been smoking for about two years and it started off as 1 a day and now it's 20+ sometimes.

I've tried this SO many times but I'm determined that this will be the last time I attempt to quit smoking. Currently, I'm losing weight too so I'm doing a whole body make-over. I'm 35lbs down and I feel that I'm making really good progress in that aspect of my change but now I'm targeting quitting the death stick.

I was planning on going cold turkey as I'm not sure how else to deal with it, could anyone give me some advice of what to do when I get cravings?

Today is the day; I am quitting after my last cigarette in a few hours. The start to a long arduous journey to get my life in line.

I've been going through an awfully long existential crisis. Still don't really know anything of myself, but I am going to start with intelligent habits, as oppose to my typical self-destruction. Cigarettes have got to go. Wish me luck friends, this will not be the first time, but hopefully the last!

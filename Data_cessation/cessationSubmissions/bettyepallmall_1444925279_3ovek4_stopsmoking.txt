Bought a pack of nicotine gum instead of a pack of smokes on my way to work.

 My last quit attempt lasted only 38 days. And that was over a year ago. I'm going again though. This was kind of on a whim so I hope it works. Scratch that. It'll work. Just wanted to post it to make it more real. If I hide my quit attempt it means I won't stick to it.

 You guys are always so helpful so that's why I came here!

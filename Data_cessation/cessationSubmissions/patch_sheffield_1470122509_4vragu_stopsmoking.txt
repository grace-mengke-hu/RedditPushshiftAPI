two weeks done! I'm a non smoker!! :)

Have to keep telling myself that.  Was watching House of Cards last night, and how smoking a cigarette at the end of a tough days work is glorified, by the two main characters sitting and sharing a cigarette together.  You won't break me Mr/Mrs writer/producer/director (whoever put that in there!).  

I also still think about going to my good friends house - the friend who has the wacky baccy.  How it would be nice to share one with him.  But I can't now.  Not with tobacco in anyway.  

Then the thoughts of why I'm doing this come rushing into my head , and the benefits I'm seeing already:-

+ Not constantly thinking ahead to when I can get away from everyone and smoke
+ The fact I seem to have loads more time in a day (well I do! I wasn't a heavy smoker, 10 a day at the most - but 10 times 10 minutes is a shed load of time!)
+ The money I'm saving. ..how healthier I feel...how I'm not coughing in the morning....how my wife keeps occasionally saying how I'm doing really well... how I'm not having to hide it from my kids....

There's just no contest..  

It's only two weeks, but I feel great already.  Hope I can maintain these feelings and keep being a non smoker for a long time to come.

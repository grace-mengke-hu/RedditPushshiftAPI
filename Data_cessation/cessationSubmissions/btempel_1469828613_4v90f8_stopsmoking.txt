Low blood pressure and quitting.

I have low blood pressure. If I have it tested immediately after smoking a cigarette, my blood pressure is still low but healthy. Today, I had my blood pressure tested after an hour without a cigarette and it was dangerously low. 

I want to quit smoking, but now I'm worried that I will start fainting and having other health problems (already a problem my siblings have who are non-smokers). 

Should I go to a doctor before trying to quit? Should I monitor my blood pressure throughout quitting?

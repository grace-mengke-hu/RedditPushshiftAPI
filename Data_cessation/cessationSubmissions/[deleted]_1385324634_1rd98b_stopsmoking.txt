Anyone dealt with unsupportive friends?

I've been smoking for 3-4 months or so, and was already to the point of knocking off 10-15 ciggs in a day, after smoking my "free" time before another craving was around 30 minutes, sometimes I'd just chain smoke.


Naturally I made the decision to quit, because I wasn't in too deep, and at this rate if I continued I know I would have been smoking for the rest of my life.


So background done, thread topic:


I have a friend who I hang out with a couple of times a week, all we do is talk shit, work on cars, and smoke, it's almost to the point of being a pretty big part of our friendship, a lot of discussion about different brands etc.

He said this to me in a couple of texts:

"I just realised this is the first time you quit, haha"

"dw man"

"You have no idea brother, wait till you start smoking again, and try to quit.. again"

"Then shit gets real"


I don't even know what to make of this, just comes across as amazingly dickish.


Best option seems like it will be nudging him towards quitting, problem solved if that works. 

How have you guys and girls dealt with friends who are seemingly jealous or disappointed that you've decided to quit?

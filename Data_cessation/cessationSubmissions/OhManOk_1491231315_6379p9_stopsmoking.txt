32 year old chronic asthmatic, smoking since I was 14. Currently smoking a pack a day, sometimes it hurts, and I spend $300/month on smokes.

The scary part is, I can't imagine what life will be like without cigarettes. I can't picture most parts of my day without smoking. I need to quit. I think I need to wean myself off. Does anyone have a recommended time/schedule for weaning?

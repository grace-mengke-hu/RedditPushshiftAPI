One week, and going strong !

Thanks all! I was at a party yesterday where lots of beer was consumed. There were many smokers, and I had every opportunity to bum cigarettes, but I didn't. In fact, as a non smoker, it didn't even cross my mind. I had some mild irritations from the second hand smoke (difficulty to swallow all of a sudden), but those subsided as I swiftly moved upwind from the smokers (like a non smoker would).

I woke up this morning, feeling a bit groggy from all the beer, but my throat was clear. No taste of dead birds this time, and no need to smoke even though it makes your hang over worse.

Going strong, determined, and feeling great!

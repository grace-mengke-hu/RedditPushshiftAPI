Allergies after quitting

I've had a sinus/allergy reaction since I quit smoking 3 days ago. My chest feels really tight and my face feels kid of swollen. It's kind of vague, not quite a cold, don't know what else to say except I'm really knackered and can't seem to drink enough hot liquids.

Do you think it's related to quitting? anyone else had experience with this?

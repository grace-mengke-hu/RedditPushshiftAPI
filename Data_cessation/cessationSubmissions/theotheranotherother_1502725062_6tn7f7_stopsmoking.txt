Quitting while having depression.

I'm one of those "tried to quit a few dozen times" people.  Tried willpower, tried patches, tried gum, tried vaporizers...

My most recent attempt was trying after reading the Easyway book, after I kept seeing it pop up in comments in threads.  

It felt like the book was really helping.  But here I am still smoking.  

And thinking about it this morning, after making it about 45 minutes before giving up and going to the store...I compared my smoking to someone who cuts themselves.  Like I want to "feel the pain" of doing something bad to myself.

And one bit of advice that he keeps giving in the book is when you feel that craving, think, "Yippee! I'm a nonsmoker!"  I haven't felt "yippee" about anything in years.  

And the depression leads to a lack of motivation in general. I've never had strong willpower or follow through when it comes to anything. If there was an easier way to do something, I'd find it.  And if there wasn't an easier way to do something, I wouldn't do it. 

I guess I could hear from someone who was/is similar.  I didn't want to resort to Welbutrin (or similar) - I've been doing a lot of mental health work in general since the start of the year, and I'm doing a lot better than I used to.  The idea of turning to a drug to "fix" myself is a turn off.

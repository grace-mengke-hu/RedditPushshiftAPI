Does the anger/temper get better?

I didn't expect quitting to be so emotionally draining. I can deal with the void I feel, and the pacing throughout my house caused by anxiety and even the cravings I still get but the anger and mistreating of my wife is really getting to me. I never use to be a angry person prior to smoking nor during smoking - so this is a new feeling for me I don't know how to cope with. In fact, I'm introvert, I generally always take the highroad and avoid confrontations.

My wife is super supportive, she is the best, but I'm worried about other social interactions, like work!

Here we go.  33 and tired of being a smoker!

I have smoked off and on for at least 10 years and I'm sick of it.  I've been telling myself it's time to quit for awhile now.  There's nothing special about today but I figured if I don't set a date then I'll just keep procrastinating.  Know the next few weeks will be tough.  Wish me luck!

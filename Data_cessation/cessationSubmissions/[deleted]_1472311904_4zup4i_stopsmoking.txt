Tobacco companies are fucking devil

Philip Morris, one of the top companies of the tobacco industry is one shit hole of a company with no moral compass whatsoever. A quick search for documentaries on the tobacco industry or the John Oliver's video on the tobacco industry will usher light on the heinous and immoral tactics the company employs to maximise it's profit. 

For example, when cigarette smoking in the US dropped due to action of the government and partly because of the ill effects of smoking of which people became aware of . Philip Morris decided to target developing countries such as Indonesia, where it specifically targets young children of age 14 and around in order to get loyal customers in the future. 

Do we have to support such a shit of a company by using their products. Cigarette is the only consumer product , which when used as directed will kill you.

Philip Morris, also made false scientific claims that induced doubt as to the cancer causing capabilities of smoking.

This company also , twisted the society and culture to believe and accept the legality of the drug, that is as lethal and  addictive as cocaine or heroin or any other banned drug out there.

Quiet sickening, isn't it , Guys?

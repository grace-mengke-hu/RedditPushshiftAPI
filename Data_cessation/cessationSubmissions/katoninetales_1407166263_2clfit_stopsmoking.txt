Do happy things make cravings worse?

Most days are pretty ok, now, after a week and a half, but I had one bad day a couple days ago (I have some anxiety and stress issues), and I just got some pretty good news that has my energy levels through the roof and now I find myself itching to pace around and smoke. I threw 'em all out when I quit, though, and I'm not going to buy any more. I just wondered if you guys had the same problem. Maybe I'll try the gym? Something.

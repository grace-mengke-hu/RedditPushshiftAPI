1 week! - More random thoughts

Hey guys. I made it to 1 week. This subreddit has been instrumental to that success. I am not the most active poster, but reading other peoples advice and victories is one hell of a motivator.

  The cravings for cigarettes still exist. I don't know if they'll ever go away. But, I just tell myself that smoking will do absolutely nothing for you. It won't make whatever problem you're currently facing just magically go away. It won't satisfy that craving in the back of your throat. It will only come back, with more intensity than last time. 

  I had a dream about smoking. This occurred about 3 nights ago. In my dream, I had used both an e-cig and smoked a normal cigarette. I awoke drenched in sweat. Wow! I thought it was real! I was so disappointed with myself. After a few moments I realized it was a dream. Again, this was a very powerful motivator.

  I've told everyone I care about that I am no longer a smoker. I say it like that. I don't say that I quit, I say that I don't do it. Because I don't, nor will I ever do it again.

  Stay motivated /r/stopsmoking. You're oh so worth it.

It's been a few days since my last cigarette...

I'm 18 and I've been only smoking for around 2 years. I didn't smoke a lot. I was much more of a social smoker, like two or three cigs whenever I went out with friends. Since I turned 18 though (8 months ago) I started smoking more than I did before. I had two packs a week, when I bought around 1 pack every 3 weeks. 

I decided to quit though when I realized that last Friday I smoked a pack and a half in a party. God, it was a lot.

I'm starting med school this fall, so that's another motivator. I want to show a good example to my patients by not smoking and also I think I need to be more disciplined, because I'm also trying to lose weight. I think these are the first two steps to bettering myself. I really really want to quit and I'm sure it will be hard because a lot of my good friends smoke all the time so I'll be around cigarettes a lot. This is scary, idk, because I love smoking. God, I hope I can do it.

Metallic taste and headaches in 20th days

Hello Guys;

This is my 25th day. I quit both smoking cigs and weed with Cold Turkey. 12 years of smoker.

For the last 3 -4 days; it started extreme headache when i wake up (which i almost never experienced; i mean, i really seldom have headaches) and there is a metallic and disturbing taste in my mouth.

i brush my teeth 3 times a day but this metallic taste with the headache really crunches me.


Is this normal? Should i see a doctor?

Thanks to all.

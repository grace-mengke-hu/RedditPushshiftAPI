No more cravings

It's been over two years now since I've quit and I just realized when I saw a post from this sub pop up. That I don't get cravings any more.

I used to get the odd inclination to have a smoke, or when I had a particularly shitty day I would fantasize about smoking.

But for the last two months I haven't even thought about cigarettes.

I just wanted to provide some hope for you guys struggling through the process, that day by day it gets easier as you go.

Good Luck.

32 day yesterday and I drank

But I didn't smoke :) In the past between 2010 and 2014 I quit smoking for a week about 10 times, 2 weeks 5 timesish and twice I went 16 days to 24. I crumbled everytime I had a drink. I drank last night after a stressful day for the first time in almost two months. Probably had just 6 beers and not once did I smoke even though I was surrounded by ciggys. Rather happy

Spent the whole summer smoking. Need to quit.

Hey guys, I'm new here and I decided to quit smoking from today. I started smoking this summer and at first it was nothing problematic just 2-3 cigs a week. But these past few days I noticed I've been smoking a pack a day which is just too much for me. What I wanted to ask you guys is it going to be easier to kick the habit since I've only been smoking for a short period of time? Thanks in advance for any advice! Stay strong, you're all awesome.

Just checking in.

Made it through the 1st workday with only one meltdown. I'm really happy with the way these first two days have gone. I try to be patient, but keep moving forward. Sometimes it's just a matter of ignoring my own thoughts and feelings, trusting the facts of quitting are valid this instant as they were last.

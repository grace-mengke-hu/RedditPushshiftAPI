When to stop babying oneself?

It has been several weeks since I quit and I'm very proud. I've had great support and I am using the gum (almost done with it). But since quitting - I've kind of given in to other bad habits. The worst is gingerale.  It doesn't sound terrible but I'm overweight and have bad impulse control. I've started drinking 4 to 5 cans a day. I use them as rewards and I think they tickle the same pleasure zone as cigs used to. I've also been more liberal with snacking and I guess I'm just sort of ashamed. I've gained weight.  Why can't I just not have to shove shit in my mouth? (Great place for a dirty joke, but I'll pass) Anyhow, smoking and being overweight are 2 things that just aren't me - no matter how long they HAVE been me. So now I have to go through withdraws and massive change all over again with another gross habit. Living is hard. Good luck to us all.

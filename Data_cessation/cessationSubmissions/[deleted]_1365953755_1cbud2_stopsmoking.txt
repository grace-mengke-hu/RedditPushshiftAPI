Alright Reddit, help me out.

I've always been in the mindset that, if I'm not ready to quit, it won't work. Yes, I want to quit, but am I ready? Am I mentally ready to quit smoking? With all my stress and anxiety right now I'm not sure if I'll be able to. But I think I want to try. 

What worked for you guys when you quit? E-cigarettes, patches, gum, etc. Did you guys just stop one day or gradually slow down/stop? Any advice is appreciated. Also any motivating pictures and stuff will help too.

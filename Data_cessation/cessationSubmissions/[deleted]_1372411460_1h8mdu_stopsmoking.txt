8 days and I bought a 6 pack of beer and a pack of cigs.

Dunno what is wrong with my mindset. Threw an unwarranted tantrum at my girlfriend until she had no choice but to let me buy cigs/beer. She could've stopped me if she hadn't agreed but I would've harboured resentment probably for the rest of the night, which isn't fair. The mind games I played with her were pretty fucked, I knew I was in the wrong but I'm good at debating/arguing when I want to be manipulative :/

I dunno, maybe I just wasn't ready. Quitting was extremely spur of the moment this time around, I just suddenly decided to stop while I was riding home from work and then went cold turkey for 8 days.

Made it 8 days with my ex smoker friends puffing in my face (I'd go on lunch with them) and me not giving a shit. There's something really wrong with my attitude because it was going so well until 2 hours ago. Anyway I am smoking and drinking for the rest of the night, then breaking up my pack and throwing it in the bin before I goto bed. 

Resetting for tomorrow. Going to fish out my old Allen Carr's Easy Way book that seemed to work so well 5 years ago. It's somewhere around the house. Sigh.

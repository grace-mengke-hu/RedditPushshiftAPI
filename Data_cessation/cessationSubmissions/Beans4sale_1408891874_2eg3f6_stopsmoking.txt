Finding myself bored

Having smoked for 12 years... I find myself craving smokes more when I'm board... but I am having a hard time finding ways to consume my time... and it's still such a struggle to not think about smoking... but I will make it... I want my Daughter to think, " WHAT??!! you used to smoke?"

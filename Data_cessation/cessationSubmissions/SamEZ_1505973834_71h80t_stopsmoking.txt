Deciding to start a Mad Men rewatch on week two of my quit.

It may not be the most sensible decision I've ever made but its cathartic too...

Literally the first scene of the series was a discussion of Old Gold vs. Lucky Strike...

But at the end of the day I'll wake up tomorrow on day 12 and will continue not to smoke. Regardless if the advertising bros on a 10 year old tv show do or not.

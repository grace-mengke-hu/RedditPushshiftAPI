Anybody switch to snus to ease the transition?

I don't know if I would exactly recommend it to anyone, but I bought a package of camel snus so that I would stop smoking. Tobacco was second priority to smoke inhalation.

Its been a week, and I've only just now gone through one tin of it. So my nicotine levels have been significantly lower since quitting smoking. It helped to curb the headaches and withdrawl symptoms, helped to stop the smoking habit, and has just made the transition a little easier than the last time I quit a few years ago, when I stopped cold turkey.

Reading up on snus, the risks associated with it are much lower than chewing tobacco and cigarettes, so while its not as great as 100% clean, its at least somewhat better, and my lungs are not taking the full force of heavy smoke all day.

Now that I'm calming down about the urge to smoke cigarettes, and nicotine is much lower in my system I'm quitting for good.

After a week of no cigarettes, I have more energy throughout the day,  wake up easier, and feel less frantic. I also can taste and smell things a lot better, and I smell better too. 

Hitting the Gym again was what gave me the desire to quit. I would bike mostly downhill to the gym, and be out of breath when I got there. I've been tired of getting tired so easily on my bike

Anyway, Good luck to everybody else out there.

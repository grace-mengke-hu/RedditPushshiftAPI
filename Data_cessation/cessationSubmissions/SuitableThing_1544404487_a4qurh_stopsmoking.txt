Another quit attempt. I feel like this is the one.

I've just quit today. Over the past few days i've cut down by at least 5 and have been smoking only 2-3. Ive got nicotine gum for when im really craving and i've got no money at all to buy more. I'm 19 and a student, won't be getting any money till February. I've got better things to buy and save for than cigarettes. Along with that, nobody will be giving me money since we're tight on it. If anyone gives me money though, it's time to buy good food rather than cigs.


Been finding outdoor activities to replace the smoking environment. Gardening has keep me busy enough to cut down and i'm keen to save up for a telescope to look at space at night-time.

Ive only smoked for 4 years starting at 15. Mainly quitting cause its expensive trash with no benefits. I feel really good about quitting, I don't feel like i'll ever smoke again. I don't even think i'll be using the gum today.

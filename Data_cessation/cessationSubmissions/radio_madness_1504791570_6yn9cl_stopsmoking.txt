Failed again. Taking it to extremes now.

I'm 30 years old. I've been smoking for 15 of those years, about a pack a day. I've been working on quitting for months now. The longest stretch cold turkey was 16 days, followed by a couple 2 day quits, and most recently 6 days.

A lot of my issue is I have no friends, literally zero. No support network. I live in a small town and everyone smokes. I work from home, and have my kids most of the time. I'm seriously depressed and honestly have been looking at it like "my life is shitty what does it matter if I die early from smoking. Who wants to live longer when they have a shitty life?"

I posted yesterday that I was starting day 1 again, and then proceeded to cave immediately and go buy smokes. I DON'T want to smoke, but once my addict brain kicks in it's like I go on autopilot and get them, then regret it right away.

So, to counter this, I gave my bank card and credit cards to my ex-wife to hold for me. This way, when my addict brain kicks in I will have no option but to just ride out the craving. That's the new plan. I'm so tired of being trapped in this cycle and I'm putting an end to it now.

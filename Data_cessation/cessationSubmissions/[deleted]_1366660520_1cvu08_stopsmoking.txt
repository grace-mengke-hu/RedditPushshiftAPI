Day 10

Hey guys, 10 days are gone since I've stopped smoking again and I'm feeling really good. I've started running again and I feel much more motivated. 
But there is one problem: I don't sleep well since I've stopped, did anyone else experience the same and has any advices?

Thanks reddit and stay clean.

Day 104 and having SERIOUS cravings. 

Never thought I'd make it this far and I'm super proud of my accomplishment so far. I am using an e-cig....down to the lowest level of nicotine as well. Most days just holding it works for. Call it a crutch if you will, but after 20 years of smoking and trying to quit, it's the only thing that's worked for me. Soon, I'll be putting in juice without nicotine and see how it goes. It's how have gotten by. Hopefully, soon, just like cigarettes, the e-cig will go away too.

However, today...the past few weeks really, life has been dealing some really shitty cards. I've braved work issues, friend issues, family issues, roommate issues, hell even legal issues. Not a puff of a cigarette. Today came the girlfriend issues. 

The perfect storm seems to have hit. 

I'm hoping typing this out will fight back the craving to have one. It will be not only a regrettable mistake, but I'll feel like I let my friends, family, and most if all myself down in a big way. 

I'm going to do my best to ride it out. As I re-read and type these words out, I'm already feeling a little better.

Thanks for being there r/stopsmoking, if even to allow me to vent.

Good luck everyone! Hoping to see 105 over here.

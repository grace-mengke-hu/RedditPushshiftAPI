Breaking down

So I keep breaking down in the evening after a few beers and dinner and have one or two rolled cigarettes. The last week I have had less than ten cigs total, with two days cold. Any advice on how to cut out the after dinner smoke I feel like it is a slippery slope and I will soon cave and go back to a pack a day.

Quitting Smoking for New Year? Learn a strategy to manage nicotine cravings + the chance to win a£200 Amazon Voucher!

I am a Trainee Clinical Psychologist at UCL and am currently conducting research into the use of body-focused strategies for managing cravings. This study teaches you a very simple strategy which can be completed whilst seated and can be used alongside other smoking cessation techniques and interventions, or alone.
Not only is this free and easy, but all participants who complete both stages of this brief online study will be entered into a prize draw with a chance to win one of four Amazon vouchers, with a top prize value of £200! Stage one takes around 15 minutes, and stage two between 2 and 5 minutes.

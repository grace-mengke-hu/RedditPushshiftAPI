Breathing problems after quitting?

Hi all,

Been a smoker on and off for about ten years, my biggest issue isn't quitting itself, it's that my breathing feels worse when I quit.

Last time I quit was a year ago, doctor said I had slight asthma. I would take the inhaler and it did not do much. After a bit they said the asthma went away, but my breathing problems stayed. I started smoking again and it started to feel easier to breathe for me.

There constantly feels like there is a lump or cough that will not leave my chest/throat.

I would really like to quit for good this time, but I can not find a proper source or anything on why I can't breathe after I quit? Are there ways to fix this? Is this a permanent thing? What can I do?


Thanks for your time!

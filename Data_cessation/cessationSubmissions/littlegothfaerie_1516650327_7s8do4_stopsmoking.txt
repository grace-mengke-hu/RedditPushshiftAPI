Some reflection after 18 days

I’ve made it through the moments in life that lend you some extra time to burn. 

I’ve made it through work, during the biggest rushes of hangry people alongside incompetent servers and management. 

I’ve made it through my commute, day in and day out driving about an hour to get to my destination. 

I’ve made it through social situations, sitting and chatting for hours. 

I’ve made it through while plastered drunk and I’ve made it through while high as a kite. 

I’m beginning to have a more solid confidence in my ability to totally kick this habit!

I'm missing a concert and staying home right now, just because I know drunken me too well

As soon as pump some booze in, I am going to find a cigarette. After I smoke it, I'm going to smoke a pack.     
So I'm staying home instead, bombarding Reddit with my crap.    
Gimme that karma right there!!! Or don't. I don't care.

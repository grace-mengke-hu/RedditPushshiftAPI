34 days, and relapsed

Well, it happened. I could write some stuff but it would be total bullshit because they are all excuses, I smoked, and I shouldn't have. I think stopping smoking is giving me a life lesson because this is something that I have to be aware of even after a time it seems meaningless and smoking feels like something that is fun and not a big deal. We have to be AWARE and careful. We should never make a totally stupid decision in the heat of the moment.

That being said, if you use vape or nic replacement, make sure to be prepared. It was already a dumb idea to bring 0 nicotine juice with me, the battery died too. Get a good quality vape, and if you have the coins make sure to keep two because some people report that they can stop working, and that can be very risky.

News flash, they tasted like shit, made me feel sick. The buzz is not even that good. No man should ever do something this nasty and low to feel better.

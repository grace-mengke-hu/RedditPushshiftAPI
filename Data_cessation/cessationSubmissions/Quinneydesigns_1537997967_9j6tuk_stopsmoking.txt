Second time reading the easy way...

Feeling positive! Feeling hopeful! Feeling successful. I just recently changed up my username due to a lack of password memory. As a matter of fact... I think I've already forgotten this one... shit. Hahaha... anywho. Good things a commin round the bend. Will finish the book in the next few days with my quit date set for October first. I vow to not smoke another cigarette from then on. The first day of the rest of my life.
Cheers, friends. 
You can do this, and so can I.

Ready to do it! (Again lol)

Just a little about myself:
I've been smoking for about 25 years generally a pack a day and have quit to various degrees but I'm going to keep trying until it sticks. I've set the quit date for Monday so I'm gearing up and trying to make sure I'm a little more prepared this time. I've got a lot of reasons to quit but when I try and whistle with a tune I get out of breath lol. Just tired of it and ready to be unchained. Thanks everyone in advance for the posts and support!

Day 5! Hopeful and Exhausted!

First and foremost I want to thank everyone here and encouraging myself to quit through hearing everyone’s stories. I’m on day 5 of wearing the Patch and I’m actually proud of myself that I’ve gotten this far and I’ve also quit drinking as well, so this is a very uphill battle, but I’m having a hard time coping of not smoking if that makes sense. I’m constantly bored and tired. Maybe this is normal, but smoking also helped me cope with my daily struggles and now I have nothing. Anyone else have a similar experience?

alright, here we go, round 2

relapsed after 8 days. not this time though. I think the problem was that in the back of my mind, I didn't "actually" want to quit. It was just something I thought I needed to do. I want to quit now. I had my last cig of my life about 5 minutes ago and honestly, I didn't like it. Made me feel gross and it tasted bad. Lets do this thing.

Tomorrow will be day 1

I've been smoking for about 10 years, and I've seen the negative effects it can have on the body. I've had pleurisy, bronchitis, and an upper respiratory infection. My mother(40+ year smoker) has suffered 2 heart attacks, a stroke, and was recently diagnosed with COPD. I do not want this in my future. All of my close friends have quit smoking, and I think it's my time now. Any tips on preoccupying myself tomorrow? I have the day off, thankfully. I know I'm going to feel sick and irritated, so I think sitting at home or doing some other activity will be good for me.

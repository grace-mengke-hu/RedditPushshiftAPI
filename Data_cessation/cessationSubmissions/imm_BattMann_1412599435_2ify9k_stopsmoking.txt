Trying to stop...

Hey Redditors, I'm actually not posting for myself but for a friend of mine who's trying to stop. 
She's not that great in the English language, and I thought I could help her by using reddit.

We are actually trying to help eachother, I help her stop smoking, she helps me trying to live a little more healthy (work out, eat healthier).

I can see you all love helping eachother and we would greatly appreciate you guys and/or gals have some tips for us to stay positive and reach our goals.

Many, many thanks in advance!


PS. Excuse me for any spelling errors, I'm on my phone ;).

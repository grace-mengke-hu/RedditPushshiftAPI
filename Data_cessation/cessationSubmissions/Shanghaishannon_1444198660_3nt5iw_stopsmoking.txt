24 hours down!

I've smoked for half my life, which is pretty fucked up to think about. I don't want to have been smoking for MORE than half my life, so I held back from buying more cigarettes. I love smoking, but I also don't enjoy it much anymore. I'd find myself putting them out halfway. I'm also pretty health conscious- what a fucking joke huh?- and I don't want to get sick :( I've had success in the past but usually I'd just get suuuuper stoned for three days to get through the worst of it. That way at least I wouldn't lash out once I returned to work. But I quit smoking weed. So now I'm just trying to deal with it and it's quite hard.

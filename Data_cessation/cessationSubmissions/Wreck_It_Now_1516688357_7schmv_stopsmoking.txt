Starting to quit, again, need advice, just quit drinking (39 days)

Hi guys,

I quit drinking for going on 39 days now, it was hard, very hard even now, but NOTHING like nicotine withdrawl. 

I have a chronically burned lip from vaping so much, and I would like to get off of nicotine all the way. Vaping is not the way though.

Problem is, I love nicotine, TBH if there was minimal health consequences id be a chain smoker. It sooths my brain, it relaxes me, it tastes good, gives me something to do.

After seeing tbe results of quitting drinking, I am interested to see the effects of quitting nicotine, does anyone havr any input?

TLDR: Anyone here give up drinking then smoking? What should I expect?

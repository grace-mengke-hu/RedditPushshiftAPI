Day 2 - So far so good

20 year smoker here and up to about 30-35 cigs a day. I was REALLY nervous about quitting on New Years Eve but so far I'm doing ok. I haven't smoked a single cig since I went to bed on NYE (but I am using the patch and once in a while hit the e-cig). I'm optimistic that I will overcome this addiction finally. Thanks for having this group (subbed like 8 months ago) to give me a constant reminder to give up the habit!

Running helped (and still helps) me so incredibly much!

I just wanted to share here, I still get cravings occasionally (probably around 3-4 times a day, but nothing that makes my life worse). So I asked running shoes for Sinterklaas, which is a horrible Dutch racist tradition but yeah we kind of still celebrate with my family. And I took up running after quitting for 2 weeks or so. It started to become so much easier! The running motivates my staying an ex smoker, and staying an ex-smoker motivates my running. Now the fact that I'm a DJ and electronic music producer, makes it so that I can completely lose myself in electronic dance music. Today (6 weeks and 1 day quitter) I tried running with headphones on and I just couldn't stop. What a combination. Had a session of 45 minutes and not only do I feel fitter, I also feel like I can concentrate more on my thesis and just every aspect of my life becomes a bit better. Quitting cigs has made me realise that I do have the willpower to better myself, also in different aspects of my life. So eh, just wanted to say that if anybody thinks of starting to run after quitting, please try it! For me it worked like a charm :) good luck everybody.

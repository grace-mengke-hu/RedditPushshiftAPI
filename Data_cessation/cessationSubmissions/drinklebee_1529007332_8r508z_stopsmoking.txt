I’m going to quit for good!

As the title suggests I am going to quit smoking for good. I have a few good days where I don’t smoke and then the stress kicks in and I end up smoking again. I had my blood pressure checked today and it is very high. Does anyone have any success stories with quitting and it lowering their blood pressure?

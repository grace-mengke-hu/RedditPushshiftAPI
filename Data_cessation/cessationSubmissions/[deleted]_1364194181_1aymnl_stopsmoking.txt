Third day not smoking., going to be hard :(

i have to say:

 the busier you are, the easier it is - stay active and if you get urges do 20 pressups or something.

and the advice i read here yesterday (not sure how many pages i scrolled though) 'quitting is only as difficult as you make it, its all to do with mindset' is pretty good advice i think.

i've been trying to stay in the mindset of 'i've already quit' and that i do not need a cigarette, but sometimes i just can't trick myself, and still want one.

i think today is going to be the most difficult, as im going back to uni after the weekend and all of my friends there are smokers, its going to be difficult, but i think i can make it - will post here if successful!

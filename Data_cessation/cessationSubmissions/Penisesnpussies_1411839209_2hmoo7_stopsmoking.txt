Hey everybody, I'm new here.

I'm 25, and I've smoked for about 13 years. I'm still a pretty strong and healthy guy, but I've recently noticed a bit of a change occurring in my body. It's not so much that I'm getting winded now, but it feels as if my airway is just slightly more narrow than it normally is, or was, for that matter. 

Anyways, this shit is not okay with me. It's been too long. It's time to quit. I've been cigarette free for going on three days now. My dilemma is this: are lozenges a okay to use as a quitting tool? 

**TL;DR** Long time smoker, I've been on the Step 2 Equate Lozenges (2mg) for these past three days. They work for me. Has this method been good to any of you?

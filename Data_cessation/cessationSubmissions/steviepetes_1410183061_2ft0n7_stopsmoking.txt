Best Decision

Hi all! I just wanted to thank you for being there during the toughest time when I first started this journey. I've been smoke free for almost five months now with absolutely no desire to ever go back, after smoking for 11 years. I was up to a pack a day. 

I've always been a runner but quitting smoking made me step up my game. Last week I ran a half-marathon (21.1k) which I could not have done if I was still a smoker. Yesterday I ran a 15.5k to continue my training for a marathon. As I ran yesterday, I realized how grateful I am to no longer hear the wheezing deep in my chest. I'm excited that I barely lose my breath anymore, even when going such a huge distance. I'm thrilled I can do interval workouts on the track without needing a cigarette after.

I don't miss the woozy head rushes. I don't miss the constantly gross feeling teeth/tongue. I don't miss the taste. I don't miss the smell. I don't miss anything at all about smoking. I go out all the time with friends who still smoke on patios and I have zero desire to have one. 

So, thank you so much! Without this forum here to read occasionally, I wouldn't have made it through the first week. To all those new quitters, good luck! You can do this.

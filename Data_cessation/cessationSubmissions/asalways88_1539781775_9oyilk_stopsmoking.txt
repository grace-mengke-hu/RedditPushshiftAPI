JUUL is worse?

Hey all,

It has been three days since i quit smoking and I replaced it with JUUL. i have not been craving real cigarettes at all. But do you guys think JUUL will be even more addicting? (considering the amount of nicotine in there). Some say it is better than actual cigs because JUUL lacks the tar and other harmful chemicals. But then again, no real long term study has been conducted on JUUL.

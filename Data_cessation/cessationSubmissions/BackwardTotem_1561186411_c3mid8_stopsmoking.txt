What was your turning point like like I AM SICK OF SMOKING I HAVE TO QUIT MOMENT?

As above! Currently a smoker trying to quit, would love to see what is your turning point where you just decided to stop it all together . That might give me more reason to even wanna quit. Well for me, I live in a country where smoking is frown upon, there are few smokers around me, I absolutely hate the secrecy of smoking and keeping it from everyone. What's yours?

Day 3 and I don't know what to do now.

So a semi back story first. I decided to quit smoking 3 days ago and I haven't had once since but it seems I don't know what to do with my time now. Any advice for what to do with all my free time now to distract my self from wanting to smoke since everyone in my house smokes?

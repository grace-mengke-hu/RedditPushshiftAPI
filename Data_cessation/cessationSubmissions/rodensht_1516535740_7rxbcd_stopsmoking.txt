Day 2- mix of chest infection/withdrawals?

Hi everyone hope youre all doing well! You may have seen my previous posts here but this is my official day 2. Ive not had a cigarette since friday afternoon! Just wandering if anyone had only physical withdrawal? I dont feel cravings just now but only chest pains, tiredness, slight congestion in ears/nose etc..maybe its due to the fact i had a chest infection all week, probably wasnt a good idea to quit with a chest infection as it only makes symptoms worse i guess..anyone else had this experience?

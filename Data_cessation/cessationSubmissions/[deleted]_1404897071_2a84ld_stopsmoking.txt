My trigger is spending time with friends who smoke. Help me deal with this!

So I've been smoke free for 5 days, its been fine for the most part - some cravings here and there when I am stressed out or fed up BUT I am worried about my cravings around people who I know who smoke - I am worried this will be my downfall! Another trigger is having a few drinks and wanting to have a smoke, which I know will happen! 

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with these triggers? Thanks in advance!

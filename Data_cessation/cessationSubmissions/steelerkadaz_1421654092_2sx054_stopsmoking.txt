Just found this sub. Currently day 2.

I've been winding off smoking the past week and today is my second day without smoking.  I am currently deployed so everyone smokes like chimneys whenever they can. So I decided to do a little search on reddit and of course there is a quit smoking sub. Since I feel a community on here would be better then the few people that have attempted to quit on this deployment. I hope to make it through these next few months and come back home a new man.

I've tried quitting 4 times last year, now i met this girl and it's easy not to smoke when i'm with her.

But that's just it, when i'm with her i can't stand myself to smoke. She doesn't like it, and has a way of making a face when i light one that makes me not wanting to smoke. Outside of seeing her, it's business as usual.

Now for the fun part, she's leaving for her homecountry coming monday, and i need more inspiration to continue this somewhat positive trend of my brain telling me there's more important things than smoking.

I intend to visit her later this year, and my goal is to be smokefree when i get there. Any help from you guys?

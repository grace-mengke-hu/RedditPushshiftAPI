Tomorrow, I'm gonna stop.

Hello Friends!

For the last few hours I've been sitting here reading a lot of this subreddit and came to the conclusion that it is finally time to stop.
I've been trying to quit smoking for a few month now, but never made it more than a few hours. Right now I am 19 years old and smoke about 20 cigs a day. I want to do sports again, lose weight in general. And I finally realized that I should start out by quitting the smoking.

What makes it even worse is that I am lying to my friends, my family and even my girlfriend, the people that know everything about me. They think I stopped a while ago. I was scared to tell them that I started after only hours of "quitting". 

After I posted this I will smoke my last cigarette and hopefully never come back to it.

Thanks for the inspiration. I will keep you updated.

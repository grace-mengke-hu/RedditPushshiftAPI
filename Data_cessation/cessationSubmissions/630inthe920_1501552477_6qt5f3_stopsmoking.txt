Recently I was nearing 9 months without cigarettes.

And then slipped, and kept slipping in episodes of binge smoking. It re-begins tonight for me and I just wanted to make a post here for some accountability. I'll also be using this sub greatly for motivation. So thank you all in advance. Time to reclaim my health and, more specifically, my lungs :)

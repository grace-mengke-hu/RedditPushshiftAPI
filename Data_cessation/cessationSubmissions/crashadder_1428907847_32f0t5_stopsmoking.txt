Is it going to get any better ?

Hi,
Its going really well. I am about to reach the 5 months milestone in just few days. when i look back i've never had "really" bad days. though  i have cravings and most importantly thoughts to become a smoker again time to time. The progress of healing or journey to home is slow to a cralw now. It feels like it wont get any better than this. So my question is will it likely to get any better in the near future ? I mean is there a difference between being 5 months into it and 6 ? I can say that 3rd month was somewhat hard . It got significantly easier later. 5 months in and i dont take cravings seriously anymore. Hope i made myself clear.

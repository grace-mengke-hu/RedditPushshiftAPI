Advice for brain fog after quitting smoking.

Been  a couple months. Work quality has been poor since quitting. More easily irritated. Not happy about this but I'm holding on that it will be gone sooner like a couple more months. 
Any tips or tricks to make my brain work?
I'm exercising and eating well. Getting outside. Being active. 
Feel foggy in my head. 
Thank you

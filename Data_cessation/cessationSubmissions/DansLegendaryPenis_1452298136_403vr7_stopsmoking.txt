S/O and I made New Years Resolutions to quit smoking, she caved... Im unsure where to go from here

My so and I made new years resolutions to quit. We had tried and failed several times in the months leading up to new years. We got 7 days in and last night she tells me she can't take it anymore, and that she doesn't really want to quit, and she was just doing it for me...

I'm 31, I've smoked half my life. I am ready to quit, and have been every time I've tried, which is in the dozens...  I know I don't want to smoke... The longest I've "quit" was a year and a half... I WANT to be done.. In the last two years I lost 100 lbs, quit smoking, started smoking again, and regained 40... I want a more healthy lifestyle... Can this balance with an S/o who doesn't want to quit? There is no "occasional" cig for me... I'm an all or nothing smoker... I can smoke no cigs for 2 weeks during a quit attempt, cave, and then boom,I'm right back to 30 a day... 

Not sure why I'm posting this... Just wondering if anyone has ever been in this position and looking for some insight.

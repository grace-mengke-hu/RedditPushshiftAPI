Resetting badge after 3 puffs

A couple of days ago I drank for my b-day. I should not have drank because WOW! Did the cravings sky rocket! So I found some cigs but didn't smoke them and threw them out(actually wet them first so I would not change my mind) but then went out and bought a black n mild. I buffed 3 times on it and threw it away (the wine one tasted soo freaking bad thank goodness). ( aka I am quieting smoking cigs) Does this count to reset the badge/ app?

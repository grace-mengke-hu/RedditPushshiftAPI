Day 2 and really hoping it sticks!

Hey all - been following for a long time but here is my first post! I've been smoking around 10 cigarettes a day for 14 years and have quit so many times I've lost count (have also read Alan Carr's book so many times I think I have it memorized!).  Have been looking for a good time to quit again, and couldn't find one until finally my own vanity kicked in. A fried of mine sent me a photo she took of me on Saturday, puffing away in the park.  Although I was smiling my face looked grey (!!) and sullen, even in the bright sunlight.  So I said that's it - I've been killing myself for long enough that its starting to show on the outside.  Moreover, I will be 30 in a few months and want to stop before this terrible addiction finds its way into yet another decade of my life.

Anyway as I've quit many (MANY) times before, I am looking for new ways to keep myself motivated over the next weeks and months.  Plan is - as usual - to get to the gym a few times a week and have plenty of water and tea nearby, but I hope that this subreddit can help boost my motivation!

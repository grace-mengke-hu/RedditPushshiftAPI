Help please!

Hi everyone, I've made a throwaway for this because, well I'll explain that in a bit.

I can't really remember when I started smoking but it was early 20s, most of my friends smoked and I guess I just got into it while drinking, bumming fags off them. Eventually I started buying packs myself. I'm only 27 but I've been smoking for 7 or so years, and it's all been a secret.

My friends see me smoke all the time but think I just do it with them, they don't realise I get through 10 a day when they aren't with me. My girlfriend (who I've been with 10 years) doesn't know. She hates smoking and only tolerates me having a cigar once in a while. I carry deodorant with me to spray before I get home to her.

I love the routine of it. Smoke 3 on my walk to work, 2 at lunch, 2 on the way home. If I'm home alone then I'll smoke til my throats is sore. I think my girlfriend would support me and I'd find it easier to quit if she was helping, but I can't tell her because I'm so ashamed of lying for so long. 

I went away recently and didn't smoke for 10 days - had no problems - planned for it to be the 'end', but as soon as I went back to work I started up. (I made it half-way before going into a shop). It was like I was only not smoking because I couldn't, but I know that I didn't get bad cravings. It's more the 'feel' of it that I need.

Basically, I'm looking for tips. How do I cope on my walk for work and when I'm bored at home on my own?? I know good advice is to tell my girlfriend but I really can't.

I've got about 10 left in my pack and I know from experience that even though I want to stop when I finish them (wouldn't want to waste my money) I'll go right out and buy more. I've tried gum and e-cigarettes but they only make me miss the real thing.

Sorry for rambling so long, but you are literally the only people who know I am a smoker and how much I want to quit. I'm hoping it'll be like an analog for having support from friends and family.

Cold Turkey fail today...Again. New plan I'm going to beat this.

Hey Reddit,

I've tried to beat this multiple times and nothing has worked but I feel the time is now. I KNOW I'm ready to be a non-smoker. I tried a cold turkey quit last Monday and that didn't work and I tried it again today, but I just could not focus at all. My head was chaos and I gave in, but I have a new plan.

I'm going to stagger my smoke count so that Friday 6.17 will be my first NO smoking day. Breakdown for what I'm thinking (I've never tried to ween like this before where you smoke 4,3,2,1 then Zero but I think it will work for myself).

Today: 4 smokes
Tuesday: 3
Wednesday: 2
Thursday: 1
Friday: Goose egg

For my sake I'll be updating this post every morning with how the previous day went. I just really want Next Friday (6.24) to roll around and to have been smoke free for a week, that would just be great. That's the Goal. 

Thanks for reading - more to come.

Feels good to write this down.

Update 6.14 - Stuck to the plan yesterday. After reading through some comments and really spending some time thinking about it. I'm with the "sack up" crowd. I'm going to continue with the plan today of 3. Tomorrow the plan is zero - slight alteration. I do think I've sort of over hyped this is my head. Thanks for all the comments Ya'll.

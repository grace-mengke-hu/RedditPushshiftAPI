Day one ..

I'm 54 been a smoker since I was 19 ..pack a day ...I've done everything to quit ...including Chantix which  worked for me I quit for six months but I went to a concert and started smoking again .Quitting seems next to impossible .My wife smokes and most of the people in my life smoke . Downloaded the smoke free app trying  that seems interesting nice to have some positive feedback that stays up to the minute ..good luck everyone that's working on this ..it's tough

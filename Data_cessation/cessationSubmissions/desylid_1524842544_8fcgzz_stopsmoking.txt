When does the rage end?

I’m 8-9 days cold turkey. Purposely trying not to track specific dates because I hate that milestone celebration shit. I don’t now know when I quit drinking. 2 years ago? Doesn’t matter.

Smoked about a pack a day for ~13 years. I’m 32. Or 33. However old dec 1985 is.

Sometimes went through phases of 2 packs a day. Tried doing nicotine replacement a few times. Resulted in me relapsing and chain smoking harder than ever.

I spent all of March with pneuomonia. 75% of last year with bronchitis.

My cough is gone. Haven’t had to hit my inhaler in a week. 

Things are going great except the rage. I’ve been losing my shit instantly. I used smoking to sedate myself. 

I keep catching myself being mean and unreasonably impatient. And of course I then want to escape the situation and smoke. 

HOW LONG DOES THIS LAST?

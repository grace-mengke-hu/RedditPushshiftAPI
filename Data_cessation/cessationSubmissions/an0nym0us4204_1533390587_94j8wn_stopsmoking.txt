Quitting smoking making me very emotional

Hello everyone

I’m writing this half an hour before work just because I need to let it out somewhere. I decided to quit smoking for the first time on Aug 1st, after being a pack a day smoker for 2 years. I’m using a vape with 5mg nicotine to help with quitting. I did not decide to quit smoking because I want to, I decided to quit because I know I have to, to save my health, my money, and those around me. 

The first 2 days were okay, but For the past two days it has been very hard, and I have cried multiple times including 5 minutes ago because I could find a pair of socks. Quitting has made me extremely emotional, and i should mention that even when i was smoking i’m struggling with severe anxiety and depression. 

All I want to do is smoke. I had one puff two days ago, and 4-5 puffs this morning. My mind is telling me that I’m too emotionally unstable to quit right now and that I should just quit later on. My mind is telling me that maybe I can just smoke a couple of cigarettes a day. But i know this is the addiction talking. 

I’ve been on the verge of tears for 20 minutes now thinking about how miserable i’ve been these past few days without cigarettes. I miss smoking so much. But I know it’s killing me. I don’t want to quit at all, I want to continue smoking but what’s holding me back is that I know I’m better off this way. 

I remember when I smoked my first few cigarettes i thought to myself, “I really need to be careful because I don’t want to get addicted to smoking.”  I keep trying to remind myself of how I felt when I first started, and that even though i “love” it, there was a time where being a smoker wasn’t something i wanted to be.

Sorry this is so ramble-y, I just need to let my thoughts out somewhere. Some support or similar stories would be appeciated.

Does anyone else forget that they quit?

Last weekend I was in my backyard brewing some beer and I just patted my pockets and thought "where are my cigarettes?" Then a bit more processing then "oh yeah, I quit".  I don't doubt that if I had a pack of cigs in my pocket, I would have smoked one without even remembering I quit. Smoking was just so automatic.

Brewing beer and wrenching on my bikes is really hard to re-learn to do without having a cigarette to pass the time or de-stress.

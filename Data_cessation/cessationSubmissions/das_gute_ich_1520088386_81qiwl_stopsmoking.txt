...and tomorrow makes a week!

Come tomorrow morning I will be one week free of cigarettes and 50(!) days free of alcohol. Those feel like good, coinciding milestones!

Unfortunately, I still have cravings for both. And my alcohol consumption was/is a far far more detrimental vice than my smoking, so I would smoke cigarettes when I had a craving for alcohol. 

But that needs to stop, too. Even though my smoking (roughly 3-7 cigarettes a day) was the lesser of the two evils (not to mention I've naturally been smoking less since I stopped drinking), it is still a horrible vice and one which I have been trying to kick for nearly a decade. I end up making some progress, then saying "screw it" and backslide.

I want my healthy, pink lungs back. I want to be kind to the organs that breathe life into my body and kind to my heart that pumps oxygenated blood throughout the body that allows me to walk my dog, practice yoga, clean my house, go hiking in foreign countries. I want to feel like I no longer need to fill the void I unintentionally created so many years ago as a teenager.

Thank you for reading.

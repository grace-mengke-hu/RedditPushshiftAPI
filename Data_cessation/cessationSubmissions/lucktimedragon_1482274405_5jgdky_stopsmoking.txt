over a week

so it's been just eight days without smoking and it's going pretty well.  i may get a craving now and then but they are generally very mild.  as a chain smoker in my early twenties, the first time i ever quit was hell because i was at a pack a day.  the way i've been smoking this last year or so has been only four or five cigarettes a day.  so much easier to quit.  my skin looks so much better.

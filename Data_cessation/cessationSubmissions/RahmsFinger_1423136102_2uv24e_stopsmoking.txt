Day 36 (had to look it up the day via my badge) Very random observations.

1) I had some weird urges to put cancer sticks in my mouth tonight. They were easy to dismiss, but these were the worst in what seems like years :-).

The last time this happened was week 3, I was having dinner in the same part of town where my ex fianc√© lived. Tonight I returned to that area to meet a friend, and wow, there it was again.

What's weird is, I can go to bars, be around people smoking, but this ONE, very specific part of town, a lovely and beautiful part, with great food, bars, etc, and I'm squirming.

I did not smoke. Yes, I'm pretty proud of myself!

2) I must preface this, people assume I am a man, I'm not. 

I just think it's cool that Chicago's ~~major~~ mayor chipped a lot of his finger off in a deli-meat slicer. So, I have no issue being called, and calling others, "dude". 

But back to the weird, but positive side note, I have really freaking long hair, past the bra strap on on back. But not freaky 70's style long.

Noticing, my hair is growing super fast, but also there is some 1/4- 1/2 inch long baby-fine hair growing around my normal hairline. I'm pretty happy about that. It seems to be a sign my body is super happy, and productive, even though day-to-day I never feel this super healthy thing other new non-smokers talk about!

Let's keep this up, because it's really pretty easy in the grand scheme. I'd love to have company today, I'm not smoking!

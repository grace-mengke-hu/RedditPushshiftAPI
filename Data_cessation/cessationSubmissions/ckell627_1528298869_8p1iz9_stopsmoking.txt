Not Smoking At A Festival

I'm normally pretty good about avoiding smoking cigs - out of sight out of mind for me...... Except one place I always really get out of control is at festivals.  I've never been to a festival without smoking at least 3-4 packs in a 4-day weekend. Does anyone have any tips to help me not smoke at a festival in a few weeks?  I've been having terrible digestion problems which made me quit (among other reasons of course).

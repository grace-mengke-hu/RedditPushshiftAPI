Hang in there!

Hi y'all,

I just want to tell everyone my appreciation for this sub. I haven't been very active, but just lurking and reading how supportive everyone is has helped me stick this through. My dog died a few days ago and my grandfather is expected to die this week so the cravings have been tough due to stress. I'm so thankful that I can come here and see everyone cheering each other on. We got this!

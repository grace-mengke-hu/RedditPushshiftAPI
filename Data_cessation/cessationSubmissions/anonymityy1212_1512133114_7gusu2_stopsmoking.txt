This is my second time attempting to quit!

Today is Day One, again. A few weeks ago I went 3.5 days without one but eventually caved. I can’t afford it anymore plus I really want to be able to breathe again.

I quit in 2015 for 2 years! I started back up this past March because I was stressed with school and life, but now my life seems to be fairly stable and I think it’s the right time to start again.

I have patches but they seem to make my skin itchy and red, but it really helps so I might just push through it and use them for the first couple weeks. 

Anyways just wanted to post so I can try and keep track of my progress. Journaling hurts my hand after a bit lol typing is much easier.

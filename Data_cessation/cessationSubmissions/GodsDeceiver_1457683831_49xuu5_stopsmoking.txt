I failed it again, but...

Well, as the title says. I already failed it again.

But there's something I noticed.

It's absolutely no problem for me not to smoke when I'm with my girlfriend, usually it's for the weekend. During this time, I don't miss smoking at all, I don't even think about a cigarette.
But as soon as I get home, the craving starts again, and that's when it gets really hard.

Maybe anyone has a suggestion what I could do about this?

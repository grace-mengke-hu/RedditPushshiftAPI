I want to quit, but I live with two smokers.

I'm currently at a two-three ciggs a day habit, and I have quit before. I know how to do it, but I face a problem I didn't before. As the title states, I live with two smokers(my brother and step-dad). That said, I feel that I need encouragement more than anything.

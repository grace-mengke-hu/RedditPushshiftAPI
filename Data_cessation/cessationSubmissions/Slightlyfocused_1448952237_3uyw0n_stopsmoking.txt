I've not kicked nicotine completely, I vape instead of smoke but this comment I read today reminded me of why I should/need to quick completely.

 From the comments from the video of the uncontacted tribe on r/videos
We have the power of gods, yet only the wisdom of men. The next century or two are going to be most interesting, bizarre and amazing time to be alive. We might see the first 200 year old human, extinct animals brought back to life, you might surf virtual reality with your thoughts.. You might get robbed by a robot, or pass out in your robotic car as it drives you back home lol
W.e happens I think we all won the lottery prize of living at the very beginning of one of the most interesting times on this planet.

17 years. Pack a day.

I'm technically only about eight hours in to quitting thanks to a moment of weakness earlier. I started to get sick after quitting, so I bought a pack to taper. Just one every eight hours, I said to myself. Sure enough, that whole pack disappeared overnight.

Never again. Bought a pack of lozenges. They are awful, but it's what I've got to do. Restarting from zero here.

I will be three months cigarette free by my 30th birthday. Something I haven't been able to make in 17 years of smoking.

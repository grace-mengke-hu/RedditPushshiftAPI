I pinkie-promised my 8 year old daughter that I wouldn't buy any more cigarettes.

Today I pinkie-promised my 8 year old daughter that I wouldn't buy any more cigarettes. 

Did this right after finishing my last one.  I've been doing okay so far, so fingers crossed. I know it only gets harder but eventually gets easier. I've quit before but I'm praying this is the time that sticks.  

My daughter gave me that final nudge I needed to actually quit this time. 

She's 8. She's the most mature kind beautiful smart creative 8 year old in the world. And she's old enough to know that pinkie-promises are the real deal. 

Any advice welcome, support will be needed! Thanks.

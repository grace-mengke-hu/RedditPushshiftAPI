Need help quitting when drinking

I've been trying to quit for some time, I use an e-cig and most days that works fine but once I start drinking (generally at weekends) I just can't stop myself from smoking a cigarette. Any tips on how to prevent this from happening? Also, I know not drinking probably is the best way to go about it, but I sincerely doubt I'm going to be doing that.

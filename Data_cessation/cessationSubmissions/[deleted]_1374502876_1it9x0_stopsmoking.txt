One week!

One week and I feel great. I've noticed that my sense of smell has started to return and woah, I really didn't believe the difference would be this big.

It's been quite easy on me, I've found I don't even think about smoking anymore. I do have my e-cig, but I've already started to forget puffing on it from time to time.

I still haven't been drinking after quitting, which I see as the real test, but I have confidence in myself. After a week of not smoking I can really feel the difference in my lungs and breathing.

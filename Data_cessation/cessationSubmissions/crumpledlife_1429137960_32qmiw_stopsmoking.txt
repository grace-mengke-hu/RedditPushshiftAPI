I want to want to quit.

Wanting to want to quit is a big step for me. I am very emotionally attached to smoking. I have a chronic disability (non-smoking related) that means I cannot be very active or social. Prior to the disability I was very active. Since then, smoking has become one of my primary sources of pleasure. I am trying to cultivate other sources of pleasure (like drawing) so when I quit I'll have other positive things in my life to turn to. Any suggestions for other positive activities or things that could help my desire to quit grow?

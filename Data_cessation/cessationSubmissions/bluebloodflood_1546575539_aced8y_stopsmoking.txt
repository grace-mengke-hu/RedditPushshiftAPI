Made it to one year!

I keep remembering how much I hated waking up anxious thinking about how many cigarettes I had left. It was a constant fight, I was broke and addicted to it. 

Since I stopped, so much has changed in my life. I guess the fact that I decided to stop changed everything because it was when I started to take care of myself physically and mentally. 

I will never smoke again. I'm better than that

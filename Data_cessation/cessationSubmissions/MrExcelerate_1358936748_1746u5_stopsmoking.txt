Oddly Deep Dream

Just quit smoking about three days ago and I just got my first cigarette dream. I was playing darts with some friends and I threw my first dart and it didn't even make it to the target. So I asked my buddy if I could bum a cig. I lit up and got ready to throw my next dart. I threw it at the target and then all of a sudden "Clang" the dart hit's a big red STOP sign where the target used to be. I told another one of my friends to move it; to which he replied "I can't." Then I woke up at first mortified that I had smoked a ciggarette -- and then happy that I didn't.

TL;DR - I woke up and did the success baby pump fist.

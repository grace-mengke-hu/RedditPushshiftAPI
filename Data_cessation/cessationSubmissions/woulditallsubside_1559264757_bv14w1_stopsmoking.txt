10 year streak broken

Was a smoker for 14 years. Quit in 2008.

Girlfriend of 4 years cheated on me late last year. Completely fucking blindsided. Relationship was perfectly fine - living together, happy fur family, lots of fun, lots of support - then suddenly it it wasn't. The anguish lasted forever. I caved. I bought a pack of my favorite brand and a lighter. Carried them around in my pocket for weeks. One night after an especially bad blowout, I ripped the pack open. I smoked 3 in a row. The next morning I smoked 2. 

I'm goddamn glad I did. 

It annihilated any lingering curiosity of what it would be like if I ever had one just for old time's sake, just one. They're fucking disgusting. Even at one of the lowest moments in my adult life, they were just atrocious. That evening I crushed the rest of the pack in my hand and chucked it in a trashcan. 

I don't even give a shit about resetting the clock. I'm a nonsmoker. 

And crying out loud, those things are expensive as hell now! I paid like 12 bucks for one single pack!

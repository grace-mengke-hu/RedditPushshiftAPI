Seriously guys, if I could do it, you can too! One year and I'm never going back!

I smoked for a little over 20 years. I was the worlds worst quitter. I'd lie, bum from anyone, and pick up butts off the street. I read Allen Carr and he took all of my excuses away. I never could have imagined how great life would be as a non-smoker. I've got so much more time, and it is so much more relaxing to never worry about when I'll be able to steal away to have a cig. The truth is that you're not giving anything up, they never did anything for you in the first place. They just feed the addiction. The only thing that makes it better is not smoking.

Thanks for the help, guys!

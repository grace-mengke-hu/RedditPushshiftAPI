Let's hear it, people... your most shameful "I'm a smoker" moment.

So I've been and off/on smoker since about 17, and finally decided to quit permanently.  As I was thinking about it, I remembered all those terrible times that the addiction dictated my actions, and just how far it would push me to get that nicotine fix. 

I'm sure there are some good anecdotes from other smokers when it comes to those few times that your smoking just make you look terrible, or forced you to go so out of your way to have a cig.  Let' hear a few!

As for myself, probably the worst moment was me sneaking a cig in the bathroom on the LIRR (Long Island Rail Road).  It was only about an hour trip, and I had a cig in the morning, but the urge hit me like a ton of bricks.  As I was huddled in the restroom on the train, blowing smoke into the little vent so as not to get caught, I remember thinking, "What the hell is wrong with me?  I'm an adult and I need to resort to this type of nonsense?  Ugh."

A close runner up was desperately trying to find a way to run out and sneak a cig while visiting family in another state (who didn't know I smoked).  I was like James Bond, trying to come up with a way to get out of the house for enough time to have a cig, but also enough time to use a public restroom to clean my mouth and remove any residual odor.  The entire experience was horrible.

Of course, there are the moments we all go through as well.  Standing outside in the freezing cold or rain, fingers getting numb and looking like a fool.  Trying to avoid stinking up your car by adjusting the windows just so.  Having to excuse yourself from a good time to find a place to have a cig.  

Jeez, just typing this is getting me upset.  So many wasted years, opportunities and money.  Time to stop paying money to hurt myself over something so harmful.  Good luck, everyone.

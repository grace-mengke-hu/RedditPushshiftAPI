12 days smoke free!

Hey guys. I'm on my 12th day smoke free, and I must say- it's a hard one today. For the first few days I was struggling hard and then the cravings seemed to disappear. I was telling people how easy it was seeming to be, and now I feel foolish because it's really becoming hard again. But strangely, one of the things that keeps me going is not smelling stale smoke on my fingers anymore ðŸ˜‚ it's the little things! 

Anyway- just thought I'd share. I'm super proud of myself for getting this far and I'm just going to keep pushing through. We can all do this!

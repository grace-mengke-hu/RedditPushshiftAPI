Day 2, going well! I think the chantix and CBD is working.

Well normally I go insane if I go longer than 2-3 hours without vaping, but shoot I'm doing...just fine on 48 hours!

I feel like I'm going to be ok, and part of me was thinking of stopping the chantix because i feel "fixed". However, since I'm not having any bad side effects from it, I think I'm just going to keep taking as the Dr. prescribed it. If it ain't broke don't fix it right? Off to bed soon, nic free. T

This rocks!

Help me with this!

Hey,

I (21, m)have been trying to stop but recently I felt very depressed and started smoking again (About a month ago). Everytime I start smoking again I regret it shortly after since it makes me even more anxious and then I smoke even more. I'd like to escape this vicious circle. I didn't smoke for the last three days but now I relapsed and I feel like slipping in this habit again. So please help me with this. 


Tell me reasons to not smoke or tell me how you feel differently after stopping. Everything helps.
 
I want this thread to have something to look at when I feel tempted to smoke again.

Thanks!

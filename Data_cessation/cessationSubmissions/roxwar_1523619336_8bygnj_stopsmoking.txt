Only 5 days in

I feel like crap.

Ive stopped cold turkey and tbh its been a breeze, i dont want one nor think about them like i used to which has supprised me, but also is what brings me here. 

Last 2 days ive been feeling a bit fuzzy headed, groggy like im getting a cold. Last night i woke up at 3.30am for no reason at all and could not get back to sleep. Thats never happened before, i love my sleep and usually sleep through to tje alarm going off. I was shivering but sweaty under the sheets, and the last 2 days cant stop yawning and feeling a bit drowsy a few times a day.

Am i actually coming down with something or is this quit related? If it is smoking related does this feeling last long? Can i do anything to not feel so worn down and get passed it?

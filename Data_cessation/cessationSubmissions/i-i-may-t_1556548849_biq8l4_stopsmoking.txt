Ah, there it is...

I’m day 12 into my quit and I’ve gone through most of usual “side effects” of a fresh quit; all smokers smell like ashtrays and not smoke, tolerance for very spicy food has gone down (my usual taqueria now makes me sweat profusely), etc. 

However, in past quits I’ve been constantly hacking up goop starting around the day five mark. This time? Nothing. No coughing, no mucus, no sprints to the restroom mid-conversation. Nothing. Until now. 

I just spit a massive loogie (unintentionally) onto the fare collection box this morning on the bus while wishing the driver a good morning. I didn’t know what to do, so I just wiped it off with my sleeve as quickly and discreetly as possible and shuffled in shame to the back. Bless his heart for pretending not to see. Now I’m in the back seat with my hood up and trying desperately not to cough up the apparent broken damn of mucous currently lodged in my throat until I can get outside. 

Smoking is gross but quitting is grosser. I don’t want to have to go through this again.

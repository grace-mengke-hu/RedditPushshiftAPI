One whole day without a smoke.

It doesn't seem like a long time but it sure as hell feels it, hoping I can continue the streak. I weaned down from an average of 12 smokes a day, to about 4 a day over the last 2 weeks, to having not a single smoke today. No severe withdrawal symptoms yet besides a little irritability, wish me luck.

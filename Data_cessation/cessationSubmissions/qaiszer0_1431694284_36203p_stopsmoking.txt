My fifth day smoke free! Feels good

Hi guys, just wanted to share with yall since I don't really have anyone else to (my gf and all friends are smokers so they're kinda 'meh' on the topic). 

Been 5 days clean since I haven't smoked, realised that almost all my smoking was with friends, we would just chill and chat while having a couple smokes...So I've stopped meeting them and I didn't smoke on my own too much either.

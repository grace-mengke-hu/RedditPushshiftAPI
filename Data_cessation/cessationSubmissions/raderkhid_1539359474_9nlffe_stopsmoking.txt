Does anyone else get annoyed when people ask questions?

When I am struggling, fighting the urge to smoke, frustrated with myself, and someone asks me “Do you think you’ll quit for real this time? How long have you gone without a cigarette? blah blah blah”... I get snappy and irritated really quick. Like I’m already frustrated trying to control the cravings, I don’t need you prying.

I had my last cig last night and the first thing my gf asked me this morning was “Have you smoked? Have you vaped? Are you gonna try vaping instead or just stop completely? How many hours has it been? Do you feel like you want to smoke?” I asked her to stop talking about it. I know she means well but she brings it up constantly and I just get pissed off.

I was in a good mood this morning and then she wakes up and starts drilling me with the questions and now I’m irritated. Does anyone else get like this or am I just a b!tch? 😑

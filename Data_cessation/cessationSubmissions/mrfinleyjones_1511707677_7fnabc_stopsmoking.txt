stopping

So I started taking an interest in fitness and nutrition after alcohol abuse problems. First I quit drinking now I quit smoking i stopped for a week and felt so much better and relaxed but relapsed as I was feeling upset about personal issues. Afterwards I realised that one cigarette was a waste of time. Since I relapsed I had one or two when with friends socially. I need to stop properly. Wish me luck.

Day 21: Bench day! No snoozing, no drinks, no smokes

Evening world. Sitting in the parking lot of the gym at 12:45am after a long day of work but got my exercise in. It was a difficult day where nothing seems to work - every turn creates 5 more problems. I had a headache, was grumpy and just general blah. But I did not smoke or drink and had a reset around 7pm. Really have tried hard to be positive and focused these past three weeks but today was just off. Oh well:-) I got in a nice two hour workout and made a delicious salmon dinner for two. Drinking lots of water and looking forward to tomorrow. Starting to play around with the idea of eliminating caffeine from my daily routine. I've found that since quitting smoking and alcohol - I am consuming a lot more coffee/espressos. Thinking about switching jobs also to one where I am outdoors much more. My education and background would qualify me for the jobs I'm looking at - just got to take the jump:-) have ten days to apply - will see.

Anyways, I hope you had/have a great day! I will not smoke nor drink with you! Bed time

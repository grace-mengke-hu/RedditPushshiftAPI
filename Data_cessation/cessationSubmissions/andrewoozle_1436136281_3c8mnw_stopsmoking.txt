One more month until I'm one YEAR cigarette free.

I had my last cigarette on August 4th, 2014. With less than one month to go until I hit the one year mark, I have to say I feel great. I've saved a ton of time and money. I'm not self conscious about the smell of my clothes or breath and I've been hitting the gym consistently since I quit. I'm feeling better than I ever have. 

I'm still a part of a friend circle with smokers and I think that was the toughest part. First coffee without a cigarette, first concert, first beer etc. It's all in your mind. Find another way to distract yourself.

I think the biggest key for me was actually wanting to quit. I didn't get sick and become forced to stop like other times. I said to myself, "okay, today I am not going to smoke". One day turned to two, two days to a week, a week to a month and now I'm here. I wanted to keep beating my record and making it that one extra day.

Not sure if this will help anyone but I hope someone draws inspiration from it. Good luck guys, you can do it.

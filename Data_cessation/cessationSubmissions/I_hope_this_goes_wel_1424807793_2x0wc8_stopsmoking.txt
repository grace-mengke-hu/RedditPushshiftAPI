Went out to the bar last night with friends who smoke...

... And stayed strong!

Yesterday:
My friend came over early in the day to go to my movie premier that was going on later in the night. Him and I started smoking together about 5 years ago so every time I would even think about hanging out with him I instantly thought about smoking cigarettes... and I looked forward to it. Before he came over yesterday I thought it was going to be easy. It wasn't. I had so many cravings every time he would light up a cigarette in the car with me. 

Fast forward to the movie premier. I didn't even know if my short film was going to play or not (top 16 out of 80 were shown). It was so nerve racking specifically because my film was the last to be played! But I made it! I was so excited, I wanted to celebrate... And I instantly thought about going out to get drinks and smoking cigarettes with my friends. 

I would have to say that the hardest part was just **thinking** that at any moment all I had to do was lean over to my friend and ask him "hey can I bum one?" It would have been that easy if I wanted to smoke and right there... my number would have gone from 26 to 0. 

But I made it through the night. What helped me? I honestly can't put it in to perfect words but it's simply because I no longer *hope* that I will make it. I **know** I have officially quit and that I will never smoke again. 

Stay strong guys. The cravings are only seconds long.

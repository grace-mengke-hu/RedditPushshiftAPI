Smoking marihuana

Do you guys think it's okay to smoke weed, well i haven't smoked it in like 11 days and haven't smoked a cig in like 9. And my mindset has been set quite good to stop with smoking. Now i have a drake concert at the 27th and i think it will be a very enjoyable concert with a joint. Do you guys think it's acceptable to just smoke some joints at the concert. I hope i don't fall in the same habit again. And i probably won't since i've seen how much money it has saved me. It is a really big motivator for me. I will try smoke it pure. But i also love to smoke hashish which isn't really smokeable wothout tobacco. 

I would love to hear about your opinions thanks.

20 year smoker on day 4 of quit...

I’m 39 and have smoked at least a pack day since I was 19. I quit once successfully cold turkey in my late 20’s for 2 years. Went through a divorce and what I thought would be a few one day at lunch turned into another 9 years of smoking. I’m on day 4 of my quit and I think I’m going to make it! I read and listened to Allan Carr’s book and that has helped. Quite frankly I’m tired of feeling like death and tired of life revolving around when I can smoke. I miss out on family time because I can’t smoke as much. I’m constantly in a state of “when can I smoke again?” even when I’m in the middle of a damn cigarette. That’s not a way to live. I lived that way for too long. Thanks for letting me lurk in this community. It’s been helpful!

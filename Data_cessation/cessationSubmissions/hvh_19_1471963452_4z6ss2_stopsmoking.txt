Managed 18 hours.. :(

I'm so annoyed at myself right now. I really, really want to quit. I managed 18 hours and caved in. I just couldn't handle how I was feeling. I have terrible anxiety anyway and it was 1000x worse. I thought I was working from home for the rest of the week and with the bank holiday on Monday that would have given me 6 days to adjust and would help.

I found out I have to go to the office tomorrow and gave in an hour after that, the office makes me extremely anxious. I think I'm going to reduce as much as I possibly can over the next 24 hours and wait until it's really bad craving and start up cold turkey again after work tomorrow. 

I'm so sick of this habit.

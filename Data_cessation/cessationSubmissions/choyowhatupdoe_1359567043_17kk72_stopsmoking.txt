Most Useful iPhone App

Hi there guys.

I really wanted Cessation Nation to aid in my quit, especially because of the 'craving game' feature; I think this would be incredibly useful for those tough time. However, it appears that app isn't available for the iPhone. There are a lot of quitting apps for the iPhone, but a lot of them are expensive or look kind of crappy. What are some good ones? Willing to spend a little money.

Thanks & good luck to everyone here!

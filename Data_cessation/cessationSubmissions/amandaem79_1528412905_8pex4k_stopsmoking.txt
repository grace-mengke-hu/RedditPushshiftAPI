Tomorrow is my Quit Day (for the 4th time)

Hey r/stopsmoking, I am new to this sub. I have decided that tomorrow, June 8th, will be my quit day. I am 39F and am tired of feeling like crap and I want to get more active, so I need to cut the poison out.

I have smoked off and on for about 23 years. I quit once for 3 years, another time for 2 years, and last year for about 6 months. My habit has ranged anywhere from 7 or 8 cigs a day to almost 20 a day. Usually evens out around 10 or 11. This doesn't sound like a lot in the grand scheme of things, but I'm looking to make it ZERO in a day.

Anyways, I'm going cold turkey this time around. I've done it before, and it was hard, but I managed. I've done nicotine replacement before with longer-term success but horrible side effects.

I'll be checking out everyone's posts and reading the sidebar in a little bit. Thank you all in advance for your support. We can do this together (but separately, because, you know.. Reddit).

Four months smoke free!

Hey all! Just wanted to share this milestone with your fine selves. This sub has been very important to me since my decision to stop smoking, especially during that first challenging month. To be witness to so many people going through the same experience and to so many awesome souls much further along in their own journey... it was unbelievably motivating. At times I wasn’t sure I could do it, but now I can say with full confidence that I am a non-smoker. So, if you’re reading this in the earlier days of your quit where four months seems so far away, I remember how that felt. I hope this milestone of mine can serve as inspiration. Take it one day at a time. It will get easier. You can do it. I believe in you.

So grateful to this awesome community for the positivity and inspiration!

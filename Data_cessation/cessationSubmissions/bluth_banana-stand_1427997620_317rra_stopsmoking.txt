I have a question for those who have successfully quit their nicotine addiction via ecigs...

How aggressive were you in taking your nicotine mg down to 0? i started at 24 mg and did that for about 3 weeks, now im at 20 mg and plan to continue at this pace of moving down every 3 weeks. is this pace too quick? too slow? any other advice you have?

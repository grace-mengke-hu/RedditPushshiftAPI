I'm on my way but have a couple road bumps (serving and socially uncomfortable situations)

Tl;dr social situations are uncomfortable for me so smoking helps me get back in there. 

Hey. I'm sorry I haven't been here before. If I had maybe my journey would be shorter. I'm working on quitting and have am cutting down every few days. It hasn't been terribly difficult. Those days that I've cut down haven't been painful.

I've tried to quit before and telling people I'm quitting has been a bit of a double edged sword in part because it makes me feel proud and essentially give up but I'm proud for no reason (ie haven't achieved my goal).

So I have two issues. To be clear I have reached the point where I'm reasonably aware smoking does nothing for me though I can still try to justify it. Anyways:

1. I struggle as a server to not try to find an excuse to smoke. It's that one glimmer of hope in stress. Plenty of people have posted about it and the tips are helpful. I think I can get through this issue.

2. Social situations are difficult. I overthink it a lot. I know I'm awkward but sometimes I feel like I'm not a part or don't contribute well. I'm pretty social generally. But when I'm uncomfortable or feel out of place I can just run and smoke and rebound into it. I smoke the most when I'm uncomfortable. It happens at work too. I feel awkward around tables and need to escape. Then again I could be confusing cause and effect between social discomfort and addiction.

If you have any pointers I know I can close the book on this whole nasty habit.

You guys are great and thanks for bearing with me.

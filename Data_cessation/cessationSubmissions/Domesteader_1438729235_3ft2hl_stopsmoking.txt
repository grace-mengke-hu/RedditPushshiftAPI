3 Months- the smell...

3 Months in, and I feel really good.  I'm done for good, but my roommate still smokes, and at first the smell was really seductive.  I had to really resist, but recently it has become downright repulsive!!  I seriously smell cigarettes a mile away now, and I can't believe how different (and unpleasant) it is on the other side.

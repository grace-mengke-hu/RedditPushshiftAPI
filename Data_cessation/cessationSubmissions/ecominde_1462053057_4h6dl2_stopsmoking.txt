Hello non-smokers, so glad to find you!

Need to get this off my chest before I cave in or my teeth fall out.

Around May/June last year me and the fella switched from tobacco onto the vapes, so been puffing for just short of a year. About a month ago I became really ill with flu or something which badly affected my chest. I couldn't vape without coughing my guts up and for a couple of weeks developed a strong aversion to vaping - so no nicotine, yay!

So once I'd got better and my chest cleared up I decided to see how long I could go without the puffs. At first it wasn't too bad and I quickly replaced smoking with being (neurotically) productive: done a big spring clean round the house, including a massive declutter, buying and passing-on furniture, some bits of DIY. This really wasn't too bad! But now I need to sit down and write an assignment before Tuesday without smoking. After this I have my big final assignment of the module to go before the end of May.

Safe to say, stress levels are high and so is the desire to smoke! For now I'm using sweets as a replacement but I could really do with something healthier. I hate to think what all the sugar and gelatine is doing to my insides, and I really don't think my teeth can take a whole month of this! - and I say a month since I'll be on a study break then when I can clean, decorate and do any other neurotically-inspired housetasks I desire to silence this siren-like-beckoning of the nicofiend.

Anyway, glad to see there's a support sub here! Hello all, and thanks for having me :)

I'm finding it hard

Okay so I've decided to stop smoking, I smoke cigarettes and weed,I smoke around 6-7 joints a day and around 5 Ciggs a day the worrying thing is coming of the weed I've been smoking since 16 and it's the sleeping part I'm going to miss and can't find any remedies that will replace it,I'm really wanting to stop as always suffering from chest infections colds etc any advice on the best way to go about both please

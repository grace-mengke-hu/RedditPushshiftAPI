After 8 days of not smoking

I had a cup of coffee today, and it felt so damn good like I never felt that way with coffee before. I was abstaining since my last relapse but after a week of not having coffee it's was like it gave me a high and all the fatigue and worries I had, they were gone. 
P.s. I am a barista.
P.s. 2: it wasn't spiked.

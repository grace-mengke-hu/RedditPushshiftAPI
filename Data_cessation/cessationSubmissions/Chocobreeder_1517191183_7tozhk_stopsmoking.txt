Anyone else experience late side effects?

So I am coming up to 23 days since my last cigarette and have never looked back (22 years old, smoked 5-8 a day for 5 years) I feel really put off by the idea of smoking. The first week went great, got to the gym loads, jogging regularly and eating healthily. However, by the end of week two, I started to experience major anxiety and chest pains. As someone who has never experienced anxiety, this really took me off my feet. Now I am on week three the chest pains have become much less frequent but I am starting to get all the side effects that people seem to get in weeks 1-2: phlegm, cough, headache, fatigue etc. What's worst is that the side effects are making me worry (not helping the anxiety!)

Did anyone else get their 'smokers flu' later than anyone else? Let me know what you guys had to put up with. Good luck to everyone x

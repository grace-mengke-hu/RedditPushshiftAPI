oh man.... i have to restart

i didnt smoke for 6 days. then yesterday i bought a pack and had beer with friends. i smoked and smoked then i threw the pack away in the end of the night. now i will restart to stop again. 

i hate it, dont do it! and keep up your good stories. this will help focus better this time. 

i think: no beer in the first few months!

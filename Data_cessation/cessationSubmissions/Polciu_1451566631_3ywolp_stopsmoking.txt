Didn't expect it to go like that

Hey, I'm only getting close to my 24th hour. Just had food, went to bathroom, and normally I'd have a fag now. Yesterday I downloaded this app which shows what happens when you quit smoking, like oxygen levels etc. I can't even physically have a cig now even though I really want one because I don't want to ruin my score. The pack is right next to me and I've been sitting in my smoking spot for an hour, I still can't do it. I think I'm actually on my way out just because I don't like losing. Lol

Ps: Silly question, but does smoking half pack a day for 15 months have any permanent side effects?

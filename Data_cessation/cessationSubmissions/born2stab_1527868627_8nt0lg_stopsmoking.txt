My husband said to me, “please stop smoking - you’re too beautiful to die of lung cancer”....

...”I want you to die of loneliness when I die.”

How sweet. 😂 I think I *will* decide to die of loneliness instead.

I bought a vaporizer. I know it’s not ideal, but I’m gonna try that for a while and ween myself off.

Wish me luck!

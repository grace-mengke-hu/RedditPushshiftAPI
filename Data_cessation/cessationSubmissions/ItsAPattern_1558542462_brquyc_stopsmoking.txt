Another attempt for the post history.

Unless you're not smoking, you're just working off that last failure I guess. I quit Monday night and picked some up yesterday, but I'm back on the wagon today.

Something stressed me out and I picked some up yesterday, gave some to the homeless man outside the shop, and smoked through the rest quickly to get to here. I seem to always plow through my cigarettes knowing the big quit is on the other side.

I quit for almost 5 years from '01-05, then stupidly got back on them. Now is the time for a couple reasons.

- I'm wheezing consistently. I'm approaching a firm grasp on mid 40's and I know there are firm consequences I still may be able to reverse by completely quitting now.

- My LDR smoking gf is about to drive across country with me to live with me for the summer and if I don't quit before that happens, the two of us may enable us all summer.

- I've almost been smoking again as long as my big previous quit. All this time it's been a psychological milestone for me to not smoke again for longer than I quit, and I'm approaching that.

It's going to be tough going across country with her in a car with me quitting and her not, but I'm hoping to type into this little Reddit box and look at my quit app, and vape to substitute, but I have to realize I do this for my health and finances whether or not those around me change. I say others because I enjoy quality time on my porch with my roommate smoking as well, and I will miss this as well.

A lot of words, and I'm just freshly out of cigarettes and trying again. Here's hoping. I really need this.

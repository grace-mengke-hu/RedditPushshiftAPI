870 Days

I don't think about this subreddit much. I am grateful that I created a badge the day I quit, so that I can forever know the number of days I've spent not smoking just by stopping by. I usually come here when an old friend or random acquaintance mentions they are trying to quit, and I impart to them the thing that changed my life. If you are struggling with stopping smoking, read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. I smoked 20-30 cigs per day for 9 years. read the book over the course of 3 days, and was done. No cravings, no withdrawal, no bullshit, no relapse. 870 days ago. Here's to 870 more!

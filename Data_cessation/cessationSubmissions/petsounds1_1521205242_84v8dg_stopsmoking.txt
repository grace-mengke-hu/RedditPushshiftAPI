I feel like smoking again after years

Quitting was pretty hard for me a few years ago and I’ve gotten over all the hard parts. My sucked before, during and after I quit and quitting was a big struggle and I felt I had to learn how to do activities all over again minus the cigarette. Smoking was a way to deal with stress. Cravings would happen everytime stress came.
After years of self improvement I feel good now finally. This time it feels different like I want to smoke to celebrate. My life is finally good. Money, new apt, car, job everything. I feel that if I started again it would be different and I could handle it. Maybe a few here and there and just be relaxed with it.
Idk why I’m posting about it I just maybe want some input or something.

Almost 2weeks in

I’ve smoked since 1983. Since I’d recently cut back on social drinking I decided to quit smoking. I’d tried “quitting” a couple of other times but no more than 24 hours. 
  I’ve obtained some Chinese herbal drops for cessation. They’re working very well. I usually smoke some herb a couple of times per day but nothing of the Rasta level. 
  It’s nice breathing more deeply than I had two weeks ago and the air feeling cool when inhaled without hacking terribly. I can’t tell if my taste and smell have improved yet but I’m sure they will before too long.

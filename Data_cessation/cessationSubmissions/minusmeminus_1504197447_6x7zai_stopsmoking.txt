So I quit smoking 600 + days ago but....I ended up gaining almost 40lbs.. I have to admit i am pleased that I quit smoking and i feel better for sure but i also feel like crap. I've been to reddit looseit but have had no succsess.. I'm always out of breath prob cause of the weight i gained. I'm 38/m 6"2 255lbs. I would love to get back down to around 200 but my drive is just not there.. anyone else go through this after quitting and then turn it around. I need to im not healthy at all right now...

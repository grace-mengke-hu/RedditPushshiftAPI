Getting some serious cravings :(

I’ve not smoked in 3 yeas, and I’m now getting the worst cravings I’ve ever felt. Usually breath mints take the edge off but not this time. 

I even considered vaping and the only thing holding me back was the fact that I’ve been broke. 

Now my pay is in I’ve been debating with myself on whether I should go ahead or not. What should I do?

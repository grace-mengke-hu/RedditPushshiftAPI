All days should be like this.

So today has been completely different, only 7 days and I had no cravings at all. Been very productive and felt like I had unlimited energy. Shame I know tomorrow could be the complete opposite. But from now on, when im in a bad place I will think of today to keep me pushing through and remain smoke free. Stay positive people

You shall not smoke!

7 hours in at this point , no troubles so far but I want to be prepared. I'm almost 20, been smoking more or less for 5 years, about 20-25 cigarettes a day. 
I'm tired of smelling badly and starting and ending my days with something so useless. I need to do this for me and I will.

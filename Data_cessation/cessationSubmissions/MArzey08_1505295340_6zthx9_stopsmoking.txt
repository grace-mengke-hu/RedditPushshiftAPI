Things that I've learnt after a month of no cigarettes.

Just a small roundup of the things that I've learnt after being smoke-free for a month, hopefully it helps those of you that might be struggling!

1. Cigarette smoke does smell fucking hideous - the non-smokers were right.

2. Seeing the extra money in your bank account each month is infinitely more pleasurable than smoking ever was or could be.

3. The cravings DO subside, but you may find yourself thinking about smoking from time to time, especially when the mind is not occupied. This is normal, don't worry.

4. Exercise/strenuous activity is now RIDICULOUSLY easier and enjoyable!

5. ^ Including sex ^

6. Hangovers aren't nearly as awful (They are still quite bad, though).

7. Being able to have more restful sleep and energy throughout the day is thoroughly good for the mind, body and soul. 

8. Never succumb to thinking "just one won't hurt!"

I hope that this can provide some motivation for those of you that may be struggling! Keep going, it does definitely get easier, you're stronger than you think!

If you have any extra points that may help someone, please share them! :)

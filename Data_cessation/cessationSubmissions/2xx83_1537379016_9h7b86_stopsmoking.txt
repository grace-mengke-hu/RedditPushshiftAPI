Anyone care to share stories of using the patch? Did you use as directed for the length of time recommended? Did it work? Any cravings? Relapses?

Just started today. 8 hours so far with no real cravings, which is nice. I do wonder what it's like after 6 weeks when one begins to step down, though. Will it be a gradual enough reduction to be unnoticeable, or am I just delaying the inevitable?

Honestly I just really really really want to never smoke a cigarette again. Tried cold turkey again last week, made it through day 2 and got so unbelievably agitated I was having suicidal thoughts. That was bad.

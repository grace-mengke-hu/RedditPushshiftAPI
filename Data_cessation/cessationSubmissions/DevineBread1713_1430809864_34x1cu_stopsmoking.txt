Hey just found this through a quit smoking app. Really great post and support from what I've read and poked around through so far. I'm making a real effort to quit this. I've thought about but never really tried, had a dream that one of my lungs collapsed, woke up having trouble breathing and haven't really even wanted a cigarette since. Hopefully it stays that way, cause so far i havent had any of the miserable moments people always talk about.

Resetting the badge, been a non-smoker since this morning

Kept putting off quitting for a few weeks now, but now that it's summer I'm trying to save some money. While I could go out every day or two and buy a pack, I could also put all that money towards things like a new car... or the new Xbox coming out this year... or Chipotle... or my trip to Boston to see my girlfriend! 

Long story short, I slipped during my previous attempt to quit, but this time I won't fail.

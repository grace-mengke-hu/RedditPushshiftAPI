I have an idea to help people quit :) (Need Validation)

I recently thought up an idea I think would help people quit smoking and dipping! I am creating something similar to a Koozie but for dip cans and cigaret boxed that would have a small message on them like "Quit For Me Mom" or "Do It For Me Dad". We all know that our minds are the strongest things in the world and can make our bodies do whatever it wants. I think this could help keep people motivated to stop because you would be confronted with your "Why".  

If you want one of these koozies I could email you with the details. I need to know how many I need to make for when I buy all the materials :) I am really excited about it!

Here is a form for your email and if its for dip or cigaret boxes @ https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PhHMcRpVZz_a87D-GxJ8m92Rrd4nIdc3eeB3nmK2oGc/viewform

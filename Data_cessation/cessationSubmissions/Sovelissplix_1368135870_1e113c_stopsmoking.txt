I'm eight days in... but I have no idea what I'm doing.

I started smoking about two years ago in order to handle the stress of college. It suddenly turned into an everyday ritual that helped me relax and socialize.

For this summer, I didn't really plan on quitting, but I've been working with my father the past couple of days and smoking hasn't really crossed my mind. 

Now it's suddenly day 8 of being without a smoke and I'm starting to feel that quitting is a very possible thing. I would really like to take the time to quit this summer so I don't immediately go back to smoking when the college stress hits again.
However, I'm starting to develop a quick temper and anxiety. I'm also not sleeping well. It takes me forever to go to sleep and I find myself waking up in the middle of the night with my brain exploding with all sorts of thoughts.

Should I continue to keep myself busy and try and quit cold turkey? 

I'm afraid that if I do anything drastic, like throwing away the pack of smokes that is in my backpack, that I'll be tempted to go back to smoking. I'm not a heavy smoker, but I'd love to quit before it evolves into a terrible issue.

Any advice? :/

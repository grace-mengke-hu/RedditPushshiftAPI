A few weeks now, feeling depressed as hell.

Ever since I stopped smoking a pack a day a few weeks ago, I've been having mood swings and such. Today it really reached a new level, I just feel like crying no matter what happens.

Is this normal? Shouldn't the hard part be over? I feel a bit suicidal and extremely unhappy...

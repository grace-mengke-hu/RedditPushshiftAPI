First time quitting in 11 years.

Hello everyone. 

I'm tired of feeling guilty every time I smoke. I know how much it costs. I know that it's killing me. And today *my desire to quit is greater than my desire to keep smoking* .

I know it's going to be hard. I told myself that no matter what, just get through the craving. There's no reason to do it anymore. There is absolutely no benefit in smoking. 

Everyone that has quit before me had to start somewhere, and today is the day I quit.

I need your help. I was at the pharmacy 4 hours ago when I was going to buy a pack. It was at that moment I decided it's time. I bought a Blu E-cig. Is that going to help me or hurt me?

I also told a ton of friends and family i was doing this and also bought a shit ton of candy. I downloaded two "quit smoking" apps to motivate me. I'm going to browse this subreddit for the rest of the night. 

Any tips would be great. If it helps, I'm 26, smoked a pack a day, everyday since i've been 18.

bring on the withdrawals...

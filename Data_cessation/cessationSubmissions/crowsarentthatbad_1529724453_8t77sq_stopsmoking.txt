Chest pains after quitting

Hi, I am nearly 3 weeks smoke free and my biggest symptom is chest pains. It is all sorts of different types; sharp pains, aching pains, anywhere in my chest, almost random. I have no intentions of going back but I am unsure why I am in more pain since quitting smokes. I have been to the doctor twice and both times they said it was due to anxiety. Has anyone else experienced something similar?

Making some progress

I set a goal to only smoke 7 cigarettes yesterday but kept battling myself mentally that I should just indulge and enjoy my last few days, however, two times passed that I was going into 2 hour classes in which I could not smoke, and did not give in to that one on the way, right before. I made it through yesterday beating my limit of 7 with only smoking 6. I also found that while in the classes, I was ok. But I'm still struggling with that "indulge while you can" thinking. I've smoked 3 already today and am feeling super discouraged. Tell me I won't exceed no matter what. You guys are amazing and all of your affirmations really give me that extra strength that I think might help me to overcome this. 

I cannot tell you all how thankful I am for your posts. You guys are strangers to me and I am receiving more support from you than my loved ones. Really, I am so grateful.

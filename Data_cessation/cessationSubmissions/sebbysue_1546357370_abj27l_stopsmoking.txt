A Really Happy New Year!

137 days and counting. AND I made it through my first  New Year’s Eve party without a cigarette. What is even better? I didn’t even think about and I was around people that smoke!!!!! I still have hard moments of days but not as many and it is easier to shake them off now. It feels so good to be free of them. I now know what a prisoner I was to cigarettes. The only thing is that my short term memory seems to have suffered a bit. Has anyone else experienced that?

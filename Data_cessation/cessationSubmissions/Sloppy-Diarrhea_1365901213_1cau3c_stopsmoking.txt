Latched on to me like a leech

I have been smoking for roughly 3 years now, i have recently started to hit gym and gave up for about a month, i realised how much money i was saving and improvements in my health but in the end i gave in and started asking people for cigarettes instead of buying them, i really want to give up completely but dont know what to do

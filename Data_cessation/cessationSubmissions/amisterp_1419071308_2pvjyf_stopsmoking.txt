Quit for 2 years, caved

Hey,
Only posting this here as I need to tell someone I'm giving up again. Even if no one reads this. I'm 27 and smoked from 18-25. I gave up using patches and found it relatively easy. About two weeks ago I went to my girlfriend's granddad's funeral. Her whole family smoke, as does she. We went out for drinks a few days prior to the funeral and as usual a couple of drinks turned into 4 or 5. There was something about the stress of the funeral approaching, and with the stress of being around her family (I'm quite quiet and shy) that made having a smoke so desirable. I regret it.

It's now been about 2 weeks of smoking and though I have the patches, the last two attempts failed. I'm still quite stressed and I know I used to lean on fags a lot when I struggled.

Anyway, this is it. It's time for my third attempt. I'm going to have one last fag and then put on my patch. I have work today so that should keep me occupied.

I don't feel ready. I haven't on any of the other attempts either. I don't want to smoke, but I really have a love affair with it and it's hard to just cut that off me. But I did it before and I have to do it again. It's not good for me and it's expensive.

I'll post tomorrow to say if it went a success. The first day, even on the two year quit, is always the hardest for me. Experiencing all my routine but without the punctuation marks that cigarettes insert between EVERYTHING.

I pray I can manage it.

Edit: I'm going to update this as the day goes on. I need to for my own sake.

- I'm out of the house. Last fag.  I've no tobacco with me. I work in a shop so could buy some but I won't. I'm tired of the shitty looks people give me when they see I'm smoking - the feigned coughs. As a shy person, having that type of attention is upsetting. People who do that are cunts. When I gave up for two years I didn't do that shit, I went out to the porch with my girlfriend so she could smoke and even when it went in my face I didn't cough. Like those people don't have things they could change. Fuck them. It's 10:52 on the 20th of December and my last fag is over. I'm scared. I'm scared of failing again. I'm scared of failing and remaining a smoker. I can't afford that shit, financially, and with regards to my health. I'm not unhealthy with my diet and though I don't exercise I'm not overweight nor underweight. I childishly hope someone replies to this, I want support.

- I'm tired of smelling. Again, to repeat myself as nauseum, I'm a shy guy, I hate standing out and being noticed, so living with the knowledge that people can smell that I smoke embarrasses me. Plus I don't even like the smell. It's musky.

- It's been 6 hours and I'm feeling OK. Trust mind numbing unskilled labour to keep the mind busy yet also empty. I'm already fearing that tomorrow morning will be my downfall. Gotta just stay strong.

- Coming up to my 24th hour and things are going OK. Waking up and but smoking went really well, this is the first time in the last 3 attempts that I've managed it. Feeling positive. Mad dreams, will consider taking of my patch before bed but only really want to do that when I know that "first crave of the day" is no longer as much of an issue. Also stomach pains, but I remember these from when I used patches before.

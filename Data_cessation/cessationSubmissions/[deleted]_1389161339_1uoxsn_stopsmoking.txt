HELP!

I have been a smoker for about 4 years.  I started my freshman year of college, and living in a small college town in eastern Washington with little to offer in terms entertainment, I grew to love smoking cigarettes.  Smoking gave me an excuse to sit for 5 minutes thinking and pondering about whatever I felt like at the time.  As an introverted person this was the most appealing reason to smoke.  And I lit 'em up.  But, alas, I'm coming to a point where I realise that the physical toll of smoking definitely isn't worth whatever benefit my irrational-self thought I was getting out of it.  I have tried several times recently to quit smoking, albeit not with confidence, but I'm here confidently saying I no longer smoke cigarettes.  I have decided that my rational self is in control.  My rational self knows that my perceived benefit of smoking, that 5 minutes of solitude, doesn't require a cigarette. I don't plan on looking back.

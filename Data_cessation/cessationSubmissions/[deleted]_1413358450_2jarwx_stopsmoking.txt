Made it two days but feeling so tempted

This is the longest I've gone without smoking since I started, so that's cool! But I'm not feeling entirely motivated. I quit because my bf quit and I know if I smoke he's going to keep smoking (if I wasn't around he wouldn't have started again to begin with). We fought a little today and all I want is to not care and not be afraid what he'll say and to go buy a pack

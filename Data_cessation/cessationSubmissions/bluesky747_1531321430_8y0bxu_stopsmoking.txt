I want a cigarette!!!!

After arguing a little about quitting with my boyfriend for the umpteenth time last night, I impulsively put my cigarettes in his backpack so when he went to work, I wouldn't have them all day to be tempting me. I guess I could just go buy more, but I'm not going to. At least I'm going to try very hard not to.

I did take two so I could allow myself only two today. I already want one...I'm trying to save them. I'm telling myself I don't even like it that much. I kinda also do, though. 

I think I'm gonna talk to my dad about quitting too. We live in a duplex kind of house with my dad, and he also smokes, so part of our bonding time consists of us chatting and smoking on the porch, which I kind of like. Me and my dad don't spend much time together, because I'm pretty introverted. So is he. 

There's a gym up the street, he already has a membership, and he doesn't go. My BF and I are signing up, and I'm going to try using that to replace cigarettes, and wondering if maybe my dad wants to quit with me and we can start going to the gym together instead of smoking. He's in his 60s and probably won't change, honestly, but I would like to have him around a couple more years, and be healthier, and if quitting and going to the gym might do that, then I want him to do it. 

Does this sound like a good idea? Idk. Ugh I just wanna smoke. Also I wanna have a baby soon and I clearly can't smoke and be pregnant so I guess I should quit before I get pregnant so its easier later...is it easier to get pregnant if you don't smoke?

Sorry this is so all over the place.  I felt like I just needed to talk out loud to someone or something...just needed to put all these thoughts out of my head and somewhere else. 

Have a good one.

Stopped Smoking. Surprisingly easy?

Figured I'd post this here, since I recently quit smoking. My trick... Bronchitis, or RYO tobacco? Got sick for a week and a half, of course I didn't smoke during the sickness because it was a raging joyride of coughing and mucus. 

I have been smoking for about 15 years off and on, and have, over the past few years, developed a habit of smoking RYO (Roll Your Own) cigarettes. It is my opinion that this type of smoking has made the major change for me. Back in High School and College, I smoked Camels. Recently, I have been smoking $12/lb rolling tobacco. It was great for the wallet and most importantly it was great for me not smoking as much. 

I must say, I might be unique here. My friends, who smoked the same stuff, didn't have this 'reaction', but I have, over time, started smoking less at a time. I would roll one RYO cigarette and only smoke half of it. In my mind, it was repulsive after a certain point. 

I don't think this is a situation where the tobacco threw me off, but that I mindfucked myself to the point where I dry gagged when I tried to draw on my smoke after a certain point. 

Either way, after many years of smoking, I started smoking RYO (loved it!, good tobacco is one of the joy of joys), started smoking cheap (but good) tobacco, less was required (normal cigarettes are SO LONG!) and eventually I was able to quit via a decently harsh sickness. 

Of course, this might not be a real quitting, but it is great. At about ~4 months now and have only had one craving. After the first week I was solid. 

I feel like I've been cheating.

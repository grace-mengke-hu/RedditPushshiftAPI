Good motivators when the craving hits?

I look at pictures of the outdoors and people doing crazy outdoors activities. I always wanted to live the "outdoors lifestyle" with mountain climbing and kayaking and backpacking and whatnot, but smoking got in the way. When I think I might relapse, it's a good reminder of what I'd be giving up.


Anyhow, that's my motivator. What's yours?

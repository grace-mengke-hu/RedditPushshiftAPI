Anyone else notice a decline in heart rate?

I stopped smoking cold turkey about 2 1/2 weeks ago, it's surprisingly been easier than I had expected after being a heavy ( pack - pack and a half a day ) smoker for almost 8yrs but I can't help but notice my bpm has dropped significantly. Before quitting I had a resting pulse of around ~100 and now it's anywhere from 58-70 and probably even lower at times! I feel much better but this is somewhat concerning to me after being used to my heart practically beating out of my chest for almost a decade.

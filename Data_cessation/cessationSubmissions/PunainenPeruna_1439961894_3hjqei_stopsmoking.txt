Day 9 -

Days seem to go really fast . 
Right now I don't have a job or school (first time that happened to me ) 
Searched 12 jobs this far but they have denied or not answered . 
So I feel sad that I don't have the money to give for myself that would have been spent on cigarettes. 
One of the reasons I quit . There is no money for it . 
And I can't even award myself for it .. 

I know this may be a little off topic kind of post but there is just a little of things I need to get off my chest . 
I'm a really creative person and right now I'm working on making a book . Half of the book will be done by me so I will be doing 100 illustrated pages . 
But as a creative person . The only time I took breaks from drawing was when I went for a smoke, I'm not sure what I should do now as a break. 
I don't want to sit in a chair all day so I guess I could go for a little walk when I have breaks .. 
And I was thinking on only going outside and listen to one favorite song on my spotify list . 
Hope something like that works 

How are things going for you ?

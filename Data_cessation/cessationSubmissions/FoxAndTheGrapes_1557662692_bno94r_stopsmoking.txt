Quitting vape is way harder than quitting cigarettes

I quit smoking cigarettes four summers ago and went three years smoke free. I’d still smoke weed but I was totally off nicotine. Then last summer I drunkenly got introduced to the Juul and have been smoking it intermittently ever since. 

From my experience trying to quit both, the Juul is so much harder. I take in way more nicotine since it’s much easier and convenient to smoke the Juul. It’s been a process but I think I’m truly committed now to put the vape behind me too....trust the process.

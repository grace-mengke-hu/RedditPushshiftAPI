Haven't ever smoked but...

My girlfriend is a light smoker (2-3 a day) and lately I've been very tempted to try it with her. I've read how awful it is, how addictive, and how just one seems to lead to another, but I can't shake the temptation. Is it okay to have the temptation? How should I go about suppressing it or should I let the temptation hang around? Should I try one just to see what it is all about? Any input would be much appreciated.

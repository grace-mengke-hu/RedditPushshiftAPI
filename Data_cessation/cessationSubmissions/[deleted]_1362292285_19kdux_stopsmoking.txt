One year smoke free...what a difference

I can't believe it has been so long, the feeling is unreal.  I remember exactly how disgusted I was with myself when I chain smoked two in a row, and was thinking about having another.  That night I threw the pack in the trash, and then read Allen Carr's book the next morning (thanks to this sub!).  

The hardest part about the process is realizing that it's not that bad once you actually want to quit.  Carr says it better than I can, so read the damn book!  

Good luck to everyone, and keep up the great work

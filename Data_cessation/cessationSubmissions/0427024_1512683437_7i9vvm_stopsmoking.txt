I just need to vent.

Well I've been trying to keep it clean. 2 week and stgaying possitive but this has cost me really really really much health at this stage.

I had a panic attack, I had hallucinations, then I have a disease called VHS-2 in my spinal cord, it's a virus and stays dormant if I have no stress and sleep well and stuff. Guess what?! I'm not sleeping, I had a panic attack and I throw up every fucking single day.

I will not smoke again but this shit is hard as fuck.

Now. I did vent. Thanks.

Haven't smoked for 72 hours and now unbearable cravings. Should I fill my e-cigarette with nicotine juice?

Hi, guys. Have been smoking pack a day for the last 4 years. I have suddenly just decided to quit three days ago and haven't smoked since. I have been vaping occasionally when the craving kicks in, but I have used 0 nicotine juices. But now, the cravings are really unbearable, and I am always spacing out. Should I fill in with nicotine juice or the nicotine is completely out of my system and its just a psychological thing?

P.S Sorry for messy writing, quitting is hard people

Edit: Hey guys, I just wanted to say thank you so much. Initially, I was just challenging or, I should rather say just testing myself how long I can go without a cigarette. I somehow managed to pass two days, and told myself why not make it three. Then, one thing led to another and the thought of just quitting snapped into my head. 
When first posting this I thought, hell no one is going to reply to me and when I cannot hold any longer, I'll just head to store and grab a pack. But everyone in this subreddit is freaking awesome, giving me more motivation than I ever had in my life. I even went to gym today because I was feeling motivated. You guys just inspired me hell a lot! Cheers, guys! Goodluck to us all. 

P.S. Again sorry for messy writing, quitting is indeed hard.

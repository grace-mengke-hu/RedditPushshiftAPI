How does stop smoking feel about e-cigs?

I've been trying to quit smoking for about 4 months now, to no avail.  My girlfriend recently bought an e-cig for us.  It's very nice, and burns my throat real nice when I'm puffing on it, which satisfies my "need" for a cigarette, if that makes sense?  

I've noticed that my packs are starting to last me a couple days instead of a day (I'm a pack and a half smoker) which has got to be good, right?  Is it a problem to replace the tar filled cigarettes with Nicotine?  Will I still suffer the wheezing breath and coughs that have started to noticeably appear?  

I started smoking a little over 3 years ago, so I haven't been smoking forever.  I started smoking as a means to cope with my stress, and it worked fabulously.  I used to work a job cleaning, and that contributed a lot to my smoking.  Since most people in maintenance/general labor seem to smoke, it was an easy way to bond with people at whichever apartment complex I was working at that day.  

I also did minor biohazard cleaning from time to time, which was not always the most pleasant, and I frequently used smoking to deal with some of the things I had to see working there.  It got to the point where I was smoking 4 packs a day. 

Anyways, is there a chance that the e-cig could potentially replace normal cigarettes?  Will this erase some if not all of the newly developed health problems I'm experiencing?

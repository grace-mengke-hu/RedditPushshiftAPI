Almost 290 days and I just want to smoke

It's interesting why we want to smoke. This isn't so much a post on me wanting encouragement to not smoke (it would be nice). But it's more of a suggestion to observe your life, what's going on, and why you all of a sudden get that urge to smoke again. Sometimes it's just cravings, other times it's what smoking represents in your life. When you recognize the destructive nature of smoking and the destructive force behind wanting to smoke, you can make an aware decision. I can walk down that destructive path and try and sabotage gains made, or I can continue doing what's healthy and good for me (I'm not really talking just about quitting smoking). 

To you all, continue doing what you need to to improve your lives. Smoking is just one reflection on the choices we make to do what's best for ourselves.

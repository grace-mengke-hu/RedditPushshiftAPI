Here we go.

    Thanks to reading this sub I’ve finally gathered to courage to quit. I’ve been smoking about a pack a day for 6 years now. I’m only 13 hours in and already it feels like I’m at war with my brain. It feels like it’s searching for endless reason to go buy a pack. I’ve tried quitting multiple time and failed. I’ve just accepted the fact the first couple weeks are going to suck and I’m determined to beat the addiction. Any advice or things that have helped you guys make it through the early withdraw would be cool to read. Also I’m just doing in cold turkey this time, no vaping and no NRT.

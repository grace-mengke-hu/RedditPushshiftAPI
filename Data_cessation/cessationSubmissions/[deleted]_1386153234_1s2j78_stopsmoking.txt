Day four :)

Well, this is the longest I've gone without a cigarette in years, I've tried slowing down and quitting cold turkey, but it never worked. I would always tell my self and other people that I was trying to quit, which sometimes I did, but barley put in effort most of the time. I even got an E-cig at one point, but that didn't work for me. Now I have a E-liquid Vaporizer (I know E-Cigs and these are pretty much the same thing, but I like this MUCH more than those damn E-Cigs.) and it's actually working for me! The brand is Lava if anyone is curious, I'm using this and I really don't miss smoking at all, I'll admit yesterday I tried to hit my friend cigarette once, but I had to give it back to him, it didn't even taste good! I love this Vape, because of this, I know I will be able to break free from being a slave to tobacco :D

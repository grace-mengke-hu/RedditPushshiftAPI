Over two weeks in, and now my partner has decided he wants to quit too!

I'm feeling pretty good. Last time I posted I was getting really aggro at everything, but I'm feeling good. I'm using an e-cig so feel like what I've achieved is great in terms of the toxins I'm avoiding, but means I still need to deal with the nicotine addiction at a later date.That said, my partner informed me this morning that he is quitting today. He's had a chest infection for about a month and decided he needs to quit. So pleased for him.Also as a random side note, I dreamt someone handed me a cigarette as it was the last one. I considered smoking it but then thought that I've got a good streak going on and I don't want it. Nice to know I'm a non-smoker in my dreams too!

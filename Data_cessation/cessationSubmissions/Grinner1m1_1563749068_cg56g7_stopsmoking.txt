Dealing with mood swings.

Hey peeps I'm just over 2 weeks free of the nicotine trap. But have run into bad mood swings that make me very irritable and my mental focus suffers from time to time. I know it's my addiction doing it and it will pass with time. 

My question is what are some of the things people have done to cope with the mood swings and lack of focus?

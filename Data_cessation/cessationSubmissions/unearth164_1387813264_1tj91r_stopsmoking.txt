I passed my first real test.

So last weekend I had gone to a concert with a smoker friend and we were in line waiting for the show to start. He whipped out a cigarette and apologized knowing I recently quit. I told him he can smoke up and I won't mind. I didn't. Now that part wasn't the test, that was very, very easy.  The real test was 2 nights ago.

The same friend picked me up to chill and we had a third friend with us. Both of them smoke and were pretty down in the dumps that day, so they were chaining and telling me their previous night consisted of the same activity. This was a real strain on me and it was hard not to ask to bum one, but after hanging out with them for 3 hours, I managed to stay away from smoking one, though I did inhale a bit of second-hand and wondered why I wanted that crap in my lungs in the first place because it bothered me and I couldn't breathe fresh air in the backseat. 

Just wanted to share. :)

How long does it take to be able to tolerate others smoking without having to suppress an urge? After you can say that you have quit smoking, is it okay to occasionally have one socially (akin to social drinking) ?

I quit smoking, drinking and weed all cold turkey a week ago and since then have not left my home, as I fear access to these will make me relapse. But soon I will start going to my classes again and that makes me wonder, will I ever be able to hang out with my friends again, even those who do not do any other substance but just smoke cigarettes. It is rude and unreasonable to force people to not smoke just due to my presence around them. So when will that point come (looking for a time-frame) when I can hang out with a group of around 6 to 10 friends all smoking (not weed) and me not having to fight off an urge to get a smoke. And also, sometimes it is rude in the company of regular smokers to not smoke. So is it okay if I smoke maybe one or two from time to time while I am with people?

Worldwide struggle

I wrote this in a comment to an Australian. He was asking some advice regarding cigarette cravings and well I felt it was worth sharing to all of you to get inspired: 

Well From the other side of the world to you, in Canada I had been smoking for 8years, huh 8 years. Anyways, i quit 3 weeks ago today. I dont know very much about quitting just like you but one thing i know for sure is that I know that everyone who smokes wants to quit. People smoking outside that you cross pat
hs with and you think for a second "damn he must be enjoying that cigarette" is complete bullshit. Everyone wants to quit and everybody has the struggle of trying to quit. So here i am at the other side of the world, i could tell you to workout / chew gum/ whatever but you know this already. So i will say the other obvious thing you are not alone ! This struggle is worldwide, you got this ! We got this! And Smile through the urge like you dont give a fuck.âœŒ

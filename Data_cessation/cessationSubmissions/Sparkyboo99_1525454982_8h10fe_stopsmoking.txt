8 mos quit and strong cravings lately!

8 months smoke free and suddenly experiencing strong cravings this week! I think related to nice weather and the arrival of spring after a long winter.   Warm sunshine and spring greens have me remembering days in my youth at college, outside with friends sharing a smoke.....arg. I know this is just a silly nostalgic temptation....

I am so grateful to smell nice, have more money in my pocket, and to no longer have that smokers cough.  I don’t worry about ruining my health or voice and my skin looks better.   I don’t stress about needing to stop to get cigs, or when I’m going to be able to suck one down.....I’m not going to let a few cravings take me back to the ol smoking ball and chain.

Thanks for reading all :) enjoy a smoke free fun weekend.  What is your favorite way to deal with persistent cravings?!

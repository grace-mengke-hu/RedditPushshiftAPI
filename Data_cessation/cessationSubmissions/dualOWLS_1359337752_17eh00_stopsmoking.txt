I feel like i'm back in my first week...

I think I know why though... the last time I quit smokes I made it to a month. I feel like the cravings haven't subsided at all at some points in the last week. Last night I was practically BEGGING my friends to bum me one but I told them to not give me one no matter what when I quit about 40 days ago. The weird part was that I wasn't even that drunk last night... some residual study drugs and ~6 beers. Just one cig. No, Just a pull. You can only smoke on the weekends. Can you guys help me down from this cliff?

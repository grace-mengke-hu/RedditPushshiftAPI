No time like the present

I keep telling myself that I'll quit tomorrow or after some future social event when I know that I'll "need to" smoke (because alcohol makes it way too easy to chain smoke). The problem is that tomorrow never seems to be today and social events will always be a thing.

Now the day is today, for a lot of different reasons that have been around since way before today. But mostly, I'm just tired of waiting for a day that never seems to come. 

Hope you all get through today with me!

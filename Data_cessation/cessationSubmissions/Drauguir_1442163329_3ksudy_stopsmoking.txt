A selfish friend can get in the way of your quitting. Be careful!

Even when I told my best friend (I don't think she's my "best" anymore) I had quit a month ago, yesterday, while we were drinking, she was all the time suggesting me to have a smoke...and she isn't even a tobacco smoker! She just wanted me to smoke because this way is easier to smoke weed (weed + tobacco) and she wanted to smoke too. 

"Smoke, man! it's just once. Good! This is how you roll!"

I finally gave up when I was pissed drunk, and after having refused multiple times. And, obviously, bought a pack later, a pack that I've already thrown into the garbage.

Next day I told her: I'm feeling miserable because I went back smoking. And she said: "Don't worry. You'll overcome it".

I fucking hate her now. Some people are so selfish it's unbelievable.

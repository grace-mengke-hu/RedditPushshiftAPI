Help!

I have been smoke free for 2 years now, mostly thanks to "Easy Way". But lately something has got into me. I smoked a couple of times when I was out drinking... I felt like shit in the morning. But I'm afraid my old addiction is creeping back on me. Any advice? Encouragement? Anything? Has anyone been in this situation? I thought I would never need to smoke again...

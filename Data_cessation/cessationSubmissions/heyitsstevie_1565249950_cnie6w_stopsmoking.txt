does anyone else get really depressed when they quit smoking?

specifically, I want to ask people who have smoked for a long time

do you find your emotions absolutely flooded when you quit?

every time I quit I am just overcome with emotion, tears, etc and it's so overwhelming

I can't seem to find any information on this

maybe I shouldn't say depressed, but there is something huge going on there

do you just power through it? does it get better?

it ruins my quits every single time. I just feel like I can't take the emotions anymore and I end up smoking again even though at this point I honestly hate cigs and find them disgusting

any advice appreciated TIA ðŸ’•

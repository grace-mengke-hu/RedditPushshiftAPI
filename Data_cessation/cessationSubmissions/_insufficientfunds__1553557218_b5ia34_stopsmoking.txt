Day 1

I managed to avoid smoking at work which is a huge trigger. I was low key irritable today. And thinking about it most of my shift, I chugged water and sustained from going to my outdoor cigarette oasis out back of my work. 

I got home today (I live with my parents and my son) I got really upset with my dad and went and puffed one of his cigs.

I’m disappointed but, man, I’m fucken miserable without a cig. I cried a lot today. Feeing better now and I won’t pick up a cigarette tomorrow !!!

I really hope to maintain my mood better, I found myself being snappy with my son which I don’t like, and the fight with my dad was unexpected and emotional.

Hope everyone is doing well

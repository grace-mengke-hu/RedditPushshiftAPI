Well shit

~~168~~ 0 Days cigarette free

~~146~~ 0 Days nicotine free

I had a hard day today, build up of several hard months. The stress and feelings of being trapped in my situation reached it's peak, after a morning of tears and thoughts of self harm I broke down and bought a pack on my lunch break reaching for that old crutch as a way to relieve some stress and pull me out of my funk at least for a little while. I smoked 2 of the cigarettes, awkwardly lit with my cars push button lighter found in the depths of my glovebox, felt terrible about myself and gave the rest to one of the smokers at work.

Back to square one with new information about myself. I thought I was free from those things, but down on my list of solutions to stress they're still there. I've gotta figure out a way to get them off that list or this is gonna keep happening.

Day 4 complete

At 6pm it'll be five full days since I've had a cigarette.  I have to be honest, other than a few nights of really terrible sleep, the physical withdrawal wasn't that bad.

The mental/habitual withdrawal however has been horrible :(  I think I've not stopped thinking about a smoke for a single second lol.  I had a massage last night and I swear I thought about smoking a few times :(  other than distraction, anyone have any tips to share??

2 weeks!

Alright made it to the 14th day mark! I'm so proud for making it this far and grateful for our stop smoking veterans here for the inspiration they are all of the members for their support and assistance. Today was rough.  My families on the east coast and I'm in California.  Feeling a bit homesick.  Could not afford a plane ticket home for the holidays.  I have been taking the money that I am saving on not smoking towards a trip home. Merry Christmas everyone

Vaping... smoking cessation or alternative to smoking analog cigs

I've put my story on here before and now i want to share my experience. i was a smoker for 20 yrs, i quit 100 times and failed 99. There are a lot of people talking bad about vaping as a cessation aid. I am here to tell you that it worked for me. I started with 18 mg/ml and with every bottle or 2 i dropped a step ( 18,12,6,3,0) i haven't had a cig in 48 days and i haven't had nicotine in 36 hrs. i have done a lot of research on vaping and there aren't any real studies on the effects of vaping only the aspect of a cessation aid which states that vaping had a lower percentage of long term quitters than other NRT methods. Matter of fact i read that nicotine inhalers and patches are a common treatment for neurological diseases so nicotine in and of itself can't be too bad. But who am i to say what's what all i know is i have been nicotine free for offer 36 hrs and have yet to have my normal withdrawals at this point and i owe it to vaping

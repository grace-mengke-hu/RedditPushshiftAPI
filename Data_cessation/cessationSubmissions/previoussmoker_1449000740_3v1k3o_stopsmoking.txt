I had a puff after 39 days... still counting am I wrong?

So I made it until now - 39 days in - and I was down the pub, lads had fags and I grabbed one. Took a puff, decided I was past that and put it out, ripped it into three pieces and decided I wouldn't break my quit for one lousy cigarette.

But I'm hone now, and it's on my mind, shit, would one puff seriously count as a full relapse? It was hours ago and I don't feel like I want a smoke, I'm still counting, but I dunno. Should I be feeling guilty? I had literally a puff a few hours ago, is that enough to ruin my streak? Thanks. I hope not.

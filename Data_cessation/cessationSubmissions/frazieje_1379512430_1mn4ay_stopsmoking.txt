6 months and feeling great!

I am very glad I made the choice I did this past March.  No nicotine products for 6 whole months.  Any of you who are just quitting or thinking about quitting, you won't regret it I promise.  Stay strong for the first couple weeks and vigilant for the rest of your (now longer) lives!

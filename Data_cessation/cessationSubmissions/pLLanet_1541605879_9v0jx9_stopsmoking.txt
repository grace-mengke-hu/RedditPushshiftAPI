I didn't smoke a cigarette with my sister!

Smoke free for almost two months now.  Dinner at my sister's house usually consists of us escaping outside for a butt a couple times during the evening to get some quiet chat in (she has three young children running the house).  She needed some sisterly advice last night, and didn't want to ask since she didn't want to sabotage me.  We talked for a good half an hour - she got to unload, and I successfully didn't bum a smoke.  Success all around!

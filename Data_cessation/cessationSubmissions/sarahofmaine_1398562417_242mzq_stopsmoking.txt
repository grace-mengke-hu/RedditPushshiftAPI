It's been 36 days.

I don't really have cravings because obviously the nicotine is out of my system. I just miss smoking. My days seem like a big run-on sentence without the punctuation of cigarettes. I know I can do this, but what if I don't want to? I want to but the complete joy of not smoking hasn't hit me yet. Anyone else have this experience? This too shall pass, right?

Can anyone relate to a stuffy nose?

When i was smoking, i developed a sorta ''permanent'' stuffy nose. I've felt it being kinda ''filled'' all the time and grew self-conscious of it. It got even more worse after i smoked more than ussual (gatherings, parties etc).  Sometimes, one of my nostils would be blocked for a whileafter events like these, like having a cold that doesn't go away.
I was wondering, is this a common thing between smokers? Does it go away eventualy when you quit? It's really annoying, because it makes my voice sound pretty wierd because of the ''blocked nose'' effect. I got used to it, but now, when i'm 18 days clean after 7 years of smoking, i wan't my old, clear voice back...

I need help

I’ve been smoking for about 8 years now. I’ve tried to quit many times. But the temptation is real. What are some good ways to quit? I’ve tried the patch and they only ease me, but I did the full cycle suggested and as soon as I was “done” I broke and smoked. I know a lot of it is mental, but I need to quit...I want to quit and I feel so weak for not being able to :(

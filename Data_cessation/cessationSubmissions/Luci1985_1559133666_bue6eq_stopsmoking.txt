Grumpy as HELL!!

Hey everyone! So I am on Champix, I am not smoking but I am SO GRUMPY! I snap at everyone, I have no enthusiasm every little sound annoys me, sounds like the printer, voices of people, even people walking past my desk all things that I didn't even notice before!! I haven't smoked for 34 days now. Is it normal that I am still so irritable and feel like I am going to murder someone?? I love that I am not smoking, don't have to stand in the cold, saving money, lot's of benefits oh and not dying from emphysema when I'm older. But geez I am dying for a smoke, well not actually for a smoke but to not be so bloody annoyed all the time. I don't even wanna do stuff, I feel stiff with annoyance. Is this normal for so far into quitting I mean 34 days to me sounds damn long. I'm scared I'm gonna crack. I stopped drinking as well because in the beginning each time I had a drink, I smoked. So can't do that. I feel so upset, like my life is SUPER boring. Like I want to go do something and then I'm like, nope! because when I go out for dinner I love to have a wine and a smoke and now I can't do that so now going out for dinner is not fun, might as well stay home, order takeout and watch tv so I can avoid those triggers. Anyways, sorry for the rant, I just feel so blue:(

6 months today and a stone heavier...

But being a non-smoker is more important than being a little bit overweight, right? Very proud of myself for getting this far, I can’t say it’s been easy and even now I would love to have just one cigarette. But I’m not doing that to myself or my children anymore. And I guess I’ll lose the extra weight some time...

4 days in... And I have to brag.

My SO and I both had our last cigarette on NYE. We've been together 3 years and have never known each other as non-smokers. 

I love the casino. For Christmas (before we had fully decided to quit) my boyfriend told me he was going to take me to the casino and give me some money to blow. Perfect gift IMO. 

However, I started thinking this week that it would be impossible for us to go with all that cigarette smoke and temptation around. I decided we needed to wait and go when we were both more ready. 

However, I woke up this morning, 4 days into quitting, and REALLY wanted to go. I decided that I wanted to go and be able to do this thing that I enjoy at SOME POINT. So why not now? If we could get through it only 4 days in, we could do anything.

Well, we just got home and neither of us relapsed. The smell was more disgusting than tempting and it was really quite sad to see all these people SO consumed with smoking. 

We were there for 4 hours and it was definitely not without some cravings. But I cannot even say how proud I am of both of us for being able to get through this. 

I feel so strong and I hope this lasts. It's  good to see someone you care about taking care of themselves. It's great to feel like you're doing something so good for yourself after years of this unhealthy habit. 

Good luck every one in your journey!

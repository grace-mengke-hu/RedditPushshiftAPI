Pack-a-day smoker for 9 years. Long time lurker here. Random circumstance caused me to basically quit cold turkey.

So I started smoking 9 years ago when I made my first film and broke the bank. Stress always kept me lighting up. Pretty soon I was addicted, psychologically and physically. 

I tried here and there to "quit", but never put any real effort into it. Running out of cigarettes would stress me out even more. The best I ever did was half a pack a day (around 10 cigarettes). 

So, 4 days ago, I had 1 cigarette left and was planning to run up the street to buy a new pack. Just then, a massive thunderstorm hit and it started pouring. I literally said, "Fuck it", and grabbed my e-cig. Before I knew it, I went 48 hours without a real cigarette. Now, 4 days later, I think I'm on a decent path to quitting. 

Falling asleep at night has been tough, but other than that, things aren't as bad as I thought they'd be. 

Just wanted to say "thanks" to you guys and this subreddit. I've been visiting for a few months and finally have something to say.

How do you feel about smoking dreams?

Since I quit i i've been having these dreams - out of nowhere I realize that I have half-smoked cigarette in my hand or that I'm in the middle of taking a puff. It feels bad, but it helps - whenever I'm awake and thinking of a cigarette I can remember that bad feeling of failure and stay strong.

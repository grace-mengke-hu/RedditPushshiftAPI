Smoke free for 6 months!

So about 6 months ago, I moved a long distance with no money to live with a friend. Having no money meant i couldn't buy any smokes. I didnt want to ask my friend to buy them for me, so I just didn't smoke. It sucked. Bad. For about a week, every time i'd get drunk I'd hate everything. Slowly though I started to care less and less about smoking. I didn't honestly realize i hadnt smoked for so long until about a month in. I was just like, woah....I quit?

SOMETIMES NOW, I still get the urge to smoke, not a huge one. But almost like, "Man I remember how good cigs were with this coffee". And I'll wish for a second that I had one, then be like, meh fuck it dont care.

I have had a few dreams though where i've smoked someones cig or found one on the ground and smoked it. Woke up feeling horrible for a sec. Weird.

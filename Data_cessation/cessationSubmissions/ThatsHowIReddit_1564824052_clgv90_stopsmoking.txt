It's not cancer but...

It's been a long week. The doctors have been running x-rays and CT scans and MRIs for two years. Last year we found out that dad has a tumour in his head. Eventually the doctors confirmed it appeared benign and they wouldn't operate unless there were signs of growth because  the possible complications outweigh the benefits. Since then there have more MRI scans which show no growth but hearing tests that show approximately 30% loss. This seemed to give my dad a new perspective on life and trying to reduce his bad habits - smoking included.

Back to the present and my dad smokes as much as ever. He had a suspected chest infection which he was given antibiotics for. Unfortunately he had a very bad reaction to these and this worried the doctors so they booked him in for a chest xray. After the second xray they were told to prepare for bad news as it was possible that dad had lung cancer. After a tense wait this week the doctors called to confirm it was not lung cancer. The CT scan showed it's Emphysema...

My dad has smoked for 40+ years. He knows he needs to quit and has tried before and really struggled. He used a vape pen for a short time but he stopped because he doesn't trust them (popcorn lung).

Any success stories or methods that might work? I want to suggest hypnotherapy but I will need to convince my dad it's not BS.

TLDR; dad's been diagnosed with Emphysema after 40+ years of smoking. He wants to quit. I'm looking for suggestions and any personal experiences to help him. Has anyone had success with hypnotherapy?

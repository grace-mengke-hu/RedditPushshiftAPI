A section from Allen Carrs 'Easy Way To Stop Smoking' that really resonated with me

At this point he's talking about the initial stage of quiting;

"After a few days of torture we decide that we have picked the wrong time. We must wait for a period 
without stress, and as soon as that arrives the reason for stopping vanishes. Of course, that period will 
never arrive because, in the first place, we think that our lives tend to become more and more stressful. 
As we leave the protection of our parents, the natural process is setting up home, mortgages, babies, 
more responsible jobs, etc., etc. This is also an illusion. The truth is that the most stressful periods 
for any creature are early childhood and adolescence. We tend to confuse responsibility with stress."




Even though this verges away from smoking a little bit, I really liked this.

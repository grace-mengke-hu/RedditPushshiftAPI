I've become a hypochondriac since I quit smoking, am I alone?

I quit cold turkey five weeks ago... Since then, I'm convinced that I am dying. Am I alone in this? I would think that I should have felt that way WHILE smoking, not after! Our motivation to quit came from the death of a friend (cancer, not smoking related) and I feel like that may be part of it. Also, my mother was a hypochondriac and I feel like I've aways brushed anything I feel under the rug because I don't want the attention. I'm thinking that a fairly simple solve to this is to just find a doctor and make an appointment for a physical. I mean, the best thing that could happen is they tell me that I'm fine and then I can stop worrying. But, honestly, I'm afraid that I am actually dying, and I'm afraid to admit that I've killed myself by smoking for so long.

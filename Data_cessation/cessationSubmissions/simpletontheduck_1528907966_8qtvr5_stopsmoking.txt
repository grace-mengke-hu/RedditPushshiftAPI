Been a hell of a journey just to get started.

I've been a heavy smoker for almost 30 years, minus a few years when having my babies. I have come to the realisation I won't be around to see my future grandkids if I don't stop right now! 

BUT! patches, gums, vapes never worked. Only Champix did. But that left me suicidal. So, I'm at the last chance saloon and have been prescribed Zyban. Now, in order to go on zyban I had to endure a crash course in withdrawal from Citalopram (which I had been on for 5 years). The withdrawal was horrendous, but I did it in 2 weeks with an extra clear week before starting Zyban. 

Today is day 6 on Zyban and I feel like I have flu. I'm dizzy, feeling low in mood, exhausted (but I also have fibromyalgia so that doesn't help!) and frankly feel like shit... And I haven't even reached my quit date yet!  Tomorrow I am supposed to up my dose to 300mg in 2 tabs. Frankly, I'm nervous as hell. 

Please, can anyone share their experience with Zyban, and will these symptoms pass? Is this all worth it? I no longer know.

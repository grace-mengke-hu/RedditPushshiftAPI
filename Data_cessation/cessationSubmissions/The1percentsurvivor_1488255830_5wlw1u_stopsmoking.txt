Tomorrow is the start of my new life

I got the smoke free app, I usually smoke about 5 death sticks a day (mixed in with weed).
I'm 8 days clean of weed and I think it's time for me to quit smoking everything.
First time posting in this subreddit and am wondering if you have any tips/tricks or advice for a semi light smoker

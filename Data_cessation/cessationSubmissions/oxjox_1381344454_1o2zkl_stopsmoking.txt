How addicted to nicotine are you?

According to wikipedia, nicotine ["has been shown to be more addictive than cocaine and heroin."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Dependence_and_withdrawal)  I'd like to ask those who have successfully quit if you feel nicotine is so terribly addictive and if so how did you beat it?  I heard in the past that the nicotine molecule is a certain shape that only causes addiction if your biochemistry is susceptible to it, like a puzzle piece.

What I'm really curious about though, is how I can be an occasional social smoker and go days or weeks without smoking.  Why am I not addicted? Or am I?  Over the course of smoking on and off for 14 years, I've always been pretty good at quitting when I want for as long as I want.  The only time I ever crave a cigarette is when I'm drinking, otherwise I'm not interested.

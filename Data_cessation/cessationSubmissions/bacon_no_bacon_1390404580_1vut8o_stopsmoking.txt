Question about the 72 hour period - I'm normally a night smoker, but I quit at 4pm on Sunday - making tonight night 4. Is 72 hours just a number?

I'm trying to figure out: will my evening tonight (which is technically after 72 hours) be more or less difficult to handle?

EDIT: I made it past that mark. I think it is easier. Rather than being a constant, low level craving I have to distract myself from, it's not something that I'm thinking about all day long.

Since I will likely be out in the woods for my 1 year, I'll post now!

I cant believe its already been a year since I quit. I made a bet with my friend to see who could go the longest without smoking when we were drunk one night. I was about to smoke and someone gave me shit about how much I was smoking, so I said fuck it and we made the bet. Well I technically won but he welched like a bitch, but I went a full 6 months without even puffing on a cig. I went back home, where smoking in bars is still up to the bar owner, and the neighborhood bar still allowed it. I was really drunk and my friend lit a cig and I bummed a few drags off it, and it honestly made me feel like shit. About 2 months later I bought a pack for a car ride and smoked a few but gave the rest away when we got to where we were going. Some of you probably dont consider me a year or whatever, but I am no longer addicted to nicotine and haven't smoked consistently since I quit, so I consider it valid. If I can do it, you can do it. I would not have believed you a year ago if you would have told me I would be smoke free now. I was smoking upwards of a pack and 1/2 a day, and quit cold turkey. I feel great, I can ride my bike for miles and barely get winded, and I've saved THOUSANDS of dollars. Not that I have thousands of dollars to show for it, but whatever. I should have thrown $5 in a jar every day and saved up, but oh well. YOU CAN DO IT! I didn't use gum, or patches, and I read about 4 pages of Carr's book.

Need motivation!! Helpppp. Day 17

I need some motivation please. How do I do this successfully?! Hopefully easily as well.

Can anyone please fix my logic:
I read Allen Carr’s book. I understand that the cigarette is the one that creates the cycle of calm-agitated-calm-agitated.. but then that first cigarette really makes me feel calm. It’s the cycle after that I don’t like. Like being a slave to the cigarette and the addiction. 

This is my third attempt to quit this year alone. 

Whenever I craved for cigarettes/ vape, I jogged. I do HIIT workouts now and took new classes (hobbies). 

I’ve been using vape for more than 5 years and it just got me addicted to puffing even more. Every time I throw my vape when I quit, I end up buying a cigarette. And this is exactly what happened yesterday. Puffed 3 sticks.

I’m contemplating now if I should buy a vape again. I just don’t want to be stressed about this anymore. Any suggestion?

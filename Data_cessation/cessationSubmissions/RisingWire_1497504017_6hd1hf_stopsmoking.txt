Some appreciation for this place, and encouragement

I wanted to say thank you to the people that post and comment in this place. Through all the successes, setbacks, advice and above all, the desire for living smoke free lives, I've found this sub to be a great source of positivity in my own journey. 17 days later, I'm smoke free and loving it. To all those just starting out, or feeling discouraged, don't lose hope. Take it one day at a time and believe in yourself. And for crying out loud, pick up a hobby. That really, really helped me. Maybe it's something new, or something you used to do and enjoy. I've started running again, as well as reading books more. I have a bass guitar I've neglected for too long that I'm planning on spending time with soon. Just keep your mind busy. Stay strong, fellow quitters. **You can do this.**

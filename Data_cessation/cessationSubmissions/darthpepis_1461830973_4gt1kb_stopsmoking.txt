I always relapse when I get a job.

I'm about to start a new job at a movie theatre as a bartender. I don't mix drinks though; I just serve wine and beer. I'm scared because I always end up going back to cigarettes when I start working because I get stressed on the job. I'm trying to look for less stressful jobs, so I'm using this one as a placeholder since I'm a broke college student. I'm gonna try to stay strong and hope I don't encounter too many asshole customers.

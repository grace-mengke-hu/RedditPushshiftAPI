Im Done, No More Smoking.

Dear Reddit. As i type this out i am finishing the last cigarette I will ever smoke. Its been four years now, since I started this nasty habbit, and I WILL NOT continue it for another day. I am done, because i am realizing that I care to much for my health and wellbeing to continue down the path that it will take me. I will never purchase or smoke another cigarette, I will use my vaporizer when I get a craving, untill i can wean myself off of nicotine for good. This is the start of my journey to become healthier, and I vow that I will see this journey to the end. Wish me luck, boys and girls, and any tips are greatly appreciated. I am done, I QUIT!!

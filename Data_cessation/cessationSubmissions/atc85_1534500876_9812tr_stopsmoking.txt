One month approaching and ...

So I’m finally about to reach that one month milestone. Thing is, I’m barely hanging in there these last two days. Lots of shit at work. My damn brain keeps thinking it’s needs a cigarette to cope with all this BS. What are some ways y’all cope? How much longer will these kinds of cravings last? I’m kinda starting to think that I’ve smoked so long that my body and mind just won’t be right without em.

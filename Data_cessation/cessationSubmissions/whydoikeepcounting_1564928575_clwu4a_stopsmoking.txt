It’s just getting harder...

I’m two hours from finishing day 4 smoke free. Most of the day I was ok. The cravings were more frequent, but manageable. That is, until my wife decided to take the evening off and leave me with the kids.  Probably shouldn’t be that big of a deal, but it ended up triggering me big time. She wanted to take a walk downtown with the boys after picking them up from early education class. I told her I wasn’t up for it and just wanted to take it easy at home.  So she says she’ll just go on her own and for me to take her kids home. I was surprised she wanted to go alone, but she told me she had no interest just sitting around the house. I figured she was going to be gone for an hour or two, but then three hours comes around, I’m fighting with the boys to finish their dinner, take their bath, get in bed, etc and I can feel myself just on the edge. I’m snapping at the kids, my wife isn’t answering her phone, and more and more I’m getting on the verge of losing my shit. At least three times tonight I apologized to my 3 year old for scolding him. I know I’m just frustrated. My wife comes home close to 10 pm and I just lay into her and storm out. I feel like such an asshole.  I hate that the kids had to deal with me like this tonight. I kept trying to calm myself with deep breathing, but the frustration wouldn’t pass and I’d end up raising my voice, telling them to lay down, stop pinching me, go to sleep, etc. I think I was more angry at my wife because in my head, I was blaming her absence for my kids having to deal with me in this state. I left the house, took a brisk walk, now I’m writing this. I didn’t smoke, though the thought of just buying a pack crossed my mind, and I didn’t drink, though running away to the bar crossed my mind too. But I don’t feel good about myself right now. I may not have had a cigarette or had a beer, but I definitely feel that I lost control.

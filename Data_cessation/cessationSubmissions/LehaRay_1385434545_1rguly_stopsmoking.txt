This is crazy!

I just spent 25 minutes looking online for the ingredients in Belmonts and Benson & Hedges Menthols in Canada to no luck.

The manufacturer (happens to be the same for both brands) does not even list Canada as an option to view the ingredients.

This is absurd! 

Does anyone know where I can get this information that is current and reliable? 

Thanks!

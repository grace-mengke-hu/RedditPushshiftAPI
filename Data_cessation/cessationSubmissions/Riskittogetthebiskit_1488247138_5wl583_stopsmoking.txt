Depressed on day 15 and 16

The first 2 weeks went fairly good, even through some serious stress I didn't smoke and I got through life fairly smoothly. All of a sudden this depression hit me yesterday and I have barely gotten out of bed the last 2 days. I can't do anything right now. I just tried to leave the house and decided to turn back and go back to bed. I ended up taking one of my boyfriend's cigarettes and lit it but immediately put it out and now I'm back in bed. I guess I'm really really on the edge right now. Has anybody else had a similar experience?

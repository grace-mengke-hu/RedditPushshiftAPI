Raising Money for the American Lung Association

Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to raise money for the American Lung Association. My company is one of the sponsors of the event and we have formed a race team as well. I have been a redditor for years and love all the communities I am a part of. I know this is a long shot but I was hoping you would consider donating to the ALA via the following link:

Any amount of money would be so helpful. Even as little as five dollars. Thank you again in advance from those that do decide to make a donation.

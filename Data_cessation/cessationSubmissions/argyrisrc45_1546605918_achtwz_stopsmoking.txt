2 weeks without smoking, turning into a drama queen??

Hi everyone!I was a heavy smoker for 10 years.In the last years i've made many attempts to quit but i relapsed every time.Now i'm trying to quit again.I had my last cigarette in Dec 15 and now i can manage the urges to smoke.
But the problem is i'm turning emotional.In the first days i was angry.I mean reallly angry.I was direct, and i was speaking without thinking.Then in the next days i was feeling normal.But right now it's the worst part.I used to be a cool guy.Now i'm moody, emotional and feel like everyone is against me etc.Drama is everywhere around me!I hate the way i'm thinking!I take everything seriously and feel unappreciated.I hate these days and wondering when it will end.

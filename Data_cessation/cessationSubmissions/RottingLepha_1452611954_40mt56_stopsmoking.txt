Bowie is helping me quit

I'm 33 now, started smoking when I was 14. I managed to quit for a couple years, but picked it back up this summer.

Kept meaning to stop, always the same excuses: stress, events coming up, etc...

Yesterday I woke up and David Bowie was gone. I went to have a cigarette and stopped, staring at it and a picture of my favorite musician on my phone.

I didn't stop yesterday because I think Bowie would care. I didn't do it because he died from cigarettes (he didnt). I quit yesterday because all my life he has been there, playing in the background. He helped change my life, mold it into what it is now. I want him to influence me one more time. So since then any time the cravings get bad, I watch a Bowie video. It helps. Gonna still be a long 5 days... ugh.

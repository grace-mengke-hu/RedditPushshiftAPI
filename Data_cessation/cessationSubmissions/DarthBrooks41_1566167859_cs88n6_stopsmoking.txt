I quite two weeks ago and it doesn’t seem to be getting better.

I smoked a high nicotine vape, more or less, constantly through out the day for a few years. I quite roughly two weeks ago, but the craving and being easy to aggravate have only steadily gotten worse. The worst part is, I quite only to see if I could and for no other reason. I’m not sure if I’m going to go back to smoking, because truthfully, the anger I’m feeling now seems less healthy then the actual habit. To those of you out there who have smoked for a little bit, in comparison to 20,30, or even 40 year smokers, how long do I have to bottle this up for? Two weeks has been pretty rough, with not sleeping well, frequent sweating, and my anxiety issues firing on overdrive constantly, so how much longer would I have to wait to be “nicotine free”? I’m really not sure if I’m going to keep this up for much longer, as of right now, I have no reason or motivation to continue to not smoke, but figuring out what I would be dealing with will help be ether continue to quite, or at least give me motivation for if I start back up and quite in the future, when the reason I stop is to actual quite and not out of curiosity.

It's time to do this.

I'm going to ramble and keep myself pretty angry to push through this nonsense, so if you could, please bear with me.

I've been smoking for 11 years. I started for incredibly inane reasons while in the Army, and I've been paying for that foolish, reactionary decision both financially and physically ever since. 

The damage it has done to my physical performance (I'm quite fit and very proud of it, and the fact that I suck wind despite my fitness infuriates me) has been profound. My income is solid, but I find myself scraping by here and there because I spend so much on cigarettes. The same story everyone has, really, it's just helpful for me to type this out and remind myself.

Anyway, I guess the point here is that it's time to roll, and posting it publicly gives me a sense of accountability to someone, even if it's just internet strangers.  I don't have a lot of support to rely on, so I'm going to have to be accountable to myself and the community at large, I suppose.

Hello fellow quitters! I'm in my early 20's but I have been smoking for almost half of my life (9~10 years). I just recently stopped after my latest birthay.

I am new here at /r/stopsmoking. I just admire all you long-time quitters. I am hoping to achieve as long clean periods as you have. More power to all!

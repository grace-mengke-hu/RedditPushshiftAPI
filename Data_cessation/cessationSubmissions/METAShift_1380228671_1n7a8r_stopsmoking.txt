Non-smoker for about 3 months, really craving a smoke right now...

I quit smoking completely about 3 month ago, cold turkey. I noticed lately that I've been eating and boozing more, but this week I've been feeling particulary bummed out. I'm sitting now at home, alone, and I'm really fighting the urge to drive to the gas station and get a pack of Parliaments. It doesn't help that I quit mostly due to a certain person that I now feel more distant from.

I'm haven't been working the past week(holidays and such) and most of my friends are away, so I just feel stuck, bored, and alone. I guess I just wanted to vent a bit, dunno if it will help.

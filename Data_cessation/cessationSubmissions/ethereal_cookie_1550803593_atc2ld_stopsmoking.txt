What to do with Juul

A lot of my friends have Juuls and I’ve been hitting them a few days a week when we hang out. I’ve been debating about buying one until I finally did it yesterday. I know I’m at the point where if I stop now I would not yet have withdrawal symptoms. I really like the head rush and the appetite suppressing effects, which is why I got one. I smoke cigs occasionally but not as a habit.

I feel really gross and guilty for even buying one, and part of me wants to quit while I’m ahead, but another part of me wants to just say fuck it and go with it. My friends do it and function normally, but this shit is expensive and I don’t want to have to quit later on with bad withdrawal. 

Do any of you wish you has quit when you were in my shoes? What are the reasons I should stop now? Is it really so bad? Does anyone have experiencing quitting juul and what was it like?

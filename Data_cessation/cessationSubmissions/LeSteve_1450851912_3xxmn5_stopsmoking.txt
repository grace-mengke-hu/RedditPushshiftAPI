I'm stopping all nicotine today

I haven't had a cigarette in a while, at least long enough to stop the worst of the cravings.  I bought a vape to use with high nicotine liquid to try to get over it, which has worked for months now.  Today, however, I felt myself craving for my vape more than ever, just needing that last bit of relief.  I know it'll be hard, but I think I can quit that too.  I've come to rely on it to relax me when I'm down, but I need to learn to do that on my own.  I'm throwing my vape out today.

I hope this is within the rules of this subreddit.  Thank you all.

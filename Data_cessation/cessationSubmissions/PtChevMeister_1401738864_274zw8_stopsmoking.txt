Unsubscribed a year ago because I thought I don't need you anymore but here I am again...

Okay so here we go,

I was smoke free for over 14 months. I quit smoking 17 Dec. 2012 before going to a ski trip with my girlfriend who quit one week later. We were super happy and all. I Unsubbed r/stop smoking three months later and thought I would never have to come back but... 

Here I am smoking maybe a pack a day when with friends. My girlfriend broke up with me four months ago and I just had my twentieth birthday and since the brakeup I don't give a Fuck about myself anymore. I feel horrible about smoking but I just can't get myself to quit again. There's is nothing really to go after since the brakeup and I feel like smoking just doesn't matter since there are no goals in my life anyways... I ran out of ideas to get myself to quit. Can you guys give me a little kick in the ass? 

Sorry for any bad spelling, only lived In a English speaking country for a year. 

For background I have been smoking four years before the first time I quit. 

Thank you in advance for anything you can shoot my way.

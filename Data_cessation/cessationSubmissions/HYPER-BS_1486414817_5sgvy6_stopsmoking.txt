How I stopped.

I'm an addict. I consume. That's just the way it is. So how did I stop smoking?

I focused on how I felt not 10 seconds after I finished the cigarette because that was usually fine, but 1 to 2 minutes afterwards. That might not seem like much, but paying attention to what I tasted and how I felt going up a couple flights of stairs back to my office really helped me get over my cravings. Once you get a craving try to immediately concentrate on the negative aspects of cigarettes.

Of course, if you don't recognize any negative aspects this isn't going to work for you. Just a suggestion as it worked for me.

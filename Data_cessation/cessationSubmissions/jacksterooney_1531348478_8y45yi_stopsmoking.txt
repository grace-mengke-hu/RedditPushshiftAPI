How long did it take for you for it to become effortless?

I remember from before I smoked as having no idea why anyone did - I had zero impulse to, and was happy without having nicotine in my system.

My worry quitting is that wanting to have a smoke will always be in the back of my mind, and life will never be truly enjoyable again. Does this ever change, and if so how long?

Quitting is a lot harder than I thought but I can do this.

I "stopped" smoking last Wednesday but unfortunately, have had 3 smokes since then. My last cigarette was on Sunday so I've now gone 3 days without a cigarette and I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty hard. I'm only 20 years old but I've been smoking since I was 16 and I just want to have good health before I'm 21 and actually have a bit of money so i can treat myself to something that'll actually benefit me.

I'm also on a tolerance break from cannabis and haven't toked since last Monday(Feb 17th) and that's a lot more difficult than quitting cigarettes I think. I've been a bit edgy the last few days and there's nothing I'd love more than a joint. I'm planning on having this tolerance break last a month so I'll be back toking on March 17th. I think once I go back to toking, it'll make not smoking cigarettes easier.

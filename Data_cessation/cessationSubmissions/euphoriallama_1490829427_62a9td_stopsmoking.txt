Smoke free for a week & still arguing with myself

Hi y'all. I've smoked for about 10 years on & off, sometimes super heavily sometimes hardly at all. For the first few years, that gave me the false impression that I could "quit when I wanted" (ha). I've only ever officially tried to quit three times, with (clearly) no success. I hate committing to quitting; it makes me feel panicky. The cravings are hard, but what feels even harder is telling myself that I'll NEVER have another cigarette again. It's such a mindfuck because for the most part even though I know smoking is terrible for my body and in theory I want to live a long and healthy life, the me in the moment just wants to do as I please, whenever I please. (That's some classic addict thinking, isn't it.) I just want to shut off the part of my brain that's interested in arguing the merits of quitting and just COMMIT, because quitting is hard enough without all of the internal banter about whether or not "quitting" really matters, or what if I want to smoke socially, or could I ever have just one, blah blah blah. 

Also, I take ADD meds, which makes the cravings especially intense, and maybe also intensifies the obsessive thinking.

What's more, I'm currently between jobs/looking for work, and things are difficult in my personal life, so in some ways I figured if I quit now when things are bad, I'll know I can get through tough times in the future without smoking. And, when things (hopefully) get good again, I'll be able to enjoy them without the guilt I felt when I was smoking. 

In the meantime, though, this fucking sucks. I'm having a hard time feeling "proud" about quitting when this one terrible part of my brain keeps telling me quitting is dumb and unnecessary and we're all going to die so what's the point. So glad all y'all are here too. If you have to struggle, it's good to struggle with others.

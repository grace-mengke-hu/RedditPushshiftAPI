Was it healthier that I smoked outside?

I was thinking about this when I saw a redditor post a picture of an ashtray. It's not something I ever used as I always went outside to smoke, and that got me thinking, even though I was smoking a cigarette directly into my body, had I smoked all that time in a room, is that worse, or it would make very little difference. My thinking was I would be breathing in smoke even when not puffing away, or is that wrong.

July 11th is the date!

So, on mentioned date I'm going to stop smoking for good. It's been 5 years since I smoked my first cigarette. I picked this date 10 days ago so I can fully understand why i don't want to go back (I'll be smoking for 5 more days). Needless to say this is a dumb addiction. Everything from lack of smell, lack of taste, lack of air, lack of a solid erections, feeling of slavery, hiding from people, trouble interacting with girls cause I just don't feel clean. I'm also starting to look older than my age. I would talk a lot about quitting to my ex girlfriend, and I didn't quit (1,5 years before). I assume I look dumb while smoking, I'm a tall guy, most think that I play basketball. And probably the most important thing - TIME. I'm still young (23), my life is basically waiting to happen. "I do not want to waste it on cigarettes". I prefer healthy life with the money I didn't spend on cancer sticks.
 I do have a question if anyone is reading this: what are the benefits benefits you didn't expect when you quit?

Looking for advice on getting started (with stopping)

Hi all! I'm aiming to quit smoking and I'd love some support.

I've tried to quit a few times in the past.  The most recent time was in the past month; I made it almost a week without smoking, but my cravings along with some other stressors (homelessness) made me extremely irritable and it was causing issues with my relationship, so I began smoking again.  Now, I have housing and am looking to try quitting. If you've had issues with extreme irritability due to cravings, how did you manage those while quitting?

I just downloaded the Livestrong MyQuit app.  It gave me a choice of weaning myself off over a week or going cold-turkey - any advice? Has anyone found these sort of apps helpful in their quitting?

Thanks so much for your help. I look forward to being a part of this community :)

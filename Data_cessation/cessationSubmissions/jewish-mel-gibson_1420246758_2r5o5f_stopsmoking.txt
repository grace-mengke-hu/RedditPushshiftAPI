[42 hours] I feel like Algernon

I feel like the protagonist from [Flowers for Algernon](http://www.oglethorpe.edu/faculty/~m_rulison/Honors/SpeculativeFiction/Documents/Keyes,%20Daniel%20-%20Flowers%20for%20Algernon.pdf). Yesterday, I ran for 40 minutes and read 10 pages. Today, I read 18 pages and did exactly nothing else but lie in bed.

I looked at my calendar on December 30, 3 days ago. I read half a book (120 pages), wrote a 2000 word blog post reviewing it, practiced my Mandarin for an hour and got through two Pimsleur sessions flawlessly, took notes on a whole chapter of quantum mechanics and did about half of the problems in my textbook, went for a 20 minute run, and emailed participants for the seminar I'm leading with new info about the next semester, as well as the professor running the center funding it. I even had time to go watch a movie with my mom at a theater half an hour away from home.

The cravings are manageable. I just drink a lot of water, eat a lot of fruit, and go for a run when it gets really tough. They suck, and I can tell when I just want a cigarette because I'm having a craving, but I know that I can definitely handle it. It's just incredibly depressing to see my days waste away from withdrawal. I've read that it might even take up to two weeks for my concentration to return, and even then it's apparently not the same. I had a very particular program I created for myself during the time I had off, a program I needed to stick to so that I would be at my peak performance when I returned to school and I have to say, at this rate, accomplishing even a tenth of that program would be impossible.

I did not quit for my health or the smell, or any of that. I actually enjoyed smoking--the taste and the feel. I quit because it cost too much money. I'm starting to wonder if it's really worth it at all.

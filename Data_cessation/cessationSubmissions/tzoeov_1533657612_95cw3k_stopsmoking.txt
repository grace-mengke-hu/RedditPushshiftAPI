Smoking Facts - Alexa flash briefing

Hello,

We created an Alexa flash briefing that gives you a smoking fact each day. The facts aren’t meant to scare you. They are a mixed bag of the good, the bad and the neutral. This way you have the chance to slowly gain a bigger perspective about it all; to slowly, easily, subtly, maybe change the way you view smoking.

If at some point you start noticing yourself looking at cigarettes differently, then that could be a good thing, right? Maybe you will even find yourself at some point considering quitting sooner rather than later; or not; that’s ok too. It’s actually a chance to learn about this habit as you start your day.

Check it out here: [Smoking Facts](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Chain-Smoking-Facts/dp/B07G764KSY/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-skills&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533649688&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=smoking)

We would greatly appreciate your feedback. Thanks!

Hope it helps!

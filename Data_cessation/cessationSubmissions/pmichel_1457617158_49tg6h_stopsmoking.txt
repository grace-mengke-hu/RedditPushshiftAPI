Living the dash

Heard something on the radio this morning I wanted to share... 

We will all leave the same thing behind on our graves... 
born date - died date. 

All we can do is live the dash. 

I took control over bad habits 74 days ago. Quit a 40 year smoking addiction and replaced it with exercise and an obsession with healthy food.  I have lost 25lbs and am feeling awesome! 

I feel like a new person and never even think about smoking!  

I actually feel like someone who has never smoked, which was my prayer.    

Hang in there, it gets better so very fast but you have to look for the good.   Start living and loving the dash...its all we get!

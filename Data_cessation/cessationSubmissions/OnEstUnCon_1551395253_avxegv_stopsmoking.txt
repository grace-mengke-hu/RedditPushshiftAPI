Let's try this again

I stopped smoking tobacco on march the 1st 2017 and succeeded without cheating for [one year](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/81ptoj/1_year_nicotinefree/) and two months. At first I was still vaping / piping pure weed, but weed cravings stopped with tobacco cravings so I also stopped weed for a whole 6 month. 

I then got back to weed early on 2018, then got back to tobacco somewhere around mid-may 2018. I have since been smoking as much as I was smoking before, so somewhere between one pack and one pack and a half a day. 

This was far from being my first attempt (i'm 26M, being a regular smoker since  I was 14/15), but I had never succeeded to last for this long before. 

Right now i've been smoking back everyday for around ten month in row. 

All my close family were long time smokers and quit successfully.     
I do feel the physical differences extremely well now I smoke again after experiencing a long break (breathless after small physical exercise, coughing a lot, getting weird spots on my body, worrying a lot about my health, ...)       
Also I'm broke and tobacco prices went up crazy recently where I live (France).

Tomorrow is march the 1st 2019, exactly two years after my first successful attempt to stop. (to me, 1 year and a half tobacco free is a successful attempt even though i started back). 

So I thought it would be a nice starting date to try again. I made it once, so I should be able do it again !      
Let's make that badge increment to 4 digits numbers this time !

Thanks for the support on this sub, I'm glad i found it, and honestly it has made a role in my decision to try again. 

Be strong guys !

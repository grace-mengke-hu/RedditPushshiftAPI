Hi! Just wanted to introduce myself.

Hey all. I just submitted for a badge a few minutes ago and wanted to say hello. I need to quit smoking and I can't do it alone. My friends have not been supportive and I just find it so easy to pick one up. I intend to vape a bit to be honest, and I'm sure there's 1000 views on that. But even when I quit smoking for two weeks earlier this year, I felt SO MUCH BETTER. I'm exhausted today. I have no reason to be exhausted. Sure I'm out of shape and overweight, but it is the smoking. After not smoking I sleep so much better and wake up rested and not like I just smoked a bunch in my sleep! Sorry to rant a bit I just wanted to say and I'm really looking forward to just finding a group of people that will keep me honest and accountable. Let's do this!!

Free Allen Carr books. Need them?

If you want a copy of Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking.  send me a message.  I'm giving away three right now to people who can take delivery in the US.  


To pull this off, you have to send me an address where you can receive a package.  

This will cost me less than I spent on a week smoking.  I am starting to close in on a year without smoking.   So there is that.

If you are not US, post here. You might find people who can help.

**Edit:  All are spoken for.**  Because I went through the  mails in the wrong order, I shall send out some extras.  If anyone else wants to join on the buying and shipping side also let me know.

P.S.  To those who asked.  I didn't quit with this book but I would not have quit without it.  And I think having the physical copy is slightly better.  So if you you don't hear from me in the next day and wanted one, check your library or a used book store.

**Edit 2**:  I have contacted 5 people to say I'll be sending soon (I am near NYC and we have a foot of snow coming tomorrow night.  Great time for Amazon)  I am holding the list of others that asked that in case others that gift jump in.

Interesting fact:  The first time I did this, it took over a week before 6 got sent out (two of us were sending out 3 apiece).   This time,  I have about 25 requests in 24 hours.

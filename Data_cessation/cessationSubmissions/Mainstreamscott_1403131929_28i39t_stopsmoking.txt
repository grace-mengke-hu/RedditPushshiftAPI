Reset my counter, gonna give this another go.

So About a year ago, I got myself an e-cig and was able to move away from cigarettes completely. I did not smoke for 5 months. The problem was that I dropped my nicotine level too fast and eventually after a drunken night of debauchery, I woke up with a pack, and a habit again.

I'm gonna try this again. Clock is reset. Wish me luck.

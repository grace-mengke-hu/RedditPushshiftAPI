This time was easy... 2 weeks in.

So I know my title sounds like bullshit, but it’s hasn’t been hard this time. I swear. I have been smoking for 15 years, and have quit twice before, each for 3-4 months. Each time a cold turkey quit. The second quit was particularly dark, especially the second week.

This time, I had the luxury of staying in a different place with my sister, who I love and get along with, and who is a non smoker. My surroundings were non-triggering. I didn’t drink alcohol or coffee, or smoke weed for the first week - all of which are massively associated with cigs for me. 

I don’t know why but I have had almost no bad cravings. I also keep Allen Carr’s guidelines in mind. I have read the book twice in the past. 

I think this is the time, guys!! Good luck to everyone on here. I don’t mean to imply that quitting smoking is not a massive achievement, or extremely difficult, because it has been both of those things for me in the past. I will keep checking in. I’m only two weeks in, but I don’t see myself ever lighting up again.

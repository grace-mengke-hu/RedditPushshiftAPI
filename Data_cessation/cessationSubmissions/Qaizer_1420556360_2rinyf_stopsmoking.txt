Well, that helped....not.

Let me give you a quick background. I'm 31 years old. I've been a smoker for 13 years. I quit a couple of times, the longest stretch being 5 months. My fiancee (getting married in may) hates cigarettes and I've had enough of them. The last five days I didn't touch a smoke and it was a walk in the park. As long as I'm keeping busy and/or I'm in good company. today was different. I was alone all day, nervous and craving a smoke... so I decided to go for a drive. You've guessed it. I bought a pack and lit one up. I didn't even savour the moment, before I knew it I had smoked it and felt stupid and mad at myself. Was that the cigarette I've been craving all day? The last few days were perfect, why ruin that winning streak with such an unnecessary relief? So, after weeks of lurking, I requested a badge and here I am. I AM A QUITTER! (O, and thanks /r/stopsmoking for giving me the inspiration to do it). PS. English is not my native tongue, sorry

1 week

I made it one week! I threw my cigarettes out the window on the way home from work last Monday and I'm still going strong. I'm using NRT and I'm already noticing that I'm forgetting to pop a lozenge or use my ecig. My last "quit" spanned all of 11 days but I kept cheating and I had a horrible attitude. No cheats or slips at all this week and I'm feeling really positive about the whole thing. I think I'm in it to win it this time. I'll be back to celebrate in another week! Woooooohoooooooo! Keep at it friends. We can do this!

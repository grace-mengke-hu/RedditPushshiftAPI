Day 5 why do I still feel angry

So I have been working on quitting for 2 weeks but I am now on day 5 of officially nothing. From what I know I should be feeling better by now and breathing wise I do. In fact my migraines haven't shown up in days either. However I feel really really angry. I seriously just feel like going off on everyone for everything. When does that go away?

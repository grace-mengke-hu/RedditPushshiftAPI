Social Smoking. Don't Do it.

I started off as a social smoker. Smoking with my friends while having a couple of drinks and at night outs. I then moved on to become a smoker myself. You feel relax and all those feelings when you smoke with your friends. And in time of stress or pressure, I started to smoke on my own to get those feelings which clears my head. I have been on and off smoking ever since. It might not seem harmful or addictive once in a while but on a long term basis it made huge difference.  I want to tell the people out there don't start smoking socially, it's where it all began.

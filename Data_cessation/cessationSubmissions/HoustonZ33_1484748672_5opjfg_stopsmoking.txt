2 weeks in so far but, I'm cheating.

I'm 35, been smoking Newports since 12 - Buying my own packs at 13.

Been sub-ohm vaping for 2 weeks now and I'm not going back. My taste and smell are in HD now. I'm coughing up all the crap that was built up over the past 22 years.

In short I've "quit" without the bitch that are nicotine withdrawls.

Have I really stopped smoking or, Have I just "switched"?

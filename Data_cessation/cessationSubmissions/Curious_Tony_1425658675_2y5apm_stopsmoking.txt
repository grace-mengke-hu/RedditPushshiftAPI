Looking for help for my mother ( 6 days now without smoking)

Hello all my mother is 49 years old and she has been smoking since she was a young teenager and just recently she came down with the flu and was bedridden for 5 days and was unable to smoke during that time. after talking with her i convinced her to at least attempt to continue not to smoke.

I am afraid once she is fully recovered she will jump right back into smoking so i feel this might be my first and last window to get her to stop.

She said she has tried patches in the past but did not work for her so i am thinking about buying her a e-cig thing but the problem is i have no idea where to start or what to buy.

Could anyone recommend to me what kind of e-cig i should buy for someone like her that's been a heavy smoker for many years?

I would greatly appreciate any help thank you.

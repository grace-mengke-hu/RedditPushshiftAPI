Back on the wagon after many falls.

Hey everyone, I've tried to quit many times before with varying degrees of success. As of right now I'm at close to the 24 hours smoke free mark. Using a lot of different mental tricks I've learned along the way, as well as what I would call exploiting my laziness. 

The two biggest winners in the fight against the addiction have been hiding my debit and credit cards away from myself where they are inconvenient to get in the morning before work where I tend to smoke the most. Also I'm not thinking about how far I have to go, but just telling myself I survived the previous moment I can do it one more time, and repeating that whenever I feel a craving hitting me. 

Edit: The real challenge will be when my smoker friend comes by tomorrow for jam day, cause a cigarette is awesome after sitting behind a drum kit for 45 minutes straight.

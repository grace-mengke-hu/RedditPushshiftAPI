Fighting two addictions at the same time

For a while now I've hadn't been able to decide if I should try to quit smoking or overeating first. They're not huge addictions... yet; I'm not obese by any means but I can feel my clothes getting tighter, and I'm not a hopeless smoker but nowadays I've been reaching the pack-a-day threshold, up from a pack a week a few months ago. So I known I should cut both now that I can, but I know that quitting one will make the other addiction worse, and quitting both at the same time would be almost impossible. Today I decided to go for quitting smoking first.

My question is, has anyone else gone through this situation? If so, how can I prevent that the cravings for cigarettes make me stuff my mouth with junk food more than I already do? I'd really appreciate any advice that you might have.

Quitting again! 💪💪

Hi all! So me and my partner gave up smoking New Years from Jan 1st until march 30th, but then relapsed again.

My partner wants to gradually reduce again, and I want to go cold turkey once again.

What has everyone found to be the best method, key tips or any other helpful advice they could share?

I'm setting my quit date now, and will keep people updated with my progress.

Thanks all.

Six months. That's one half of a full year. Thank you r/stopsmoking

I was one of those people who was trying to quit for about a year before it actually caught fire.  I read Allen Carrs book several times, tried the gum, the patch, the lozenges, the e-cigs.  It was a year of attempts and fails.  I had told my friend that I was "totally demoralized" from the process of trying to quit and failing.  I was at my wits end.  I felt hopeless and trapped.  I had quit before, but this time seemed impossible.  It was "darkest before the dawn". Finally I was able to put more than a few days together.  Those days turned in to weeks, then months.  Now I am at a place i never thought i would be.  I can report that the struggle is largely gone. From day to day it is something that i can overcome.  Stay strong, even if you have tried a millions times before to quit, keep trying. It took what felt like my 1000th time but I am grateful that today i am smoke free for 1/2 of a year.

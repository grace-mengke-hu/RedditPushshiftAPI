I just realized that I wasn't tempted to smoke today.

My downfall is usually hanging out with good friends that are smokers.  Today I went and spent the afternoon with some friends and didn't even think about smoking when they were puffing away.  That's pretty damn cool!  I'm going to see that 4 week mark.

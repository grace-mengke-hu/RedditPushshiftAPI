Two weeks without a cigarette and I have a question...

It's been fairly easy so far, aside from the crabbiness and irritability which suck. 

I smoked for ten years, averaging a pack a day. I quit two weeks ago and still haven't experienced any physical withdrawal symptoms. I have yet to "hack anything up", which has me concerned. I was quite looking forward to my lungs beginning to "clean themselves" again and hacking things out of my lungs that had been building up for a decade.

So what gives???

2 months smoke free and unmotivated to do anything

I have a few more exams to finish college and as I stopped smoking I have a hard time getting out of my bed and make stuff done. I am unmotivated to do anything. Probably because when I studied I would smoke every 10 minutes. The same goes with work. I was never this lazy in my life. Is this smoke free related or is it just me?

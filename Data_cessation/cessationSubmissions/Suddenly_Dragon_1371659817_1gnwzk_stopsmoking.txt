Nearly six months and the only thing I want is a cigarette.

Seriously, every movie I watch, picture I see, game I play where someone is smoking, the only thing I can focus on is the cigarette in their hands. Watching Boardwalk Empire is a nightmare, and on top of that I live with a smoker. I don't know how much longer i can hold out. Hell, the only thing stopping me now is the fact that I don't have money for any and my grandmother keeps hers locked up so I can't get to them.

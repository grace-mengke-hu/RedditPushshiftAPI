I just quit and I plan on staying an ex-smoker forever

I am 32 years old and have been smoking since I was 13. I have not had one day without a cigarette in 19 years. Last night I ran 2 miles and as I was all out of breath lit up a cig and smoked it all and told myself "remember how this feels, how bad this is right now cause this is your last cigarette, this is how I am to remember smoking" 

So my Last smoke was at 11pm last night and it is now 10am my time so about 11 hours since my last one and believe it or not this is the longest I ever been without one and I am very hyper and happy and sad at the same time. This is going to be hard but I need to quit for myself and my family so I can do this!

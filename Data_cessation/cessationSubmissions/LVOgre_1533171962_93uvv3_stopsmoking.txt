5 Years

When I was 12 years old I smoked my first cigarette, and I continued to smoke for 27 years after that.   


5 years ago today I smoked my last cigarette and became a non-smoker. I had done a lot of research to determine what would work best for me and my lifestyle. I have PTSD, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and a whole suite of problems from early life trauma, so withdraw symptoms were something I couldn't abide. I decided that I needed NRT. The single most important factor, I learned, was to stop smoking immediately regardless of your method, no tapering off of the tobacco.

I stopped smoking immediately, and used a vape for NRT. I tapered off the nicotine little by little for 3 months until I wasn't using any nicotine. I put the vape down one day and never picked it back up, I just forgot all about it. It sat on the top of my keyboard right where I left it for 6 months before I put it away in a box. I threw that box away eventually.  


I can't say that this will work for you, but it worked for me. You have to find your own way, and you have to do it before you die a slow painful death. Smoking is killing you, as sure as the sun rises. It's stealing your life away a tiny piece at a time, but you can take it back. You won't regret it, it will be the most worthwhile endeavor you'll ever take on. Your life will improve in myriad ways. You have to do this, you are worth it.

I'm going to unsubscribe now. I think I've offered all of the advice that I can here, and I hope I helped some people smoke their last cigarette. I know you all helped me.   


I feel as if I've reached a point where I no longer need the reminder of the 27 years of constant mistakes I made. I wish you all of the success in the world, and I hope someday you'll unsubscribe too.

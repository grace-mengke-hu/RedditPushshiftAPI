Day 3- easy as can be?

Long time lurker, first time poster...
I don't mean to sound smug, but I'm 60 hours in cold turkey, and it's been, as another redditor put it, "a non-event". I've been a 15/day smoker for 15 years (I'm turning 30 this spring, so that makes that half of my lifetime).
  I've been an unhappy smoker for a long time- planning quits weekly, attempting over and over, NRT, EasyWay, vaping- all with little to no success. The other night I just decided that I wouldn't wait for a better time (I was planning a quit after finals, but then was offered a job to start the week after, which blew my "perfect timing" away).

I've been a bit moody, but I just excuse myself from other people. No tears, no angst, nothing that I was dreading as a smoker. I've been pampering myself a bit more than usual, but that's ok!

So here's to riding the wave of an "Easy" quit, and never taking another puff to fuck this is up for myself.

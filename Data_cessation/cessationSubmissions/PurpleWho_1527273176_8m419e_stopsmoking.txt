Anyone Interested In An App That Lets People Bet On Getting Things Done?

The basic idea:

You bet that you will do something by a certain date.

You share the bet with your friends.

They can either bet that you will or they can bet against you.

If you deliver proof of completion by the deadline you keep all the money bet against you.

If more people bet that you would get it done then you all split the pot, or vice-versa if you lose.

I thought this might be useful when you need to hard commit to doing something in a group. For example, if you are promise a report done by the end of the week then you can bet that you will. Your co-workers can bet against you if they genuinely don't think you can be relied on.

Betting against you is actually a form of motivation because now there are stakes to proving them wrong.

You can also use it for personal goals like losing weight or you can just use it for fun challenges between friends.

If I build it, would you use it?

If not please tell me why.

If you are interested, I put together a mailing list where I will update you once an MVP is built https://betbug.org/

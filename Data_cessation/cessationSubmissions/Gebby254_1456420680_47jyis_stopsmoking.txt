For those of you over a week in, what have you done to keep your willpower "fully charged"?

I'm finding I don't have as much "mojo" as I did in week one.  I was jacked up during week one.  I was on a mission!  I could do this!  Now.... now I'm a little less gung-ho.  I'm not giving up - *by any means* - I just feel like it would probably be in my best interest to recharge my motivation so I don't get blindsided by a moment of weakness.

What steps do you take to you make sure your willpower isn't depleted?

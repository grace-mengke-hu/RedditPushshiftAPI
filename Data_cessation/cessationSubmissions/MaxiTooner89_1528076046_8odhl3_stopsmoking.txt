How did you find the motivation to stop smoking?

I've been smoking since i was 16, I'm 28 now. I've been trying the electronic but i felt so bad when i was running so i started again with tobacco.

I've been told many times that you will never forget the cigarettes, you will always wake up some days to an anxiety thinking about to smoke a cigarette, you will always want one when you drink, but still some people don't do it anymore even if they really really want.

Some of you are those who have achieved this so... How you did it?

I just stopped a month in this 12 years when i read  a book about to stop smoking but started again.

I stopped so many bad things in my life but tobacco is simply to strong, that feeling in the throat when you do a drag is a really strong drug addiction.

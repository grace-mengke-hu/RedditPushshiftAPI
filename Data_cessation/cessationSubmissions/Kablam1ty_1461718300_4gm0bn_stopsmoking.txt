NEED to stop

I am only 22 years old but I have been smoking since ninth grade.
I have a tenth month old now..and all I can think about is how sick she will see me get. I'm not naive..this will kill me.

Having quit for a year successfully once..i know that i can quit cold turkey under the right mindset..but i haven't had the same willpower since.

Need any and all advice

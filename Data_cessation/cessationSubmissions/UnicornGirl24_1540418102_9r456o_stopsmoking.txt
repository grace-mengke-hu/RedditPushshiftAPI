Need help

So I need help finding the final push to completely quit smoking. 

Here's my story: 

I tried to quit cold turkey and ultimately sabatoged myself by eventually feeding the nicotine monster and telling myself "I'll ween myself"

Well....I am so close I can feel it but I just can't find a way to force myself over the edge. I smoke 1-2 when I am getting ready for work. And then dont smoke again until i get home. Where i will smoke about 5-6 in an evening. 

I need advice. I have cut back from a pack a day to a pack every two days but there is a mental block keeping me from totally kicking this gross habit. 

PLEASE HELP

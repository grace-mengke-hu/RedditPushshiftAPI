Fantasising about Failure

I'm around 2.5 weeks into my quit. The first few days aside it has been a reasonably pleasurable experience. I knew from previous attempts that false confidence early in the process can lead to complacency so have been attempting to mentally guard against.

I was blindsided by an unconscious thought today which is a perfect illustration of the addict's mentality. I was fantasising about something awful happening which would justify me smoking again. Something like a death of a relative. Something where I could grab a pack of smokes and go to the pub 'blame-free' by my own reckoning. I was almost willing something awful to happen. 

I'm pretty disgusted by my thoughts but am sharing anyway.

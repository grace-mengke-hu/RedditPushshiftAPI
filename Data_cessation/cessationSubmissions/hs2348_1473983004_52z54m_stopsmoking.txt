I just happened to wear a shirt stinking smell of cigarettes.

College senior, got my other shirt that I was previously wearing, to which I spilled some ketchup earlier. I found a shirt in my car and wore it instead. Just realized now that this smells like cigarettes and I can't deal with the stink :( got 4hours to go with this on.

Stopping when you're only a light smoker (6-10 cigs a day)

So I've been a light smoker for a while now. I never had the urge to smoke more than , say, a half pack a day. Even when I was on vacation in countries where cigs are basically free (like 1 euro per pack or less) I would still not smoke more than half a pack a day. Maybe very occasionally I would get to maybe 15 cigs on exceptional days, where I was drinking a lot, but that's about it. Many of the people I see on this subreddit are pack a day smokers. And even the people I know who smoke usually smoke more than I do. Sometimes I follow their smoking pattern (so I light one up when they light one up) and I end up smoking way more than I would normally.

Now I am trying to quit completely though. Smoking brings me nothing, it doesn't make me feel better. All it gives me is something empty and mindless to do, for example when waiting for the bus. But there are so many other things I could do that would be more useful than smoking a cancer stick.

This is day 1 of stopping (well I wanted to yesterday but I still found a cigarette and a half ! somewhere, lol). Wish me luck :)

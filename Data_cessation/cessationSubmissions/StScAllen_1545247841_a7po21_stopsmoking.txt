That sense of disappointment...

So at this point my interest in smoking is hovering just over 0%.  What I HATE is that lingering sense of disappointment.  At moments (triggers) I get that quick onset form of excitement from the subconscious thought of smoking and then it gets muted by the realization that I don't smoke anymore.  Its not the lack of smoking I miss, its dealing with the sense of disappointment after getting that momentary sense of excitement.  Does anyone else get this?  I really don't want to smoke, I just hate that sense of disappointment.  My brain knows its BS, but the sense of let down is still very real.  Does that make sense?  Anyone else?

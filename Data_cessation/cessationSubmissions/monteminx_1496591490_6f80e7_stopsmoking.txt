Day 4 without a smoke (when you're irritable and start yelling at inanimate objects)

Had my first nightmare about smoking! You know the ones, where you wake up in an awful sweat and your heart racing and have to smell your hands to see if they smell and if you really did smoke or not. Guilt dreams. I'm actually having the easiest time I've ever had trying to quit. Usually I tell myself I deserve one on the third day, and I felt it hard yesterday. But I kept my eye on the clock and waited out the cravings. I can sing along to the radio in my car cause I'm not trying to sing between inhales full of smoke. It's starting to be easier to take a big breath. Trying to remember all the times people told me I "don't look like a smoker" or "your boyfriend doesn't smoke so I didn't think you did". How do I keep this motivation for the rest of my life?

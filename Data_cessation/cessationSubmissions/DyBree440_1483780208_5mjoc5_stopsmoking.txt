Any other long term quitters experiencing dreams about smoking?

So I've been a non smoker for a year and a half(Yay!) but I'm not posting this to gloat. I've been experiencing dreams, about once or twice a month, where I'd either buy a pack of smokes or I'd bum a smoke from one of my real life smoker friends.

I'd wake up and think how gross it would be to pick it up again and am glad to find out it was just a dream, so the fact that I have the dreams don't bother me. I just find it kind of weird that I don't remember dreams very often but, when I do, it's usually one of my smoking dreams.

Does anyone else get dreams similar to this? Does it bother anyone? Just curious, myself. I've gone through some serious shit over the last year and having a cigarette never crossed my mind. I just find it strange to have dreams about it every once in a while.

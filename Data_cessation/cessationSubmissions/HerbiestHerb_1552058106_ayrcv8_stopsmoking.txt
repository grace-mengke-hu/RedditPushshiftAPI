Hey so I’m back to quit

A few months ago I had successfully quit for about 3 weeks or a little more. I even posted about how I never want to come back to smoking again. I got played by the demon that is nicotine when my guard was down. When I was feeling my best. I let nicotine whisper “hey, if you don’t buy them, you’re technically not a smoker.” So, I played that game for a week or 2. Only to lose. I ended up buying a pack a week. Just like old times. Me and the demon. Riding again. 

Today is day 5.  My homework for today was to come here and read through 10 posts of folks just like myself. I’ve been here before, and I’m just glad to have made it this far again. I came here to say thanks for being an amazing community and being the inspiration to so many. We’ve all the same goal and it’s to remain free from smoking.  A day at a time. Thanks and we got this!

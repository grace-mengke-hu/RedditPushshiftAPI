Planning to quit, have switched to rollies

So I've decided to quit all together by the end of this year. This is my final year of college so stress gets to me and as you guys would understand this acts as a trigger for me. Now I used to smoke one manufactured cigarette a day and all in all 4-5 a week. This was going on for the past 3 years. Now I was introduced to rollies by a friend. So I spent about the cost of two packs on buying papers , OCB filters and a pack of American Spirits tobacco  (the one that claims to not have any additives). The main benefit I see is that I can smoke a really less quantity,  about a quarter or half of a normal cigarette in one rollie. I plan to quit by the end of this year as I finish my finals. So I'm thinking that smoking less, using a filter and using the so called additive free tobacco should reduce my risks for any adverse health effects. Thus far I haven't had any cough , Breathlessness or any other symptom and want to keep it that way. As I'm sure you guys know it is hard to quit. My idea is to use one full pouch (25 grams ) of tobacco through this year and not buy any me tobacco or cigarettes. Anyone else have any similar experiences? How did it turn out for you ? Are my facts correct?  Thank you for reading and the feedback.

TLDR- switching to filtered rollies to smoke less and quit this year with last tobacco pouch.

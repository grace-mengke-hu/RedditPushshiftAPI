One year milestone

I'm a non-smoker now.

Feeling really thankful for the strep throat that kicked my butt into gear to make a decision I'd been wanting to make for a long time.

Also: this subreddit, the folks who post & support & my friends & family for dealing with me for the toughest patches.

So much thanks!

It just got to me.

I was doing really well before I transferred to my University from CC. This place is just so stressful and so hard, I just can't stay away from the quick fix. I'm sorry, y'all. I couldn't handle it and I feel so weak because of it. I hate that in order to de-stress my life, I have to use something that inevitably shortens it.

Best part (so far) about not smoking

One of the worst parts of smoking, for me, was experiencing how weak my immune system got over the years. By the last several years, I'd get several colds per year, and sometime's they'd linger on and on and on. Even worse, I'd get impatient with not smoking and just start smoking again as soon as the worst of the cold was over. So I'd still be sick, coughing, but going out to smoke on the patio.

I stopped in April of this year, and I just came down with my first cold since. Amazing. Even better? After just one day of the worst of it, I felt much better--maybe back up to 70%. On day three, I'm still tired, but I'm not coughing or sneezing or going through boxes of tissues. I was dreading waking up early for a work call I couldn't postpone, but I didn't have any trouble at all.

It's honestly one of the happiest realizations to come out of this process so far. Congratulations to everyone else working hard to kick the habit--remember, your immune system will thank you for it!

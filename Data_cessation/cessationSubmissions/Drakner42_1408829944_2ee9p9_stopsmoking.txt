Need help with nicotine gum.

Sorry if I am doing this wrong but I have never posted before and am desperate. I am also not great with English.

I had quit for about a month using nicotine gum but slowly realized that the artificial sweetener (sorbitol) in the gum was causing a lot of bad side effects.

 I was wondering if any of you know of a 4mg nicotine gum that does not have any artificial sweeteners in it? I could not find any online but my google fu isn't great. I have started smoking again but tomorrow I am going on the patch and if that doesn't work I am going to try gum that has Xylitol in it.

**If I was not clear I really want to know if any of you know a 4mg nicotine gum that is either flavorless or has no artificial sweeteners in it.

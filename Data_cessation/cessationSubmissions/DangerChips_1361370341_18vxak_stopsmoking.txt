What to expect going forward?

So I quit last week. As you can see my badge is only 9 days old and it both feels like an eternity has passed and yet no time at all. To help ease into it I've gone gym crazy and been going about four times a week and going on hikes inbetween. Tons of physical activity (which is great since I need to lose weight). 

But what should I expect going forward? I feel like I've been fighting off a mild cold, I'm occasionally coughing stuff up. I smoked for 17 years. 

**17 Years**. 

I'm 29, I've been a smoker longer then I haven't. But I want to change that. What are some things you noticed when you quit?

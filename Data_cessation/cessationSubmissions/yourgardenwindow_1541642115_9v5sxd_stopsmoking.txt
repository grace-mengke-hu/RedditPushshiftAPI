Existence phobia?

I’m 40 days quit cold turkey from a pack a day of spirits.

But lately (idk if it is the weed) I’ve been just freaked out about life. Like everything feels too weird, and life feels so scary and unsafe. Lol. Idk how to describe it. It’s like I feel out of control being a human and life is so strange and complex that it literally scares me that life exists

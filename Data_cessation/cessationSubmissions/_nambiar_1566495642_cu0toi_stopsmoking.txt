I smoked in a dream and it was a nightmare

I have now been smoke free for nearly 5 months and its great. But I was in the past in my dream, in a tense situation, and i lit up. I felt my eyes widen as I took the first drag, realizing my streak was about to break, I was letting all these poisons back into my body, taking the easy route to deal with stress. I hated myself for those few seconds. I woke up sweating and checking my quit tracker. I know if I did go back, I have the integrity to set it back to zero. Fortunately it said 4m 22 days. I was glad the nightmare was over, both the tense situation and the smoking. 

Not another puff. No matter what. I don't smoke.

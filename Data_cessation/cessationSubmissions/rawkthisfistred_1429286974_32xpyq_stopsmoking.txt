I just realized I haven't had a cigarette in almost 2-3 weeks... And I haven't even noticed.

Of course, I smoke a decent amount of pot too so that probably helps me not remember my cigarette cravings, but after smoking for 10+ years, it feels good to not have that terrible cigarette taste in my mouth. I always hated the way it tasted / felt. And I'm assuming that's why I have all these sinus issues now, all of a sudden, but I'd rather suffer through them than smoke another cigarette.

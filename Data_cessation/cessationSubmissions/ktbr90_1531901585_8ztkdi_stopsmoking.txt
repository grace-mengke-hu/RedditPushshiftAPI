Dreams

Hi all! Thanks for the posts everyone, they give me motivation and support. I'm in 4 days and 10 hours in, this isn't my first time being this far smoke-free. I'm not feeling so good like previous times, my sleeping was great in the first maybe first two days, now it's just bad. Last night I had my first dream in which I was smoking. Man I felt terrible afterwards. No actual point of the post, maybe just writing out of myself. Til this point it's been easy-pleasy, which scares me. Be safe everyone!

Smoking weed

I'm just curious how pot is factoring in for those of you who still get high while trying to quit cigarettes. Personally, nothing was better after smoking a bowl than finishing my smoke with a cigarette. Now that I don't have that "end of the session" routine I find that I just keep smoking the weed. It numbs the cigarette cravings but I feel like I haven't been totally sober in days. I'm working on disconnecting the two in my mind, but I was wondering if anyone else has a similar coping method? How are you handling it?

Here I go again...

Well, I started strong, stopped without even the need or want to smoke again, got about 3 weeks in, and just lost it. This is normal for me, major depression is a killer, and I started again. It started when I agreed to go out with friends but when the time came I just wanted to sit at home alone, so I smoked and went out, it got me through it, and I just continued. Jump to now, 2 weeks later still smoking, and I see these posts from this sub and I just feel guilty and that I've let you down. Just telling you all that I'm going at it again, wish me luck, we'll see how it goes.

5 days... and I slipped

I was on a record streak. I had been smoking a pack a day for almost 18 years. I stopped on Saturday. Including two hospital visits, this was the most I had been without smoking. I slipped today. I smoked half a cigarette. I couldn't stand it anymore. I had one of those days that you feel you can't handle it any longer. Fight with my SO \(we made up in the end but it left me with a feeling of a huge void in my gut\), problems at work, problems at home, just too much stress. I thought that a smoke would lighten my load and it did the exact opposite. Now I feel  terrible for everything and to top it off, because I lost my 5 days. Should I start over again? I don't even want to tell it to my SO who has been nothing but supportive and encouraging in this matter and in every other aspect of my recent life... It feels like a huge secret and a failure to him but most importantly, to myself.

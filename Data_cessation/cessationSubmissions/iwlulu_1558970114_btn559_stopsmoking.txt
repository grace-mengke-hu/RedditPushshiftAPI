Trying to decide my quit date

Hello.

I'm not new here. This is not my first time quitting either. Nevertheless I seek your advice. Ultimately it's my decision of course but you may share your opinions or tell how things went in your case.

Our relationship with my wife has been a bit roller coaster past two years. I would claim that the worst is left way behind but things are still settling while we are trying to figure out who we are to each other and also to ourselves. We are happy and

My wife has medication for depression and another to insomnia. Her doctor said that she could lay off of them this summer which she wants to give a shot.

Me on the other hand very much want to quit smoking cigarettes. ASAP. The thing is that I'm terrified how things can escalate to utter darkness in this possible scenario where wife suffers from her medicine withdrawal and me withdrawal from cigarettes and one or both of us cannot control our feelings.

I know I'm not responsible of her (happiness) and our current situation is kind a difficult. If I'm feeling moody or worse (which usually is the case with quitting cigarettes) she starts to feel that too. And with her, it can escalate to very bad.

So... How would you see my situation? Or have you experienced something similar?

She is going to start to wither down the meds 1 week from now. Should I play it safe and wait few months? There is not perfect time to quit. Ever. But I'm not sure I want to risk everything we've built. I really do want to quit, that's not the issue but I really can't, or haven't been able to control my feelings during the first few days or maybe even weeks. Thus I cannot guarantee I can support her how I would want to.

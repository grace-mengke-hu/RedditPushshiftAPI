Relapsed on Vape and chew...I really want a pack.

I quit successfully in October and was nicotine-free for 7 months. Running a lot, eating healthy and meditating daily. I felt great and was so happy to finally be smoke free.

Some stress entered into my life when I had to move for school. I knew i didn't want to smoke because i have made so much progress with my running. I was chewing for about two weeks and vaped for a day.

On Monday I started a coding bootcamp and it very mentally demanding. I've made it the first two days without nicotine, but can't get rid of the thought in my head telling me I will perform better with my cigs.

How can i think about this in a better way?

So, I went drinking last night for the first time since I quit....

DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE I HADN'T WANTED A CIG UNTIL I WENT TO BED!! YAY!! Super pumped about that seeing how a night on the town used to mean a pack and a half with ease!  To anyone quitting, I swear it gets easier and easier until you don't even think about it anymore, lean on your support when times are hard, I LOVE this sub and all the support and advice you get from people who ARE or HAVE BEEN exactly where you are now!

Smoke free for two days, but I have a question.

Hey everyone, I've been smoke free for two days now, and I'm so close to lighting a cigarette all the time. My head hurts, I get cold sweats and I have trouble falling asleep. Just wanted to know for how long this will last. Is the first week the worst, or two weeks? Or will I feel like this for even longer?

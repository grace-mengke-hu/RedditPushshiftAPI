12 hours since my final cigarette...

Been a smoker for about two years. Started because I was working in the oil field and it was one way to stay awake. I've since quit that job but kept the habit. A pack would last me about 2-3 days so I wasn't a heavy smoker but I still hated it. I've tried to quit in the past but always relapsed the next day or so. I had a about 3 left in my pack last night and thought to myself "wtf am I doing,this shit is pointless" and crushed them up. This time I want it to be for real. I've quit opiates cold turkey a few years ago so I know the struggle I'm about to go through,but I've got this.

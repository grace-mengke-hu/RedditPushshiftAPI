Quitting with Nicotine Patches/Drinking Cravings?

So I decided to quit with the help of Nicotine patches (again) yesterday, starting with "Step 1" (21mgs) I used them back in September 2016 and they worked for the most part for about a month (but was only using 14mgs). I found that for me they kind of worked as a guard against smoking, knowing that if I had one on and smoked it would make me sick. I would take them off before sleeping though since they're known to give people bad dreams, and I already have vivid dreams so no need to make them even more vivid.. heh..

The one problem that I noticed is that whenever I'd have a drink (not that often, maybe once during the week after work and on the weekends) I would rip it off and reward myself with a cigarette for my progress. Which of course, makes no sense. This snowballed me back into being a full time smoker, so I'm trying to avoid this happening again. Does anyone have any advice for curbing the cravings while drinking? I'm well aware that the answer might just be stop drinking, which I did for the month of January and wasn't that difficult for me but, living as a 20 (almost 30) something person in NYC it's hard to avoid socially. Thinking about maybe getting one of those cheap "Blu" e-cigs (approx. $15) to quell the cravings in the meantime. But I'd appreciate any other advice for someone has dealt with the same issue! 


EDIT: Just saw my badge says 166 days from back in September so I need to reset that :) That would be nice...

Day 2, any advice?

I'm 23, and have smoked since I was 17.

I've decided to stop smoking. It will save me money, of which I have little of, my body will be healthier and I won't end up looking like a leather handbag.

I'm using an e-cigarette, and it's helping. I was wondering if anyone had any advice they would kindly share?

Thank you :-)

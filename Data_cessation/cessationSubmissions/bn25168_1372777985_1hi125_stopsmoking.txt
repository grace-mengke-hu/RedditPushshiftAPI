Trying to quit, how do I convert my addiction to smoking into an "addiction" to working out?

I work out on a pretty regular basis, but I'm not the most motivated. Is there some type of jedi mind-trickery I can pull on myself to basically make my brain to equating a nicotine craving into the desire to work out?

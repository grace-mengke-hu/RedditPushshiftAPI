It's been exactly 7 days as of midnight.

Little background on me 

21/Male started smoking when I was 16/17 and basically went into smoking 3/4 to a pack a day depending on my stress levels at work. I finally just felt like it's time to quit so I went and got chantix however my insurance company didn't want to pay for it and I didn't really feel like fighting them on the phone. I ended up quoting cold turkey with zero forms of nicotine replacement for the past week. I find myself craving them at high stress moments but I gotta say I smelt one last night close to me and I felt repulsive and sick that it smelt so bad. 

Do the cravings last forever or do they go away?

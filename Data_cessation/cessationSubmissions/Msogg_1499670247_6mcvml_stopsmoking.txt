So this is what hell feels like?

I turned 17 roughly a week ago, I've been smoking cigarettes for roughly 2/3 years now. Ran out of cigarettes the other day, and I'm just too lazy to go out and get more (Which I have to bribe homeless people to do for me since I'm underage), and I also don't want to go out due to the heat. But it's been a day, and I'm really craving a cigarette, I'm writing this so I can keep my hands moving so I can keep my mind off the cigarette itself. I have mainly decided to try to stop smoking because it almost sounds like my voice has increased in pitch due to the cigarettes, and I use to have a very deep voice, I still do, but at times it just feels higher now, and as if I have to forcefully try to do it. So I pray to God that if I stop my voice will heal it self. I'm also attempting to quit because I don't want to look 30 when I'm 20. I feel like I might half ass this though because I'm a lazy degenerate piece of shit, I'm not over weight or anything, I just have zero motivation. And when I lost my ex like 2 years ago you smoking really began to pick up because whenever I smoked it always reminded me of her. I'm sorry, I'll probably delete this since I'm rambling and just trying to keep myself busy with my brain and hands. Also, I've decided to try and start working out and drinking water instead of smoking so hopefully I can get another GF soon. A portion of my family are heavy smokers, my mom smokes, my dad use to, and my grandma does as well, she now has cancer. She is currently going through treatment, but she seems to be doing well from what I've been hearing. I'm going to try to stop, I will, but the furthest I've gotten is like a week without smoking. Sorry for rambling and stuff, I'm also new to this subreddit, so I'm sorry if I'm breaking any rules as well.. 

Any advice/tips?

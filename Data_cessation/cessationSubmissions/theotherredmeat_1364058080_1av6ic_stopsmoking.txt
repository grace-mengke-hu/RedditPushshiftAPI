Day 4, never would have guessed it

March 20 was National Kick Butt day and my GF asked me to try and not smoke for just one day.  I got through the day and have just continued on without making any big remark about it.  I do have an E-Cig which I use very sparingly.  I am a very discreet smoker to begin with (never, ever in the home; only occasionally in my car if alone (and I empty the ashtray, wipe down the dash, and vaccum religiously).  In recent years I cut my smoking from about 15 a day to 5 a day.  

Now that I am entering Day 4 I actually can feel a slight difference in breathing.  I used to love my nightly after dinner smoke but I will just learn to cope without it.  Been smoking for almost 16 years.  Enough is enough, amirite?

Going on 3 weeks cold turkey

After thinking about quitting for a long time I just randomly quit.  Nothing special, just stopped.  I’ve been hitting the gym and definitely eating more.  I can tell my energy level is higher and I’m just getting more done now.  It’s such a dam relief to not sit in bed with that pain in your throat, or those chest pains that all feel like cancer or some terrible smoking related issue.  I’ve finally cleaned up all my ash trays.  Feels good ... right before the summer too.  Here to deep breaths !

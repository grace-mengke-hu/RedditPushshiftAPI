Here we go(again).

I've lost track of how many times I've tried but here we go again. Day one. 

Everytime I smoke I wonder what good is this? I see my bank account suffering and I'm wondering why dont I have money? Hahah! 
I could be saving like 200 dollars a month.
What the hell am I doing?

Here's hoping I make it this time and good luck to everyone else who's struggling but trying to change their lives for the better.

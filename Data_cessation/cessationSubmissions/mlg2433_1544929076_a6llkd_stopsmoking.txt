Quit smoking cigarettes on December 10th.

I finally decided to make a serious effort to quit smoking. I’m 28 and am hopefully going to stop this nasty habit after ten years. I just want to hear what it’s going to be like in the next few weeks from other people who have stopped. I haven’t had any urges to cough yet or any shortness of breath. Heard that can be pretty bad in the near future for me. I’m using an e-cig to slowly dial back on the nicotine. 

This could be a dumb question, but is using the e-cig going to stop my lungs from recovering? Like I won’t start hacking up a lung until I completely stop using it? Or can they slowly improve while tapering off?

One whole cycle. One year. I feel awesome.

I want to write a lengthy post about my journey so far, but I will do that another time.

I will however do a little recap.

1. I can now run a 5k run under 25 minutes.
2. I saved over â‚¬2000
3. No longer possessed by a timely nicotine / cigarette fix.
4. The first month was the hardest, followed by month 12. That's because Summer was kicking in and getting old "summer smoking" triggers.

For everyone who's on the verge of doing it. I say do it.

For all the rest who feel like relapsing: don't. It's not worth it and you'll be back to step 1. Cigs give you literally nothing but a "fix" to feeling normal for a short while.

For all the non-smokers. Congrats! I love being part of this club.

Been on Chantix for a few months now but when will the cravings stop completely?

Like the title says, I've been on Chantix for a few months now. It is actually working for me and it has made quitting easier. (I use to smoke a pack a day or more.)

When I first started Chantix I continued to smoke. I regularly smoked and bought cigarettes for maybe the first two and a half weeks or so. But recently I have stopped buying cigarettes and have not really had any. (Maybe half of one a day or a puff here or there but nothing really.) 

I'm usually good and don't crave one but when I'm in my car the craving is pretty strong. I don't actually have and cigarettes with me so even if I wanted to I couldn't light one up. 

Basically I want to know when will the cravings stop completely?

I quit last friday

So I quit smoking last Friday.  I had tried and failed with the help of, gum, patches, auricular therapy, and cold turkey.  Nothing seemed to work.  Auricular Therapy got close.  I went about three months and then thought, oh I'll just have one while I have a drink.  WRONG.

So as a former 14 year smoker.  I can say, without a doubt this has been one of the hardest things for me to get over in my life.  With that said, I'm only a few days in.  The difference this time is my helping method.  I got hypnotized.  Seriously.  I got into some deep stuff about my past, that wasn't really traumatizing, but important for me to deal with.  Since then, I feel in more control over many aspects of my life.  If any of you have considered it, I'd say go for it.  But do you due diligence in vetting your hypnotherapist.  Make sure they are certified. And make sure you can trust them.

If you haven't thought about seeing a hypnotherapist, have a conversation with one.  Don't sign up for anything.  Just find out more about it.  It has, and is changing my life for the better.

Stay strong quitters!

Today's the day I've decided I'm going to quit.

I've decided that today, I'm quitting. I've been smoking for 6 or 7 years now and I'm just done. I'm okay to use my e-cig (which I've just cleaned) It's been a long time coming but today, I'm sticking to this. I'm done with feeling like crap when I wake up, only to walk outside and smoke another ill cigarette, they taste like shit, they feel like shit after smoking and I've been putting out half or quarter smoked cigarettes the last couple of weeks.

I know this won't be easy (Hence why I have my e-cig. It's gotta be safer than normal cigarettes) but I have to do this for myself, my son and my girlfriend. That's all that matters now.

Good luck to me :)

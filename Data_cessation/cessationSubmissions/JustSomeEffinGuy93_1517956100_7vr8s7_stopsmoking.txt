Quitting while in school

I promised myself I would be smoke free by the end of the year and the sooner the better. I'm also a college senior.
Every day I say it will quit for real but I'm so disoriented and distracted by the afternoon that I give in and have one.
Tbe good news is I'm down to 2-3 a day but I still haven't gone a full 24 hours. How can I fight the insane brain fog so i can pay attention in class without nicotine?

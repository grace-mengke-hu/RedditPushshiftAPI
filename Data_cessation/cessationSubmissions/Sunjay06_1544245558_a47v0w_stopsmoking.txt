Thank you Reddit Family! 250 Hours Smoke Free.

Would just leave you guys with this quote from Allen Carr which I believe something those who have quit this addiction have felt. For those waiting for the right time , well today is! 

“However, I think the most pathetic aspect about smoking is that the enjoyment that the smoker gets from a cigarette is the pleasure of trying to get back to the state of peace, tranquility and confidence that his body had before he became hooked in the first place.”

16 days oh my. I can’t wait until 365 days.

Well I’m 16 days smoke free. I’m still on the 7mg patch and just stopped taking my chantix two days ago. I’m confident I am finished smoking. 16 days ago it was a week without one. The two or three I had on the 4th were disgusting and said that’s it I am done with these damn things.

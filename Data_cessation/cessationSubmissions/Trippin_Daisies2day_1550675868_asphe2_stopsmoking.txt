Lost 2 great lovers

So I have smoked for 35 years minus an 18 month stretch a decade ago. My spouse of multiple decades whom I loved dearly has left me. I decided that with the heartbreak I will be able to think of nothing else. So let's improve ourselves and quit smoking. It's day 4 no smoking and day 7 without her. It has been much easier than I could have imagined. I read a bunch on whyquit and drank juice. It helped tremendously

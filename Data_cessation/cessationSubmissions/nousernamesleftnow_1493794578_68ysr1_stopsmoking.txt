How long did it take until you stopped thinking about, or wanting a fag?

Quit cold turkey a little over 6 weeks now and feeling proud of myself. yay me! But quite a few times every single %@*!! day I still want a cigarette. 

ok, when I say I want one, it's not like the cravings of the first few weeks, more like a feeling of nostalgia for the good ol days. But I'm getting sick of hearing that little voice suggesting I should return to smoking and all the stoopid reasons it has. If I'm feeling low the reasons even make sense to me and I find myself becoming convinced having a fag would improve my life. 

I've got really challenging personal circumstances right now and I'm struggling emotionally. Wanting to smoke does seem to happen on my bad days when I'm stressed and depressed, but I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement. 

Someone want to tell me how great it is to be a non-smoker just one more time? Or remind me how crappy being addicted to nicotine is? 

How long did it take until you didn't think about them?

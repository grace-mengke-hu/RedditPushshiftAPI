Where do you stand on vapes/e-cigs?

I mean, we all know they're not as bad for you as cigarettes (I wouldn't go as far as saying it's healthier) but it's still the same habit/action and still a source of nicotine. I just ordered a new vape (smashed the tank on mine in January and went back to fags) because there's no way I can manage giving up, the habit of rolling and smoking. Ideally I'd like to work my way to 0mg nicotine and put the vape down.

I'm not sure if this post belongs here or not but yeah, thoughts?

4 Days In Going Strong

I had my last cigarette Friday evening at 6:30. 4 days without a single puff, I feel proud but very anxious. I averaged around 4 hours of sleep a night as I am very restless. I've compensated by chewing regular trident gum to the point that my jaws are sore. I work outside and had a pack and a half habit. I have so many cues throughout my day that its constantly tugging on me to have one. I have a mixed feeling of wellness as far as taste, smell, and breathing, but have a feeling I can only describe as an absolute discomfort in my own skin. I keep reading timelines on cold turkey quitting and feeling accomplished when I reach that next timeframe. However these timeframes are stretching out longer and longer and I'm resolute to hold out to the next one. Any tips or advice, perhaps a timeframe of when I won't be so fidgety.

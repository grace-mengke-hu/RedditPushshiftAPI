Tips for not smoking while drinking

So I have managed to not smoke for the past three (mid)weeks, but when out over the weekend I have ended up smoking. Everywhere I look the most common advice is to just stop drinking... just wondering if anyone has any alternative advice for being out and handling cravings. I am thinking of getting an e-cig for when Iâ€™m out but I would much rather knock the fuckers on the head all together.

I do not deny that cigarettes are occasionally nice. It's about saying goodbye without it being a hateful goodbye.

I do not deny that cigarettes are occasionally nice.

When I feel healthy, and Spring begins, and I sit on the back porch, a cigarette is nice.

When I am stressed at work, and I can escape for a few minutes and have a smoke, it feels good.

When I am anxious in a new city, or in a social situation, a smoke gives me something to do. I am grateful for it.

At a wedding or a funeral, either one, when I mark a milestone, a cigarette seems right.

How many is that? Say 1% of cigarettes are nice. It is fair to say that these events are nice with or without the smokes. But I will not lie and say that I have never enjoyed a cigarette.

Do I need Allen Carr to persuade me I don't like them? He is right about 99% of cigarettes. They are just plain junk. But I have enjoyed some.

I can make a rational choice, an obvious choice, and say that I don't want an addiction that is almost always awful.

I can say I enjoyed cigarettes on occasion, but must leave it behind.

As life goes along, I must leave some things behind, even some good ones.

It's about saying goodbye without it being a hateful goodbye.

Goodbye old buddy, thanks, but no more. Goodbye.

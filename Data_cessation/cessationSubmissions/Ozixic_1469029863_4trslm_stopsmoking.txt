Struggling.

I had smoked just over a pack a day for ten years. I have been smoke free since the 8th of July, that's just shy of 2 weeks, and I havent had any nicotine in 7 days. I didn't realise how much cigarettes helped me cope with the struggles of life, until now. Cigarettes put up a great wall seperating me from my problems, and that wall has come crashing down, fast. I have cried uncontrollably more in the last week, than I have my entire life. Sometimes I think it would be a alot easier and life much more enjoyable if I just lit one up again. I am proud to say I have not given into temptation yet, but I need to know if anyone else has experienced the level of misery from quitting that I feel now. This must seem like a stupid, pompous question but I am at my wits end. Does it get better? How did you cope? I really don't want to smoke, but I cant deal with this tidal wave forever.

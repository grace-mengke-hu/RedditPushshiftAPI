3 days in

It’s been almost 3 days since I accidentally quit smoking (I realised it had been 2 days and figured I might as well keep going). Tonight I’m going to the weekly social event which 1 year ago started my smoking habit, and this is the first time I’ll be going without smoking. I’m terrified that I won’t be able to resist because I’ve tried to quit before and this event has always been the thing that makes me relapse.

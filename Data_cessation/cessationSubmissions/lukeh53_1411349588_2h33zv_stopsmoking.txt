I think I can do this

Day 2 is coming to a close and I'm feeling pretty awesome :D I would always smoke while I walked my dog and after having walked him smoke free twice now, I am really enjoying how much more energy I have. 

I'm going to a friends house later, and he smokes, but I'm bringing my pack of gum and the mindset of "nah, I don't need one right now."

Looking forward to day 3!

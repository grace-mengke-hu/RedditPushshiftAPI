Non-Smoker for 2 years, curious about the 0mg vape

Hey fellas;

2 years ago i went cold turkey and quit my habit of smoking for over 10 years.

During this time i had my share of struggles but i managed to keep it clean and never touched any kind of tobacco product. Mostly because of the fear of starting again.

But I still miss the social aspect of smoking. It was a part of me for too long and somehow i cannot let that part go away totally.

So i came across with the vaporizers. I was reading about them for some time but after all my co-workers got into it i started to wonder about using one (0 mg) just to fill the absence of that missing part.

Now my worry is that the vape may act as a gateway to the regular cigarettes. I'm so afraid of starting again i've never dared touching any kind of tobacco product even to try what it's like. (snus, pipe, herbals etc)

What are your views on this device? Have any of you who already quit, started using a vape later on? How was the experience? Do you think my worries about the vape being a gateway holds any truth?

Thanks.

Edit: Point taken; No Vape! Thanks for the support!

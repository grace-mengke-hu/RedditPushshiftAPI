I just checked in and see it's been 4.2 years since I quit smoking! It feels like just yesterday I was struggling with quitting. Hang in there everyone, the juice is absolutely worth the squeeze with quitting!

I couldn't have quit without r/stopsmoking (with that star badge) and Allan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. I am so thankful for this group. And I think my two favorite things about quitting are that I have saved soooo much money not buying expensive packs of cigs and that my health has experienced a huge upgrade.

Cervical cancer gave me the kick up the bum to quit!

Heya, 32 year old Mum of 3 cool little guys here. Never been on reddit before, but here goes! I’ve smoked for more than half of my life, only giving up when pregnant and then straight back to it. The last few months have been tough with a cervical cancer diagnosis, talk about a wake up call! Smoking has huge links to cervical cancer, and I want the best chance of being healthy after my surgery, so I’ve finally given it the flick. I’m up to day 4 right now. Cravings today have been tougher than other days, but I’m determined! Woot, stick with it everyone else, and ladies I hope my story helps, 32 is way too young to be dealing with cancer!

Seven days and counting.

Seven, yep.  One whole week.  I feel great.  I have more energy than I did this time last week.  I had a little bit of stress Wednesday night and some cravings but got through it.  Tonight I had a little bit of craving after my celebratory "I made it a week" Pizza, but so far so good.  Still going strong.  Just wanted to check in and say all that.

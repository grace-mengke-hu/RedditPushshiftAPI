Anxiety about the anxiety

Tonight I end my relationship with a toxic friend. An abusive friend. Cigarettes.

What is doing me in the most is worrying about the anxiety that people experience. I struggle with bipolar, debilitating anxiety and insomnia. I'm really worried about the insomnia and anxiety because that can lead to terrible things in my life. But I have an appointment with the doctor next week should things go really south.

Any encouraging words? Appreciate this sub already. I've been reading it nonstop for the past week.

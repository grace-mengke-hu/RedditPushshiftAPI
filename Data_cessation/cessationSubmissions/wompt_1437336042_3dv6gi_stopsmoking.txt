Does quitting remove responsibility from the individual, and cheat them out of the opportunity to learn self-control?

I'm going to stop habitually smoking cigarettes this week. There is no benefit to smoking once an hour or even once every few hours.

I think that when people quit things, what they are actually doing is limiting their own freedom, to take something off the table, and in doing so never learn the self-control of being able to do something and not doing it. They never learn how to use something responsibly.

This may mean that a cigarette is a weekly, monthly, maybe yearly occurrence, but the pack a day or even pack a week habit is done.

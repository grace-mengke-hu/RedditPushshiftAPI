Well. Fuck.

I'm getting drunk.

My husband quit his job. I just lost my medical insurance. Goodbye OCD medication. Goodbye healthcare.

No ciggs though. Because I can't fucking afford it anyways.

Zero income with a household of 4.

God.. he said that he felt like you had more in store for him. I pray that you do. Please see us through this. I don't need the road to be easy, I just need it to be within my walk to follow you.

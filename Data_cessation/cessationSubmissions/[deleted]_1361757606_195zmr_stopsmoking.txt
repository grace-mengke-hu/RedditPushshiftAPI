I DID IT! Today (yesterday) is the day!

After trying my weaning program I noticed that I was starting to get headaches because of the smoking.

I am on day one without a cigarette, my roommates are still smoking around me but it already smells different. I am motivated to not do something, smoke.

I can do this!

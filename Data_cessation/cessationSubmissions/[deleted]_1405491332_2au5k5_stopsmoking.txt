My accomplishment on Monday.

So, Friday was my last cigarette. On Saturday I woke up, and did not sleep again until Monday night due to work and personal family tasks. 

As you can imagine, on Monday when I got off at 6:00 pm, I was incredibly cranky and felt like the only cure to the problem was buying a pack and attempting to quit some other time. I'm ashamed to say it, but I made the decision to buy a pack on the way home. I stopped at my usual convenient store and grabbed a Peace Tea out of the fridge and walked up to the counter.

 The lady recognized me because I normally come in once or twice a day during the week to buy my drink and cigarettes. She asked me, "Marlboro Blacks, right?" as soon as I got to the counter. I responded, "Well...." and while I paused I thought about my friend Ben who I quit smoking with and decided that no craving was worth betraying a serious promise to one of my best buds. Even though it felt like the hardest thing in the world at the time, and did until I finally passed out at home, I said no to smoking and walked out with just my drink. 

 When I finally woke up, I felt 10x better about not buying them than if I had. Ben and I are both on day 4 now, and had an intense work out together to relieve our stresses, as opposed to the normal chain-smoking we would do. I know it hasn't been long, but it does get a little easier everyday. 

Best of luck to everyone, no matter how many days it's been and how hard it is, you ARE stronger than a pack of cigarettes!

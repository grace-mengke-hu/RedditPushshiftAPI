Quitting NRT

I've been quitting smoking for just about 5.5 months and about a week ago finally went cold turkey on my nicotine lozenges. I am proud that I did, but I did not prepare myself whatsoever for the nicotine withdrawal. I don't have any cravings to smoke but I am just very irritable and angry often. Little life stresses are just really getting me down. I have no release anymore. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't have friends or any peers. I am too busy and committed to my business/growing family to take me time. I know that I cycle through depression, and that is probably why I feel this way.  Anyways, Good luck to all you quitters out there. Life doesn't get magically better when we quit, but it does smell better.

Do the cravings ever go away?

Hello all,

So, my obvious question is: do the cravings ever go away? I'd like to start by saying all the drugs I've quit over the last 2 months. 

I just graduated from college - in California where I heavily smoked weed (2-5 bowls out of a bong per day) - and came to live with family until I go to Grad school. I quit smoking weed immediately when I got here, causing the anxiety, stress, and boredom to significantly increase (that was around mid-June). I then quit cigarettes around the beginning of July/end of June; and quit drinking a little after that. I'm now free of all substances. 

Now, I have been smoking cigarettes for 4 years, about half a pack or more per day. Initially quitting was easy, I only had cravings for about three days. Lately, though, I've been heavily craving cigarettes and don't know why. It's been almost a month, cold turkey, and I still have cravings...

I'm really scared the cravings never go away which will eventually cause me to go back into doing it; and a part of me really wants to... 

Any advice will help, thanks

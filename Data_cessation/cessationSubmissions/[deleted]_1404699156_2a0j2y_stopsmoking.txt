I'm 18 and need some advice.

I tried smoking about two years ago. I only went through just under a pack. To this day I strongly miss cigarettes and crave them. I enjoyed smoking. I need advice on ways to make cigarettes make me sick.

I'll explain.. alcohol use to not bother me, I never drank more than a glass but all of a sudden one day, ANY alcohol makes me want to throw up. I can't stand it or the smell any more. Same with hookah. I use to actually love hookah with friends. I had no issues smoking it for hours. But again, all of a sudden one day, it made me want to throw up. I can't smell it without feeling like throwing up. Both happened out of nowhere with no explanation.

My question is what can I do to make smoking cigarettes do the same to me? I have tried everything else to make smoking unattractive but no matter what I keep craving it. Please help, if you have any ideas, I'm all ears.

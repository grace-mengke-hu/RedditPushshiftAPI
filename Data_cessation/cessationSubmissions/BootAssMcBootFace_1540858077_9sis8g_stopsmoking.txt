muh poor feeble lungs

Obviously after you quit smoking your lungs start to clean themselves up and you hack gunk. BUT what about vaping?

I'm on day 5 without vaping and my running performance is suffering heavily. My lungs burrrn and I have to cough very deeply afterwards. Never thought I'd experience this with vaping tbh. I couldn't even finish half my usual distance today and it was very slow/painful.

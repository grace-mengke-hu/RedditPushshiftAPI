I want to help my dad.

My dad is a heavy smoker. He always has been. But now that he's in his 60s his health is deteriorating, and the smoking is not helping. After several attempts I finally managed to quit smoking, but he doesn't think it applies to him because I only smoked for 2 years, and my age made it easier too.

So how do I approach the topic? He's stubborn, and even though he knows things are getting worse, he feels it's already too late. What's done is done he says. Is there anything I can do?

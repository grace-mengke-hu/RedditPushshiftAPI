Day 4!

Well this is it... my 3rd attempt... and 4 days of smoke free... very hard at moments, but already happy with the result and hoping the 3rd time will be the good one! My first 2 attempts were without any help. The start was smoothly but after a week I would break saying Ah well... one won't hurt... And we all know where that leads to :-/ So this time I went for the nicotine spray to try to cut the habit before the nicotine detox and next week I am seeing a psychologist / tabacologist to guide me! I am using an app and today I discovered this website and liking it so far :-)

Let's kick this demon together :)

12 days without tobacco after 12 years with tobacco.

It has been 12 days since I quit smoking. When I quit I didnt know I was quitting. I just didnt buy another pack of smokes. Money is so tight. I just cant afford to smoke. I could bum, but I think quitting is the best way. It has been easier then any of the times I have tried. I had some really shitty cravings. From the 3rd to around the 7th day were the worst. It feels good not having to go out in the freezing cold to smoke. I can smell cigarettes on others way clearer now and it feels good knowing that I dont smell like that anymore. And I am saving some serious cash. And just knowing that my son is not going to pick this habit up from me makes me feel a lot better.

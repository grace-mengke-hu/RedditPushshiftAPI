On my 3rd day

Two and a half days smoke free. I'm really craving the taste again. I'm having some body soreness which is managable but by the time night rolls around I have a massive headache and feel like the easiest way to make it vanish is to just smoke a little, a few puffs. But I know that will lead to regular smoking again. I'm trying to keep my hands busy (video games and guitar) and my mouth busy too (ricola and toothpicks). That's been helping with the physical desire to smoke again. But I'm having a really hard time getting through the migraines. Thanks for listening

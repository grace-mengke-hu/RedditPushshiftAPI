4 years without a cigarette!

I can't believe it is now year 4 without smoking. It does get easier as time moves on though. At this point I sometimes I forget I ever smoked for 20 years. What a waste of money and time that was.

Keep on the good fight those of you in the early stages. You can do it! I did it my first time luckily and I did it with the help of patches. 10 weeks of itchy redness and weird dreams. But it worked. Not sure what the cold turkey road had for me, but I saw more anxiety and failure that route.

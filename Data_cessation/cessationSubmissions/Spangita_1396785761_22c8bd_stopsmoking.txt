Nicotine and tobacco free cigs???

Hi! 
I've been doing well with quitting so far and am pretty happy as a non-smoker. However, sometimes I miss the action of smoking something and I wonder about those tobacco and nicotine free cigarettes. Obviously I don't want to get hooked on nicotine again but when my friends smoke or my boyfriend smokes weed, I wonder whether having a safer alternative might be a good substitute for when I'm missing it. I have seen the tobacco and nicotine free cigs in health shops but my worry is that they might trigger a desire to smoke a real one... Also as I am pleased that so far I haven't smoked anything at all since new year, I don't know if that's a line I want to cross! Any thoughts?

Rough day and almost caved at 6 months

Hey Everyone, 

I'm writing here to say that today was a rough day for me. My life has fallen to shambles lately unfortunately. I walked out onto my balcony and found a pack of smokes sitting there left by my now ex-gf. I took one out and there was a lighter. All the difficulty I had been going through begged me to just light that cigarette, but luckily I waited for a few minutes and really thought about it. I remembered the line "you never have to feel this way again if you don't want to." So I put down the cigarette and walked back inside. 

It seems strange to post something like this after so long and after everything has been going well lately, but I wanted to acknowledge this success. Also, while it may be discouraging for people early on in their quit to read something like this, it was considering all the benefits that made me put it back. . 

All the best and stay smoke free everyone!

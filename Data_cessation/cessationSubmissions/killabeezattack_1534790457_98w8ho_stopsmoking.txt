Today is the day i quit!!!

Hello all,  


After Roughly 13 years of smoking(8+ years of a pack+ a day) and with my new aspiration to join The Canadian Armed Forces, i have decided for Health purposes i am going to quit smoking, This is something i have been thinking about for a long time but have done nothing about. So i went and got a 21 Pack of the Nicoderm 24hr Patches. (Step 1) And just smoked my last smoke, I will be using this thread to keep people updated on my experience and any tips /  Coping methods i have come up with.  


Please feel free to share your experiences and any tips you may have come across, All inspo will be a huge help. Like i said i will post back here regularly to keep you all updated on my progress!!!   


Here is to a new healthy and prosperous future!   


Some Questions i have for anyone who may have used this Patch.  


Questions:  


1) Where do you apply your patch?  


2) How long did you stay on Step 1?  


3) What did you do when you found the craving to get really bad?  


4) How long did you stay on the patch before quitting?  


Thanks!

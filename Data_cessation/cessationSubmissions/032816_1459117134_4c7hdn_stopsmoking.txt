Finally and hopefully for life!

Finally decided to quit smoking for life. Been through the struggles for a few times but this time I hope being here with other fellow mates who are in the same boat I will have more success.

Today will be the last day and as Allen Carr said pick a date and Mine is 3/28/2016!

Day1: success, got through it with no major pitfalls. Ate healthy, went for a bike ride and hung out with a friend. Just an observation: Looking at some of the tv series that depict early 1930's there is way too much smoking.

Day2: a few cravings," just one" was the thought in my head.. Ignored it and went about work. Feel a little lightheaded .. Not sure if that's in my head or the body getting more oxygen!

Day3: Fended off some early morning cravings and instead worked out for a bit. Feels like my metabolism has slowed down the last few days.. I am not as as regular as I used to be :-)

Day4: Woke up way too early and rummaged the entire house to see if there was a stash somewhere.. Luckily none were to be found and I am still on the right path!

Day5: Stopped near a convenience store, deliberated going in for a good 10 mins and walked away empty handed! Proud of my self.

Day 10-12: Was when I had "Just One" and well off the wagon for a whole week.. 

Hit the Rest Button and Starting all over Again- (Day1): AP15

Last night I dreamed about cigarettes

So it's been about 24 hours sincemy last cigarette, some say those first 24 hours are the hardest. I want to be truly committed to quitting so that I can add more exercise to my life and be overall healthier. But last night I dreamed about smoking (and sex) which was just crazy and so of course I woke up this morning completely feening and feel I'm about to ruin 24 hours of progress now. Anybody else ever have this happen to them? 
EDIT: I've smoked for 20 years y'all, seriously started when I was 13. The majority of my life has been spent as a smoker, minus the short periods of time I've quit while pregnant....

This had to come up sooner or later.

What is up with the boogers that have fathom-like snot appendages attached to them. I might be alone on this but when i can't breathe i pick my nose. Then and again (more often since i quit it seems) one seems to drag something out from a region that can only be described as in the vicinity of the brain.

Is there anything to take away from this? I really don't know. I guess I am surprised by my somewhat congested bodily fluids... : P

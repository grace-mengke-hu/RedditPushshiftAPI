I'm pretty happy that I(20) stopped smoking .But I'm just scared where I'd start again like when I go to parties and stuff. How to reject the cigarette always? I do that pretty much every day now and people stopped asking also.When you meet new people and they offer and idk it's a lilhard to resist

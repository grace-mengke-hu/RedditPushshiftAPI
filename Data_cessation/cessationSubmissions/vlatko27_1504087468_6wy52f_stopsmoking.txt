5 days nicotine free...sleeping troubles

32 years, smoked for the better part of the last 18 years. 

10 days ago, after my vacation where I was binging 3 packs/day for 2 weeks, I had enough. I bought gums, patches, quality electronic cigarette, the works. First 5 days without cigarettes went ok with the nicotine substitutes - however after those initial 5 days I read Allan Carr's book and my world changed. 

I'm now on 5 days nicotine free, I feel great, cravings are minimal - even during my biggest vices beer and coffee. The only downside is my sleeping has went to shit. I'm usually a hard sleeper, always getting my 7-8h sleep basically without waking up. Now I can barely get 2h without waking up, I'm constantly turning around in the bed and sleep is hard to find. 

Anyone have similar experiences, any tips? I'm not gonna cave and smoke but I'm hoping this won't continue for a long time.

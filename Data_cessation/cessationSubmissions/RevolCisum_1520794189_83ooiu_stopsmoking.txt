Day 7, day 1 without any nicotine

Today is my 7th day no actual cigs, and 1st day without nrt.  Morning craving was stronger than usual it seemed, but it's passing, kind of.  I have a hell of a headache.  But, I have the day off, so I can stay in bed and be comfortable and relax and get through this.  Hope everyone else us hanging in!  I am loving these deep breaths I'm able to take already!  Let's kick this unhealthy nuisance out of our lives and be free!

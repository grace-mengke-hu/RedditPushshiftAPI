Bought a pack of cigarettes a couple days ago...

and just gave them to my friend's roommate without smoking one. Don't worry, it's not like the roommate wants to quit or anything. He actually really enjoys smoking cigarettes...for now...

Anyways, I was toking, and my friend and I decided to get some ice cream. Wasn't really thinking and bought a pack of stogs with the ice cream at the grocery store. Went back to his place to eat the ice cream, and thought to myself "why the fuck did i buy these". My friend's roommate came down to take a cigarette, and I told him he could have the new pack. he was grateful of course. basically just gave him 6 bux. Ate 4 ice cream bars instead LOL. But that can be burned off after a few gym sessions this week. The damage from cigarettes can't. only quitting will heal. Will take ice cream bar over cigarette any day. 6 and a half days in and about to go to bed, which means it;ll almost be 7 days by the time i wake up. WE CAN DO IT!!

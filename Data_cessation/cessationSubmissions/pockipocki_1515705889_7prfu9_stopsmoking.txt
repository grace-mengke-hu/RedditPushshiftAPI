How long do you need for withdrawals to subside ?

My SO and i are expecting our daughter in 4 weeks. He is still actively smoking ... Actually seems to be smoking more daily than he was before. He told me he was going to quit before she was born but refused to give me a timeline. I know he smokes at least 1 pack a day of camel crushes . Probably 2-4 cigs Everytime he goes outside for a break. 

How long does it take for withdrawals from nicotine ? I am terrified that he won't wait until she's born.. going through withdrawals with a newborn cannot be fun and I'm assuming chances of relapse is greater with added stress ? I have been trying to passively request him to stop sooner than later but no dice. What should I expect ? I am scared that he is going to be more irritable and unpredictable. This is his first child. Any insight is welcomed. I'm internally freaking out because I have never experienced this before in my life. Thank you !

already 21 days! Feeling better than ever. Cognitive dissonance reduced? Anyone else experience similar?

Quitting smoking (using patches, now on step 2) has been good for my physical health, but I'm also noticing I feel better mentally. Anyone else notice similar benefits?

I am not dropping whatever I was doing/talking/thinking to go outside every hour. Seriously a dramatic improvement. *Everything* seems just a little bit easier to deal with. 

I also noticed that because I go to the store less often, I'm saving even more money than I thought I would by quitting.

**The truly unexpected bonus:**  
I just feel happier. I'm not sure if clarity is the right word, but it feels good. Even in those dark moments. So I did some thinking. I had read about cognitive dissonance a bit in college, but kind of disregarded it. To roughly paraphrase [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), it's mental stress that comes from holding conflicting ideas. 

**For me, the conflicting ideas I was holding were:**  
* "I want to quit smoking"  
* "I can't quit smoking right now, I will be too stressed out"  
* with a splash of the belief that "quitting smoking isn't actually that hard if you really stick to it"

I've been carrying this mental weight around this whole time without even realizing it. Followed this sub for over a year before quitting and even had an app on my phone to quit.  

Anyone else experience unexpected benefits to quitting smoking?

I want to quit smoking.

I'm 22 years old and I am smoking for 1 year. I always kept myself away from smoking just because I didn't like it until last year. ALL of my friends are smoking so I'm always around them. First I only smoked while drunk because I didn't feel bad like when I'm sober. Some day I found myself buying packs and smoking regularly. It was 5 a day before but now it's 10, still not much I think but I know it's going to increase. I can stop smoking for a few days or can smoke once a day or once in 2 days when I'm in my family house (I go outside for smoking, they don't know). When I'm at my own house I always say "fuck it, what's gonna happen, I want to smoke". That's the problem. I want to quit but don't want to at the same time. What should I do? Thanks everyone and sorry for the long post (if it's).

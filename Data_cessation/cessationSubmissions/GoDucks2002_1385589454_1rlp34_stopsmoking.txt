Thoughts on E-cigs? Do they help? Best brands, deals, etc.

A bit of background on me. I smoked for about 5 years. Quit for 3 solid. Have been off and on for the last two. Mostly off, but will relapse every few months. Right now I'm in the midst of a 6 mo. slide. The longest I've smoked since I was 24. I'm 29 now. 

I know it's counter to actually not smoking and being addicted to nicotine, however. I do think there could be some benefits in helping replace trigger behavior, the smell, and lung damage.

Thoughts please! I just bought my first one. The blu brand.

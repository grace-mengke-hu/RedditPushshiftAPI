Anyone else suffer from ADHD? Did it get worse after quitting?

I have had “textbook” ADHD since I was a kid, and only started taking medicine for it as an adult (around 3 years ago - am 30-F) for the past week, I have cant concentrate on anything, despite taking my normal medication. Then today it dawned on me that quitting is the only thing I have changed. Has anyone experienced their ADHD or ADD symptoms get worse after quitting? Is that a “thing”?

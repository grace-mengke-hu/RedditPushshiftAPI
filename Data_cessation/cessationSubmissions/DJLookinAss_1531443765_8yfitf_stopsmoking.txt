Welp, I messed up!

I made it almost one whole month without a cigarette, and I don’t know what happened. Had an especially stressful past few days, and I’m not sure what came over me. I’ve had two cigarettes today. 

The good news is, though, that they tasted absolutely disgusting. I don’t have any desire to smoke any more of the pack, and am throwing it away. 

At first I was disappointed in myself, but I’m not going to beat myself up. I slipped up, and I’ve already proven that I can go without cigarettes.
So I guess I’m going to reset my badge tonight and start this thing over.

Here’s to day one! (Again)

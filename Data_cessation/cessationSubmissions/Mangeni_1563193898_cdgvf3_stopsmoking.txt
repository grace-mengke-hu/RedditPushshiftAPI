Planning my cravings

I quit on 1st November, 2018, and it’s been about as tough as you’d imagined. I was lucky enough to get away from my college town, and I don’t really have the same triggers where I live now like I used to back when I was in university.

Smoked for 7 years prior, not really that long, considering. But recently I’ve noticed that I’ll be planning a place to go and smoke, somewhere that maybe some friends are hanging out. Like this weekend for example, I want to go to a town nearby and see who’s around. I know my closest friends might not be there, and they’re the ones who always encourage me to quit, but I’ve got other friends who are indifferent and they might be there.

So I keep telling myself, maybe I’ll just go Friday, but a pack and post up next to the river. I find myself imagining this weekend, getting drunk and smoking just one pack, you know? That sort of awful justification that I feel like my brain uses every time.

Fuckin sucks, man. I’m worried if I go and no one is around, it’ll happen. No one else will know, there’s always plenty of travelers there to make friends so it’s not like I’m totally alone either. Fuck it’s tough sometimes.

Finding it hard to believe I'll keep going

Hey! I haven't smoked in about 11 days now. I've been wanting to quit for ages but kept making excuses. Anyway, I got a stinking cold, and am now in the middle of a trip overseas with a friend who hates smoking. So now I have 11 days. 

I've smoked on and off since I was 15. While I can go a few days no problem, this is the longest I've gone without smoking in a decade at least. I really want to stick to it. 

I'm really worried that when I get home, back to my smoking husband, smoking friends, and lovely evenings in pub gardens with delicious beer and a pack of fags, that I will find it really hard not to fool myself into thinking I can have just one or that because I don't smoke every single day, that that makes it ok. 

How do you guys keep yourselves on track once the hard part of the first few days is over?

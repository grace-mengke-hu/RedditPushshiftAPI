72 hours... It gets easier after this right?

Been smoking 10-15 per day for 7 years - had my last cig on Monday at 10:20pm, went to sleep with my heart pounding and had a dream I had a heart attack. This certainly kicked me into touch and I've been cold turkey since.

Been using the app "smoke free" for iOS which has really helped me to see progress and quickly note down when I have a craving. (106 in 3 days :-( )

I heard the withdrawal symptoms were like a 3 day hike and then it's easier because your cleaned out. Any thoughts? (Preferably good news?)

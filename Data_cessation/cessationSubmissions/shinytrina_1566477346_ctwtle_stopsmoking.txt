Why is it that the middle of the week, over night, is the worst?

So for the past 2 weeks, my dreams overnight Wednesday into Thursday seem to be the worst for me.  My dreams are filled with smoking and most of my triggers, especially the main ones that kept me smoking for so long. I wake up in a sweat during he early morning and thing oh god I should just go down to the local 7-Eleven and pick up 2 packs, the last I was in there they had a 2 pack special. Thus far I just take a few deep breaths and roll back over and drift off to sleep again. I hope this goes away soon. Does anyone else have this issue during a particular part/time of the week? 

23 days, soon to be 24 days, and still going strong.

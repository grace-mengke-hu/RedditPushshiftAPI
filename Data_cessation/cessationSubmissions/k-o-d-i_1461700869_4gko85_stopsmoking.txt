Maybe it's a choice...

The day before yesterday I ran out of cigarettes and a totally unexpected thought crossed my mind. What if I don't have to buy more? What if I have more control than I think I do? So instead of a fresh pack I bought one of these newfangled e-cigs. I'm not too crazy about it and don't really plan to use it in the long term. It feels weird and tastes like candy. 

I never really made a conscious decision to quit. Instead deciding to assess other options. In the past two days I've only smoked three real cigarettes. Pretty good compared to the 15 or so a day I've been smoking. Still this vape thing is very different and I'm really starting to crave cigarettes. I think it helps me to not put all the pressure on myself but now that I'm here I don't want to completely back out of this self-improvement mood I've suddenly, surprisingly found myself in. Has anyone here had a good experience with these vape pens? Am I just transitioning into a different bad habit? Am I becoming one of these douchey, holier than thou, vape bros? I don't understand what's happening to me haha

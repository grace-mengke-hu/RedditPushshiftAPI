Boyfriend and I I just quit. He's almost two weeks in, and I'm on day 5.

No cravings so far---I quit after he did because I was incredibly stressed with finals, but made my quit date last Saturday.

We both got vapes and have been successfully battling cravings. We both smoked for around 10 years (I'm 26, he's 25) and this is the first time I've actively quit. Other than being sick, I feel wonderful and accomplished! :) I know we can do this, and I'm so excited to start getting healthier with him.

If I can make it 3 days at work I can quit, but how do I make it those three days?

I literally just spent about 15 minutes rolling the bare ends of butts to get enough tobacco to get a disgusting ashy tasting cigarette and smoked the shit out of it. That ended four minutes ago, on midnight. I'm fucking done.

I don't know how I'm going to stand going to work without any cigarettes, though, and I'm scared. I've been smoking for a while and I said I would stop before I turn 26 and now I've been 26 for almost 2 months now, still smoking, and I can't help but think about all the bad effects it's having on my body, as well as the money I can't afford that I somehow do buying ciggs when I don't even have groceries to feed myself. I'm living from paycheck to paycheck and I have to stop smoking, it's absolutely disgusting.

But I've quit at least a hundred times in the past four months alone. I keep trying, over and over, I reset my badge I quit cold turkey over and over and I can't seem to stick to it. But I know if I can at least get 3 days things will get easier, right? So then just give me good advice on what to do at work:

* There are three breaks every day, two of which are ten minute ones that smokers go to smoke at in front of the building. I know I can go there and bum a free cigg at any time. Sucks knowing this all day. 

* What would I do in the break room? I'm already reading while I work for the most part, so reading more in the break room is something I could do, but if I'm bored of that do what? Play on my phone?

* Should I stop smoking bud while I quit ciggs? When I finish a bowl I have a big habit of smoking a cigg right after.

* How long before I can start jogging?

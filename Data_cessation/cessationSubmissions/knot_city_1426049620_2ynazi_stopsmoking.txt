How a lapse actually 'cured' my craving

Strangest thing ever happened to me, I was quitting on the patches and I was 6 days in, I finally gave into the voice in the back of my head and lit a cig up, I was very depressed because I knew (from my last 4 attempts) that this was the end of my quit attempt. It had been the hardest attempt I had ever done, I was puffing away on a e cig and had a patch on etc.

The odd thing is, after I finished it, the only thing smoking it achieved was making me want another (straight after). Its been 2days since I realized the only thing smoking was doing for me was prolonging the withdrawal symptoms over the span of my whole life.

 I just ripped the patch off my arm and resolved myself to tank it out. The strangest thing is I haven't even experienced a craving since the lapse? anyone experienced anything like this?

Its incredibly strange but I just haven't had the urge to smoke, at all. I know its only been 2 days, but I'm sure of myself this time, I know I'm an ex smoker. Its one thing to be able to resist for 8 weeks (which is my best) its another thing entirely to just not care about smoking. 

edit: I should say that  do feel nicotine withdrawal, a sort of empty hollow feeling in my chest and stomach. The difference is it doesn't bother me all that much, and I also don't feel as though a cig will fix it.

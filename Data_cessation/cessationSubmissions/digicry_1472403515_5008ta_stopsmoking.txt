That motivational wallpaper?

Hello fellow quitters, I thought I would start quitting from today. When I was smoking I saw one picture/wallpaper somewhere here in Reddit that was really inspirational and motivated to quit right away. It had black background with maybe a planet or two (can't remember vividly) on the down right corner. And the text written something like:
 

"When you quit smoking, first day your blood loses some nicotine,
 
second day your teeth starts getting better,
 
third day (something random good happens to your body)
 
blah blah good"
 

I thought it was really inspiring but I had a glance like 2 months ago and totally forgot. If anyone knows about it, could you please link it here? This will help many people including me. Would really appreciate.

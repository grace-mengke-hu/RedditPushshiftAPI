Festival this weekend. Afraid I'll smoke.

This weekend I've got a 3-day festival coming up and I don't know what it is about music festivals, the atmosphere... the people.. the music.. the alcohol.. but I'm very afraid I'll start smoking again. I'm going with a few people of whom some of them smoke. Any tips? I really really really don't want to smoke again.

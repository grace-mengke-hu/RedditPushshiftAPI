Day 1

I just got prescribed the patch today. Turns out your insurance has a pretty vested interest in you quitting, so, I got 8 weeks (6 weeks 14 mg, 2 weeks 7 mg) for $0.

I've "stopped" before, always cold turkey, and whether it was six months or a week later, I'd always come back.

I'm fucking sick of it. It's disgusting. I don't want cancer. I miss being able to run like a gazelle with lungs full of sweet, sweet O2.

So I quit today, after getting the prescription. My last cigarette was about 5 hours ago. I've already stocked the car with sunflower seeds. I'm sure I'll be back on this sub to bitch, and to get support, so here's a preemptive thank you, to all of you. 

Let's do this.

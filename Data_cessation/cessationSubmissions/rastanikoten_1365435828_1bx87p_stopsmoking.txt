Life is getting better rapidly after 9 days of quitting.

Cigarettes are still my enemy and the battle against them wears on. 90% of the time, the battle just seems like a faded memory. thats great. I feel most vulnerable at night, prior to bed. I always use to have that last cig about 1/2 hr before hitting the hay, but I remember why I quit. Cigarettes are a progressive degenerative destruction; a slow suicide. I dont need, want, or like them. 

I want to be more attractive to the ladies :) 
I need to make babies for self-actualization.

I've been exercising to battle obesity and depression. Boy was quitting a good compliment to those other goals. I've lost 30 lbs in the months through diet and started exercise with smoking secession. And my body mass index today is 30.0--right on the borderline for obesity. Just 2 lbs more to go down and BMI will be in the overweight category. I want to make running my addiction. I've pretty much got three health problems kicked in the butt: smoking, obesity, depression. There is no turning back now. I am so proud of myself. The burning light inside me keeps raging on. 


The exercise is getting the pulminary and cardiovascular systems into repair. I feel alive and regenerating rather than decaying. I love it. 

All of this motivation came from going back to college. I learned a lot about personal responsibility and making good choices to achieve goals. I choose to battle my problems, not just accept them.

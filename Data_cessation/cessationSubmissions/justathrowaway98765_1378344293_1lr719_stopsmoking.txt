How do I help my friend kick the habit?

I'm sort of new here and didn't see any resources in the sidebar for this kind of thing (maybe I'm blind), so I figured I'd go for it. I don't, and have never had a smoking problem (yay me), but this past June I found out that a good friend of mine and started smoking to cope with some difficult things that had happened. When I confronted her about it, she said she was quitting so I left it alone, but today I once again found out that she is still smoking and still trying to quit. I asked her about it, but frankly, I'm a rather harsh person and could see that I had offended her in the way that I asked. She was upset, and I have no idea how difficult it truly is to quit.

I've really thought it through now, and am willing to commit myself to help her quit, but I haven't talked to her about it because I don't even know where to start. What should I tell her? How can I help? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

**Quick Edit:** Just from browsing links for a few minutes, I have seen Alan Carr's name come up quite a bit, would getting her his book help?

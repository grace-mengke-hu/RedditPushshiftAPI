Today marks two weeks

I smoked for about 4 1/2 years. All my friends did so i did too, worst mistake ever.

I'm overweight and I was a smoker and a drinker, trifecta of dying at 40 like my dad. I smoked a cigarette and then with 4 left in the pack just stopped. the pack is still on my dresser, I wave to it sometimes and just keep walking. I don't miss it at all because it has no power over me.

I still have one friend who smokes, i hate the smell now and i give him crap for it. i cant believe i let cigarettes hang out with me for 4 1/2 years. eww.

Quitting was easy, i just didn't smoke didn't have the urge and I still don't. I just got accepted into my Bachelors program for school, I work two jobs and I'm running for State Rep in NH. i just don't have time to waste on it.

don't let a plant and a peice of paper hurt you anymore, your better than that, we're all better than that.

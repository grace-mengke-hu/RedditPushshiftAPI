Strategies for those first few weeks?

I've read/heard that things like toothpicks/lollipops, etc help with the psychological side of putting something else besides a smoke in your mouth. 

For all those that have successfully quit, can you give me any other advice as to things to take my mind off when the cravings come on? Walks, reading, etc?

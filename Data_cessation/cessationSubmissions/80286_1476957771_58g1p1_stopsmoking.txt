30 days!

I gotta thank the community for having kept me focused and inspired.

The first 3 weeks were a brutal emotional roller coaster but since then things have calmed down considerably. I still get 5-6 random craving episodes a day but they come and go very fast and are easy to get over. Many old triggers have nearly disappeared (craving after waking up, after dinner etc). I'm still cautious about drinking, and should cut it down anyways. Also I eat a lot more and have gained a lot of weight (I'd guess 3 kg), but that's part of the package and will tackle it later.

I'm not just happy, I'm ecstatic. It's looking more and more possible that I'll overcome this ugly addiction. I have already greatly enjoyed the benefits of addiction free life, where every fricking thing doesn't revolve around smoking, or rather, the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms, where for every thing you do, place you visit or activity you attend to you don't have to make a tactical plan of where and when you'll get your nicotine fix, where you don't have to cringe when you count the money you have recently spent on the worthless, life quality destroying addiction, where you don't have to feel ashamed each time you take a puff that you are such a weakling for being unable to quit. And so on.

Let's keep the spirit up, fellow quitters.

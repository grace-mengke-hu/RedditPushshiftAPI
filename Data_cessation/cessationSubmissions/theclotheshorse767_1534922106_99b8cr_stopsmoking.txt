Replacement habits and activities

Hi guys, 

I’m quitting smoking (not for the first time) on 1st September.

I’m looking for recommendations for replacement activities/habits as every other time I’ve tried to quit I’ve wound up biting my nails which isn’t a great replacement habit!

This time I’m planning to get a gel manicure so I can’t bite my nails and am actually already doing exercise but wondered what habits you guys have found help you to quit as a replacement activity?

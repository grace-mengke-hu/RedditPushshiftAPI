The first two times I smoked during my quit (The first was a night of smoking was last December and the other was a couple of months ago), I forgave myself so I could keep my shiny badge.  On Friday night though, I bought a pack of cigarettes and got drunk with some friends.


I might have been able to forgive myself for it once again, but I continued to smoke through most of Saturday until it became too gross and it seemed to be depleting my mental resources.  So because of that choice to continue smoking on Saturday, I have reset my badge.

I really just want to curl up in a ball.

On varenicline, yet again....

Currently 1.5/2 packs a day.  (So done with this stuff!)  I stopped snuff (Skoal, etc..) about 5 years ago, so that habit is thoroughly gone, thank goodness.

Varenicline seems to be good for me, but weird side-effects for some people from what I understand.  Talk to your doctors please... :)

This is not my first rodeo, of course.  Took this stuff about 7 years ago or-so and managed to abstain for about 1.5 years until drinking got in the way, like it can do.

OMG though, first day on it and I can't smoke without feeling sick and extremely nauseated.  (F** yes!)  I don't remember this side-effect, but my desire to smoke has already plummeted.

Wish me luck and cheers!  Take care and put down the smoke.

(Edit: Oh, varenicline is just the normal name for Chantix...)

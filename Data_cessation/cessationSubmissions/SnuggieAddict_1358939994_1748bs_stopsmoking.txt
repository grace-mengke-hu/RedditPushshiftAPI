Alright! Cold Turkey, Here we go.

After smoking ONLY 3 cigarette for the last few days, I've decided - let's go! My pdoc allows me to take a benzo if the panic gets too much for me, and I have a meeting with my doctor tomorrow for some support and evaluation. 
Didn't smoke for 15 hours now. Went on a big walk with my dog, and right now I'm munching on tic tacs and some orange juice.

This will be hard but I'm optimistic. let's get this party started!

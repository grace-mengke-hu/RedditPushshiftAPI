101 days without the nicotine.

Got off nicotine lozenges 101 days ago after getting a bad flu and not being able to restock, so I rode out the 3-day flu and haven't had nicotine since.  I had my last cigarette maybe 6 months prior to that -- So it's been about 9 months since my last cigarette and 101 days since I've had nicotine.
YAY!

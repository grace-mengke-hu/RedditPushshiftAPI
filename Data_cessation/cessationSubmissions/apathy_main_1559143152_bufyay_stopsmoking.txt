Hey. So I quit smoking today

I started smoking on my 19th birthday. At the beginning it was a fun thing I did when I was at parties or I was hanging out with friends. A couple of months later I've become absolutely addicted. I've started smoking 6-7 cigarettes a day. I feel extremely weird if I don't. I have no idea how it turned out to be like this. I can't believe I'm addicted at the age of 19. So instead of wallowing in self pity I'm going to quit today. I've been reading this subreddit for quite a while now and I feel like since it's only been a couple of months so I can quit successfully. Wish me luck

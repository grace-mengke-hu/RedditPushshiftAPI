Almost at one week!

At the moment my brain is acting like a child having a tantrum because I wouldn't buy it McDonalds, and is looking for any excuse to make me give up- but every time I get one of these thoughts or cravings I explain things to myself like I would an angry child- "I know you want it, but things are different now, you can't have one because it's bad for you, and even though it might seem good, I know best"

Anyone else have debates with their 'nicotine brain'?

Can't stop for anything

So I've tried quitting a few times and always relapse. What drove me to write this post was that I had set a quit date a few days ago and stuck to it, but couldnt find my patches and went crazy for the psychological craving and just bought a pack. I had told everybody I know that Im quitting and everybody expected me to follow through. Now I've not only let myself down, but I've let down all of them. I'm on my state's quitting program and have plenty of resources bit they dont seem to help. I'm going to finish this pack and get more patches. Wish me luck.

Where do I even begin?

Ive tried giving up before but to no avail. I started smoking when i was 14, I started smoking as a result of a brief but debilitating mental health issue and now 6 years on as Ive recovered 100% mentally ( have been for years) I only feel like my addiction has gotten worse. The issue is all the members of my household smoke so the fear is that if i do try to quit theres always cigarettes around. I  feel that the only way I could give up is to lock myself in a room for weeks. How do I even begin the process?

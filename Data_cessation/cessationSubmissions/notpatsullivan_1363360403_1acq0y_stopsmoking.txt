Day 7: I'm having a really tough day today.

I've been a smoker for 8 years about a pack or more everyday. Last week I abruptly decided to quit, no weening down or any of that. Got through the first 5 days with mild/moderate amounts of discomfort. day 6 was pretty started pretty bad with me finding an old pack with one inside (no worries threw that little bastard away). I haven't really been able to sleep the past couple nights and the cravings have been beyond intense today. I know I'm not going to smoke but it would be nice to have a couple of people in my corner. Hey maybe I can help you with some positive thinking! I've been pretty good at that lately!

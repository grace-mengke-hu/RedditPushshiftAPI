Are you ever happy again?

I started smoking young, at 13, and was buying packs by 15. After 10 years, I decided it was time to quit. I've really enjoyed the time spent not smoking. I've been more productive, smell better, exercise more. I do not want to start smoking again. However, I have been insecure and mildly depressed the past two weeks. For people out there who are nonsmokers longer than me, does your brain ever return to normal levels of happiness? I hope so.

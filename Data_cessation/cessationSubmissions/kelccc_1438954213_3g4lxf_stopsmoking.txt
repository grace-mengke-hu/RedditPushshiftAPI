Five days in... Lots of phlegm and feeling generally crappy. Does this get better?

I have been quit for 5 days. FIVE WHOLE DAYS. Longer than I've ever made it in ten years of smoking. I also have literally no desire to smoke, at all. I'm appalled at it at this point. I'm just so thrilled with the prospect of a new life without smoking. I've already saved $40! 

However.... I feel awful. I feel sluggish, sore, achy, tired. I feel okay mentally but physically I feel very blah.

I also have a lot of phlegm in my throat. I'm not really coughing but I have been clearing my throat a lot. Is this a side effect of quitting? Is this normal?

When do I start to feel "good"? I'm willing to wait because I know the health benefits are worth it but I do want to feel "good"!

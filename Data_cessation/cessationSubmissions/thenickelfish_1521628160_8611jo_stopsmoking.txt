Accountability

Hey folks! I'm quitting smoking, too! I've been on and off since high school and spent the last few weeks on (and heavy) due to school stress. I found this place through r/stopdrinking and since it has been such a wonderful success for me, I decided to come and post so I've got something to come back to when the cravings hit. So, here we go:

My blood pressue is out of control. Hovering around 140/85. My dad was about this age (early 30's) when he had his *first* heart attack. Now he's 52, three attacks, three stints, and two other surgeries down the road, and he's on disability. He has dreams about his dad "calling him home". I thoght I could beat it with diet and exercise, but I've been sporadic in that effort because "I've got a lot going on, hur dur". After a trip to urgent care yesterday, I think it's time I start treating this thing like what it is: a harmful addiction that is straight-up killing me.

I've got the bottle in a headlock, but now it's time to kick Phillip Morris square in the nicodick. I've been vaping between relapses, used gum in the past, but nicotine is as bad for the arteries as anything else in a coffin nail. My wife and I made the descision to have kids and if I don't quit, I may not live to piss and moan about having to go to my kid's kindergarten graduation.

So, I quit. I have to be done with this if I want to make it to 50 with no plastic bits in my chest. Day One was a fucking pisser. Here's to Day Two.

I've noticed I've become more mature towards my emotions via quitting smoking, but do you have advice how to deal with these "fuck it, nothing matters" emotions that often are connected to relapsing?

I've developed a more mature, not as black-and-white approach towards my emotions during recent weeks and I've noticed this in situations when I'd like smoke a little but then did some more healthy activities to alleviate my stress. 

During the same time I stopped smoking I also took up the habits of meditating and writing about all the things I'm grateful of daily. I think that I'm able to take some distance to my negative emotions and take a different kind of perspective. My problem is that my negative emotions usually begin a spiral - if I did one mistake I begin to think about all the other negative things about myself and then feel utterly miserable - and this is usually when my discpline breaks and I quit my habits. But I've noticed that meditation and especially gratitude journal helps to break this spiral a little.

I don't think I begin smoking now though. I try to sleep well, take care of myself and maybe do some fun activities, try to keep up the habits of meditation and gratitude journal and I'll probably feel better a day or two from now.

Coming up on 7 days!

This has undoubtedly been one of the hardest 5 day stretches in my life, but I'm still here! I had my last cigarette on Monday at 11:30 AM, and come Monday, I will be celebrating a week of no nicotine, the longest stretch in a 3.5 year period. In order to treat myself, I bought a circular saw, thought having a reward system would be good. Thanks to all those in /r/stopsmoking for their help and guidance, wouldn't have been able to do it without such a supportive community.

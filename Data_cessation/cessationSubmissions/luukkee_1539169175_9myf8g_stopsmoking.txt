Stopping smoking or switching to vaping?

Hey everyone,

So I've been smoking daily (5 or less a day) for the last few years, but have recently become more conscious of the longer term impacts that it's going to have on my health. I don't feel a huge desire to quit at this point in time, but also want to do less damage to my body. Should I try and quit all together, or switch to vaping for the time being, with the ultimate goal of quitting sometime in the near future? What are peoples experiences with vaping, or with switching from cigarettes to vaping?

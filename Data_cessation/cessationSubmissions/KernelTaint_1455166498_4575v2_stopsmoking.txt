I feel like this will be impossible

I write this with a smoke in my hand.

So today I felt like shit. Woke up coughing up phlegm, sore throat and body. Had half a smoke (I smoke roll your owns, non menthol ), felt even worse.

Decided to leave my tobacco etc at home and go to work without them.

1/3 way through the day, and feeling the urge to smoke but not wanting to because of feeling like shit decided maybe now would be a good time to quit.

2/3rd way through the day urge to smoke gets worse, go hunting through car to see if any smokes laying around, find a prerolled menthol someone left in my car. Perfect! Shit no lighter, oh well. Ignore urge.

Almost 3/3rd way through work day, go hunting through car again for something to light smoke with, find lighter. 

And now I'm here having a smoke.. didn't even last a day. 

How do you make it past the first day?

Starting to read Allen Carr Book.

Today i'm starting to read the book you guys recommend. The thing is I'm scared that even reading the whole book it won't work and I'll be smoking afterwards. Any advice before reading it?
By the way how do you get that star that count the days you've not been smoking. Thank you.

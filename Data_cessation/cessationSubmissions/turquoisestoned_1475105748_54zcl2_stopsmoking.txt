What is considered actually quitting?

I smoked my last whole cigarette on Saturday night. Since then, I took two drags of a friends cig on Sunday. On both Monday and Tuesday I lit a butt and took a couple drags. Nothing today. So I've had approximately 6 drags total off cigs since Saturday night. I would like to think of that as my quitting day, because it's been a struggle and I'd like to give myself credit for those days even if I took a couple drags each day. I know it's kind of subjective but just curious for some insight either way. Thanks

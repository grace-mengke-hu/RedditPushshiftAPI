Day 2 smoke free, but I feel the pull. How can I stay motivated?

Hi all,

I really want to quit smoking, but haven't found much success over the past 3 years of trying. I am 30 and have been smoking on and off since I was a teenager. My longest break was from 16 to 20. Essentially, my wife hates it and it drives her crazy that I won't quit. 

Now I smoke primarily because it goes great with pot and alcohol. I really don't enjoy smoking cigs nearly as much when I am sober, but once I get with friends who smoke I begin to crave it again. I think if I was completely sober and friendless, it would be much easier to "stay" quit.  

Quitting is easy. I can cut it cold turkey at any time without withdrawal symptoms or anything. I could do it for a few days or a few weeks if need be. I just can't stay quit because I miss it. I remind myself all the good times we had and how it made me feel. How do erase all of these romantic memories of smoking and how enjoyable it is? I really do like smoking in general. 

Do I have to sober up to quit smoking?

Edit: I was just offered to go on a smoke break. I said no. But if I was drinking, I would have said yeah.

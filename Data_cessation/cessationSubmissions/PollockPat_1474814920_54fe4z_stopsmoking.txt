Vivid dreams last night

Woke up a little angry and all around down in the dumps. Couldn't figure what caused this attitude because I've been in a great mood the past couple weeks. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks, I dreamt I bought a pack of smokes and was chaining them in my dream. I was even pissed at myself in my dream! Had to slap myself and remember I'm bigger than all that! 
Keep strong ladies and gents!!

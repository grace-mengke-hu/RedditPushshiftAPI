I shed the armor that used to protect me from the world: it’s been 24 hrs since I quit and I am feeling vulnerable and overly sensitive.

I feel like a burn victim. I have no skin. I used to hide behind cigarettes, which apparently repressed my emotions but now I have no armor. I can’t stop crying and every little thing upsets me. 
Even though I do not want to smoke filthy cigarettes anymore, this emotional withdrawal is extremely hard. 
Please wish me luck guys! Is anyone feeling the same way?

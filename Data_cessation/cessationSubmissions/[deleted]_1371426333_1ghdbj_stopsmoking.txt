One week in, got rip roaring drunk and didn't smoke.

Drinking has always been a huge trigger for me, and I drank way too much last night. I was craving a smoke like nobody's business. But I didn't have one. I honestly think if it weren't for the check I made out to an anti-gay organization (my partner has to mail it if I smoke) I would have broken down and bought a pack. 

So yay to not smoking while drunk! Now to cut back on my beer intake, heh...

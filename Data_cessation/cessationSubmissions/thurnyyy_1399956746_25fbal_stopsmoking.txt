I don't smoke that much but I hate myself for it and want to stop.

I smoke anywhere between 1 to 5 cigarettes a day and also suck on an Njoy e-cig. I hate everytime i smoke and I really want to stop before it gets even worse.

As i was smoking an e-cig a lot and now i'm doing both would cold turkey be too tough? Or should i just bite the bullet and do it. I feel so disgusting and pathetic.

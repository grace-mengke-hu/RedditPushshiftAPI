Ok, I think I'm over the hump. For real this time.

I'm never sure whether it's worth posting here or not, even though everyone is so supportive.  
I went to a BBQ this past weekend. On my third beer, right when I should normally be caving in, it seemed like everyone around me all happened to pull out a cigarette and start smoking. Didn't even really have an urge to ask for one.  
  
Toughest first test passed. Fuck you cigs, if I can have a beer or two and not falter, I think I can make it on the journey to full on non-smoker.  
You shitty cunts, I hate you, cigs.  
/r/stopsmokers, thanks for listening, seriously. You guys and gals have helped me a lot. Knowing that there are so many of you out there that also make it 3-4 days and falter, but keep getting back up, makes it so much more doable. I appreciate you.

Merry Christmas!

Day 2 here. I knew I needed to quit before New Years, I'm a little anxious but very happy to finally be accomplishing something. I'm going to keep posting here as I go (this sub is great), but thank you to everyone on here for your help and support. I hope everyone stops and takes a minute to appreciate the good choice they've made in quitting.

I've just hit 3 years since I joined this subreddit and quitted for good.

This subreddit has been an inspiration for me. To be honest, I barely check in now, so I missed some important milestones, but milestones to where? I haven't touched a cigarrette in YEARS now. So milestones are kind of irrelevant now for me. Brothers, sisters, it's a doable thing, just give your heart for the first 6 months and avoid it at all costs, even if it means to run away from your best friend's party, even if you have to be rude to people, it's all worth it. Do whatever it takes to avoid it and someday, you'll wake up and realize how long it has been since you last lighted up one of those death sticks.

> I've been smoking since 1999. That makes almost 12 years. And I've tried to quit twice. The first time, I endured for 6 months, and the second one for about 8 months.
> The reason of my failure? I thought I deserved one cigarette for my hard work. And so I did, and failed. This time I'm convinced I gotta stop smoking and I want to do whatever it takes to achieve it.
> So far, it's been 8 days since my last cig. And I know I'll do fine for several months.
> IMO there are some hard challenges when trying to quit. The hardest one: parties. Everyone keeps smoking and makes it so fucking hard. So far, I've been at 2 parties without smoking, and that's a big achievement.
> Any tips will be much appreciated.

**I love you all my fellow warriors.**

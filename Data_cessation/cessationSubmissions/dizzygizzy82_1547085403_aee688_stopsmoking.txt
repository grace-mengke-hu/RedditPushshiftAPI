Really hopeing for some encouragement

Hi. I'm coming here in hopes of some much needed encouragement. I'm 36 and have been smoking since I was 15. I am just getting over a case of walking pnemonia that scared me bad enough to give quitting a shot. I honestly don't know how to even start the "quitting" process. I am thankful and appreciate any advice or encouragement you can give.

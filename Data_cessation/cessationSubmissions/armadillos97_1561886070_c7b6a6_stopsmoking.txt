It's been a week!

I made brownies to celebrate. Being able to taste them will be nice. :) 

I woke up to the smell of cigarettes twice last night because my partner smokes in the same room as me. Occasionally he smokes while in bed with me. I'm fine though. 

I've been having vivid dreams which I greatly enjoy. I dreamed of food, ninjas and earning money. I'm pretty happy with this, but I've had this feeling like I was moments away from caving. Several times it felt like I was going to. The moment right before you reach for a cigarette before you actually light it? It felt just like that without doing anything. 

I'm afraid that my mind is just waiting, but fear isn't productive. I'm so happy to be substance free. The down side....I have no chemical patches for my mental health. Change is inevitable. I'm doing my best to take responsibility for the direction that change goes. :) This is going to make the next steps easier. I don't want to be dependent on anyone or anything. I want to be free.

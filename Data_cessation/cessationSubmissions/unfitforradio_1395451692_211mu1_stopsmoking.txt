should i be worried about this person? Spoiler: it is me

I notice that I am brainwashed too, when I fool myself into believing I did something useful by leaving my house to get coffee.  

If I had people around me to give me a high five for the unwritten essays going through my mind then maybe I could feel like my opinions are validated and that i am useful to society by thinking about things.  

Capt. Corp sure appreciated me dragging my ass to give him money in exchange for hot brown liquid.  The exchange of money. Yes, much pleasure for Capt. Corp.

If I stay home and think, the only person who thinks that is cool is me.  It is so lonely.

Each phrase I think only makes me feel more alone.  More words unsaid, as I am educating and indoctrinating only myself.

Who would want to listen to this shit?  I skim my own writing sometimes.  Harsh.  

When you tell the internet you feel like dying a lot of the time it agrees with you.

If you tell a doctor you feel like dying they will lock you up.

If you think about dying while your face shows a smile you may develop a sarcastic, ironic or humorous personality or maybe nothing will happen.

If you tell a friend you think about dying they will resent you.

When you friend kills himself it is okay to think about death.

I don’t know if he thinks about dying anymore but I still do.

It’s staring in my face and I don’t know if it is just depressing or simply too real.  I feel like the Pogostick containing the personification of Midlife Crisis and Teen angst in an atmosphere of idealism and misery.

My feelings don’t seem to make much sense but I can examine them quite thoroughly.  What happens at death has been examined quite thoroughly yet we all yield our own poetic extrapolations from it.

I’m going to warm up my coffee.

At least when I smoked cigarettes I had the pleasure of fantasizing how happy I would feel if I succeeded at quitting smoking.

Happy one month and 2 days without smoking. yippee.

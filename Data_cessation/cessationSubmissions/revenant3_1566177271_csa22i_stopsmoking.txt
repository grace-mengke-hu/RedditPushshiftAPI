Half Marathon / Marathon

Long time lurker here.

I ran a full marathon in San Diego on June 2... I still smoked during training.  

It pains me to say that.  I know that it prevented me from doing really well.  

Well, I aiming to one day complete the full in under 4 hours and a half in under 2.

I just set my quit date, 8/18/2019 at 20:00.

I run in Vegas in November.  And maybe the Chicago next year.  

This is going to take some work.

Wish me luck.

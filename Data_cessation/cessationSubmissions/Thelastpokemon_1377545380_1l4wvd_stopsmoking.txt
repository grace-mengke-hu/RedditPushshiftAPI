I'm 15 and I feel like already this is a big part of my life.

I'm 15 and I had my first smoke with a few friends about 3 months ago. My step mom smokes and leaves her half smoked buds out so I smoke those. I know it's bad for you but I just love the way it feels. I want to stop smoking but I feel like if I tell my parents they will never trust me again. If I tell my actual friends (the friends who would want me to stop) then I think they won't want to be friends anymore. I just feel like this is spiraling out of control because at first it started out as just me and my friends but its turned into me doing it everyday. Thanks for listening.

How long does lung soreness/pain persist after quitting smoking?

So I've just passed the 6 month mark of quitting after smoking for about 5 years. Occasionally I still feel slight chest pain/soreness when breathing. It's nothing too intense but its there and I'm just curious how long does soreness in the lungs persist after quitting. At what point should I consult a doctor if the soreness continues?

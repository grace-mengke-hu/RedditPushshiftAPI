Six days...

...and still no desire to smoke...For the first time in my life I contracted an URI which led to bronchitis and I've been sick for two weeks...Barely able to breathe, so fatigued I can barely move and the constant coughing...Mid illness I decided I was done smoking forever (20+ years) because if this feels anything like emphysema or COPD I refuse to let it become part of my life...I'm on the mend but still not 100%, thanks for letting me share...

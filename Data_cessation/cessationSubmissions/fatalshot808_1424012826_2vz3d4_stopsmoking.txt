Its been 6 years since I started I think I need help

Hey reedit, I really need your advice. I've been a smoker for 6-7 years now and I really want to quit, its costing me plenty of money($170-$220 a month) and its bad for my health I just need to stop. I've tried using ecigs and cold turkey and those have not helped me quit. When trying cold turkey I was very iratable and I've always been craving one. I was thinking nicotine patches or nicotine gum. What have you guys tried that was successful??

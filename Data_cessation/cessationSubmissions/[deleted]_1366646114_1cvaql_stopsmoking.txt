Upside: noone died. Downside: new quit date

So I am not a cold turkey kind of gal. I almost attacked a marketer for sitting at my desk. New quit date & plan....I am going to do a low dose chantix (0.5mg x7 days then 0.5mg twice a day. New quit date. NOT ON A MONDAY! I thought Monday + work = distraction. 

Friday quit date so that I can just chill round the Casa for the first 72 hrs. Replacing not deflecting.

I have never gotten this far before. I am vaping, but only when I get an intense craving like after eating. Low mg of nicotine and I’m hoping to drop the vape really soon.  I actually hate using it. 

If I didnt work on a construction site where everyone is smoking everywhere at all times I probably wouldn’t use it at all. 

I feel good, head is a little foggy and I’m a little grumpy but I do feel good. Time to take the dog for a walk.

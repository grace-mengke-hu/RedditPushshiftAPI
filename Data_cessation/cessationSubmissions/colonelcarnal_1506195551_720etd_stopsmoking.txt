Fishing for some encouragement

Hey guys! I've been lurking for months, reading about all of your successes and trials. I have been loathing the routine, the smell, taste and cost of these cancer rods for years. I have felt helpless and guilty for so long that it isn't even funny. My fiancee lost her mentor to lung cancer 2 years ago and has tried every route of encouragement to help push me to quit since before that...tack on some self loathing for taking this long. 
I dont want to feel sorry for myself, but my CNS has me hamstrung and sends me every possible emotion to get me to stay off the quit train, but I don't want to be a smoker. I never identified as a smoker, but my 15 years of 20 cigarettes a day (minus my one time 6 month hiatus) says otherwise. I have such a hard time thinking past the next chance to go burn one.....but I think I can make it work. 
Here comes the coooold turkey and the shakes and shitty attitude, closely followed by a sense of accomplishment and a sense of taste. Possibly even the chance to not sweat like a pig and have what seems like an asthma attack from jogging up a hill? To be seen. Wish me luck, I think I'll need it

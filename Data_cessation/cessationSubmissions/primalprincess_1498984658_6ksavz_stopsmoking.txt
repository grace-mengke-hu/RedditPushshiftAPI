The quit smoking care package I made for my boyfriend

My boyfriend smokes and told me he feels ready to quit, or at least massively cut back, because it's starting to give him breathing problems.


Side note--We have been dating for two years. In the past I have tried to get him to quit, but I realized pretty quickly it needed to come from him and there was no point in trying to make him quit. And in fact it was only doing more harm than good. So I stopped being like that and now it's actually coming from him.



He thinks he has untreated ADHD and that could be why he smokes. He says he just likes that it gives him something to do rather than being addicted. He claims to not be fully addicted, but I don't know.... I am sure he is to an extent addicted to the actual chemicals/ nicotine. 


I decided to buy him a few things to show him I am supportive and, hopefully, help with the process!


Here is what I included.


1. A lavender essential oil of mine which he likes because as he says "it's something to do!" and it is also calming 

2. A classic fidget spinner, of course 

3. These [disposable filters] (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NJA2PMY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which to be honest I only bought because they have great reviews. I was hesitant at first but again the reviews are great and they apparently help quit smoking

4. These [toothpicks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F4ITXJM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which seem odd but are definitely "something to do"

5. This set of three [fidget toys](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZY6PHKW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

6. This [odd little fidget toy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071XN5H8F/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

7. "Harmless" [cigarettes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCUPR26/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)? Ok I guess, again they have good reviews, I am not a smoker and never have been so I am just trusting Amazon!




So that is it. Any tips on what I should say when I present it to him? If I make another one later, is there anything I missed? 


This is a learning process for those of us supporting people who are quitting too. I have tended to come from judgment in the past. I definitely have had to work through some classist and elitist views I've had about smoking. But my boyfriend is from Iran so they have different views about smoking and smoking is more common. 


Moving forward I just want to give tangible support. How would you want to be supported during this process? 



Good luck everyone!

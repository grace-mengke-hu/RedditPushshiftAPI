Hey

I quit smoking cold turkey in January. I still remember my last cigarette….

I was definitely using it to make me feel better, cope with quitting alcohol and deal with stress. The number one thing that is keeping me from smoking again is that I won't be able to just have one cigarette…I will just want more and more. It also feels so good to not reek, feel like crap etc.

you guys motivated me

I have been thinking about quitting for a long time. I attempted the last time on February the 1st. My grandson of two picked up a pencil a put it to his mouth. I knew then I had to quit.  Well since then I relapsed. I was just messing around and found this place by accident, this morning.  

I read a lot of posts about Allen Carrs book,  bought that and read the first chapter! Then decided "I have nothing to lose." So I am 2 hours in.  I feel like I am ready to take on this challenge. 

Just wanted to say thanks!

I want to stop but I fear that my anxiety(which is already pretty damn high) will get out of control

I've been smoking for a few months now and it started for 2 to 3 a day to a pack and day. I brought it back down to 3 a day and want to stop but I just can't deal with anxiety. Smoking kind of helps me with it and leaving might alleviate it and I don't want to get on meds since many are addictive and such. Any advice which can help would be appreciated.   

Edit: alright after reading all the comments I'm going to have a go at it and see how things turn out.

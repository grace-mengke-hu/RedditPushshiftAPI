Got diagnosed with COPD

I’m 24, smoked since I probably around 9-10, and turned myself to smoke poppers (tobacco and weed mix together in a bong toke) from the age of like 15 till yesterday. Smoked about a pack and a half a day. 

I was told I have COPD and my Breathing capacity is in the levels of stage 2-3. I’ve gotta quit, it literally is my life now. 

any tips or tricks for someone who has never tried to quit (honestly) before? 

I have 4mg mints and this morning my girlfriend told me to take 3 lol, is there any way to be less irritated with life? 

thanks in advance.

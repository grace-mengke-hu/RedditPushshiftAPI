I don't believe in God, but...

... if there is one, they're definitely testing me. I work nights as a RN in a hospital. Received the maximum amount of patients tonight, and they're all confused with multiple health problems on top. Wanted a smoke so badly on my break but I forced myself to stay inside. This sucks. I know it'll pass, but it feels like hell sometimes.

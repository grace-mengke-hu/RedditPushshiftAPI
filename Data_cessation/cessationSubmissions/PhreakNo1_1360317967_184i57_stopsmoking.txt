Let's make this my last time quitting!

I'm doing it today, forget about all the previous times, THIS TIME I QUIT!

Could use a little help though, last time i quit 3 months, fooled myself one wouldn't matter, so I've been a sneaky smoker for two months now.

Can't keep fooling everyone, especially my 8 month old baby boy, he needs a dad, not a junkie.

I don't keep track, am I the only one?

Smoked for about 8 years, a few weeks ago during a holiday I had some time to reconsider my life choices and thought smoking was ridiculous. I decided to quit and not make a big deal out of it. I could calculate my quit date, but fuck it, this is working for me so I'm sticking with it. 

Last time I quit, I was constantly talking about it, I checked my stop smoking app all the time and after 5 months I caved so that also influenced me to do it like this. 

Anyone else like me?

Fiancée here. Fiancé is about 2 weeks nicotine free and constantly arguing with me. Please advise.

Hi, I love my fiancé to death and wanna get through this nicotine withdrawal. He's been smoking since he was 16 but recently (around 2-3 years ago) decided to start vaping and we've gradually tapered his nicotine down. He vapes about the same amount each day but he's gone from cigarettes, to 6 mg/mL, to 3 mg/mL, to now 0 mg/mL.

Can I ask y'all about your nicotine withdrawal? The symptoms I'm hearing about from him most are stomach aches and being light headed. The symptoms I'm witnessing from him are crazy irritability and a scary ability to pop off about small things.

I myself am going through a drug withdrawal but am 3 years strong so my grip on my mood/anxiety is much better than it used to be. I'm trying to be as understanding as possible because I know this must be rouuugggggghhhhhhhhh.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I help him relieve his nicotine withdrawal symptoms? Was there anything people around you did to help the experience?

Thank you all in advance and I'm rooting for all of you! !!!!!

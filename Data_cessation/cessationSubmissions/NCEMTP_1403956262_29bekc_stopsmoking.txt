Starting my last pack...Could use some words of wisdom to prepare myself

Just lit up the first of my last 20 cigarettes. I've quit a dozen times, never more than a week. This time, I'm serious. How can I mentally prepare myself? I've been smoking since 16, 8 years. Today is the day. I'm really anxious about the next few days. Help?

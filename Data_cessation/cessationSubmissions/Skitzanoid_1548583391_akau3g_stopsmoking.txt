Desperate so I've got an uncommon question

Hi!

Unfortunately I'm schizophrenic. So in my case if I want to quit, I get paranoid. I hear people talking about me, and the longer I stay off the cigs the worse it gets. Now I've tried all. Patches, e-cigarets, tablets. and it's all the same. But I'm persistent! Some day I will be off this ongoing grab 'n light.

After a while I figured it's the tobacco. The tobacco has some antipsychotics in them. So, now I thought: what if I vape it in a vaporizer meant for weed? Is that even possible? And if so, is it possible to slowly cut down the amount until I don't need it anymore?

Thanks!

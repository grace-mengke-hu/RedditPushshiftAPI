WooHoo! He's 97 days Smoke Free!

Hey guys! 

As the title says, he (my boyfriend) is 97 days smoke free! 
You guys really helped when he started, I came to you guys for advice when he first stopped and now I need your help again! 

He's doing so great, and I am so proud of him I want to do something fun for Sunday (his 100 day point). I just wanted to see what you guys & gals thought would be a fun thing for us to do to celebrate this accomplishment. 

P.S. I think it's awesome that you guys support each other so much, he really enjoys reading what all of you have to say! 

Thanks again!

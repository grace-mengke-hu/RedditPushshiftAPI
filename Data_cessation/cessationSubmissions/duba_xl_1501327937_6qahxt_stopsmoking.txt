My story

Hey, first time posting here, here is my story and I would appreciate some helpfull tips and tricks.

I'm 20 year old male from Germany, been living in Croatia for past 19 years. I started smoking 6 years ago because I wanted to get into cool group. 3 months ago I underwent hearth surgery due to tahicardia (not sure if that's right in english). I couldn't smoke while in hospital and didn't have any cravings at all actually, but as soon I got out the hospital I smoked a full pack that day. Didn't have any problems with the hearth and I was surprised. I am slightly obese and smoking is not really helping lose the weight since my lungs give up pretty fast. Now, I hate every single one of the guys and girls from the "cool group" for making me smoke and I would like to quit more the anything. Tried stopping for few times and failed misserably. 

So, now that I got that out of the way, you guys got any helpfull tips and tricks to stop this missery?

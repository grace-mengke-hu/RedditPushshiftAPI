12 hours without a smoke. Please tell me it gets better.

Hi everyone,

I'm new to this sub. 29 year old female. I've averaged a pack a day for the last 9 years.

I read Allen Carr's book, and while I don't necessarily like him or his writing style... I see the logic and agree with most of the concepts. It has inspired me to attempt quitting, but I'm not convinced it'll make me successful as I'm struggling. Would re-reading the book help?

It's been 12 hours (sleeping for 7 of those) and I'm not sure how well I'm doing. I want one. Badly. I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like I'm going insane. Never mind that... I'm oddly emotional it seems? Not in an angry way, but I can't stop tearing up. Browsing the posts on here. Reading stories of other people who've quit. Turns me into a basket case. Perhaps I'm happy for them, perhaps I'm happy for myself?? I don't understand it.
Also, anytime I get an uncontrollable urge - I start laughing. Uncontrollably. It's like the craving is the most hilarious thing I've ever experienced. What the fuck is wrong with me?

All I know is the people walking by my desk this morning think I'm losing it.
Any tales, advice or encouragement is very much appreciated. Anything I can do to make this easier?

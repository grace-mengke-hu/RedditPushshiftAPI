Guys, I have to remove my badge.

Unfortunately, it's just not my time yet. On the bright side, I still will never smoke a cigarette again in my life - I just vape with low nicotine content. BUT, I promise you I will be back to conquer that demon. For all of you who are on the road, or already seem to have reached that pure bliss and freedom, I commend you. Bula mates!

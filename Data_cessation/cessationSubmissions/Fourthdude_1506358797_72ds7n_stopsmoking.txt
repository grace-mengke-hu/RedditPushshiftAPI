I am on day 5 of quitting

I have tried quitting multiple times in the past, but for the first time, I actually committed to it.  I have found that telling my friends around me that I am quitting and giving them the power in my life to where if they see me with a pack, they can tear it up has been extremely helpful.  I also have been using an app to help me better understand where my body is at in the quitting process.  That has been fun to watch and learn from.  Thank you to everyone on here for being real with the process.  It's always nice to know you aren't alone.

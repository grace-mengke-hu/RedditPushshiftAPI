I was at a bus stop and a woman friend was walking up, smoking, and I walked away so I didn't have to

smell the stinky, disgusting things!  Boy for a second *nano* I wanted one of those icky things too!

It's dark, cold and no car.  I'm tired, bathed and ready to go to bed.  Thank you all for psyching me out ......it's such a help believe me *dud, I think each and every one of you know!*

I even requested a badge!  LOL

Night all!

Quit 2 hours ago

I quit about two hours ago, after a long time of cutting down and falling again. But I have confidence I will manage thisbtime.

Anyhow, I read this book that gives me a new perspective: carr, the easy way to stop smoking. I recommend it to anyone currently considering breaking the habit :)

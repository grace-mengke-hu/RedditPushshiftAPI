36 hours in, and couldn't be doing better

Not feeling any withdrawals, just heavy cravings every now and again for 30 minutes until I find a way to distract myself, went to a music event yesterday, was able to smoke weed and everything without giving in, will power got to last me though.

Went cold turkey btw, vapes and gum never helped me with anything

Almost 72 hours!

First time I have gotten this far since I started smoking at 19, switched to an ecig years ago but would often have quite a few cigs as well. Always using the ecig and often chain smoking it. I really wanted to rid myself from nicotine once and for all though. Started reading Alan Carr’s book Monday and finished it when I woke up Thursday. I then threw my ecig away right away and did it during the middle of my work week. I have still stayed strong, it’s not been easy the whole time,  especially since I am a bartender so always surrounded by smoke, but have stayed strong and am proud of myself.

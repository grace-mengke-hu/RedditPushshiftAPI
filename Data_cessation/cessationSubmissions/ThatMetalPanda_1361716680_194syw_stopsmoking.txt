I'm a terrible person.

My fiance has been trying to get me to quit, help me quit, do whatever he can to just get me to stop, but I've been doing it behind his back. We recently went through a bad "breakup," if you can call it that, but after 2 1/2 weeks, he realized what he lost and we got back together. The first day, I caved and bought a pack of Camel Blue Wides, my drug of choice. A few days after we got back together, I uploaded a pic of my "arting station" to facebook, and as smoking while I do my art is an impulsive habit, I had two packs of smokes in the pic. He saw it and flipped out, which I understood, and said it's the last time he'll trust me when I say I'm quitting. So I'm done. I just reset my badge to the day when I had my last cigarette, and I'm quite proud to have gotten this far. These past 10 days I just haven't thought about smoking, haven't said anything about the chest pains from my lungs "cleaning out" to him, which made him worry that I've been smoking again. I haven't, but his worry really hurt me. I've stayed as far away from smokers as possible, which for me means being cooped up in my room when I'm at home as everyone in my house smokes. It's sucked. I think I'm finally able to exist around them though.

I'm going upstairs to *socialize* outside of work for the first time in 10 days. I can do this. No. I WILL do this.

Also, does anyone have any links to a website I can get a nicotine-free vaporizer from? The main reason I smoke while arting is the feeling of smoke in my lungs helps me concentrate, and I'm hoping I can do it the nicotine-free way. Thanks in advance!

24 days - cravings start

I was a smoker for a long time. Never wondered quitting, I knew there was a problem and I was aware that Im in denial but I never took the idea seriously. After trying I easily fell back. A few months ago I thought I had a serious disease - which smoking makes worse - and had a real reason to quit. Mind you I didnt.

After getting my vape it was easy. However lately my vape hasnt been working properly, it works but it has flaws and its annoying. I ordered a better device but it takes time. As vaping is not so easy smoking cravings come. In my dreams I smoke.  I envy smokers, think about how good it is. I feel like Im far from actually starting and kinda confident about not going to buy a smoke in my weaker moments but Im keeping an eye on myself to not get too confident. I think this is sorta funny how after vaping is not enough to satisfy the smoking ritual, the cravings mostly come in my dreams.

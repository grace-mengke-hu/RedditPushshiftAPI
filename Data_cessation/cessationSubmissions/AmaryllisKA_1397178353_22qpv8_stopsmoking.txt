Wish me luck, guys.

Hey, I finally found the courage to quit smoking. After 7-8 years with a pack or two of cigarettes per day .I have first two days of abstinence behind me. first day as a bartender behind the bar - living hell.  Second day as a customer. The next day my friend, gives me a pack of cigarettes from Bali. I'll keep it as a souvenir. Wish me luck.

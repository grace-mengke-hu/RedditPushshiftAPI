Can I ask a curious question about when you started smoking?

I'm not a smoker and it has no appeal, but I've always wondered something.

Did the very first cigarette taste/feel good? 

I'm curious to know if it was a feeling that couldn't be reach again or if it was just enough to make you want another? 

I'm sorry if this is insensitive, but I don't know many smokers and I'm sure as hell not going to try one to figure it out. Thank you.

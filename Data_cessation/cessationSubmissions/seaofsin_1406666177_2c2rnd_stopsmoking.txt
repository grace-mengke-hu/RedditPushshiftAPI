Must quit once and for all

I've been smoking for around 15 years, just like everyone else the only reason I started was to be a cool kid, hines sight 20/20, it was the stupidest habit I could have picked up. I am now 100% addicted physically and mentally. I have been able to kick it physically a few times, but it is the mental addiction that has me seeing no future. I've done my time with drugs/alcohol and have left all that in my past. Just left with this terrible addiction to cigarettes. I have quit from time to time, but for whatever irrational reasons, when shit goes pear shaped, I immediately urge a smoke. The longest I quit was this year, six months, then I received the news of my mother passing away and with out any thought, I was at the store moments later purchasing a pack and pulling on those things like there was no tomorrow just to feel that burn coating my lungs. I want to put them down once and for all and hope to open my ears to what you may have done to overcome this obstacle in life. I want to breath again, thank you in advance for any help you can provide.

I have done patches, gum, lozenges and cold turkey. I have read Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Quit Smoking a few times, but have always fell right back in to the trap.

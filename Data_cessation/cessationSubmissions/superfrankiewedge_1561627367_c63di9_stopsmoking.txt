I started smoking again after 447 days smoke free 🙁

I’ve been so stressed at work and having trouble with one person in particular and now they want me to start doing the job of people who make 3 times as much as me. I caved after months of being stressed and officially have had 4 cigarettes. I’m not sure what to do. I’m officially looking for another job but I need to get back on track. Do I reset my counter or just shake it off as a slip up. Need so motivation for sure. I should also add I’ve been working out twice a day for the last month trying to prevent the stress but it didn’t seem to help.

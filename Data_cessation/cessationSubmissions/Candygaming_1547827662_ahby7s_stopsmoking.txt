I failed

Thought that if i could last one month that i could do it. For some reason i bought a new pack the day i got to that point. Did not have a strong craving or anyone that pushed me that i can blame. I just feel som weak and stupid. I have not dared to show it to anyone, and smoked the whole pack theese last tree days while i have been hiding, scared that anyone would see that i failed something so easy. Will try to quit again tomorrow, but i dont have much willpower left. I just feel so tired and empty.

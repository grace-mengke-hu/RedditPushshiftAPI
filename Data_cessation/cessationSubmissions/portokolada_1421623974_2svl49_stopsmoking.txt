quick tip to deal with cravings

I stooped smoking using the internet as a motivation and help. I have a smoker at home, all my friends smoke, but i needed a change. 
I though why bother when i get pregnant?! Why bother when i'm ill?! I can do it now so i get thorough good things and bad things not craving for cigarettes. 
And the shame, oh my God, nowadays is embarrassing to start smoking knowing all this. Nobody does. 

And the hardest part was remaining a non-smoker. I though, for example, if i smoked every 2 hours, i would want a cigarette every 2 hours... But the difference is, i will want a cigarette every 2 hours whether i lite up one or not. Eventually the cravings will go off, more likely if i don't smoke. :)  And they sure did.
wish you all good luck :)

48 hours into quitting smoking. 34/f who has smoked on & off since I was a teenager...now what?

Its been 48 hours. I've tried this many times before. Quit for years when I was pregnant, nursing and quite some time after, and then my husband took his life, and I started again. 

I smoke anywhere from a few a day to a pack depending on if Im drinking (socially).

Currently: Anxious (already have diagnosed anxiety), jittery, irritable, sweating, uneven breathing, cravings. 

No patch, no vape pen, cold turkey.

Now what happens? Is it gonna get worse?

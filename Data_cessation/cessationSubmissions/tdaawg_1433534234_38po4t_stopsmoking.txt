Got hammered last night, saved by a friend

How do you cope with a heavy night out and not smoking?

Was out last night with clients, had lots of booze and it was a hot summer evening with live music etc - REALLY wanted a smoke. At the end of the night I tried to get one of my mate, but he refused. I barely remember that lol.

Anyway, this morning was SO pleased I didn't smoke. My friend did the right thing.

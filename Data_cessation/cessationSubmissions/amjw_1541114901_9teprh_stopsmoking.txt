Never go out on your own

Just to give a heads up, I stopped smoking through cold turkey for 14 months then went to the pub on my own and the smell of beer made me want a cigarette with it (which I stupidly gave into and have been back in the trap for another year)

If you go with someone who knows you’ve quit, they’ll keep you accountable. Under NO circumstance go out drinking on your own.

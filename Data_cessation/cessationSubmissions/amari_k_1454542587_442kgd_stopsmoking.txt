Hoping it sticks this time.

Ok, so I have quit for periods of time before, the longest stretch being 11 months about 3 years ago. All together, breaks included, I have been smoking for nearly 7 years, ever since I joined the military. Last night I had a cigarette and didn't enjoy it at all. I didn't even finish it. Today I got up determined to make it through the day without smoking, and so far so good. It's just harder than I expected. I am really motivated to be done for good, though. My twins (one boy, one girl) are getting older and I want to make sure I can be here for them.

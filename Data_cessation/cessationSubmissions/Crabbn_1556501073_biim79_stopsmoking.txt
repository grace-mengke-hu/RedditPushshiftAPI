Coming up on three days in a few hours.

Still feel disassociated and weird. Honestly, I’ve IV’d ketamine and felt more normal. Every time someone speaks to me I feel as though I’m floating over my own body. 

How long does this last? I’m pretty sure the nicotine is out of me after a pack a day for 15 years. I don’t have physical anguish anymore, it’s just the physiological bullshit, “one cigarette won’t hurt!”. I haven’t had that cigarette and I know that voice is an asshole. I’m just really fucking done with this asshole. Any words of wisdom?

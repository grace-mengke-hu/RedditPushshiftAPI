Former smokers, what were some of the most surprising/pleasant effects of quitting?

I've been a smoker, everyday, for only about 2 years. Before that I was only an occasional smoker. Aside from the negative health and financial effects of smoking, I've really considered quitting recently because, quite simply, they don't taste good anymore. I don't really like them. I was wondering what kind of effects surprised you when you quit? Like taste and smell, really anything.

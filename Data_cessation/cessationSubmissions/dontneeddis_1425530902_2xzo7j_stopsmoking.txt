Hanging out with vape friends...

Everytime I hang out with my friend that now vapes...I get super edgy for a day or two.
I think it's because there is nicotine floating around in there and sets me off...
Getting through the evening without smoking is not really a problem...it's getting through the edginess the day after.

Any have any tips?

When do you stop thinking about it?

This is the worst part for me, having "quit" a couple times in the past.  I feel like no matter how far I've gotten (and it's been months before) that I never truly stop thinking about smoking which in turn leads to me failing to quit.

It's as if a certain part of me still *wants* to smoke no matter what I tell myself and so I still get cravings even when I don't think I'm supposed to.

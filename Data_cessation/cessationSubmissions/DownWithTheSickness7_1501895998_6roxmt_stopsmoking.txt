Started today.

I've been a smoker for three years, started at 15 and just recently turned 18. Just downloaded the smoke free app, haven't had a cigarette since this morning. Smoking a pack a day (sometimes more if stressed) has really messed up my breathing and lung capacity. I find it painful and somewhat hard to breathe in the mornings if I don't have a cigarette, and after a meal it doesn't feel complete if I don't have a cigarette. It's completely taken over my life and it's time to take it back before things get worse. Wish me luck, tomorrow morning is going to suck!

I just think of cigarettes as heroin, that's how I stay clean.

It's been 15 months; my longest span cigarette free and I think it'll stick this time. I've always gone back to cigarettes. I'd have a drink or two and tell myself that I can have a smoke-just one-because I only want them when I'm drinking. I don't do that anymore. I tell myself that cigarettes are my heroin, and no one in their right mind would let a heroin addict have a cheat day. That's how I've been able to stay away. Now I know I can't have just one.

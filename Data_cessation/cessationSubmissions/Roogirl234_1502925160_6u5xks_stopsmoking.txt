Not picking up a pack for my mom

Just ignored the text. When I got home I had to go to the store any ways so I Invited her along and let her get them. She also grabbed some fast food and offered to pay for me but I politely declined. It's small victories like this that make me happy and remind me to keep pushing forward ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š I also decided i won't be judging her for any of her actions or decisions. I can only judge myself for the actions i take and make.

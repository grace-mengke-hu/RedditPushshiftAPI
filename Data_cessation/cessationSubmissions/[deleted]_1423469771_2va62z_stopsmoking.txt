Smoked for about 5 months, now I'm scared...

I keep reading about the benefits of stopping smoking, and it seems like all the lists and info are saying that its going to take years and years to ever recover the damage I've done, and that a lot of the risks will never go away. 

I just turned 22, I stopped smoking after 2 months of casual 1-3 a day tops, 1 month of not smoking entirely, then 2 months of 3-5 a day. 

I know I've affected my long term health, but is it really gonna be 10-15 years for my risks of heart attack, cancer, etc. to minimise? 
I guess I'm wishful thinking, but I would like to think stopping early actually made a difference than if I were to wait for a less stressful time in my life to quit. 

Thank you for any guidance.

I relapsed and need help with withdrawal induced insomnia

I had my first attempt at quitting this last week. I took melatonin, reduced caffeine intake, and drank sleepy-time tea to help me sleep, but slept only about 2-3 hours per night for the first 4 nights of my quit. I was a complete zombie.  Yesterday, day 5, I relapsed (was able to sleep well after). 

Exhaustion isn’t an excuse for relapse, but it certainly didn’t help me stay strong... and I want my next quit to be my last. Ever. 

I feel that I did everything I usually do to get myself to fall asleep and it didn’t work. Anyone else deal with sleep issues during withdrawal and have insight about what worked for them?

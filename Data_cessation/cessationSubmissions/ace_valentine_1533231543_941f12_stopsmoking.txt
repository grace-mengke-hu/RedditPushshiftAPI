That’s it, I’m tired of this shit

I’m 18 years old and have been smoking since I was 14. At first I’d smoke maybe 4-5 cigs a week, but eventually it got worse. Yesterday I smoked a whole pack by myself and felt incredibly guilty. Today I smoked about 5 cigarettes, got sick of them and threw the almost full pack away. This is not who I am, I can do better. I’m tired of always being broke because I spent my money on cigarettes. I’m tired of often being out of breath even though I’m not overweight. I’m tired of always having bad breath. I’m tired of smoking because I’m bored even though I’m not enjoying it. This stops now. 

Wish me luck, boys.

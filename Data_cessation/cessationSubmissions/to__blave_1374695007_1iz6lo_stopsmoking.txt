Do you have any suggestions on how I can support my husband in quitting smoking?

My husband and I have been married for almost a year and he's been smoking for about the last three years (he's 21). He's not a heavy smoker, usually not more than a few a day, but he's finding it impossible to quit. He's tried E-Cigs and they helped a little but that didn't work. Right now he's trying the gum, helping but still not able to kick it.  The most he has gone is 5 days, a few weeks ago with me trying my absolute hardest to help him. Now he's smoked almost every day since then. Honestly, he doesn't really want to quit on his own. I want desperately for him to quit and right now that's about his only motivation. He knows he "should" quit, but I think it feels impossible to him. He also struggles with anxiety so it's a bit of a coping mechanism for that as well. I've smoked in the past, but it never became an addiction for me.

This is such an emotion filled battle between us right now, I'm starting to give up. I'd love any suggestions you have of how I can help or what I should/shouldn't say. I'm new to this sub so let me know if I should post this elsewhere. Thanks guys.

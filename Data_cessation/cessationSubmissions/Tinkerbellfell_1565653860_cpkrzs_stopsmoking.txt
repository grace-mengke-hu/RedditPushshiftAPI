Currently watching my dad go downhill fast with vascular dementia at 63. Dr said it’s due to his chainsmoking. Today is my Day 1.

Being in the hospital visiting my Dad and seeing the other patients who are so incredibly sick has really made me determined not to put my family through that. I have an 18-month old and I’d feel awful if I had to leave him early. 

I don’t want this life of addiction to nicotine, I feel embarrassed about doing it because most people don’t smoke anymore.

My addiction is strong right now but I just have to remind myself that the benefits of stopping far outweigh the struggle. I’m giving up cold turkey and the plan is to read my Allen Carr &amp; Paul McKenna books. Downloaded the SmokeFree app.
 
I have written down my reasons:

* I could put an extra £780 in our house savings fund by this next year

* My teeth are getting yellow and I’m insecure about smiling. I can’t wear certain lipstick colours like I used to. I am dying to buy some teeth whitening strips but there wasn’t much point. I think I will save that as a 1 month reward.

* I always have a yellow stained index finger

* I want to be able to run more but I get scarily out of breath and my chest wheezes for an hour after. I want to wait until I’ve quit a few months and then try to start running again.

* I have anxiety, which leads me to feel like I can’t breathe. It’s really not a good idea to add actual breathing problems onto that.

* I’ve worked with patients with COPD. Struggling to breathe 24/7 and having to carry an oxygen tank wherever they go. Not having enough breath to climb a flight of stairs. I just can’t put my son through that.

* I just know that this winter if I’m still smoking I’ll get hit with a bad chesty cough and I’ll feel miserable about it.

* my husband quit so I’m the only smoker in the house now. It removes temptation

* my dad has just been kind of forced to quit due to his hospital stay and I need to be supportive of him quitting by quitting myself

* By not smoking, I think I’ll take the guilt I carry around off my shoulders and feel lighter

* My husbands family don’t know I smoke (they live 12 hours plane ride away). When I visit them I am always desperate to get away for a cigarette. This removes that issue! 

* I want to give up caffeinated coffee too and I will definitely drink less of that while not smoking 

* I waste time going outside for cigarettes all throughout the day, this time could be put to much better use reading or just snuggling my kiddo on the sofa

I hope I can do this. I NEED to do this. Roll on Day 1.

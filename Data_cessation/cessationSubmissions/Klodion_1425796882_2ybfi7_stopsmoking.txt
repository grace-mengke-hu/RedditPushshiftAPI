Met Someone Else In The Process Of Quitting

I was filming a pilot for a show yesterday, and met a girl. It wasn't until we finished everything that she mentioned she had gone three days without a cigarette, and I immediately had a smile on my face. 

To meet someone else going through the same thing that I am going through was awesome, surprising in fact. I could have spoke to her for ages about experiences and stuff, but I didn't have time. 

Now that I think about it, I should have referred her here. Either way though, I hope she succeeds in quitting for good, she deserves to. Anyone who smokes deserves to succeed in quitting.

Unforseen Benefits.

One week in now!!! Look at that circle with the 1 in it.

Just wanted to mention an unforeseen benefit. Anyone else notice that sex is way better? I'm not sure why, but I noticed it when I quit in the past, and 1 week in I am noticing it again.

Isn't it too soon to be because of better breathing?

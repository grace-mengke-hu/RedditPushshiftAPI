I need help.

I haven't smoked in 32 days! I smoked a pack a day for the past 4 years.  One day after a weekend bender of drinking I looked at my ashtray and said "I'm done." I smoked about 5 packs in 2 days  of being drunk. Quit cold turkey. I feel great! The only problem is that I'm always so agitated! I used to always be the "chill" person, but now it seems like every little thing that doesn't go my way  just pisses me off. It bothers me so much because I have no reason to be angry,  I'm in a great place in life right now and even though I'm in control of my life it feels like I'm not in control of myself.  Does any one else ever feel this way? Any tricks to help anger? I've never been an angry person and it's weird to always be "on edge" ðŸ˜ž

Almost four years , still scared of smoke

It has been a while since I stop smoking , I don't feel sorry for smokers , I feel their pain and the challenge ahead of them. I understand their way of thinking.

I have failed before, stopped for 6 months even , and started again , with only one cigarettes . that s all it takes.

Meditation , mindfulness , family's judgement and overtaxed cigarettes country and going cold turkey helped me to stop. I had time to deal and cope with the addiction and cravings.


Now after almost four years , I found myself refusing a join because it contains tobacco , I stop breathing behind people who smoke until I pass them. I still have dreams where I smoke again and where it feels ok to do so.

But the discuss , the fear is stronger , no judgments for others smokers

Like most of you I smoked for almost 20 years , felt like it was part of my life , constantly planning to have enough nicotine with me , taking so many breaks.

Funny thing , stopping cigarette is only one step , one thing to fix , and the battle is never over. There are so many things to improve ,  so many addiction or would be addiction right in our mind.

 I had to resist the urge to replace nicotine with alcohol to relax or when I was stressed or depressed. Now I m trying to get a healthier lifestyle doing sport , stopping to eat sweats.

let's keep ourselves on top of our game , one step at a time . let's get freedom and control over our own life. It is worth it to stop smoking , once you ll have done that nobody can take that away from you, you will learn about yourself more in the process and become a better person , those stars reward are not for nothing ;)

Easier this time?

I've quit several times in the past, and had a really hard time with it.  Constant thoughts of smoking, headaches, trouble sleeping, etc.  This time, I am six days in, and haven't had any of that.  

A couple of times a day, I think, it's time for a smoke, but then remember, "I don't do that anymore."

Has anyone else had this experience?  I keep expecting this to get really hard again, but for some reason this time it has been easy.

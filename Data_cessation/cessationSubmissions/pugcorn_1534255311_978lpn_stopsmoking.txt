Back to smoking after anxiety attack

I tend to go back to cigarettes when my life feels like it’s falling apart. It’s obviously an exaggeration. Bottomline is that I cannot handle my emotions properly so I self-destruct and make myself feel worse. I feel like I deserve the shitty feelings.

When I’m feeling worthless or anxious, I feed into it by delving back into old, nasty habits (eating poorly, smoking cigarettes, isolation) and then I feel like I’m back to square one. I once went months without smoking, but in the event that something happens that causes me extreme distress, I’ll go back to smoking and say “fuck it, might aswell”. I’m a student who’s currently in exam season, and I’ve been feeling like shit for days. Went back to smoking and I want to quit forever, but my stress will never stop here. I want to stop being self-destructive.

I want to handle my emotions and stress better. I want to take care of myself. Do you guys have any advice?

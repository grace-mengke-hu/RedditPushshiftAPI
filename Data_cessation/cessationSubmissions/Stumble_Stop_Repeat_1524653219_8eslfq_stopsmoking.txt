Tingles in my fingers, arms and legs!

Hi!

I am starting my 3rd day now, and I feel great!

I am trying to do something quickly as soon as I think about smoking (that makes me wake up from my bed SO fast! :D).

But I feel a new kind of High. I spent the 2 first days doing a lot of  sports and now I am feeling tingles everywhere in my arms and legs, especially fingers.

Is it just a sign of the blood circulating better ? If so, everyone feels the same? Anyone knows how long it can last?

It doesn't matter that much because it makes me feel alive, and I love the fact that I can feel physical progress in my quitting :)
but it's kind of unpleasant at the same time... !

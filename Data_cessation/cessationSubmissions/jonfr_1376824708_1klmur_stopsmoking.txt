These people really piss me off!

Ok, so I quit smoking. I did it on my own. I didn't tell anyone for a week. I kept it quiet. 
I started smoking at the age of 14 and I am now 37. Granted in the last couple of years I've reduced my smoking to between 5 & 10 cigs a day. 
It still hurt to quit though. 
So where do these arse fuckers think they're fucking coming from when they tell me, "oh it's easy for you because you never smoked much!"  
I mean WTF!!!!
These people are generally smokers! Basically they are belittling the massive effort it takes to stop smoking! And oh of course it would be much more difficult for them!
I have developed an answer, you can use it if the situation arises. 
In a calm voice, one usually reserved for talking to nice people, tell them to "Go Fuck Themselves."
Thankyou x

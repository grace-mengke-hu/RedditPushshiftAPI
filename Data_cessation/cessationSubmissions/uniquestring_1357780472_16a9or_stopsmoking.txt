500 Days of Freedom

When I first quit, I thought I'd never make it.  But one day at a time has brought me this far, and I'm likin' it big time.

The greatest thing about not being a smoker is never having to wait until you can have a smoke.  I live in one of those states where you have to paint a red S on your forehead and ring a bell and chant "Unclean!" if you want to light up.  I can't imagine now how I put up with that nonsense.  OK.  I'm exaggerating.  Slightly.

Now I can light up whenever and wherever I want.  That would be never and nowhere, thank goodness.

Hang in there.  It's worth it to get rid of the slavery to tobacco.  I honestly can't think of a downside at this stage of the game.  Makes the few few weeks of withdrawal seem like a bargain.

Stay quit.  If you're still sucking on those things, make it a priority to get started on quitting so you'll get to this stage sooner.

Thanks for all the help.  See y'all indoors where it's smoke-free and comfortable.

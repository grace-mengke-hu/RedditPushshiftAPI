Relapsed but it's ok!

I am someone living with serious depression and ptsd. Medication helps a lot but in may I was hospitalized for suicidal tendencies. I've been taking super good care of myself but tonight I accidentally watched a movie that had a huge underlying theme of suicide. I wouldn't have watched it if I had known. 

I know it's weak but after crying for hours I broke down and bought a pack of cigarettes. I smoked 2 and tossed them. I don't want to feel shitty emotionally and physically. I like being a non smoker. And I like not being suicidal. 

So tomorrow I wake up and feel crappy bc I smoked but I won't let it break me.

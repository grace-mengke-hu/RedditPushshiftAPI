One Month! This Subbreddit Rocks! (Also, What Now?)

Howdy all, 

Just wanted to drop a line to this sub.  You guys saved my life probably, I never thought that I would have been able to stop this long.  Heard about Alan Carr through y'all, and it changed my life.  

Quitting has been way easier than I ever thought possible.

I'm a mental health worker, and I have a few questions for you all:

1) Breaks.  In life, at work, at home.  What do you non-smokers do to replace the habit.  I feel like I'm needing something new to curb stress.  What do you do?

2) Nicotine poops/weight gain.  (politely) Feeling a little stopped up? Anyone else? Also, gained about 5 pounds, what do you all do to stop this? 

Again, thank you all for building this network and keeping it up.

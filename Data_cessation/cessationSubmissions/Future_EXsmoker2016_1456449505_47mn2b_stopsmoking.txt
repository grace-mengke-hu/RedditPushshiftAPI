Did Allen Carr help you?

I've started reading Allen Carr's "EASY WAY TO QUIT SMOKING" book and so far so good! I've tried Chantix but it makes me so nauseous! So I decided to put my energy into reading self improvement books, this support group and a app I downloaded called SMOKE FREE....with these 3 things to improve my mindset, erase all of the reasons I thought I should smoke and support...I'm confident that I will achieve success!! Are there any other online tools you use? If so what are they? All can help...thanks in advance!

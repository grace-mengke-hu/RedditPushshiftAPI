12 Hours Smokefree - It's the small wins.

Twelve Hours guys! Woohoo! 
It's the morning over here (I'm in Melbourne) and my last cigarette was 9:30pm last night. 
Here are the some of the benefits that I'm reminding myself:
1. heart rate will already start to drop back towards normal levels
2. After two hours without a cigarette, your heart rate and blood pressure will have decreased to near normal levels. Your peripheral circulation may also improve. The tips of your fingers and toes may start to feel warm. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms usually start about two hours after your last cigarette.
3. 12 Hours After You Quit
Carbon monoxide, which can be toxic to the body at high levels, is released from burning tobacco and inhaled as part of cigarette smoke. Because carbon monoxide bonds so well to blood cells, high levels of the substance can prevent these cells from bonding with oxygen, which in turn causes serious cardiovascular problems. In just 12 hours after quitting smoking, the carbon monoxide in your body decreases to lower levels, and your blood oxygen levels increase to normal.
My body is recovering!!

Please Join r/PornRehab

I have noticed that there aren't any safe and welcoming subreddits for those struggling with pornography addiction, and where they can openly share their stories in a small but inclusive community. Therefore I have decided to start r/PornRehab. Please feel free to join, share your story, and spread the word about this community!

Back in the game

It feels good to be a non-smoker again.  I think I've figured out why I started smoking again, and don't plan on repeating it.  

After getting my 4 star, something was missing.  Now that I've analyzed it, and compared it to how day 4 of quitting feels, I think I've determined what happened.  I think I missed the sense of accomplishment that came from resisting the urge to smoke, so I smoked, and did so for about 2.5 months.  

I never got back up to my full smoking capacity, as I have been trying to hide it from my friends and family, but I'm finally tired of it again.

4 days in I feel great, I've got that old feeling of both withdrawal but the accompanying feeling of accomplishment.  Now I just need to work through my issues to make this one stick longer than 5 months.

I'm not smoking today, are you?

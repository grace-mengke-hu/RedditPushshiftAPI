Trying to quit after 16 years

Hi all! I've stumbeled uppon this reddit thread and started reading some posts, which opened my mind about quitting smoking!
I've started smoking 1 pack a day 16 years ago, and I'm sick and tired of the bad smell, the money that I waste on this nasty habbit and being constantly worried about my health due to smoking!

I've never achieved a successfull attempt to stop, because I was always afraid of the consequences of stoping smoking! I'm aware that is only in my head, but what can I do to prevent these thoughts?!?

I've decided today, after reading some posts here, that I want to stop! I have a 1yold child, and I don't want him to suffer from my stupidity!

Can anyone give me some advice or simply some personal experiences of cold turkey stopping? Does it work? What are the drawbacks?

Thanks in advance!

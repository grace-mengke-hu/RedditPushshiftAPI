I made it for almost one day then..

I'm so mad at myself right now, browsing anything can help me quit again, and I found you guys! I really hate smoking and i'm thinking how it is legal to smoke..this thing is just awful ! I really was a kid when I first ignited my first cigarette, then I tried to quit.. 5 times each time is more or less than 3 months, last time was yesterday.. I woke up, I ran for 30 min, I took a shower then I tried to waste some time, already counted 10 hours w/o smoking..I almost can't see well, neither able to talk properly then my friend showed up hey lets watch a movie buddy!! and yes he started to smoke!! later I couldn't resist :((( at the end of the night I said fuck it let's buy cigarettes why not. 
Now I can't sleep thinking how loser am I, and what if I didn't meet that friend, I need to stop again but this time I've to do it..I can do it..let's count again.
** sorry for the wall I needed to get it out.

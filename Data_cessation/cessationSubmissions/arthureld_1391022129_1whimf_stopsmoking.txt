Day 3 - Doing OK except for viscous mood swings

So I expected there to be times of irrational anger. I've warned friends about it, they laugh at me and get me to laugh when it happens, which has been a huge help.  But today, I've started to get emotional over absolutely nothing, is this pretty normal?  

For reference, the only time I've cried in the past decade was when I found out my father died.  Today in a meeting at work, I had to excuse myself because I couldn't contain my tears, went to my office and started to sob. Why you ask?  The microwave at our remote job site is broken and I need to go get a replacement.  Yes, I cried about a broken microwave. Please tell me this phase doesn't last the next 3 weeks, I can't have people thinking I've gone literally insane.

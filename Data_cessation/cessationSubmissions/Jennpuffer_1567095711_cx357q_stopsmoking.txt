Almost 8 months

I just wanted to stop in and post where I am at in my journey of not smoking.  I am 3 days away from hitting the 8-month mark!  Yes, I am proud of myself. I lost my father on July 11th and exactly 4 weeks later I was let go from my job.  If those 2 events didn't make me pull into a gas station, nothing else will. Every now and then I find myself thinking about having one but then that urge goes away. Take it day by day... If you want it bad enough, it will happen.

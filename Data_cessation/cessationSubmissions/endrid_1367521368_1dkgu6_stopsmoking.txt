I quit because I'm sick!

I haven't had a smoke in 4 days, and it's actually been very easy.  I have a chest cold and can't imagine smoking with it.  Haven't noticed the withdrawal symptoms because the unpleasant sick feeling is stronger.  Only thing is, I'm afraid that I'll start craving again when I feel better.  I'm starting to get noticeably better now.  I normally smoke a pack a day, and have been smoking for about seven years straight now. I smoked a few years before that, but was able to quit.  Any advice for someone in my situation?  Do you think it should be downhill from here?

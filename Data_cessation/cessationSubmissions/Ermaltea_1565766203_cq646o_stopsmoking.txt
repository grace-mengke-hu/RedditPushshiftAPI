New morning routine?

I am on day 4 and 100 hours in and man am I feeling it. 
But I am proud of how far I've come. Mornings I've found are the worst. A cup of joe and a smoke was my routine and now I just drink coffee but it always makes want a cigarette more than ever. 

What are some new morning routines I can work in to help me with my new life? I was thinking maybe an energizing smoothie and light exercising?...
Anyway, tips are appreciated.

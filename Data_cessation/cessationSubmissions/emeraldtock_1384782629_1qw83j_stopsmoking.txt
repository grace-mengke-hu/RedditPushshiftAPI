The two week curse?

I have failed again, but as of yesterday afternoon I am restarting trying to quit. I keep getting to the second week and for whatever reason I will just smoke a cigarette and then everything snowballs from there. The good news is that each time I relapse the time inbetween quitting is less and less.

I work at a restaurant on the weekends where all of my co-workers smoke. So all night I have to hear about how they want a cigarette because of this, that, and the other. My husband has quit smoking cigarettes with me, but still uses snus (which doesn't bother me in the least). However, he will tell me that he wants a cigarette all the time. 

I don't want people to walk on egg shells around me, but I feel like people in my life constantly talking about smoking is making it harder for me to stay quit. Has anyone else experienced this or have any tips on how to deal with people talking about smoking all the time?

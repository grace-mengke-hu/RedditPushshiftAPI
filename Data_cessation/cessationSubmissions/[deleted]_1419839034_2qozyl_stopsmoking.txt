Does it bother anyone else that they might find the cure for lung cancer?

I'm just afraid that they will find a cure for not only lung cancer, but also other respiratory conditions related to smoking.  If this happens, it means that my quitting was totally in vain, and that I could have been smoking this whole time without future consequence.  Does this bother anyone besides me?

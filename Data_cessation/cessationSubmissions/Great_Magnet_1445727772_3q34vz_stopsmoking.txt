Relapse

13 days ago I had a life changing experience. After seeing the beauty that the world has to offer, I  decided to quit smoking. It's been a tough time but I pushed through, changing my habits and thought I was in the clear. I don't even know why I decided to have a cigarette today, but I realized after 2 or 3 drags that I had just wasted 2 weeks of progress.
I'm feeling kinda shitty for smoking again, but I need to push through the cravings and just stop. 
Sorry for the rant, but I'm too embarrassed to tell my best friend about it, plus I figured that this is the best place to go with this.

Day 48

So just wanted to give an update.  I quit smoking cold turkey 48 days ago and I wanted to share some thoughts.  

The first week will suck.  I (former smoker) had my wife (never smoked) to be my support system.    By support, I don't mean she was telling me 20 times a day that I could do it, she was more a sounding board I could go to when I was having a really crappy moment.  She was great when needed, but 95% of it had to come from me.

Worst week ended.  Nobody died...myself included.  The world didn't end.  I did not end up yelling or punching anybody.  Life simply went on.  As life went on from then until now I have had ample opportunities to go sneak a smoke with absolutely no consequences.  But as of now, I haven't given it a second thought.  Life will always have it's ups and downs.  Whether I smoke or not will not prevent or encourage family emergencies, stressful work things or real life accidents.  

If you are mentally 100% on board with quitting, truly believe in yourself and just stop.  As a smoker of 20+ years, I have 'quit' more times than I can count.  The thing that is actually working is my mental state of being done with smoking.

I love you all.  Believe in yourselves!

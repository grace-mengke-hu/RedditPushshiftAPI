The body says no...

...but my brain says yes. I took a drag earlier tonight. It was a bad move. Now I want a whole smoke because "I already fucked up, what's the difference?" How do y'all handle these moments? I live with multiple smokers and am really struggling tonight. I don't want to smoke all the time, but right now I want to. I know I am the proprietor of my own quit but I would love some support right now.

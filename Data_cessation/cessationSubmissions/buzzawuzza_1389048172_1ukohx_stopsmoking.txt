Quitting for second time, any advice?

Hi there, I stopped smoking the first time back in early 2012 for a year or so. But sadly started again whilst in the US due to not being able to drink thus having no outlet for stress relief (was offered one and was hooked again instantly). I tried giving up for a new years resolution, and lasted 3days, 3 hours and 14 mins, the first 3 days 3 hours was pure willpower (14 mins was driving to the shops at 3am in a pissed off mood :p) First time I quit I went cold turkey as I had a bad shock during my monthly training with my job, however now that I am at uni i dont have the need to be physically fit and find that whenever I go to the pub with mates I end up having a fag or walking to the shops drunk to buy some, even if i decide i wont before hand. I have tried e-cigarettes and was wondering if you have any advice on how to motivate myself to quit again. I know of course all the health and financial benefits to quitting but it just doen't seem to cut it. :/ any advice is most welcome, thanks!

Resetting my badge. But it's okay.

Well. Ashamed to come clean, but a conversation I had with one of you yesterday really came through to me. I need to reset my badge. 

I smoked tonight. It's been an off day. The cravings have been intensified the past 3 days. It's funny how you'll have days when you'll wonder how it can be just soooo easy, and other days where you realized you programmed your own brain too well for this habit. 

I wish it hadn't been good. But I am not quitting because I don't enjoy smoking. I am quitting because I like to run without dying after 500 feet. Because I like to hike. Because I smelled how bad cigarette smoke smells when you're not smoking. Because I hate that I'm addicted. Because I'll be 30 in October. Because I want more money in my wallet. 

But it's okay. I will not lie about my failures to you. 

How many of you avoid writing this post because you're ashamed? How many of you removed your badge instead of resetting it? Don't. Be honest. Sometimes someone is gonna give you some tough love. They only do that because they want you to succeed.

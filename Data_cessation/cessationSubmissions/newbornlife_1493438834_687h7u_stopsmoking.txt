How do you cope with work inefficiency when quitting?

I believe it is true for some degrees that you lose some of the cognitive performances when quitting because of the lack of dopamine.

Overall, in my experiences, on top of that, i feel unmotivated.
So i even tried microdosing thc so i can keep the curiosity and joy when quitting but needed thc dose to keep the same effect quickly goes up as i use it in daily base.

I work as a programmer/statistician and it is so hard for me to sit in front of my laptop and start writing down the code when I quit especially for the first week. I always ended up with stack of unfinished/low quality works which strikes me as a pressure after a while, so i just grab a smoke and actually start working.

It might be placebo, but throughtout the college years and my careers, i was always with smoke when i needed mental focus and sharpness under pressure. TBH, im afraid my brain is already altered in a way that i cannot sustain my normal productivity (under smoke/nicotine) without it.

I know the answer that i wud get is just grinding through weeks and expect it to get better but it is not as easy as i thought so.

I need a help! Should i start working out crazily as in my early 20s? Change diet? Lifestyle?

Today Is The Day :)

Hey guys! I made this account just to be part of this little subreddit so hopefully I can get your guys' support along this journey, it's a new beginning but it surely isn't my first time. 

I've been a smoker for 5 years. Anymore, I'm constantly using my inhaler because of smoking and that just adds to the money that cigarettes just flush down the drain. This morning I went out for a smoke before work and I just felt bad about it, that's really the only way I could describe it. Physically and mentally, I wasn't feeling my morning cigarette. I put it out halfway through, say there for a bit, and out of impulse I broke my pack and tossed it in the trash. I want to quit, I mean I need to quit actually. 

I made this account because I'm alone. I have family and I have friends; I simply mean I'm alone on my journey to quit. I'm surrounded by multiple smokers whether I'm at home or at work. This is actually my 4th time quitting, last time I broke on new years after taking a smoke a friend offered, bought my 3rd first pack not even a week later. I need people who know what I'm going through or at least are willing to lend and ear and some friendly words. This definitely seemed like the right place to come, so I'm glad to have found you guys! I'm quitting. This is the year, reddit.

Reset Badge. Ready to go....again!

Hey everyone! So my little story that tipped me over the edge from last night. I was out with friends watching game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final at a Buffalo Wild Wings. I'm the only one in our little group that smokes which makes it a little easier to not chain smoke around them, but i decide to step outside and have a smoke during a commercial and I miss the game tying goal! It may seem like a small thing for a lot of people but it sort of symbolizes how smoking has caused me to miss a lot of little things with my friends. It was then that i decided i need to start getting serious about quitting!

The only thing i need some advice on is smoking at work. I work 10 and a half hour days and use(d) smoking to break it up. What are some of your tips on replacing that break?
Thanks for all the support guys! This community is awesome!

Nearly three months down. I'm here to tell you it gets easier!

I never thought I could quit.  I smoked a pack a day for twenty years, and I truly believed it would be impossible for me to stop.  I used the patch all the way to the end of step 3.  I had one disposable Blu e-cig that I would hit from when things go really tough.  I had some really bad days in there, and thank goodness I have understanding family, friends, and coworkers.  While I still have small cravings here and there, it is much easier than it used to be.  I've not had any nicotine in my system at all for nearly a month now, and it feels good!  I'm here to tell you that if I can do it, so can you!

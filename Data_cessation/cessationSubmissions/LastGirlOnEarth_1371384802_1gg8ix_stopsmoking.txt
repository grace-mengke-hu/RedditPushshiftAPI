Inevitable weight gain?

So now I've been quit for 12 days 11 hours and am so happy to be free from the addiction and all that it entails. So, just like before when I quit my sweet tooth is out of control and I end up munching on EVERYTHING in sight. I'm not allowed to chew gum at work so I sub carrots instead. I also started running again and am back up to a 5k, but I've still already gained 6lbs. I am proud of myself for what I've accomplished, but man I would love it if you all had tips or tricks that helped you from hoovering everything in sight. Thanks!

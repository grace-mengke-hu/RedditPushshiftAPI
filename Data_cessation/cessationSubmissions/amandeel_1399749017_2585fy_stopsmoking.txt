I failed, again

I tried to quit several times now, once even managed to quit for three months or so, but failed every time. I quit, again, 10 days ago, and yesterday, I failed, again. I got quite drunk and I smoked a lot with my friend. Today, my throat felt sore, and I felt like shit, partly because of my hangover, but mostly because of my failure.

Well, time to pick myself up and try again. This time I'll quit for sure.

SIX days! Oh man.

Six days. My cravings haven't been too bad. There have been some really stressful moments since I quit, but I didn't give in. My boyfriend says I haven't been grouchy or angry, so I guess that is a win. I definitely want to stab people a lot, but as long as it doesn't show I consider that a good thing. 

My sense of smell is going crazy. Boyfriend just kissed me after smoking and oh, god, cigarettes smell worse to me now than they did before I ever started! The other day I could smell peanuts in someones hand from like six feet away, before I knew they were there. Crazy.

My dreams...wow. Every night it's like I took some acid before bed. One night I woke up because I was drooling (don't judge) and wiped my face with my hand, then barely glanced at my hand, thought "oh! That is blood! Not spit...eh. I will worry about it later." and back to sleep. Last night was particularly crazy. These dreams are so bizarre.

I keep feeling like I am starting to catch the flu, too. Chest hurts a bit, sinus pain, sore throat... No other real symptomd, though. How long does this last?

Honestly, I think the Cessation Nation app is my biggest help. Watching the health stats go up keeps me motivated. Plus I can already breathe better.

But shit, this is tough at times. When does the irritability fade? Anything I can do just to help myself feel less cranky?

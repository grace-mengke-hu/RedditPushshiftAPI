Started to stop smoking yesterday

I'm gonna quit. Going from 20 cigs to 0 cigs a day. It's been well over 30 hours without any nicotine. 

Staying at my parents' for a week to help kicking the habit. So far, besides being a bit cranky and headachy, I feel kinda fine. 

However, next Saturday I have to do a gig and I know that there'll be beer... Gotta hold it up though! /braintap

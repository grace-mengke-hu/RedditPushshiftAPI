Party smoking and withdrawal question.

Hello, just a question that i really couldn't find an answer for when i googled it. I've been smoking since i was 13, i stopped smoking regularly when i was 20 and since then i've only been smoking when i'm out drinking or in certain social situations( lets say 2 times a week at average).

 However, lately I've decided to cut down on the party smoking( to like once a week) as well since it's expensive and i don't really feel addicted to nicotine. Furthermore ive been having really crappy days lately the second and sometimes the 3'rd day as well after a night out with smoking.

 So my question is as follows: has my age caught up with me? am i no longer able to smoke on the weekends without experiencing withdrawal? is it possible? I've never experienced withdrawal symptoms that I've noticed before.

Also i should mention that im on depression and anxiety medication, but i often feel quite alright the morning after(provided that i didn't go all the way overboard with my drinking) so it does not seem like thats where the problem lies unless the meds somehow makes me experience withdrawal symptoms/gets me addicted faster (after all they are psychoactive drugs so maybe thats somehow possible?) 

Help would be much appreciated!( And sorry for any spelling errors, my reddit somehow only corrects words in norwegian, so pretty much every word shows up with red undelining)

Edit: i guess i should clarify what i mean with crappy days. I mean days of feeling tired, like im in a haze. Or maybe downright depressed.

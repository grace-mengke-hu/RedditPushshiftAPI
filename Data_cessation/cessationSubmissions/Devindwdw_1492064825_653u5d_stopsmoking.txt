10 days down and feeling good!

I did it cold turkey and damn it was hard at first by myself. I work, live, and hangout with almost all smokers and it was tough being around it at first (especially at work) but they've all been very supportive and kind not to smoke around me. It gets easier every day! Finally getting back to being active again!

12th day challenge

This is the 1st time I didn't go for any nicotine replacements because I wanted to say NO not just to smoking, all forms of nicotine.
After 12 days, today few minutes earlier I experienced a craving. Just walking out of office and typing this message kept me busy and I am so glad that I did overcome that urge!

After almost 2 weeks, I am back at square one! :(

I am not sure what got to me yesterday, maybe being all alone on Thanksgiving with an empty fridge, or that I just didn't know what to do with myself on my day off (among some other stuff I am dealing with), but I caved in and got a pack (which is so much worse than just bumming one if you get that desperate, but that's another story).

I knew I was going to regret it, but I did it anyway, and now I have to quit all over again. Womp womp.

I have a few cigarettes left, so I may or may not finish those today - we'll see how the day unfolds - but tomorrow I start fresh. Thanks for everyone's support! I am trying not to get too discouraged. I can do this! Blah... I am going to remove my badge shortly.

Three days in and no cravings but terrible cramps

I've been doing great, day three with no nicotine replacement after smoking 2/3-1 pack a day, but I was in and out of sleep all night last night with terrible stomach cramps, continuing today. I've been eating my normal diet, which is pretty healthy for the most part. I've been eating more fruit and drinking water to help me cut cravings so I don't think it would be my diet. I've had some close bathroom calls too and I was wondering if this is common when quitting (hasn't happened when I quit before) and if anyone has advice to help subdue them

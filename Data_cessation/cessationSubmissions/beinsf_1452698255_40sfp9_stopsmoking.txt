!12 days and feeling moderately good

I'm 33 years old and started smoking when I was just 13...its incredible how much time goes by when you're hooked on a nasty weed! Today marks my 12th day quitting and I will honestly say I am starting to feel better. That first week was hell, plain and simple. All I thought about was smoking, even as I planned things that I would do in the future, like travel, constantly thinking about where I could smoke. Even dreaming about smoking.  SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE!!! ARGH!

This week I am starting to feel better, as I have been repeating my mantra, NOPE (Not one puff ever) and realizing that every time I see a smoker I feel bad for them being caught in addiction.  I know it too well and how much it sucks. I am still experiencing cravings, in fact, I tore my house apart yesterday looking for the 1 stray cigarette in a jacket pocket. I'm not sure if I would have smoked it if I found it, but I didn't find one, so I lucked out on that one.

I've quit a hundred times, but this time feels different, I feel like I am starting to see my life without cigarettes. Its a really strange feeling, but incredibly liberating at the same time.

To those of you just starting, you must know that you have more power than the nicotine. You can beat this!

For those of you who have commented on this board and shared your stories and challenges, I send you my sincere thanks. Understanding what others are experiencing makes this entire process much less lonely.  

Cheers and good luck to you all!

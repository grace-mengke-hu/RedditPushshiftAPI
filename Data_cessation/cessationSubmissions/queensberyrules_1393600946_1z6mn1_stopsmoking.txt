100 DAYS! time just flew by

The first month was the most difficult thing ive done in my 28 years living on this planet. Two - Three months was a breeze. Gym, Netflix and water has been my best friends. Good luck to the beginners. Ive smoked for 13 years and one day I just said fuck it and now I'm here.

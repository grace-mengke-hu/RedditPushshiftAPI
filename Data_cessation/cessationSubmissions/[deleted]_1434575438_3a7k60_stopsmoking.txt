I've smoked on and off for years- mostly off. Recently I started smoking more heavily, but then "quit" in May. I have one group of friends that smokes. Is it bad for me to have one with them once in a while (every couple weeks, or less often)?

I don't know how to best explain my question. Basically, none of my family or coworkers smoke. The great majority of my friends don't smoke either. However, my wife has a group of friends that we hang out with once or twice a month. All of the males in the group smoke, and usually when we hang out, we're also having drinks- 2 of my "triggers" (alcohol, and peers). 

I stopped buying packs when I quit, but I've hung out with this group a couple of times, and had a cigarette or two each time. While I feel like the amount I'm smoking (2-3 per month, if that) isn't a serious health issue, I feel like being mentally ok with having a cigarette occasionally means that I'm playing with fire when it comes to falling off the wagon.

Is anyone here able to "quit" their daily habit, but still have one cigarette responsibly once in a while? Is this a terrible idea?

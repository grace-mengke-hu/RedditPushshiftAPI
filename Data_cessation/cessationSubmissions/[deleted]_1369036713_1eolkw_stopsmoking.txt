And this is it...

My ex came by the other day and on a pouch of Top tobacco she had changed Top to Stop Smoking. I love her and want her back more than even I can imagine.

I know this alone won't get her back but I'll do anything it takes to be with her again. I have two left and that's gonna be it.

I just wanted to share.

Also, if you read this while its still up, I've already submitted to have my quit smoking timer reset.

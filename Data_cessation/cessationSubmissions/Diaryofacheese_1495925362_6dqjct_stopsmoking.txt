Reasons I want to quit smoking

- I will get dead from it, or at best, develop a nasty disease. Either way, I don't want to suffocate to death. My Dad did, and I dont want to.
- I don't think my kids will do this,  but I want them to see how hard addiction is. There are lots if things to get addicted to, things that are even worse. They think im strong, and know about life. Then they see me, smoking, or vaping, or wearing a sticker of shame, struggling to stop  killing myself. I am so sick of failing them.
- I want to be free, nicotine keeps you on a very short leash.
- I want to be healthy, and I am, except for being a smoker/nicadict. I try to eat well,  exercise, hydrate, sleep well, ect.... and then...smoke. total in consistency.
- I want to spend my time on not killing myself; I've always had a self destructive streak, and I'm ready to let this final piece fall away.

- I want to save money.
- I want to be able to do this, I don't want to feel weak anymore.

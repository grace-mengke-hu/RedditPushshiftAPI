Threw out the juul

Kicking myself for getting myself addicted to nicotine when I was 14. I found a juul on the ground and was curious about it... Years later I've got thyroid disease and nicotine makes it worse so I threw out all my vapes. I put them a cat litter bag so theres no going back lol. Its going to be a fun week! Any other teenagers out there u can do it!

Badly need to quit, scared to try again..

I have been an off and on smoker for nearly 20 years, my latest on has been going on for about 5 years. I nearly quit a few months ago using patches, but then I ran out and couldn’t afford more, but I could afford a pack to last me a few days until payday.. 2 months of hellish withdrawals completely wasted.

Now I’m scared to try again. The depression was  horrific, I had to constantly fight the urge to kill myself. I do have a history of depression/bipolar  that was treatment resistant, but for the past year I have been doing well without medication until I attempt to quit smoking.  I NEED to quit, my health is in a very poor state and besides that I cannot afford to smoke! On top of my difficulty, my husband smokes and is not motivated quit at all.

Not sure what help anyone can give, just need to vent to people who can relate I guess.

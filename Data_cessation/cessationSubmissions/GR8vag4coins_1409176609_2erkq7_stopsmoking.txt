Any advice for living with a GF / significant other that smokes too

Hi all,

On and off smoker for 9 years. This latest on has been continuous for 4.5 years and I am ready to quit.... for good.

I've tried many times to talk to the GF, but she doesn't want to quit. Asked her to watch Allen Carr's method, but it is met with anger and refusal to watch.

The worst part is the GF quit smoking earlier in her life, and only picked up the addiction again when she met me. I feel completely responsible.

After a long and stressful day, we like to sit out on our balcony, have some drinks and smoke.  I need to quit the smoking addiction, but do not want to stop drinking bourbon.   It's going to be tough, but I can do it.

I'm hoping that leading by example will work on her, and she'll eventually come around.  Any advice or tips for personally quitting while the people you live with continue to smoke?

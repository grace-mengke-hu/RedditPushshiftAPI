Menthol Inhaler

1 month 9 days 19 hours smoke and nicotine free! So proud of myself! Cravings are definitely less and not as intense! But when I do get one I have been using a menthol nasal inhaler, kind thing you use when you got a cold. Taking 1 or 2 sniffs has two benefits for me, takes my mind of the craving and I love that I can now take really deep breaths without wheezing! 
Am I weird? Lol 
Lots of love to all of us here today, not smoking. ðŸ˜€

A bit harder than i expected

Well when i woke up this morning, i threw away my lighters and ash trays. All was well for a bit as i headed for work, some minor driving cravings but i brough some tooth picks to chew on to help with the jaw pains.

But when i got to work things started to get harder. It is easier to count the non smokers than the smokers and the smell was driving me crazy. After a hour into work i ended up cheating and smoked a cig i got from a buddy. Had to reset my stop smoking app and i felt like shit when i seen the smoke free timer go back to zero. That was about a hour ago.


My question is, how do i stay strong when surrounded by so much temptation? E cigs dont work for me so right now cold turkey is the only way to go (due to a lack of money to buy other stop smoking methods)

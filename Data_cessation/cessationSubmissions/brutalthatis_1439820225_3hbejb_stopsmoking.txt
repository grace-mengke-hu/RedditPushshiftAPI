Need some advice for work.

I currently smoke around a half a pack per day. I've tried on multiple occasions to quit smoking, and have gone several days without one, and although it's not easy, I've always made it through those days (these days are usually vacation). The problem I have is at work. I pretty much only smoke at work, and could use some advice for getting through the workday cravings. 

This is the only place where I have any "insurmountable" urges (I know they aren't really insurmountable, but it feels that way sometimes). If anyone has any advice on how to make it through a workday I would really appreciate it.

24 days - how am i gonna celebrate 1 month? + personal benefits

Hi everyone, 
I havent been smoking for 24 days now. I have been a smoker for 7 years and i have never been without cigarettes for so long, and this time feels so much different than all the others. Its like i knew from day 1 that this was the time, and i get more convinced  every day. A big motivation for me was that i really want to get fit and all of that - and all of those hours on the bike would be useless if i was a smoker. 

I have the diagnose bipolar, which has made this very difficult at times. The cigarette has been my best friend every time my whole world falls apart. This was my biggest fear when i decided to quit - how am i gonna deal with my emotions?! 
Yes, i am so happy for being able to breathe for the first time in 8 years, seeing results at the gym, not smelling like shit (first now i notice how smokers smells like - yuck! ) and all of the other benefits that comes with quitting. 
But I have also had to find other ways to deal when things go bad for me, and that has led to more insight of who i am and how i work - something that is important for me considering my diagnose.

Now i want to hear your personal benefits! Have you noticed any benefits outside of the common ones? 

I would also like some tips on how to celebrate one month. Im so exited!

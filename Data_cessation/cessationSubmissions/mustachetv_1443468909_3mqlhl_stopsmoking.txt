34 hours in

I've been smoking for 8 years, usually about 7-8 a day (unless I'm having beers with friends, then it's substantially more). I didn't smoke any yesterday, haven't had any today, and finally gave my pack away to a coworker this morning with a little note not to let me bum any. :) 

I'm feeling really mentally foggy, a little agitated, and a lot anxious. I hate that I smoke though and am looking forward to being smoke-free and hoping that the cravings get easier. 

What do you do to get through cravings?

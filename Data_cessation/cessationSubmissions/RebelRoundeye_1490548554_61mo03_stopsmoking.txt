Five Years! I am thrilled to be a healthier and happier me.

Quitting was such a struggle for me after a lifetime of tobacco use and now I have five years between me and my last cigarette.  Now, I am 76 days sober after quitting drinking alcohol.  I still enjoy dropping by to give encouragement, advice, and honest opinions to those still struggling with tobacco.  

I just wanted to say thanks to this sub and I hope everyone finds success in their efforts to break free from tobacco!

Rapid deterioration in mental health = constant relapses. Anyone relate?

On New Year’s night I had a complete mental breakdown, and then for two further nights I had another two breakdowns. When the first one started I got the staff to grab me cigarettes and that was it. My mental health has gone downhill quite rapidly but I’ve still been regularly updating my Smoke Free app even when I’ve smoked. I haven’t had a cigarette today so far as my new e-cig arrived yesterday. But I know I’ll probably end up having a couple of cigarettes. Does this happen to anyone else who has mental health problems that rapidly deteriorate? This happens EVERY TIME I quit. I last for ages but if I have a breakdown that’s it, I’m smoking again to cope. Trust me, I have more damaging ways if I’m not smoking! But I was just wondering if anyone could enlighten me to how they cope?

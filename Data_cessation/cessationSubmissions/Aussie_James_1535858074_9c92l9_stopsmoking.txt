Chest infection day 2 no cigarette

I'm on my second day of no smoking, my lungs feel so yucky, I have a chest infection! The other night I smoked a heap of cigarettes and went to the club for a gamble. Enjoyed the night. But I remember ducking on my last cigarette saying to myself "I'm so over these poisonous sticks" anyhow got to bed around 12am. Woke up and spat up yellow stuff, my throat was sore and I was thinking of a smoke but said "no way" smoking with a chest infection is just totally disrespectful to my lungs. So I made it through the day with a bad headache, fidgeting and fighting urges to light up, drank heaps of water, ate passionfruit and cups of tea. Watched a couple movies. Today I feel better but still sick. So I'm kind of glad i got sick. It has helped me stop smoking.

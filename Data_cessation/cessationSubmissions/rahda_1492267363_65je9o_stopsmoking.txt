Found a cigarette

I unexpectedly found one of those left over cigarettes while cleaning. It was a whole cigarette. I see my boyfriend and some friends smoking, doesn't bother me. I can handle packs of cigs and not  a be affected. However, when  surprised by a rouge butt or in this case full cig I get an impulsive urge to smoke it. I smelled it, I ran my fingers over it, and I brought it to my mouth. I was thinking how easy it would be to smoke on an impulse. I acted out the smoking without lighting it. It was like having a loaded gun. I knew I wouldn't smoke it. But I had a memory of how the tendrils of smoke waft up in the sunlight as I puffed. I felt sad. Then I noticed again the power of the addiction. Those events of smoking that were pleasurable were the addiction talking. I took the little monster of a stick and crushed it up and threw it away. I wasn't going to smoke it. But it was pretty interesting and enlightening. One impulse acted on can happen so fast. We are dealing with the mother of addictions folks. Keep going! Even if you slip up, don't let it keep you down. Breaking the chains of slavery. I am never going back.

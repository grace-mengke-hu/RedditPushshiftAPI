1 week

I've been smoking for four years now. I started with 2 packs a day and cut down to 6 cigs a day or a pack when I'm drinking which is twice a week. I study abroad and my parents are visiting me so I didn't get to smoke for a week. I could have if I wanted to but it was too much trouble hiding somewhere, going for a walk and smelling of cigs. The problem is I have no motivation to quit. I know it's a healthier choice and stuff but so is exercising and i don't exercise. I do, however, care a lot about how I look. yeah really superficial, I know. Like it bothers me that my hair is thinning out  (not sure if cos of cigs or not) and that I have bad dark circles most of the time. So, if you've quit for a long time please tell me how it affected the way you looked? That would help me a lot. Also, since I've quit I've been hungry all the time!!! I'm pretty skinny right now so weight shouldn't be a problem but in the long run I'm scared I might gain a lot because naturally I'm always hungry I love food and cigs helped me stop eating. Thank you! 

Edit: everything is making me sad and angry. I'd rather smoke than feel this shitty. 
smoking for 7 years not 4 . wow that was a shocker

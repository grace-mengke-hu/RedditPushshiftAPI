Will quitting smoking make my depression and anxiety worse or better?

So I don't really know where or how to  start this but I've been smoking a pack everyday since I was 13 or 1418 now. I can barely breathe anymore, walking up Hills where I live takes everything out of me, my SO doesn't smoke and I can hear and see that it is affecting him now. I love smoking but what I'm scared about quitting is my depression and anxiety, will it make it worse? Better the first couple days?? I want to quit but it's really hard for me, I'm scared it will make me have some psychotic breakdown or make me suicidal etc. My anxiety is already bad, I have always felt like someone is behind me or in the same room trying to kill me or hurt me and I've felt that since I was a kid. I'm ready to stop smoking, and be and feel healthy and start my little healthy kick and start yoga/meditation.. eating better. What I'm asking is will it make my depression and that feeling of people behind me worse? Or better after the initial couple day hump for cravings? What are some suggestions to keep myself on track on quit. I just smoked my last cigarette and I'm done. I will post on here but I feel kinda stupid and like "what's the point of posting here" nobody wants to know and I don't even what to write....

Relieved to have finally quit, think I have quitter's flu

After 5 years or so of smoking pot daily, I'm on my way to 3 weeks of being clean - my last bowl was on Dec 21.

I've been feeling pretty great, none of the mood swings I experienced the last time I tried, but I think I have quitter's flu pretty bad. I've been congested as hell since I landed in Hong Kong for a brief home visit. Didn't have to deal with this when I quit my year of smoking cigarettes back in 2012. Any tips for dealing with this? I'm miserably congested every morning.

I'm so glad I stuck to quitting, I can feel my mind (and lungs) clearing up again. I'm a little worried about returning to California (it was easy to quit when I didn't have any alternative - as I'd planned)... Both of my roommates are daily pot smokers, but I'm feeling more confident than ever that I can stick to this.

I don't know why I felt the need to share this, but I think it helps a little to put it out there.

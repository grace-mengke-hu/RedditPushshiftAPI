Not smoked for 18 days due to surgery

Every cloud has a silver lining and I haven't smoked for 18 days due to having surgery. I have elected to go cold turkey and I am chuffed to have achieved what I have as my husband still smokes...bring on day 19! I keep telling myself the following if I can do 18 days I can do 19 days and so on and a forth it's really helped. 
I'm also saving money and most importantly this is for my health!

My love letter

Today I say goodbye to you, my love. After 20 years the time has come for me to go on this rode alone. I'll miss you. I'll miss you like hell. You were always beside me. In good times and even more so in bad ones. Every time I had a shitty day I thought of the moment I'll be with you and longed for that moment with every tick of the clock. A lot of the days you were the best thing in my day. Always sweet and ready to listen. You never judged and you always helped. With you I felt better. Without you I felt weak. 

You were the first thing that I thought about when I woke up and the last thing that concluded my day. You made every day easier by being there for me when I was waiting for a bus or went for a walk. And you were so amazing when I was drunk - I could not have felt better than when I had you. 

But now , my love, it's time for us to part. Even though you have been with me for so long and though you've seen me through all my rough times, I have realized one simple thing - you're the most abusive relationship that I have ever had. You're needy , you're aggressive , you don't care where and how I am - you just want me to take you with me. And you don't even care about me - you'll agree to anyone who takes you and the more, the better! 

And you're trying to kill me. Slowly. So this is the time to say goodbye. I really hope I'll never see you again, though I've said that hundred times before. I hope this time it lasts, even in worse times. Especially in worse times...

Day 1.

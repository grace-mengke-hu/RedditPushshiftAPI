On my 2nd day

I've tried quitting several times this year already and I'll maybe go a day or two before giving in. I'm really struggling today. I honestly hate smoking even though that's all my mind can think about at the moment. The only times I'm not seriously craving it is when I'm either working out or with my girlfriend but obviously I cannot do either of those two things for 24/7 since I have other responsibilities in my life. 

Any suggestions as to what you guys would do to get rid of the craving?

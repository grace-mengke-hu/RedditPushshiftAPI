11 days in...

I've been off tobacco for good for 11 days, I'm using vaping as a help and well, I have to admit I like it, the flavor and cloud chasing is fun, I went from a 24 piece pack a day to 5 in total per week or so, to finally, 11 days ago 0 cigs, just vape.

I feel really good, I breathe better, cough less and get less tired. 

I've also been using the smoke free app and just being able to keep a counter of progresses and a saving goal, plus the chance of logging cravings, which have considerably decreased, by the way, has been an amazing help. 

I wish all fellow quitters the best in their efforts and if you need to talk, just drop a comment!

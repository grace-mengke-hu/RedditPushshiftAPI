Inability to completely breathe through nose question

When I smoked I remember that I had the distinct inability to completely breathe through my noise.  

One of my nostrils was constantly plugged.  I always had to breathe through my mouth.   

One of my major enjoyments after I quit smoking was that I could draw a full breath through my nose.  This is healthier as its optimum to inhale through the nose so the air is better filtered.  Is this a common feature of smoking?  I could find no literature on it.

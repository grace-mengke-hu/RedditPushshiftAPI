Quitting Strategies so Far!!

Usually smoked one Cig in the morning and 6-7 after work (never during the work day). This seemed stupid because I'm sitting in withdrawl all day at work but boy that after work cig. 

That was the Cig I craved the most so for the past week I have been leaving all my credit cards and cash at home. I have my corporate card if I need something in an emergency but boy would that be a fun conversation about buying cigs on that. Time after time I found myself on the way home pulling into that Gas Station to buy a pack. I just can't trust myself right now. 

Chewing on Straws: Also week with no nail biting. Best of luck everyone.

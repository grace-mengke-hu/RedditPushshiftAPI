Its been 4 days 7 hours and 15 minuets

Ok so ive given up counting how many times ive quit. And i would love to say that i wasnt dumb enough to smoke while having pneumonia. But i wasnt. I literally couldnt breathe but was breathing over a pot of hot water to open me up enough to smoke.  Im 34 and have muscular dystrophy. This disease has taken so much from me i always said i wont give up my smoking. My smokes had been there through the best and worst times in my life. I literally looked at them like mybest friends. And yea ive almost missed a flight to go back out to get that last one in. Last year my liver was shutting down due to gallstones blocking my bile duct and backing everything back up to my liver so i had to call the ambulance. I would rather have gone through child birth again than that pain but damnit i wouldnt let them load me in till i finished my last smoke. I know its stupid. Im highly educated and i know that it is about the dumbest thing in the world. But ive finally realized there going to kill me. Day 4 and im still just so irritated and pissed off at the world. Ive never been so angry when quiting before. Any ideas would be great please........

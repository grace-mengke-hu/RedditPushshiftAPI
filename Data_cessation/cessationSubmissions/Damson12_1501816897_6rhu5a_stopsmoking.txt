Reason for concern about father's nicotine gum addiction?

Mostly just the title, but details can't hurt.

My father is in his fifties, been addicted to nicotine gum for a very long time. We've never talked about it, nor have we talked about him previously smoking (which I'm sure he gave up after having kids).

I've only recently been concerned about it because his general health seems to have declined over the past two years, and his mother recently passed from heart disease. He's getting more of a belly, his posture still sucks, and he is on cholesterol medication now. I do not believe the gum is at fault for this obviously, but the general decline has got me thinking more about his health. 

As to his usage amount, he has (for example) had 7-8 pieces of gum since 8pm. It is 12:30.pm as I write this. I checked his box (that he hides poorly) and each piece is 4mg. I have no clue if he does it at work (probably), but that adds up to 80-100mg of nicotine/day. Seems like a shit-ton, but I don't smoke or anything so who knows. If anything it is expensive. 

I would feel *extremely* uncomfortable bringing this up with him, but I would do it if I thought the health risk from continued use for the rest of his life (which seems likely) was high enough. 

Thoughts?

Day 3 Rage?

I don't even really have any questions, I just need to rant. As expected, Day One was incredibly tough. That was the first time going 24 hours without nicotine in at least a year or two. Yesterday was so much better, the difference was night and day. I had no idea Day 3 would be the hardest yet. 

I'm on an emotional roller coaster right now. One minute I'm fine, the next I'm so incredibly depressed that I feel absolutely worthless. Five minutes after that I'm so fed up with the world's injustices that I want to start a revolution in a blind rage. 

The kicker to this is that I'm also on my 10th day of not smoking pot after doing that daily for a couple years, and I cannot believe the difference. I was slightly uncomfortable for a day or two, a small decrease in appetite and some difficulty falling asleep. Back to normal by Day Four.

What boggles my mind is how much harder this legal, supposedly "safer" substance is. I cannot fathom how some fat cats decided that no one can toy with something that is quite easy to be rid of when you no longer enjoy it, yet make this fucking torture readily accessible. Maybe its just me being a bitchy quitter but that pisses me off. That just makes me hate people and society or whatever it is that made this horrific habit seem like an okay thing to do to 16 year-old me. 

Thanks for listening folks. Even though there was no point. Still won't let it make me smoke.

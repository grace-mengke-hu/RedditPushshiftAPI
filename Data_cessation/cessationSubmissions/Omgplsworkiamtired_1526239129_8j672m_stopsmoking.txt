Almost three months quit- have to replace the habit that helped me quit

I used the bakery and the ice cream section to get through the grocery store with out buying cigarettes. 

So now I think I need sugar to get through the grocery store. 

I skipped the bakery and the ice cream isle today and grabbed a candy bar at the register. That gosh darn impulse, last minute candy isle got me. 

Now I have to replace that habit with some thing else. But I do not have any problems at all skipping the cigarettes!

Antisocial behaviour

Hello Everybody. I feel like I've just had an epiphany. I think smoking heavily (around 30 a day) has turned me into an introvert.
I think the three biggest contributors to this would be:
1. I am embarrassed to stand to close to people because I know I stink, even though I cant smell it myself.
2. I have a short attention span as my mind is always in a mini state of withdrawal, therefor not able to give my full attention to the person in front of me.
3. I need to disengage so that I can go and smoke!!

Resonate with anyone?

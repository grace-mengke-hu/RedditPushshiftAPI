96 days and feeling very thankful. One of the best decision i ever made!

Almost 100 days! woohoo. Feeling quite thankful to myself really...since i quit smoking, there are really tonnes of benefits that I'm slowly feeling it. Thought i would type it out and elaborate about it and its progression since im feeling so grateful that i did it. 

When i first quit, the main reason is actually just money as i would usually skip lunch just to buy a pack everyday. I just could not take it anymore feeling very dry in the mouth no matter how much i drink and hungry in the stomach. The first couple of weeks after quiting was quite difficult but as soon as it settles down a little, the first best feeling I realized was that I always had extra money in my wallet at the end of the week (i do weekly budgets). The second best feeling was that how well rested i felt in the morning. Its like I'm up and ready without any grogginess and sluggishness. Then I started to realize that my insomnia is also over without me noticing.
Altough it still takes around 30-45 minutes for me to sleep at night, its so much better than actually to stay for a couple of hours believing that if i go for another cig i ll be able to sleep.

I then started to realized I was getting more organized cos i had more time to do some planning instead of just smoking and watch youtube vids at night before bed. I also started to research about being productive intensively just to keep myself busy as the withdrawals was strong at that time. The results? I found GTD by david allen (getting things done) and it had been a godsend.

I shall stop here and try to post more when i reach a 100 days. I am actually very grateful that i did this and i also believe that it is important that we remind ourself everyday of how good it is to be a non-smoker. Overcoming addiction is a lifetime maintenance.

Is this weird or am I just lucky?

Its been close to three weeks now and I really haven't been struggling with this at all. I had been a smoker for over ten years starting around when I was 15, and having more than a pack a day for a good chunk of it.

Earlier I was taking a walk around the building I work at to break up the day a bit (its a nice walk about 3/4 of a mile) and when I came upon the smokers area filled with people it didn't even faze me I was just able to walk right by them with not even an iota of a urge to join them.

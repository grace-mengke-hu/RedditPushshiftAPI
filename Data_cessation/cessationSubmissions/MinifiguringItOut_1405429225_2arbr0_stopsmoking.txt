Finally made it to a week!

I have been trying to quit all summer, but hadn't made it past 3 days.  Today marks 7 days into the journey.  I have been smoking for a decade with a few longer stoppages.  Stress always brings me back.  This time I plan to take better care of myself and stay focused on my goal.  I am tired of wasting money.  I am tired of hurting myself.  I am tired of being told that I need to quit.  

I have quit.  I am a quitter and I will prosper!

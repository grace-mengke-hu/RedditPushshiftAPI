Worried about my mental state if I quit.

Hey Reddit. I'm 25 years old, been smoking consistently since I was 13. I went from half a pack a day to a pack(sometimes a pack and a half) overtime. I'm definitely chain smoker in my down time. I have began to notice the toll smoking is taking on me. I can't taste or smell much of anything, I can barely breathe and I overall feel like complete shit 90% of the time. I really, really want to quit but I'm scared. I have an anxiety disorder, depression, and a short fuse. I've felt nicotine withdrawal before, and even though I was only without cigarettes for 6-7 hours, I damn near lost my mind and couldn't do much of anything except cry and throw fits and have panic attacks. I'm afraid of feeling/acting this way at work or in public. I don't know if I can mentally handle withdrawal and don't know how to approach quitting, but I am serious about it. Another problem I have is that my mom is also a heavy smoker, and she lives with me. She refuses to not smoke in the house (something I never wanted her to do to begin with) and I'm also afraid I won't be able to quit under these living situations, with the smell and the easy access to cigarettes. Any advice would be really helpful, I'm at a loss and don't know how to get myself better.

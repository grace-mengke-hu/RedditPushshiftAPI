48 hours - Longest span of being smoke free at my own will

Just past 49 hours.

Been a smoker for 30 years and never had more than 24 hours at my own will except for a couple of times being in hospital.

I have a cigarette and lighter on my desk, staring at it every once in a while.

You are not gonna beat me again...

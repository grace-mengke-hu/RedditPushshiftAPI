Tell me it's not that hard, please.

Seriously, was there any aspect of quitting, which was easier than you thought? 

I have been thinking for a long time, that it is time. Ten years of smoking is ridiculous, and I need to let it go. I have been reading some of your stories in here, and congratulations to all of you for quitting!! Some of the descriptions of quitting are making me nervous though.. So for the people who are a few days/weeks in: please tell me that the cravings the first few days aren't that bad..
and for the long time quitters (so cool!) please tell me that the cravings go away eventually.. JK, but maybe there was some aspect, that was easier than anticipated?? 

Also, did anyone have a 'quit-smoking-buddy' and did it help?

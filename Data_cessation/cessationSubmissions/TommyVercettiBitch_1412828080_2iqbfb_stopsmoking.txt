Nervous about quitting

Hi guys, I'm writing this as I'm enjoying a pleasant smoke. It has been my crutch everyday for the past couple of years and I really need to quit. It's costing me my health not to mention my wallet, but health is wealth right? I'm trying to detox my life in it's entirety but I figured that quitting my most disgusting habit would probably be a good place to start. I wanted to introduce myself to this subreddit and hope that you all can join me as I try to be consistent with this to the best of my ability. Thanks for reading.

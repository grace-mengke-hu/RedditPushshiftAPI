Getting strong urges to smoke...a lot of stress and decision making in my life rithg now...I just feel like a drag!

I still get urges when I am stressed. I worked out yesterday so I cannot do any push ups or anything...my arms are sored and tomorrow is my work out day again. So I am just here with the urge and not smoking...keeping strong.

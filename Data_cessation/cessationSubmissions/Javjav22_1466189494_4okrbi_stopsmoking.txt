Back to the start

I was going well,infact too well.I was on day 25 ,I got over confident that smoking is behind me now. Day before yesterday I had a strong urge to smoke again.I just acted on it without thinking much ,went out and got myself five cigarettes.I broke the four after smoking half.But the cravings started full time.Next day again I got myself a pack as I thought there is no stopping me now.After smoking one I drained the rest of the pack. Now I am 24 hour smoke free. I want to hit myself hard for blowing my quit. When I was smoking I felt so filthy and guilty.  Before draining my pack I thought for thirty minutes that how this only means I will again be fully trapped into smoking again.Not a day free from cigarettes.How my 24/7 will be dancing around the struggle to get them ,smoke them ans get some more.And in those thirty minutes I decided I am definitely going to try again. It's only been day 1 but still I am here and I am trying my best not to let my addiction ruin my life anymore.

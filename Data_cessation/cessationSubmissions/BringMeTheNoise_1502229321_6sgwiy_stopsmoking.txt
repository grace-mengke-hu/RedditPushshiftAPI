Writing rhymes instead of smoking...

I'm at a point where I'm over smoking. It's been something I've been doing for the past 10 years of my life, and I think of all the time and money I wasted doing something unproductive. I used to write a lot, and kind of fell out of writing after I graduated from college. So, instead of spending 10 to 15 minutes chainsmoking a couple of cigarettes, I'm going to spend time writing to fight cravings. Bear with me, this is cheesy and off the top of my head, but I figured this would be a good spot to post. Thanks for reading.

> **First Fight**  
This fight, it’s tough  
Here from the start  
The cravings for nicotine  
Tearing the daily routine apart.  
It’s hard to collect my thoughts  
Hard to keep going, hard to do work,  
When I’m out enjoying myself,  
No nicotine and I’m going berserk.  
Then there’s delicious pairings,  
Bourbon, coffee, beers late at night,  
It’s when I drink these things,  
My mind tries, struggles to fight.  
I want my fix,  
To succumb to addictive pleasure!  
But today I make my stand,  
I will not smoke for leisure!  
No more wasting away,  
Killing time with cig smoke.  
No more packs of squares  
Playing me for broke.  
I'm tired of wheezin' and coughin',  
Catching my breath at the top of the stairs.  
Or my breath smelling like dogshit,  
Or smellin' up my car, without any cares.  
It's unnatural, it's evil,  
It's time to stop.  
I may not have a mic,  
But this bad habit I will drop...

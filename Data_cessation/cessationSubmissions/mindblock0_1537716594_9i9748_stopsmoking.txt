Need some help.

Hey everyone. I finally took the plunge 16days ago and quit smoking cold turkey. The first week flew by with minimal cravings. The second week was a bit more tough. I was smacked with fatigue and some depression. Still no real desire to smoke until today. I am extremely drained and have been getting increasingly more irritable throughout the day. I am trying to stay in the moment, focus on my breath, and remind myself why I quit but it is getting tough. How long does this last? What do you guys do to help with these symptoms?

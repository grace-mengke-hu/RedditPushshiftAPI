I find the Allen Carr book 'The Easy Way to Stop Smoking' ridiculous

I'm not disparaging its helpfulness to people, but if you read it, you'll often notice these flawed arguments that are undermining the credibility of the AC method. 

For example: 'That failure rate was based on the money-hack guarantee that we give at our clinics. The average current failure rate of our clinics world-wide is under 5 per cent'.

There are more reasons than not quitting to not ask for a refund (embarrassment to admit you haven't quit, ignorant of the refund policy, laziness or apathy in getting a refund) and to just assume that because only 5% of the AC clientele asked for a refund automatically means 95% success is ridiculous. I haven't gone more than three pages at a time without finding some claim like that, which is hampering my confidence that this book should be trusted.

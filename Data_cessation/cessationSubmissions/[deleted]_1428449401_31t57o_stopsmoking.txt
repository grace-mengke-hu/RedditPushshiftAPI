I'm really unhappy with everything

I'm trying very hard to not go and get a pack right now. I'm not happy with like anything in my life. My job really does make me miserable. I skipped today because I just couldn't do it. I've done some job searching before since I've never liked this job and gotten no hits or anything so that's discouraging and I don't even know where to begin anymore. 

I'm just really sad and want the comfort of a cigarette.

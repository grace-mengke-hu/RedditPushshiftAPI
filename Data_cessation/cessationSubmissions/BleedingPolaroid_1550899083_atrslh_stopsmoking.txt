For the umpteenth time

Sorry if the formatting is weird; on mobile. 

I have been a heavy  nicotine user for almost 6 years now.  I started with cigs and quickly started to smoke a pack a day if not more. Eventually I switched to an e cig set up (would go back and forth between the real ones too) but with the e cig i was blowing through the juices so rapidly. 

I am trying to make this my final quit attempt but it is so difficult. I made it a week this time but had a relapse. I am so used to having nicotine as part of my day before/after meals, waking up, going to bed, stress, etc. 

I am using the smoke free app but I really need some encouragement

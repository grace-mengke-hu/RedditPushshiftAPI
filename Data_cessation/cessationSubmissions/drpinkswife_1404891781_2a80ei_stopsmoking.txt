Wow, Nightmares Again!

Fucking nicotine. I dreamt all these awful things were happening, culminating with I picked up a cigarette, lit it and started smoking. When I woke up, it took me a while to not feel like crap. Then I was so relieved that I hadn't actually smoked! The dream was so disturbing, because the action of picking up that cigarette was so automatic and easy, I remember the feeling of it, no thought went into it at all.

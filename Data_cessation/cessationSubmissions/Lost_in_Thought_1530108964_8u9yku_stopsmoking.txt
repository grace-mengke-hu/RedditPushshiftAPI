5+ months in, and I feel I passed some kind of milestone

Last weekend I went to a party. I've got a new girlfriend, and it was a great opportunity to meet a lot of her friends. Turns out a lot of them smoke. So I'm drinking, hanging out on a porch, surrounded by smokers, and I mention that I quit smoking a while back. People are astonished that I can be around so many smokers and yet be so calm! I actually surprised myself at how good I felt about it. So many triggers, smells, and sights that could have roped me back in, and not once did I even feel like taking a puff.

Sometimes I still feel that tug of addiction, but every day it grows weaker and I get stronger. Thank you everyone here for your help.

Five days in. First time ever quitting.

I started smoking at age fourteen. I'm thirty four now and me and my wife have a beautiful seven month old girl. My wife has been trying to get me to quit for a while now but I loved smoking so much for some reason, it was really hard for me to even think about quitting. That is until our daughter was born. I knew I had to stop sooner or later. My doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin and that helped me cut back but I was still smoking five to six packs a week. Last week I caught a gross virus which started as a head cold and turned into a nasty fever and chest cold. I couldn't breathe so bad that I thought I had pneumonia. I saw a doctor and he put me on steroids and antibiotics. At first, I had no problem not smoking because I knew I couldn't enjoy it because I couldn't breathe, although I still had cravings. I am feeling much better now and I still haven't had a cigarette since last Wednesday. The cravings have been  pretty bad but I am shocked that I haven't caved yet. At this point, even though not smoking is kinda depressing at times, I know that if I had a cigarette now I would be way way way more depressed. I can't believe how proud I am of myself. I'm looking forward to breathing and living better and watching my daughter grow up.

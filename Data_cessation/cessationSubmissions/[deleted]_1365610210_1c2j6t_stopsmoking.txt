Need some help

I just need some advice if you can help please, I quit cold turkey a little over two months ago and I felt physicall great for it. The problem is that mentally I didn't feel better, my anxiety and temper got worse and I started to drink more often to cope with that. After realising that it wasn't healthy to drink so much (twice a week, couple glasses wine) I stopped and then after a particularly bad day gave in and had a cigarette. I have now smoked for the past four days. I don't know how to handle how I feel because if I don't smoke I have an urge to drink and If I don't drink I want to smoke.

 How do I get out this cycle? I can't be an emotional mess around my young family and don't understand why quitting cigs has made me this way. Please help as I need to give up permanently

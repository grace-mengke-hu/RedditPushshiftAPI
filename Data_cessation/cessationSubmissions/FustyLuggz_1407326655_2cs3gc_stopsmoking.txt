7 Years Today

Today is the 7th anniversary of my quit date. 

It's actually really strange for me to think that I ever smoked at all. I started at a very young age and it continued through most of my twenties. I always said I'd die with a cigarette in my hand. I loved smoking, I thought it was part of my identity and I was consoled by that but as I got older I liked it less and less. Always worrying about having enough to get me though whatever I was doing, always having to have a lighter, having to step out of social engagements, etc. It's exhausting and obsessive behavior. I decided to quit on August 6th 2007.

I was driving home after work one day shortly after quitting. It was a gorgeous day, I had the windows down and the music up. I realized I could smell the flowers, grass and trees better than I had ever been able to before and I knew I'd never go back.

I don't want to be cliche and sappy. Quitting was hard as shit and I know most of the people here are just starting but sometimes it's nice to be reminded that it is possible and to not give up. One day something will click, don't give up. You are strong. Don't give up.

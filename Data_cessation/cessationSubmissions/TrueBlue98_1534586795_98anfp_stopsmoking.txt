4 days smoke free

Been a smoker since I was about 14, so 6 years, smoked probably about 30 a day and would go through a 50g pouch of bacci in about 3 days, so was spending around £40 a week.

But 4th day smoke free today and I’m so glad I’m free of it, I must admit I’m using a vape to help me out, but fuck it I’d rather be vaping than smoking.

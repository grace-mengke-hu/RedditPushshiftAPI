This is my last attempt. I have to succeed.

Well, I quit for about 20 days, went back on for about 20. This time it stops for good. Last night I burned an almost full pack of cigs to ashes as symbol to myself. I barely have enough money to continue living life right now. My depression has been absolutely destroying my will to persist. Physically, mentally, and emotionally just spent. I can hardly even look at my school work. This is the only thing I'm holding on to, in hope that in a few weeks I might actually enjoy running around outside. I know I'll feel better when I stay off them, but right now, this feels like rock bottom. So, here we go.

Feelings after 1 week

Hi guys. I'm now for the first time in many years completely nicotine free for 1 week! It's been a rough ride, but I'm still going strong.

It feels like I'm still very attached to that habit. I read the Allen Carr book and it did make it easier in the start, but I'm now finding myself craving for that cigarette after meal and after sex. Bus stops are especially bad when there's nothing to do. My mind is always conjuring up millions of excuses to start smoking again. 

Today was especially rough when I found an old Pall Mall pack from my drawer in the morning. It almost ruined my day as the craving was so bad. I'm going to a lan party this weekend and I'm worried that I'm going to cave. We generally smoke like chimneys in there and it's going to suck to be the only one who doesn't smoke.

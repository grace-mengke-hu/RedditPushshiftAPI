Effects on body after quitting?

I've googled this and got varying answers but for the most part they're consistent. To those who have quit, can you give a timeline of your personal experience after the first few days/weeks/months.

I'm at my 3rd day and using patches. I've succeeded before (for 3 years) and am hoping this time will be for good. Will using patches have different recovery effects? I don't remember too well the last time I quit so can you give me an idea of what I can expect? I still have some shortness of breath and the occasional tingling sensation in my extremities.

Just finishing day 1.

My son asked me to quit.  He's almost 7 years old.  No medicine, no program, cold turkey.  So, my plan is to immerse myself in woodworking (making shaving brushes), and maybe playing with the brand new puppy.  My wife and I just finished day 1.  Not too bad, but I also have a cold and can't hardly breathe.  I think the cold is actually helping.  Just wanted to share.  I don't know...bored I suppose.

Does anyone else who's tried to quit find it easier to cut down in the spring/early summer, but then too easy to smoke come midsummer?

I've been wanting to quit for at least 4 years. I always find it easiest to cut down in spring or early summer, so I've tried to time my attempts around then. This year I made it further than any year before! But two weeks ago I just started smoking hardcore again.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any thoughts as to why?

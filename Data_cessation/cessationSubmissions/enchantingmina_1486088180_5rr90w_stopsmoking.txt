the lies you tell yourself

I'll only smoke while at work. Only two a day. Not on my days off. One pack a week max. Just one. 

Seriously it's all crap. I stopped for two weeks, had one. Bought a pack, smoked only at work. Bought another pack. Just the last of this pack. Just borrow one off someone at work. Eugh.

The headaches, the sore throat, the smell, the cost. It's not worth it at all. 

It's horrible. 
Back to square one all over again.

Day 16 and hitting an emotional wall

The first two weeks were a serious roller coaster. But these last 2 days have been intense too, but in a different way. I've been so so sad. My motivation is for shit, in fact I left work early because I felt so overwhelmed with sadness.

Someone mentioned that Kaiser (my hmo) usually prescribes antidepressants to people who are quitting smoking. Does anyone have any info on the benefit/efficacy of this practice?

I relapsed today.

At a 4th of July party, I got drunk and asked my mother for a cigarillo. I am going through a tough time and thought it would be okay. Now I feel very bad and I don't want to relapse. I really, *really* don't want to relapse.

Please help me keep myself from starting this awful habit again. I want advice.

Quit smoking for eight months. Was back for a month, day 4 smoke free again

Just FYI, my badge isn't off because I tried and it never came off.

Someone offered me a cigarette and I was getting nostalgic. But after a month I realized I didnt have the money to do it. It took me about 3 attempts of throwing it all away in a week and here I am day 4.

I have to admit though, not having smoked for very long was a lot easier to quit. I smoked for five years before the first time and there were some obvious effects. My eyes dilated and I literally felt like I was gonna die. This time was quite easier. It was still hard and frustrating, but it wasn't as serious a habbit.

My trigger was definitely being at home. I threw away all my stuff on sunday night instead, because as soon as saturday came along before, I didn't make it very long.

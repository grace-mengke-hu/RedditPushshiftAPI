I think I'm cured of craving while driving.

Just drove 1100km over the last two days and barely had any cravings at all. Even when approaching traffic jams I kept my cool. 

I won't be around much for the week but I still need ya so I'll be back after vacay. Oh and u/drpinkswife the Kate Spade outlet was a total let down :(

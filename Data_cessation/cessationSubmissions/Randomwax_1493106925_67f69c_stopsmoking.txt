I made it to one week ~ Still feel crap though!

Hey guys, 
I officially hit one week. 

I do feel like I'm cheating, as I'm still vaping / one patch. 

I'm a bit worried as my mood is so flat, I couldn't face much today and went and hid in bed! And now I'm having anxiety attacks again when I go out!!!

Is this normal?
I smoked for 20 years / 30 a day.

Thanks

It's day 100 for me.

Quitting smoking is the most important decision I have ever made.

If you want to know the truth, I really just came here for a hug.
My friends are all smokers who have never once given a shit about my decision to quit, causing me to doubt our friendship is legit.

Today is a victory enough on its own, but a little thumbs up or what have you would really take this thing the extra mile.

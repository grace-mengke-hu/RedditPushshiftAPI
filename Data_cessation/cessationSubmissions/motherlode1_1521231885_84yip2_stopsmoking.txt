20 days smoke free. This battle is one of the hardest I have fought

Since I quit, I have experienced serious mental changes. I have become severely anxious and fixated on my breathing (constantly convinced I am short of breath), I cry randomly for no particular reason or sometimes I just end up thinking about negative stuff (it passes). I have lost my appetite completely and cant bring myself to eat. Sometimes I force myself but it's hard

Been talking to my dad who is a doctor and he basically said that these side effects can take up-to 6 weeks to disappear and that I will have to take it one day at a time. There is no speeding this process up. On top of that I have post nasal drip so my throat needs constant clearing. 

The anxiousness and the depression have made this fight so much harder than it needs to be. I haven't thought about smoking since I quit but the side effects are making my life a misery.

I have no choice but to keep fighting and hope that a few weeks from now I am better.

Quitting in 2 weeks!

Hi!  I just got off the phone with the Quit4Life people, and I want to make my intention public.  I will be quitting smoking on 10/26/15.

I've been smoking on and off for about 20 years, and now is the time!  Patches will be on their way to me soon, and I'm going to stop smoking during my commute starting today.

My husband is not quitting yet, and I could use some suggestions on how to feel better about not going out for smokes breaks with him during map changes on video games.  So far I've come up with stretching, getting a glass of water, and rewarding myself with a mini candy bar (bad, I know)  as diversionary tactics.  Any other good ideas?

Thanks for being here.

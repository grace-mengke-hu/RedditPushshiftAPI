Stopped smoking but not free from nicotine

This is just a small story to allow me to put my thoughts down and share my experience and perhaps get some advice. So it's been about 4 months without a cigarette. I was a heavy smoker, as well as a heavy cannabis smoker. I have smoked cannabis (with tobacco) on 4 occasions in the past 4 months. I'm ok with this. I have been in many occasions with others smoking cigarettes and have been offered cigarettes and refused without much hesitation. It has been my own choice to smoke cannabis on the 4 occasions. I can say I'm free of the habit of smoking, but I'm still very much addicted to nicotine as I'm using nicotine sweets (Nicotinell), which help a lot. I wouldn't have been able to stop without the nicotine sweets. I'm currently taking anywhere from 4 to 8 sweets a day, and now I'm not comfortable with this. The sweets were a replacement for cigarettes. The cigarettes were a replacement for sucking my thumb (which I did till a late age). So now I need to find a replacement for the nicotine sweets. I'm thinking to continue with the sweets approach but moving to sugar and nicotine free sweets. Does anyone have any advice with regards? How have others got off the nicotine sweets?

One month today

It's one month today... I feel good, proud, strong, and pretty cool about all that. Had my darker hours too. But they're getting less and also weaker.
Whenever they hit me badly, however, I stop over here and read the posts in this community.
Today's the day to say: Many thanks to all those who share their thoughts and insights here. It really helps.
Be strong. Be cool. It feels so bloody good to be strong and cool.

5 Days down. One laps. NRT working well.

Howdy,

Figured I'd share the experience for others who may be in a similar situation, or not.

I have been smoking for 10 years, maybe 1 year worth of quitting attempts throughout that time. But it usually ends the same way, addicted to something else, until I perceive cigarettes as the lesser of two evils again.

This time feels different though, the price is so fucking ridiculous in Australia now, 10 years was always the number of years I told my self I'd stop at and I have a form of nicotine replacement in a vape.

I almost feel like I'm already over it after only 5 days, sure for three days I had pretty nasty cravings which I quenched with food and the vaporiser, some weed helped too. But, two days later, after changing to a walk instead of food? Cravings are kinda rare and weak. 

I also found a stop smoking app, which helps to track the money saved and the health benefits over time, this live information helped me to focus on the benefits of quitting and keeps my mindset positive.

Like the tittle said I had one relapse yesterday, just with a buddy in a social setting. I didn't even want it, and I didn't find it as enjoyable as I used too, I was just curious how it would taste after a few days. I think I'm actually done this time.

Thanks for reading and best of luck to anyone who aspires to quit smoking.

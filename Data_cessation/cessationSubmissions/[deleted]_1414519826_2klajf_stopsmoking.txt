Can only ever make it to mid-Day 2.

Then I calmly resolve  that I "enjoy" smoking, and that it is pleasing to me, and that it gives me "peace of mind", and that life is short to begin with so "why not". 

Day one is always wonderful, though. Resplendently, I reflect at all the good this will do.

Then day two hits, I get all melancholy and cynical. Like, what's the point? Such hedonist. Very over this. 

If only every day was day one. 

I've read the book. I've tried the vapes. I've been through the patches. Fuck the gum. Cold turkey is uninviting...I fear that will be the only method that works. 

It is as if my skinny little white pimp... *is my friend*^who^kills^me^softly,^silently,^slowly. Oooh,^sooo^smooothly.

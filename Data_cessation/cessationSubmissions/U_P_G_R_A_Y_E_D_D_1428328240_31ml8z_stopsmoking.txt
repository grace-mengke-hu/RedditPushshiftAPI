I'm a nonsmoker as of 6:00 am this morning.

I've smoked at least 2 packs of cloves a day for 22 years, read Allen Carr's book over the weekend and quit when I woke up this morning. Showering this morning and knowing I wasn't going to stink of smoke for the rest of my life made me so fucking happy I can't even explain it!

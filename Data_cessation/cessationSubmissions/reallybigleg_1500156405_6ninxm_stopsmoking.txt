You cannot choose to avoid the craving/emotion/stress etc.

You can only choose to:

- Feel it now and wait for it to pass; or

- Defer it until later - but for every time you defer, the craving/emotion/stress intensifies

You can choose to have a cigarette now if you like. It will stop you feeling the way you feel for....oooo, maybe, half an hour? Then you will feel this way again, but it will be worse, because you will have given the nicotine receptors in your brain an appetiser. Or if it's an emotion you're trying to avoid, it will be worse because by using cigarettes instead of actually solving your problems, you let those problems fester.

Or you can choose to feel this craving right now, let it pass, get it out of the way, and over time your cravings will lose their intensity and things will get better.

But what you definitely can't do is choose to avoid cravings, emotions or stress altogether.

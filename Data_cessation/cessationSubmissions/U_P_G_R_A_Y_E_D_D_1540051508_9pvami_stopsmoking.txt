Should i even try right now?

I real Allen Carr's book and when i got to the Timing section i couldn't stop feeling like now isn't the time for me.

In the last eight weeks we closed on our first house,  i got laid off, my wife's favorite uncle passed away,  then her father four weeks later and my patern grandma has been in the hospital too weak to move for the last 14 days. 

I'm already going to therapy but still can't relax or meditate after four sessions and i only made it 16 hours without smoking yesterday but found some cigars and fell off the wagon this morning. Oh, and i have an interview at 1:00 today.

What do you all suggest i do?

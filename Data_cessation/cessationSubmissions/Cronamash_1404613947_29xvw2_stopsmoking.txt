Quit on the way home from work.

I've  considering quitting for a while since my cough has been getting really bad after over a year of smoking. But on my way home from work I realized I could hardly breathe as I was lighting my second cigarette, so I did it. I finally did it! I  threw the cigarette out the window after the first drag and threw the pack away later.
 Combining the nic-fitting with the cold I'm getting over has made the last 24 hours super shitty, but I figure that I'm already burning the candle at both ends working two jobs, I can't afford to be killing myself slowly as well.

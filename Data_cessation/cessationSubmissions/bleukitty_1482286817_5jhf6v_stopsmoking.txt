First night out drinking! No smokes.

Haven't had a cig since last Thursday. Today is the first day I've gone out drinking and I did it - no smoking! Kind of a double whammy for me since my fianc√© is out of town. It's a trigger for me; it's a lot easier to not smoke when he's around. Anyway, just wanted to post! Feeling proud.

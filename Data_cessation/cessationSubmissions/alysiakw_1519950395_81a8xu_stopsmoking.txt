New Challenges

So I'm two months in, and really doing well. Most of my "cravings" are really just idle thoughts, like "Oh yeah, this is a thing I would normally smoke during." But overall, I really thought I had this kicked.

Until last night. My roommate is seeing a new guy, and the guy smokes. After a couple of glasses of wine, it was all I could do to keep from asking him for one. Having them THERE, WITHIN SIGHT, was the biggest trigger I've encountered so far. I didn't ask for one, I was good, but it just showed me that I need to keep my guard up- this habit isn't as kicked as I thought. And the guy is going to continue to be around, so I need to come up with some way to ensure that I'll continue to be good in that situation.

this is worth doing. and we can do it.

I have been down this road a few times. 2013 has been a year that I succumbed to the worst aspects of my nature. Specifically my predilection for beer and cigarettes. This year I turn 40 and it's time to stop fucking around. A healthy lifestyle now is the difference between being self reliant and happy at 85 or a miserable burden at 70 and dead by 75. I have seen both ends of the spectrum. My father, a humorous and interesting man, struck down at 70 with bladder cancer living out the last two years of his life as a shadow of his former self. My mother, who has never smoked, who doesn't ever drink excessively, who exercises every day of her life. At 73, she looks and acts like many women in their 50s. She is active, happy, healthy and whole. It's worth it. Ending our addiction is not just "buying a few more years from the Reaper". It can mean the difference between a good life or living your life without a limb or two (I've seen that), having to drag an  oxygen tank with you everywhere you go (seen that too), losing your ability to function sexually as a man (and this most close to home)

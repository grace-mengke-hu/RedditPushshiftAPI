Keeps getting worse after it gets better

I'm more than two weeks in. At the two week mark, I thought I was through the worst of it: no nicotine in my system and two weeks not partaking in the habit. I had reached a point where I might think "a cigarette would be &lt;i&gt;nice&lt;/i&gt; but I can deal with this craving," and I would be able to distract myself, move on. Whatever.

Well, I was on a road trip then and now that I'm back home and back to my old routine I can barely take my mind off of them. Went to a movie yesterday evening to take my mind off of it. Today is a nice day and it's hard to resist going outside and alleviating my boredom with a smoke. 

It's hard to keep all the benefits in mind. I miss my habit! It feels like part of my identity and I miss having that way of passing the time. I wish the burning in my throat--the feeling of smoke going deeper through me than any breath can go. 

I can remain strong. I even know that  at two weeks smoke free the taste of a cigarette would be disgusting and that smoking would give me a headrush. I just wish I knew when it gets easier. When does my mind stop telling me I need one? If it's "never," then is it really worth it?

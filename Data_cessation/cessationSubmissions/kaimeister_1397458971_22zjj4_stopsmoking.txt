what happens when the stress comes back?

Haven't smoked for 7 days after 18 years of smoking. And it went surprisingly well. But I have been sick with bronchitis and I am wondering, how bad will it get once I am better and am stressed again every day? Can I get a long enough head-start or will it start haunting me once I am exposed to it again?

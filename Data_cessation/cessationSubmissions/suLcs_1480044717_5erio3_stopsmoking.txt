Is the act of smoking a habit?

I am 24 years old and I have smoked for 1 year. I have been smoke free for about 2 weeks now.

I get relentless urges to go buy cigarettes but I always find a way to stop myself.

Is it possible to be addicted to the act of smoking itself instead of the drug?

Or am I indeed craving the drug, not just the act of smoking?

hmmm

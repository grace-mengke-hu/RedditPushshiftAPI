A list to make things more clear

I’ll be joining you guys today in improving my life.

Had some thought about it and made this handy list to put things in perspective about smoking.

Cons:
- Increase chance for lung cancer (wanna cough up blood and pay an average of $40,000 for treatment?)
- Increase chance of heart disease (1 in every 4 deaths in the US)
- Gum and tooth decay
- You look years older by smoking long term
- 2nd hand smoke to others
- Have you seen what smokers lungs look like?!
- $174 a day or $2,000 a year for a pack a day smoker
- Also more money spent on lighters, (can you really keep track of those dang things?)
- Even more than money, the time you waste smoking. 10 cigarettes a day, and in a month you’ve wasted an entire 24 hours killing yourself
- You smell, your car smells, and your house smells. BAD
- You’re an irritable asshole if you don’t smoke every other hour.
- You’re contributing the most polluted substance on earth.
- Who wants to kiss an ashtray?
- You just feel like crap, no energy, stairs are a bitch, and that awful cough. Chemicals take one hell of a toll on your body.
- You’re a slave to big tobacco, they know it and love it.

Pros:
- You get nicotine, and feel normal for a few minutes.



One last piece is that even though tobacco is legal and doesn’t have any wildly psychological effects or inebriates your judgement, you’re still an addict. That’s the one that got it for me, thinking I’m powerless to a highly addictive substance.

Best luck y’all. I’m a non-smoker now.

Trying to quit. Help!

Hey so i'm 19 and I've been smoking full time maybe 3 years or 4 if you include hard core social smoking, but i don't know is that important? 

So basically I started smoking in high school and I realised i really fucking liked it. I guess i'm having trouble to just stop. I've told myself for about 3 months now that i'd quit but i keep on buying more, and it's ridiculously expensive where I live too, so that doesn't help either but meh. I keep telling myself i'm not physically addicted to nicotine cause I can go 10/12 hours without smoking, and that i'm addicted to the idea of it - is that wrong? I just really need some ideas on how to really quit. Cause everyone says you might get cancer - but i'm 19 and mortality just doesn't really sink in that much. Also I bought an e-cigarette but it kind of just makes me want a real one more. I need to know how to stop associating everything I do with smoking - cause i l can smoke 24/7 if given the opportunity.

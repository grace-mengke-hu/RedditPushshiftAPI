Whats wrong

Five days ago I stop smoking.   Just out of the blue.  I was up very late and smokrd my last cig at about 3 am.  I was to lazy to go out anf buy more.  My thoughts turned to quitting and just thought to myself "why do i smoke, many people dont and there is nothing wrong with them so why do i"  and thats when i quit.  The title os whats wrong because im not craving not moody just not a smoker.  Also whats wrong poses a question for all the smokers and newbie quitters (like myself)  whats wrong with not smokeing?  Sorry for ranting just needed to type something out

I try my very best to avoid alerting the cheer squad before I'm sure. Fucking rise up, erryone.

Fuck it. Why? You've seen it before. A shitty twist seen too often, I have asthma. I used to run cross country, sing like my father... I played ultimate Frisbee. I sang my soul out. And for 12 years,i tried to destroy all that.

I haven't smoked for 72 hours. Please send positive thoughts my way. I've been cooking for 4 hours to distract me!

Thank you for this sub.

Edit: Wow. That comes across crass as fuck. Sorry? My brain is in a strange place right now...

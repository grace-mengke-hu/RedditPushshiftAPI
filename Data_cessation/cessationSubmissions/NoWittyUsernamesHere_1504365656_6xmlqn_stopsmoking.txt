Congestion starting now???

Howdy, ya buncha quitters!  I'm almost 2 weeks in, and the last couple of days I've suddenly found myself congested and phleghmy like when I was smoking.  Is this normal?  I'm getting really frustrated with all the negative short term effects of quitting.  Still committed to it, but is anyone else finding that the insomnia, mood swings, and physical effects demotivating?

Any quitters out there who love marijuana?

It's been one day without cigarettes. I have been able to live with the cravings, but I really want to smoke marijuana after work today (I live in a legal state). I'm afraid that I won't be able to resist the temptation to "spliff" a bowl. Are there any quitters out there who also like to get high? How do you justify it? I've heard that smoking marijuana is far less harmful than tobacco but smoking is still smoking...right? Someone please give me advice. 

Edit: got high as fuck, pure nug bowls. Fuck spliffs, that cookie tasted so nice just on its own

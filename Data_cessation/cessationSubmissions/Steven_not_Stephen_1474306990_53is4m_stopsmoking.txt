I found my self actually planning to smoke next month

My live-in GF (non-smoker) told me yesterday that she was going out of town for the weekend later next month. My brain went haywire and I had tons of thoughts racing through my head, thinking about how easy it's going to be to smoke. I was actually feeling excited about being able to smoke as much as I want for two whole days without getting caught or getting into any trouble for it! I don't know why my mind went there. I've had to consciously tell my self that I will not be smoking that weekend. By that time, I will be roughly 90 days smoke free and I don't want to throw it all away and start over again just because I wouldn't have any consequences for it. It's just strange how my head jumped straight into craving mode at the thought of potentially being able to smoke again. It's gonna be a real test when she goes away that weekend.

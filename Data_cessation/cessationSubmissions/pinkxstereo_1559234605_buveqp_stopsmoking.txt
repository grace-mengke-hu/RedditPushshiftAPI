Day one &amp; looking for tips

I have attempted to quit many times. Ending in me quitting quitting. I have been smoking for over a decade now (27) and realized my old ways of coping no longer serve me. I am noticing the effects of it, in a negative way with loss of breath, among other things. Now that I have stopped drinking for over a year and a half, I am ready to take on (for the millionth time) quitting cigarettes. Every time I attempt to quit, I am getting that much closer to actually quitting for good (which will be this time). I have been watching YouTubers, I have been writing and making lists of why I am quitting, and have substitutions for smoking such as rubbing a really great essential oil on my skin. I think I am finally ready to become a non-smoker! Any tips and tricks? Thanks!

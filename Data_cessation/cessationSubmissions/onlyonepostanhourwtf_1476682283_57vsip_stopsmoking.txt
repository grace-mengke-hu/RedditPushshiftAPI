2 weeks.

This is the longest I've gone without smoking cigarettes in years. Been having pains and signs from my body I've never felt before. It's as though my body is healing and at the same time telling me since I'm not poisoning myself anymore with cigarettes, I better start working out too and eating healthy.



My teeth seem whiter already. I'm not worried about how I smell or how my breath smells anymore. Not hesitant to smile anymore. I feel hungrier than ever before. My appetite is bigger.

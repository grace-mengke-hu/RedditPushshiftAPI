Time is the coin of your life.

Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.
~ Carl Sandburg

Substitute "Cigarettes" for "other people".  In time wasted sneaking away to smoke, and time taken off of the end of your life, and time taken off of the "quality" years of your life.

Such a stupid waste of the only true currency in this world...

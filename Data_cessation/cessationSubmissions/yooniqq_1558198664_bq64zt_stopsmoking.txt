I smoked pretty heavily during my last two academic semesters and am feeling the consequences.

So I feel like a little context is needed to explain my situation. When I was in high school, I used to juul all the time and thought headrushes were the sickest things. And then college rolled around and that just opened up a whole new world. One of my roommates, who owned a bong suggested that I smoke a bowl of tobacco and weed describing how awesome the feeling would be. That led to me smoking pretty much daily for the better part of two academic semesters. So currently, I am sitting in my bed aching for nicotine, feeling nauseous, depressed, and having major problems eating. I feel that it’s important to mention that I had not been maintaining a healthy and consistent diet while in college which might be why this is happening. Even when it’s my favorite food, i can’t eat that much of it. It gets to a point where eating more of it just makes me feel sick.

As someone who isn’t that educated about nicotine, I have a lot of questions. how long do these feelings usually last? Should I keep juuling to make myself feel a little better or is it better to go cold turkey? Is it better to force myself to eat and just gobble it down? Please help

Stopped cigs but not weed

Hey guys so 13 days ago I stopped smoking cigs cold turkey and since then I've been smoking weed every day, when I'm sober I feel the foggy head and anxiety from cigs so basically I've been high all the time for the past 13 days has anyone else been through this before? I just wanna know how long it'll last and sorry if I'm not posting at the right place guys I'm still new here thanks!.

Ex was a smoker. Now that he's out of my life, I want to throw away this bad habit too.

I wasn't a regular smoker when I met my ex. A pack would last me a month or I just end up throwing them away. But the ex is a pack a day smoker so soon after he moved in, my smoking habit ramped up. It was our bonding time - smoking out on the porch while talking about our day, etc. I was with him for about 5 years and it ended horribly a year ago.  

A year after, I realizing now that smoking is the only thing from my old life with my ex. That got me started on this whole idea of quitting. I guess in my mind, quitting cigs is like the last vestige of his hold on me.

I'm thinking of quitting this weekend and having anxiety/worries and mixed feelings. But I'm determined. What's the one great advice you got when you started on this quitting journey?

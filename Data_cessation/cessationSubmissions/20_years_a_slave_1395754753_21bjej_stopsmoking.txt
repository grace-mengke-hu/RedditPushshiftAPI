90 days woot!

The past 90 days have been the best days of my life. You can do it too!

EDIT: ok, I don't want to set expectations too high, you might quit and have a horrible 90 days, and then use that as an excuse to start smoking again, and that would be bad. 

Life has been good since I quit:

* less fear for my health
* less existential angst
* less money wasted
* more hope for future
* more self-respect
* more exercise
* more time with my family (less time smoking & finding excuses to smoke)

So these are all good things, and they are a direct outcome of having quit smoking 3 months ago, and they all make me very happy. Life may yet take a bad turn, and smoking would not make that any better.

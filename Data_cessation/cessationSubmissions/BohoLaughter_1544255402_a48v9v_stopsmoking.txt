How awful, this is the worst addiction of all!

Not real happy about that.  

Soaring high after giving up alcohol 12 months ago, not to mention other addictions.  It was obviously time to let smoking go.  Two months into it and it's still a friggin' fight EVERY day.  This is a terrible revelation and has aggravated my other sleeping addictions.  

How bloody awful and tiring.  Damn you ciggies!

Another dragon to slay.  Oh well here I come.

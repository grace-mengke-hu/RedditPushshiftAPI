Quitting Soon

People say you'll quit when you're ready. Makes it a little easier, like there's a time meant for me. And I think its coming up. I've been trying to smoke less and I've been doing alright at it. I know I need to keep subtracting them, though. Does anyone have any advice for taking the next step?

Today -- I stop smoking

I have a habit of quitting and restarting smoking.  As in, I''ll buy a pack just to have a few.  Then I get disgusted with myself -- rinse, wash, repeat. 

So, for the remainder of today, I will not smoke.  Who is with me?  I'm a "closet" smoker, so I need some accountability.  Hope I can get it here.

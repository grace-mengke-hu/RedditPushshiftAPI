365 days and counting.

365 days ago was my last drag, I didn't romanticize quitting at all and I think that's what finally pushed me past ever wanting to smoke again. Each time before, I would say "Okay, this is the last one" or "This weekend is the last weekend I'm smoking" and I always went back. My last full cigarette wasn't 365 days ago it was actually 375 days ago, so I had quit for 10 days when I asked for a drag of my friend's cigarette. I inhaled one drag and it felt bad, tasted gross and I knew I was done forever.

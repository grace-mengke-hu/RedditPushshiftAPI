Constantly keep dreaming about smoking. Does this happen to anybody else?

Trying my best to quit it this time and I am doing good as well. But I keep on dreaming about smoking it. Last night I was walking on this random street and found a pack of cig. The pack had only one cigarette left which was half smoked / burnt. I lighted it up and smoked. I felt so guilty in the dream itself. When I woke up and realized it was a dream, damn it felt awesome. I am so not smoking no matter what.
So, has this happened to anyone else?

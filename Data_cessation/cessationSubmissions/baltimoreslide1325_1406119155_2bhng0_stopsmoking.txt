3 days & 5 hours. Still in the game!

Here goes day 4. Mornings are already easier--not just easier, they're even nice now. Wha?! This is amazing, because the coffee & cigarettes thing in the morning was a solid aspect of my life for 10 years. 
I'm enjoying the morning today without cravings, and without post-smoking fatigue setting back my morning activities like it used to.  
  
This worked: I've been doing the same things in the same order every morning since I quit. I wrote out what I'd do on waking and am just going through them each day until they become automatic like smoking once was.  
  
And the insomnia is getting better too--although I was out like a light at 8 pm last night, so maybe I'm swinging back the other way.
:D :D :D  
  
How's everyone else faring this morning?

Week 4 and cravings are hitting me hard all of a sudden...

So as the topic says I'm going on week 4 (day 22) and I have been hit with anxiety/depressed mood and major cravings these last few days. 
The week before this was OK in my book and I thought I had the worst behind me... but I guess not!?!?

Anybody with similar experiences?

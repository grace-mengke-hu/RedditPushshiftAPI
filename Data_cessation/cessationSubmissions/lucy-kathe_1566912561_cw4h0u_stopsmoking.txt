why do so many people seem to look down their nose at patch users here?

I've been on the patch for 4 days now and been doing really well, using it in conjunction with smoke free and one of my missions was to read through some posts here and i've got to say i found it more discouraging than motivating, like i'm ecstatic that so many of you have been successful going cold turkey using just the app or just allen carrs book, and i know not everyone is like this (im also not super duper familiar with this particular subreddit so idk if im opening myself up to a ton of hate here or not) but i've been looking at the posts people have made for patches and the amount of comments saying 'just throw them in the bin' or 'toughen up for a couple of days and go cold turkey' or just saying straight up that using patches is the 'wrong' way to stop smoking, im certainly glad i decided not to make a post here when i started using the patch cause those comments would've had me smoking again in about 5 seconds, there is no right or wrong way to quit, if patches work for you, use them. if gum works for you use it; if going cold turkey works for you, good for you, keep at it but why sit there and try to discourage people that've been smoke free for 3, 5, 10, 30 days by saying 'it'll never work, just read this magic book and grow a pair' (obviously not a direct quote but it might as well be)

sorry i had to have a bit of a rant there, i know the majority of people here are supportive, it just really got me down when i looked for support and mostly found discouraging comments

Today is the day.

Smoking takes up such a huge amount of time out of my life.  It causes me to be less productive at work and in life in general, I'm sitting here smoking the last smoke in my pack, and this is it.  I'm done.  Also, smoking is almost the only thing I spend money on, I could actually have a savings and go on vacation(s) sometimes.  So this is it, my last one, as of 11 am today, I am no longer a smoker.

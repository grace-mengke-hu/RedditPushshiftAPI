A week

It's officially been a full week (did I put the wrong date for my badge?).

I had a pretty bad craving earlier. But my husband, cloaked in the lingering odor of the one he just had, reminded me that last week I had said how fed up and miserable I felt all the time.

What a wonderful guy.

I hope I can help him too in a couple weeks.

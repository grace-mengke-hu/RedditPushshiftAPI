Day #3

Woot Woot! Excited for today but scared at the same time. Day 3 for me. Had some cravings yesterday. That little devil voice showed up saying:" Just go to a gas station and get a pack! What is the big deal!? You can start again on Monday!" NO! I am done! Just have to keep reminding myself that these cravings last only 10 minutes and then they are gone. 

Woke up this morning and I can take deep breaths!!! Feels soooo good! I didn't cough. Just feels like I can take deep breaths without coughing. 

This weekend will be a test. My GF is coming over. I told her that I need her support with this. She hates me smoking. I have to stay active this weekend and not fold! Biggest trigger for me is alcohol. I will have to stay away from it this weekend.

I am a little scared because I have a bday party to go to. It's my friend's 40th. I am dreading it. If I go, it will be really hard since few people that will be there, smoke. I have to think about how to approach this thing. 

At any rate. Day 3 is today! Good luck to all of you! Keep is going!

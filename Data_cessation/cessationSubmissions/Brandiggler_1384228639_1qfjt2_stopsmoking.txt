Here goes another attempt.

This is my umpteenth time trying to quit. I just got in to work and I want to end this day without having a smoke and continue forward. I've got a Stephen King book, a lunch and no reason to go outside on my break now. There's a lot of inspiration around here in these posts, gonna use that and hopefully kick the habit completely. Wish me luck and the best of it to you all.

I quit this time around for (I think) a weird reason.

So, I'm currently on day 6, attempt number 2 (in ~10 years) of smoking, and this time it's kind of a dumb reason. I'm taking champix, and it's really helping by the way.

So my grandfather died of cancer, didn't stop me. Mother got breast cancer, actually started me off again last time I quit. SO's uncle got cancer, didn't stop me. Been guilted, bribed, supported by everyone in my family/friend circle, didn't stop me.

You know what stopped me this time? My middle finger of my left hand, right where I held my rollups, went yellow.

Cancer sucks, but it's invisible. Smells aren't great, but they make aftershave and deodorant and antiperspirant for that. My SO doesn't like me smoking, but they aren't her lungs.

But fuck me, that little yellow patch. All I saw was a slippery slope to being that old guy coughing his lungs up every morning over breakfast. Standing out in the cold at 60 (maybe) years old to smoke a cigarette with my coffee. Pushing people away and foregoing other expenses just to buy smokes when I'm low on cash.

Fuck that, man. I don't wanna be that guy. Currently on day 6, reading posts from you guys is helping. Fuck the little voice trying to kill me. Fuck that little yellow patch.

How are you guys doing, anyone else just starting out?

The worst part about relapsing

Is having to buy a WHOLE pack. Unless you have a friend who shares or the guy at the gas station is willing to slip you a single for fifty cents. Craving one cigarette, and then being stuck with twenty of them, is the easiest way to fall back into the habit. And for me, it only takes a few puffs of that relapse cig to realize I didn’t even want it. 

I remember friends who were trying to quit while I still smoked, who would ask me for a single cigarette so they didn’t have to buy a pack. And I would always give it to them, because I didn’t want them to go and buy a whole pack and then feel like they have to commit to all 20 of those death sticks.

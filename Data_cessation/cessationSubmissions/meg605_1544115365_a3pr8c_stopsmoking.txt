How Can I Help Him?

Hello redditors! I'm looking for some advice for how to help my fiance quit smoking cigarettes.

We've been together for 8 years and he smokes about half a pack a day (although that's just what he tells me, so it might be more). He quit for a few months back in 2014 but picked it up again at some point. It's a point of contention for us so he doesn't talk about it much. If I ask him about it he just shuts down because he feels like I'm just getting mad at him for the sake of it. We're both losing weight for our wedding (down almost 50 lbs collectively) so I'm thinking I can use that as a starting point for a healthier overall lifestyle. 

I don't want to be that nagging spouse and I know stress will only drive him to smoke more. But, I'm not ok with getting married and having kids and them learning from this behavior.  What are some effective ways your family members or loved ones have helped you quit? Also, what do they do to hinder your progress?

I've had asthma since I was a baby so any smoke (even a campfire) will bother me, so I've never had the urge and just can't relate.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and good luck to all of you with your journey to a healthier life! You can do it!

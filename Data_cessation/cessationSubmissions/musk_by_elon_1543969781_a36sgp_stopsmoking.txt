After countless tries of getting off NRT I feel like tapering with vape long term is my only solution.

Stuff like gum, lozenges, nic pouches, and pod vapes have just made my addiction to nicotine worse. There are no local vape shops just gas stations with strong pod vapes so im thinking of making the long drive and finally ending my nic addiction or at the very least reducing through tapering with juice.

Transitioning off the patch this coming Monday..any advice?

I haven't smoked over the last 7 weeks due to my use of the Nicoderm CQ patches. I'm on the last step, and honestly don't feel the need to smoke anymore. 

The patch program ends on Sunday, and I will be nicotine free starting Monday. Other than gum, or lollipops, any advice on what to do for those nicotine cravings that might arise? Have any of you tried the patch, and notice a significant withdrawal effect after the last step?

To all those who quit - keep it up! To all those thinking about it - it takes time and will be the best decision you've ever made! Took me nearly 20 attempts over 6 years before I made it this far.

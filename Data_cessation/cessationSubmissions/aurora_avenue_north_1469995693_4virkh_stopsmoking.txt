Nicotine Patch Dreams

Little more/little less than a pack a day for 25 years.  Got my wisdom teeth out (didn't as a teen) last Friday & had my last cigarette 5m before the surgery (which went pretty well).  So 9 days in.  Have never even tried to quit before & knew this would be one of the few things, short of getting pregnant, that might just work.  I hesitate to be too confident, but I think this might be working.  With the help of this patch.

The box says one might have vivid dreams on the patch.  Yeah, indeed.  I have about 2 to 3 colourful & memorable dreams that are completely & utterly annoying af.  Things like my bedroom (just my bedroom) getting burgled, making a coworker am fond of angry, even starting smoking again (while riding a bike, which I never do).  They're not nightmares, just super irritating.  & this patch is doing wonders, so I really don't want to take it off, even at night.

But for someone who might be asking the internet about their dreams while on the patch-- yeah, this is a thing.  Would be curious if this is/was a thing for anyone else too.

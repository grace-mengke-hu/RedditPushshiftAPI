Day 72 and ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!

Holy crap. I still can't believe it really. I was a pack a day for 20 years. Quit 72 days ago and it has been tough but so good! I feel better than I ever have. I saved a thousand dollars! In 72 days a thousand dollars!
For those of you just starting or thinking about quitting just do it!

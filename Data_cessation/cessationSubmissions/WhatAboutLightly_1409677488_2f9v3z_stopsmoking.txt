Caved after 3 days

Was going strong for three days, but I was traveling and in an unusual environment, so I had none of my normal cues.  Seemed so easy.  Then my flight home gets rerouted due to a storm, and I find myself thinking about cigarettes for 3 fucking hours in the buffalo airport, getting stupidly angry at petty rude shit the other passengers are doing.   Land at home, beeline to the gas station, now I'm typing this out while having a smoke at work.

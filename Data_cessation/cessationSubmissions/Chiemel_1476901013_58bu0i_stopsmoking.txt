Even though life has been a pain in the ass...

I'm still 100% smoke free, 41 days in. After a hell of a stressfull time at work I handed in my resignation today, and it finally starts to feel like things will get better from here on out! I'm just happy it wasn't even an option to pick up smoking again!

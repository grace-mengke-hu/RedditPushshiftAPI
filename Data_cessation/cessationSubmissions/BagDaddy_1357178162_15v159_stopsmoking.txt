3 days in, played a full soccer match today, it all hurts but it was worth it, help me keep this up 

I've been a smoker since I as 16, in the last 26 years I once managed to quit it for 2 years. That was about 6 years back. I'm ready for another big final push to end this for good. I'm now pre-hypertensive and my kids hate the smell on me and they desperately want me to quit. I'm so glad this subreddit exists

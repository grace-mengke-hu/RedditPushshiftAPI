Can you recommend a STRONG, long-lasting mint to use once I get off the Nicorette mini lozenges? (Not Altoids.)

The thing is, I really specifically love these Nicorette mini lozenges (not the big ones, and not any store brand). Maybe it's the nicotine talking, but I think they're delicious and very intense and I can't find regular candy mints that do the job. Altoids are no goodâ€”they aren't strong enough and crumble/dissolve too quickly. Tic Tacs no good either. Certs, etc., no good. 

Any help? I need a strong, long-lasting mint. I'm hooked.

NOTE: I really don't mean to flog this product by name, but my problem is that these exact things are really addictive and I need to stop eating them soon.

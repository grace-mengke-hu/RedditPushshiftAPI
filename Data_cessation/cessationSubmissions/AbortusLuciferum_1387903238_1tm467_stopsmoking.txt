Hey, it's been a month!

I started smoking due to peer pressure back in 2009, and I always knew I was going to quit, and then a month and one week back I suddenly decided to quit. I had tried multiple times before, but always caved back in on the first weekend. I don't know what's different this time, but I know I'm an ex smoker now (I find that labeling myself "ex smoker" instead of "non smoker" helps a lot). Frankly it feels nice to be one month in this quitting business as I see friends making plans to quit in 2014. I'm glad I didn't wait.

One thing I want to say though, I that some of you say that the cravings are something that stay with you, and though, yes, I sometimes get cravings, I don't think they're the same cravings I was having 3 days into quitting. They're more like the cravings I had 3 days before taking up smoking, if that makes sense. It's like I don't need it, but I kinda want to try it, just like I did when I was 16, but I'm not 16 anymore and I know that smoking would be silly and might get me hooked again, and so all I need to do is keep some healthy hindsight and I'll never smoke again.

Cheers! For clean lungs!

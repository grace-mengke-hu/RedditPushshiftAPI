How to quit smoking?

Anyone who can share your experience on how you quit smoking? I stopped for a like a month and have been resuming it here and there now. Comparing the quantity, I smoked like 5-10 per day. And now restricted to like 1 fag for a week. But still, if there was a party I am smoking like 10 or more cigarrets per day. This happened yesterday and now I regret for smoking. So can anyone help me out in this issue?

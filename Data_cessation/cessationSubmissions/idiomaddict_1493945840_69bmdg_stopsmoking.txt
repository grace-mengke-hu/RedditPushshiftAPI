I fucked up

I have been almost 3.5 years without smoking, but I was drunk tonight and smoked a clove that we've had in the household the whole time. I'm pretty disgusted with myself and my fingers smell like cigarettes. I don't want to slip into smoking again. Any ideas for people who have been quit for a long time?

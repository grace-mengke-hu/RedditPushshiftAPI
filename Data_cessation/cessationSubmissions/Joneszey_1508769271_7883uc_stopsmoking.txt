The Fantasy of My Quit and How to Stay Addicted

 There are many paths to quitting, you only need one. The superior method is the one that leads you out. On the way are roadside signs, billboards, banners and detours

* depressed &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* anxiety &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* weight gain &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* constipated &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* acne &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* chest pain &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* coughing/ short of breath &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* arm pain/leg pain/toe pain &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* dandruff &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* stomach ache, constipation &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke
* sore gums &gt;&gt;&gt; smoke

Let me say without any hesitation, there is no instance where the medical community or experts in those fields, treats any of those with smoking. It is not on the short or long list of treatments for those things and this is in the age of steroids to build muscle and enhance performance. Nicotine is not a secret treatment known only to addicts.

"But not smoking makes some of those things worse". That is because you ever smoked at all. Levels of dopamine and serotonin manage the moods of human beings. Nicotine alters those levels, diminishing them or causing them to abnormally surge in response to the presence or absence of nicotine, heroin or name your addiction poison.

With belief in one or all of the above, some of us also believe that smoking makes us smart or not smoking makes us less smart. If the ridiculousness of some of the above is any indication, then certainly one could make a better argument that use makes us stupid. The truth though is that nicotine use has made us addicts, no matter how much we hate the word.  Whenever you find yourself falling into that hole of irreverent fantastical beliefs regarding your use of nicotine, paint whatever picture you have of an addict and look in the mirror. Addiction of all types colors how you see and interact with your world. 

Addiction offers you nothing, it is not helpful in any way. It is full of empty promises that depend on use to feed us more of feel good empty fantasies just to be normal for a few minutes. The emptiness, the void, that quitters talk about is a mirror of this but words hardly define it, we feel the pain of it- because we ever smoked.

When we talk about freedom, we are talking about ridding your brain of the virus of addiction that infiltrates and is associated with every action and feeling you do and experience everyday. We are talking about reclaiming how your body is supposed to work and what is reasonable to believe. Caring about life and death without compromise to something that offers you nothing.

I encourage you, that each time you feel the ebb and flow of your cravings to pull them closer to you, allow yourself to feel it as it courses through your body and embrace it, really, but not in desperation, embrace it in celebration. You will see, as I did, it's nothing more than a paper tiger I spent so much time running from and fearing. When you do that and see it celebrate every time and feel happy even in misery. Everything you might feel is the light in the tunnel. It signals you are on your way out. Don't stay to watch the movie while the theater burns.

Congratulations Us!

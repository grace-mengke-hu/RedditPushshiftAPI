Day 4...and I want to cry

Day one and two were a breeze.  I had smoked so much on Sunday that I had what I called "burned my lungs out"  Day 3, ok so I started craving, but not bad.  I worked out, ate popsicles and pickles to curve my cravings...I am on edge, and snippy, sadly I don't realize it until after I snap a few times during the day.  Day 4...I hardly slept last night.  Started coughing in my sleep.  Sore throat, feeling like I want to cry and give up.  On the drive to work I was so tempted to stop at the gas station and buy a pack and a lighter.  This is the longest I have quit.  Sadly I really enjoyed smoking, especially with my morning coffee or a good beer.  I started when I was 26 years old.  I am now 34, I want to do this for my kids, and for my health, I want to run.  I feel like this is a really bad break up, this is worse than my divorce.  Day by day right?

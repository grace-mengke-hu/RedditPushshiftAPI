40 days in, just want to share my experience

It's been awhile, and I got all the benefits like the ability to breathe, better mood and etc. But perhaps the most astounding benefit of all, is the change of mindset. Especially teens who are smoking right now, most of you don't realise how much smoking affects your judgements, and this is especially crucial for you because most of your life choices are made in your teens.

Because of smoking, I became a lazy bastard with no direction in life, thinking that as long as I'm happy, I'm fine with anything, but then I also notice I need funds to continue smoking, so I picked up studying a diploma that allows me to make relatively high amount of money in the future, which was completely different from what I wanted before I turned into a heavy smoker. 

I'm 18 now, studying aviation which I have 0 interest in and almost signed a contract to join the military just for extra cash every month for me to smoke and drink. I always wanted to be a psychologist, and I've wasted 2 years of my life doing something that I have disliked, and using cigarettes to forget about it.

Just a month clean, and I'm able to see how much I've fucked myself over these past few years, and I'm slowly trying to rebuild my future. 

Sure, the health benefits and the relief of the burden on your wallet is great, but quitting smoking isn't just for better health, it's a life changing decision. Cigarettes/Nicotine changes what you perceive as priorities, you just don't notice it because you think they are on your side. Really, your nicotine addiction only wants to help itself.

I thank you guys for all the support and if I ever make it big some day, you guys will be in my thank you list, really, big help.

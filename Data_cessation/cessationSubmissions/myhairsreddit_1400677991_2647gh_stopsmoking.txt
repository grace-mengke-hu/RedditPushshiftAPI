800 cigarettes and a furry tongue

I quit smoking 43 days ago. Well 42, until 5:00 PM if you want to be picky about it, lol. I had many family members say I wouldn't make it past the first month. I am so proud to say that I have done so without cheating! I also had a friend that said I'd give up before my QuitNow app hit 800 cigarettes. I passed that hurtle as well! I just wanted to share my progress with the sub and say thank you for everyone who shares their stories and wisdom, it is really motivational on my journey to a healthier life style.

On another note, I started getting that weird gross white furry tongue in my late teens, everyone said it was from smoking. I just recently realized that it has dulled down A LOT. It is looking more red then white now and the "fuzziness" is very light compared to how thick it used to be all over my tongue. Has this happened to anyone else? Is it because I quit smoking?

Any comments, questions, or answers are appreciated! Thanks you guys!

EDIT: Forgot to include the QuitNow App stats. Love this app, it's so helpful! http://imgur.com/EB5caP8

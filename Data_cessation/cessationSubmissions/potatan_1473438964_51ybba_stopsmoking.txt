Fell off the wagon after Champix/Chantix - any advice before restarting?

I took Champix for the recommended 10 weeks course, gave up at the start of the second week, and it all went really well. (the only side-effect was a slight nauseous feeling for about 10 minutes after taking a tablet - YMMV)

But two or three weeks after stopping the course, I was out with friends and had a few beers, and well you can guess the rest.  

I'm thinking of restarting the tablets as they definitely helped me break the cycle, but I wonder if anyone has tried this twice, and had any advice.

Thanks

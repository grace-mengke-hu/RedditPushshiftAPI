Preparing to Quit

I suppose these types of posts might be common here, but I have not been on Reddit long, so here goes.

I am 30/M and I have been trying to stop smoking for the last 8 months or so and I have been unsuccessful so far. On several occasions I have gone over a week without smoking, only to buy a pack again. I have not used nicotine replacements of vaping. 

I am trying some different things this time around. I am "preparing to quit" whereas in the past I have just thrown out my pack on a whim. 

I guess I am just looking to share with the community what I am trying to do. I welcome advice on what has helped you folks not smoke for as long as you have up to this date so that I can get some suggestions and support. 

December 18th is the date I have set and I am leaving my apartment on that day to stay with family that doesn't know I smoke. I will be there until mid January and I *think* the change of scenery and being around my non-smoking family will give me a boost to get past the physical addiction. 

But, I am already worried that when I get back on my own I will be tempted to smoke since I won't have to hide it. I'm not trying to quit for them, I just think that being there will take my mind off of smoking and break the routine that my smoking habits are associated with. 

Thanks in advance and have a great night everyone!

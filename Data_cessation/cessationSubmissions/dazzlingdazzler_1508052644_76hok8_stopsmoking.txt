Stop making excuses for yourself, you are stronger than you think.

Don't let your mind make you weak. Don't let the addiction rule you. You are more than the addiction. The stress that was always there will always be there, with or without a cigarette. Your brain is tricking you; if anything, cigarettes add more stress to your everyday life, you have to think about all the possible ways you can get a cigarette in, whether it be every hour or half hour or even 10 minutes. I remember having to plan out my day around my addiction, I would leave my house 20 minutes early just to smoke a cigarette or two or three. I was more stressed smoking than not smoking. 
I made so many excuses as to why I should not quit smoking, so many. I was sick of being at war with my own head and addiction. I remember the night I quit, I walked into the gas station, bought a stupid e-cigarette and said, tonights the night, no more excuses... I argued with myself in my head for a long time. I was sick of feeling like I was going to die every second, I was sick of being a slave to a stick that was slowly killing me. I knew I had to do it, no more excuses, I was stronger than I thought. 
TLDR: Believe in yourself, know you are stronger than the addiction. Surround yourself with supportive people.

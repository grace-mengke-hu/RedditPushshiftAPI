Okay here we go, day 1 after 18 years.

I've been smoking since I was 14, 20 a day for most of that time. I got a month and a half at the end of last year after a health scare. A big fight with my husband (and some incredible mental acrobatics) ended that. I've managed a a few 4 day quits since then. A few minutes ago I had the last cigarette I will ever smoke. I've read the Allan Carr book and watched the video someone posted here a few times. Hoping that message is lodged in my subconscious and helps as the cravings bite later. But even if not, I am done.

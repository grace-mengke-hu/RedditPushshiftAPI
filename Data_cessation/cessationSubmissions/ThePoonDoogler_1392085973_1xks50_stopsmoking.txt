1 month, 10 days quit and I f***ing hate everything today.

Lurked for a long time before NYE. 13 year smoker until January 1st, 2014. 

Today is one of those days. I can't stand people in general today. I yelled at my SO for trying to help me and chastised my professor for their mother being in the hospital. I feel stupid for not being able to control myself. I don't know if its cravings or just one of those days.        

I know this sub is usually filled with positivity so I apologize.

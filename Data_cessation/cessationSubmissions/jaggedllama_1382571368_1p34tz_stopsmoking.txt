Day 2 almost over

I Smoked for 8 years, 20-25 a day I stopped on Monday night at 9.20pm I just decided enough was enough, I was sick of the coughing, the smell; everything about it. I'm starting to struggle though, I caved in yesterday and had 2 puffs from one but I threw it away, today has been a struggle.

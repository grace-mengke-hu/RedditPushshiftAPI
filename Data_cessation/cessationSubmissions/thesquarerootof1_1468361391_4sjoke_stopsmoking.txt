Anyone know of any good way I can buy nicotine gum in bulk (more than 160 pieces) and save money?

I am have quit smoking but I have been chewing nicotine gum for 2 years now (I did not want to quit nicotine though, lol). I prefer the Coated 4mg nicotine gum and I spend $40 on the Equate (walmart version) of nicotine gum or the walgreens version.

Anyone know of any cheaper coated 4mg nicotine gum that I can buy in bulk? I have been searching the internet so far and can't find any bulk vendors. Thanks for the replies!

Tomorrow... Football and Alcohol

I quit Wednesday night and tonight it will be my second day. And tomorrow there is a quite number of football matches on TV. I thought maybe get couple of beers, drink up, enjoy the matches, have fun. Because to be honest, I'm bored, first days 

Is that a bad idea? It's just the third day and alcohol? I believe I can handle it, although I did not smoke when I went out for drinks, so they are sort of associated but again, I believe I can handle it.

PS: There is no cigarettes in the house and the people I'll be with, do not smoke.

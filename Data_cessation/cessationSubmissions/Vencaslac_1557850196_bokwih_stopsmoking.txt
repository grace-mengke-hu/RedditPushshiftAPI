Smokes? Who me?

I've been quit for 7 months and 1 day after 14 years. Now, my partner still smokes so when I go to the grocery store I sometimes get her a pack, just like i used to get both of us one before.

I know I know, I shouldn't encourage her but at the same time, one of my biggest peeves about non smokers when I was smoking was the constant nagging. Having smoked at my father's lung cancer induced funeral 9 years ago I'm here to tell everyone it has little to no effect. This is a realisation that has to come from within, not something that can be pushed from without. But I digress.

I stop by the grocery store almost every day when I come home from work, and I'll pick up a few items. Today was special though. Today all I had was a bottle of water and in the rush she buzzed me through before the other customer had a chance to pick everything up. She looked up and said "Smokes?".

Now up to this point I've been making it sort of a point to tell other's I've quit, as a sort of reinforcement of the fact and a sort of defense mechanism in case I ever feel weak - all these people think I've quit, it would be ultra embarassing to relapse - you know, the little tricks we try to play with ourselves. 

Today was different. Today when she asked I looked over my shoulder because I thought for a second she was talking to someone else. Today for the first time I've felt genuinely free, not having to remind myself how I can indeed go to the store and not think about smoking. 

So yeah, that was my victory for the day.

13 days gone. Changes so far.

So 13 days ago I finished Allen Carr's book. I've been without smoke since. When I was still smoking, I had this annoying little headache all the time, now It's gone. According to my mom, my breath, clothes and room does not smell like shit anymore. I've gained few pounds of my weight, but it does not matter because I can taste food again. And for the last but not least, I can finally sleep well. When I smoked, I slept about 6-7 hours per night and those nights were very broken. I woke up all the time and couldn't fall back asleep right away. Now Im sleeping 10+ hours per night, at weekends almost 14 hours per night. Thank for your support so far.

I'm quitting smoking, and the hardest part is not being able to just take a break and go outside, how do you handle this?

I get the biggest cravings to smoke sometimes just because I want to go outside and enjoy the weather for 5 minutes. Now that I'm not smoking, it's not as socially acceptable to just go outside for five minutes and then come back. I understand that I can still just go outside, but a lot of times it just feels weird for me. How should I handle this?

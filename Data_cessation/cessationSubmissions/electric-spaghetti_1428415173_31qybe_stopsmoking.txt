Quit success: grossed out while visiting an indoor smoking friend.

So, its been five months and a bit. I was one of those quitters who failed at quitting over and over again, every two weeks for a whole year before this last quit. It felt so impossible, I couldn't imagine how life would ever feel enjoyable or even 'normal' again without cigarettes.

Well, on the weekend, I went to visit a friend I hadn't seen in awhile who smokes in her apartment. On the way, I wondered if seeing an old smoking buddy would trigger cravings or if the second hand smoke would make me crave them for the next few days. It did not. I felt nauseous after the first cig she lit up and I definitely wanted nothing to do with smoking. I think we'll get together somewhere that isn't her apartment from now on.

There was no breakthrough that made it work for me this time, by the way. It was a slow build of hating the fact that I'd started again every time I tried to quit. I hated the addiction and what it did to my life. Eventually the hate became a greater motivator than the addiction itself. So, if you're in the same boat of repeatedly failing, don't think its not possible to successfully quit just because you haven't found a new miracle solution. Just keep at it and eventually you'll want it bad enough to do whatever you have to do to not smoke until the addition is dead.

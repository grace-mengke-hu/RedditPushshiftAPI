Today I quit smoking !!!

Today I stop smoking, both cigarettes and weed! 
Why? 
Ok,I smoked weed for around 20+ years nearly on a daily basis at some point it brought me into depression and a huge lack of motivation for everthing so I stopped the weed 3 years ago, but out of cravings I started cigarettes (stupid I know), after 1,5 years I stopped cigarettes, out of cravings I started to smoke weed again (one little joint in the evening) what was even more stupid.
The depressions and the lack of motivation came back quickly and I ended up with doing both a littlebit for a while, that ended up in  smoking cigarettes over the day and one or two joints in the evening and now I'm depressed and unmotivated every single day and I hate me, I hate cigarettes, I hate beeing depressed and I hate beeing high.
So, enough of that shit, I stop right now, cold withdrawal.
Wish me luck, any kind words are appreciated!

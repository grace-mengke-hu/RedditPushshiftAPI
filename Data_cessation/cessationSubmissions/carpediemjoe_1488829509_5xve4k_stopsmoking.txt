Life After Cigarettes

[RAMBLING POST]

So I've put smoking behind me. But I still seek friends and camaraderie (which is the role cigarettes held in my life).

So I thought it would be cool to go to a bar after work like they do in Cheers or Moe's Tavern (Simpsons). Have beers with some guys. Shoot the shit and have a couple laughs.

So I went to a bar after work at 5:00pm and it was totally empty. I felt so defeated. Went to a different bar. Empty too.

I don't think people do stuff after work anymore do they? I think everyone just goes home and surfs Netflix (which is what I do now). How much of a bummer is that though?

Not sure if anyone can relate to all this. I'm obviously glad I don't smoke anymore. I can tell now that I was using cigarettes to mask my loneliness and lack of community. 

Life on tv shows and in movies seems so much more interesting and fun... I guess that's why we like watching it.

Guess I'm just adjusting to life as a non-smoker and feeling... out of place and lost.

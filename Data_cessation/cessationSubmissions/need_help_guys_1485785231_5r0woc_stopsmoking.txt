I feel desperate...

I've read Carr's book twice now, and I failed multiple times. Every night I swear to God I will never touch a cig again, and every morning, as I go to work and passing by a tobacco store, I fail and buy one. What do I miss? My personal best was 2 months without smoking, and I just fell back into it because of stupid alcoholic "need" at a party

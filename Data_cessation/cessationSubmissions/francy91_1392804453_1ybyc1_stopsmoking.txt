One week..

It's been one week since I've decided to stop smoking after 6 years..at the beginning I wasn't smoking that often (I was 17 when I've started smoking), just with friends or in school. But last year I've moved to London and I've started to smoke really bad. 10 or more cigarettes per day. So I've decided to quit because I didn't like that about myself.
And the app is really helping me.

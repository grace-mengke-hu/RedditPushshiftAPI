Help me in my passive aggressive quest to stop my gf turning into full blow smoker :)

So, I am not a smoker myself. She used not to be either, just sometimes when drunk/at parties/social situations etc.

The problem is now - her best friend is a smoker, so, when she is with her, she lights up at least one. Her bestie at work also smokes, so she lights up at work as well.

I've been stalking her cigarette packs contents - it's about 1-3 a day on an average, she knows I don't like this, I am vocal about it. Some time ago we had a conversation about this, I did that bullshit ciggaretes vs me type of thing that I shouldn't have. She said you, you, you, meanwhile she dropped smoking maybe for 2 weeks and now is right back at it. 

I stopped trying to control her, realized must be her own choice

I was thinking of putting pics of inspiring texts+cute pics in her cig packs/bag/whatever. Not like a cancer-rotten lung or something :D, just something that make her smile and remind of me caring about her

So, guys, maybe you can turn your collective creative brain on for me? thanks!

Nicotine free tobacco substitute

So I recently quit smoking cigarettes but don't want to quit smoking joints. I usually smoke them with some tobacco but don't want to "feed the nicotine monster". Does anyone know of a good nicotine free tobacco substitute that I can use to roll joints?

Thanks in advance!

how much i harmed myself?

hello, almost 30yo guy here, i would like to know in broad outline, how much i harmed myself. i know it's not easy to know and mileage may very, i just want to coming out and see what other people think. so, here's my history of me as a smoker: 

started when i was almost 18, i usually smoked about 5-6 cigs a day, in the weekends maybe about 15. when i was about 21 i decided to stop, but not entirely, i usually smoked socially (no more than 2 cigs a week, even less), but decided not to buy them, i take them from my friends (it sounds bad, but i actually bought them to my friends from time to time) there where time where sometimes i bought a pack for me, but was happening no more than once every 3-4 months. then, at 26 i bought an elecric cigarettes and smoked it for about 6 months with that. then, again, socially smoking in the weekends. last year i regret it, because i started again smoking, no more than 4-5 a day and not continually (there were months when i didn't smoked, but when i bought a pack "just for one cig when i drink" i started again for a couple of weeks), but i did it. now, it's been about 2 months i didn't bought a pack but when some of my friends smoke, he usually offer it to me and i accept. i'm weak. i should stop entirely.

so, what do you think? how much i hurt myself? you think it's that bad to continue smoking socially or when i drink alcohol? i must say that i'm not a sedentary guy, i usually lift about 2-3 times a week (in my house, not something too hard, but at least i do not do nothing) and sometimes i run or bycicle.

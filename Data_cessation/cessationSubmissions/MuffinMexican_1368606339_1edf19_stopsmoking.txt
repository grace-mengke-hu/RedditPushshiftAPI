I dreamed a dream

I quit smoking about 3 days ago. Everything is going pretty alright but this night something happenend what really made me smile in the morning and make me feel confident.

I dreamed that I was hanging out with friends and one of them offered me a cigarette. I thought "fuck it, just one" and took it, I put it in my mouth and just wanted to light it up 'till a thought came into my mind. I don't know what that thought was but it made me take the cigarette from my mouth and give it back to my friend and just walk away (you are allowed to imagine some explosions in the background as I walk away in slow motion). 

The moment I woke up I felt really confident and told myself

"You're going to fucking make it."

Edit; spelling.

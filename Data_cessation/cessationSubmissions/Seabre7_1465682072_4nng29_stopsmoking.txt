Need tips!

Today is my 5th day without a cigarette, and even though it is SUCKING, I am feeling really good that I haven't caved. All my closest friends smoke and tonight is the first party I'll be going to since I've stopped. I know there will be tons of smoking, but I still want to drink and have fun with my friends. Any suggestions of how you've handled situations like this?

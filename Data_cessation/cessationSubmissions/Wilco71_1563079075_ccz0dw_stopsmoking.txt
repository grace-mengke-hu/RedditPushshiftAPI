I’m off.....

Well chaps. I’ve decided to head off. I used to find this an inspirational place to come and it’s certainly helped me to get to 86 days without a single puff, so thanks to all of you who helped me!

Now it seems everyone is saying it doesn’t matter if we quitters do smoke. I don’t want to keep being told that and so I’m going. I think it matters a lot that I don’t smoke.

Best of luck my friends!

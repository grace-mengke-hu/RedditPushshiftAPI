Dizziness

I'm sure this has been asked before but does anyone experience dizziness for the first week or so after smoking?

I quit because I had a panic attack right after smoking a cigarette (was it related? Who knows but it was the event that made me quit)

Been smoking a pack a day for around twelve years

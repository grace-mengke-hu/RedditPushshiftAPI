Summary of yesterdays survey! Thanks for answering

**There were 68 responses, although some questions have less (people skipping or leaving the survey perhaps). Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer! I will summarize the results, and also include a link to the actual results if you want to see every answer.

**1) What age were you when you started smoking cigarettes?**

Unfortunately and not surprisingly, the majority (14/25) answered that they had began experimenting or regularly smoking before the US legal age of 18. 

The other 11 obviously were 18 years or older, however, the oldest was 28. Most of those 11 people were in their early 20's.

**2) How long have/did you smoke(d) for collectively?**

The majority (28/52 I think) smoked for 10 or more years. The longest was 39 years. 13/52 smoked for less than 5 years.

**3) Are you currently smoking cigarettes?**

8/10 people said no 

**4) If you use an e-cig, do you use it as an alternative way to use nicotine, or do you use it as a way to help you quit smoking altogether?**

9 people (69%) said they use it to help them quit, and 4 people (31%) said they use it as an alternative to smoking cigarettes.

**5) What method of quitting has been ultimately successful for you?**

This was multiple choice, so one person could've answered patches, gum, e-cigs for example.

* Cold Turkey - 35 checks

* The Easy Way - 20 checks

* Other (no answers here) - 14 checks

* E-Cigs - 10 checks

* Cutting back - 7 checks

* Patches - 6 checks

* Still Smoking - 4 checks

* Nicotine Gum - 1 check

**6) If you have had unsuccessful quit attempts, which methods did NOT work for you?**

Again, multiple choice, so one person could've said cutting back, e-cigs, patches.

* Cutting Back - 43 checks

* Cold Turkey - 34 checks

* Nicotine Gum/Lozenges - 27 checks

* Patches - 20 checks

* E-Cig - 18 checks

* Other (no responses added) - 10 checks

* The Easy Way - 7 checks

* First Attempt Successful - 3 checks

* Haven't Quit - 1 check

**7) Do you think it is acceptable to have an occasional smoke? Why or why not?**

A lot of answers here, I didn't count them. The vast majority firmly said no, and most people said they felt that having one will likely lead to relapse and they'd quickly become a full blown smoker again.    Seems like a lot of people who answered feel that once you have an addiction, it doesn't ever truly go away - you either choose to feed it or not. A lot of people said they felt that having just one would feed their addiction, and they'd be scared of being a smoker again. 

A few people said there's nothing wrong with the occasional smoke, but they don't have the control to do it personally. They said that if it truly is occasional, then it's okay, but in most cases, the occasional smoke would lead to being a smoker again. Couple people said no, but they hope to have a cigar some day. I think one or two people just said yes without explanation. I think one or two people said that they can enjoy the occasional cigarette without smoking regularly.

**8) Being completely honest, do you feel that some quitting methods are better or yield more success than others? Why?**

Scanning through the answers, a lot of people said cold turkey was the best because it takes more dedication, and in combination with The Easy Way, it addresses the underlying psychological addiction. Many said that cold turkey was the only thing that worked for them, and I also saw a lot of people saying that they just wanted the nicotine out of their bodies and didn't like NRT for that reason. 

Most people agreed that everyone is different and not all methods work for all people. Whatever works for you is best! A common response was that it depends on your level of determination to quit.

A few people said that they preferred NRT like e-cigs because it's less painful and miserable. A few answered that e-cigs should be used as a stepping stone to ween yourself off cigarettes, but then cold turkey afterwards. Saw an answer that said patches and gum are good better than e-cigs because it gets rid of that mental habit of physically smoking and inhaling. Got a few chantix advocates. A few also stated that having a good support net is important, and having this sub helped.

**9) What is your opinion on The Easy Way by Allen Carr?**

Lots of people said they loved the book and it was a life saver, and it helped them understand their addiction more.

Saw quite a few comments about how poorly written it is, even though it contains a lot of great messages. 

Several people said it didn't work for them, Carr is condescending, and that he is uneducated and spreads misinformation and that his success rate is a lie. A few people dislike that he isn't a doctor or scientist, he's just your average Joe and that the book is overblown. 

**10) Are you currently using any form of nicotine?**

23 answers, 10 said no. Three said cigarettes, the rest were patches or e-cigs.

**11) How long have you been smoke-free?**

Completely varied, just like the answers for how long you smoked. Some people have been smoke-free for over a year, some for several months, a couple weeks, a few days, etc. One answer said 90 minutes! Congrats everyone, keep up the hard work.

**12) What is your personal definition of quitting?**

A couple patterns here. A lot of people said quitting means never having nicotine in their bodies ever again, and not missing smoking. I saw a few that said quitting means being free and not feeling dependent on anything (smoking, e-cig, etc.) so basically overcoming that psychological addiction. On the other hand, a noticeable amount of you said that you quitting means not smoking cigarettes, but it's okay to still use e-cigs. 

I hope I did a decent job summarizing and capturing different opinions! I think it's really interesting to see all the varying types of quitters here, and you should definitely keep that in mind while browsing the sub! Obviously a lot of people have a different definition of what it means to quit smoking. 

Anyway, [here is a link to the full results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FKO_ZMProS6_mmOzUeNOCQdQ4NcBm63JGLsyU7BG7o4/viewanalytics) if you're interested.

You guys are an amazing community and no matter how you choose to quit and what you define quitting as, good luck and congratulations for becoming a healthier person!  Hopefully this can help us be more understanding of each other and be better supporters :)

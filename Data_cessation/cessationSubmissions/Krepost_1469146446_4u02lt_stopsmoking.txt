Strongest quit so far

Hey folks, been lurking around here for months. Figured I'd share my story.

Basically I started smoking on a eurotrip in 2013. Smoked for about a year and a half (maybe half a pack a day) and then quit to vaping in early 2015 which lasted until this May. I decreased the dosage slowly to 0 which worked for me. I realized I had a problem and wanted to stop probably July 1st 2014. It took almost two years from that point to get where I am now.

Basically I lost my dad in March of this year. His last words to me were "Are you happy?" I was not. My addiction to nicotine was a strong barrier preventing me from being fully happy. I'm not sure why. Probably a mixture of guilt, the discomfort of relying on a chemical, and mood swings. It was just such a big part of my life that became a giant hassle. 

From there it took until May to give it a serious quit. I gathered my friends and asked them all to hold me accountable this time. It was going to be a group effort. None of them are smokers and all of them have done more than their share to help me stop this.

I made it through a music festival last week without smoking. If I was going to smoke again that would have been the place to pick it back up. I just don't want to be a smoker anymore. For me I think that was really the key.

I don't have the right to give advice yet. Maybe if I make it a year or so. But to get here I used a vape pen and my friends. That's what's worked for me to give me the strongest quit so far.

deciding to quit

I've been smoking for the past 12 years, and finally think I'm ready to stop. except, I have depression and some pretty bad anxiety. I read a comment in this sub about easily confusing anxiety with a craving, how do you separate that when you've always coupled the two up?  also, do most of you just stop altogether, or use vaporizers? I've also done this thing where I would purposely choose beverages that would make the urge to smoke stronger (coffee, pop, alcohol) because I loved smoking that damn much. should those be cut out as well? 

how the heck do you not smoke while drinking?!  

I guess I could just shut up and not put another in my mouth.

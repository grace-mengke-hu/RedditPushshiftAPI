Cigarettes Not Smoked, 3,533... WHAT?! EWE!

Does anyone else look at their Smoke Free App and get completely disgusted at the number of "Cigarettes Not Smoked" number?
I have not smoked a cigarette in 236 days... which means I have not smoked 3,533 cigarettes or 17 packs of cigarettes... WHAT?!  In seven months and three weeks ... I would have smoked over 3,500 cigarettes... that is SO DISGUSTING to think about.  Cheers to the next 3,500 cigarettes not smoked!

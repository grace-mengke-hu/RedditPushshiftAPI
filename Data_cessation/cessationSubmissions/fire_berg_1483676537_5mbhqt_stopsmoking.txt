5 Days

So I'm into my fifth day. The last time I tried to quit, about a year and a half ago, I allowed a cigarette here and there. Not this time. I need to be done. I feel it and only just turned 30. 14 years and I'm saying I'm done. As someone with terrible self discipline, this is a very hard thing to do. I want to be a non smoker.

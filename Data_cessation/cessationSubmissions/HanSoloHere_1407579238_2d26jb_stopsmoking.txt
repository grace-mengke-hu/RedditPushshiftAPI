I'm scared.

I want to quit but I'm scared. I'm scared that I am not ready, I'm worried I'm going to crave a smoke for the rest of my life. A part of me has myself convinced that I just thoroughly enjoy smoking...but on the other hand here I am on this subreddit seeking support for the journey ahead. I'm really frightened to quit... honestly. Funny thing is I always vowed to never smoke as a kid, but yet here I am justifying a addiction.... Deep down I know I am ready though, I am ready to do this for myself because I am worth it... and so are you.

Fuck nicotine and fuck cancer. Starting right now we are non-smokers. Enjoy the rest of your life, because I'm damn sure going to enjoy mine.

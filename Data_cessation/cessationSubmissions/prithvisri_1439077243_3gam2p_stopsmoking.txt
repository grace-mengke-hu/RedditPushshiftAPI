Ten years to date since quitting smoking

It has been ten years since I quit smoking. That was probably seventh or eighth time that I seriously quit. Before the final one, I never quit for more than two months. I tried to quit by myself and used all dumb shit without thinking much. I'm taking about the Nicorette gum and patches.

Eventually it took me to give up on trying to do it on my own and seeking help. My doctor recommended a group smoking cessation program which gave me the support system I needed to help quit. I quit on 8th August 2005. I used to count days in the beginning. Days turned to weeks. Weeks into months. The longer it became, I was scared that I may relapse. For the first year, I almost lived in fear that I may relapse anytime. I remember having a dream one day that I just smoked a cigarette. The dream was so vivid and th cigarette was so complete and satisfying. After the cigarette, I almost cried because the clock is now reset to zero. I started crying and then woke up. It's hard to describe the relief I felt that I didn't smoke. Anyway, after the first two years, I stopped thinking about smoking. 

Btw, I used to smoke about 3 to 4 a day and thanks to Nicorette, I was smoking about 25 a day before I quit. I'm glad that I quit while I still had time left and before it was too late.

Thanks for reading.

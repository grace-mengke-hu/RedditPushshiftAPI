codependency

I am completely terrified of quiting I've been smoking since I was 14 and now I'm 23. Cigarettes are like a security blanket for me they will never leave me I will always be able to have a cigarette. My boyfriend just quit but he's quits allot and he can go all day with the first cigarette he had being at like 6 at night so we're different types of smokers when the first thing I do is make my cup of coffee and smoke in the morning. He also thinks I'm crazy when I've told him how scared of quitting I am he doesn't get it. I know everyday someone quits and they survive but even thinking about it makes me panicky and worried like I won't be and I won't have anything if I do. Has anyone else felt this way and any ideas to get pass it to quit? I've thought maybe I should go to a Psychiatrists to treat what I think is anxiety and maybe that will help but I don't know. Any advice will help thank you

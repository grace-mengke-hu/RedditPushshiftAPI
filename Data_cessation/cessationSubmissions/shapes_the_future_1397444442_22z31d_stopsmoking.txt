Finally did it! Thanks to you guys!!

Thanks to all of your positive motivations and for telling me to get The Book, I can say I"m happy to be almost 48 hours smoke free! The worst time is right before bed, but that's also when I'm browsing Reddit, so coming here helps keep me focused.

My husband is also quitting (he just stopped this afternoon though) and is having a hard time with it. He refuses to read and me quoting Allen Carr's words of wisdom to him is just making him more miserable. Me telling him how proud of him doesn't seem to be helping. Any thoughts?

Thanks again, you are all an inspiring community!!!

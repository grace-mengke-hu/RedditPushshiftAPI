well past 180 days.

Well I really stopped counting a while back because the urge died so much even while being around a bunch of friends drunk with them smoking like chimneys around me. You all can do it. Believe in yourself remember you quit for YOU! I had a AWFUL past few months in my life and am still going through a lot but I've never let sucking down some shitty cigs to make it "better".

smoked ~ 7 years ~ 10 smokes a day.
quit cold turkey midnight July 7th 2012

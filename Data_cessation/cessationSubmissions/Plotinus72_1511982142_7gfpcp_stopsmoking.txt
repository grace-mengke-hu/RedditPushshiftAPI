Nicotine Replacement Addiction?

I've found this subreddit useful but have struggled to extrapolate all of you kicking cigarettes with my own addiction to NRT alternatives. I frankly haven't smoked cigarettes in over 5 years but have used everything from the patch to the gum and finally settled on Nicorette mini-lozenges as my drug of choice for the past few years. 

I've justified them as better for my health than smoking (likely true, but NRT definitely still affects things like my heart rate) but I spend $10-$15/day on those stupid mini-lozenges and the price alone is worth kicking the habit. I'm now on day 15 and am frankly not finding it any easier, I was just hoping to hear I'm not alone with NRT being just as addictive as stopping smoking.

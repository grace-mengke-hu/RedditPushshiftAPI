Ten days!

Hey everyone. Just checking in. It's been ten days now. The longest I've come in the last two months. 

Quit in 2012 for two years. 

Started again after one puff from a friends smoke. 

Quit again last October. Started again after one puff in late January. 

I've tried quitting since, but only made it a week or so. Obviously I can never have another puff again. I can't be an occasional smoker. It's been proven. I'm feeling pretty good about ten days. 

I get little to no cravings outside of work. I've always been that way. I only want to smoke at work. 

But either way, I refuse to become a smoker again.

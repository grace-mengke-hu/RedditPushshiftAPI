picking ecig/vaping up

today i bought an e-cigarette to help me wean off of cigarettes. i'm just curious if this was a stupid idea on my part as it's still pretty harmful, and won't help me quit ASAP.  has anyone else started using them as an alternative? was it any help? (one full day without a cigarette btw! groundbreaking news for me haha)

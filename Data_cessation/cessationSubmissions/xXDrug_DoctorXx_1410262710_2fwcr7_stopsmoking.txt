Bad cigarette taste...

Hey guys, I have been a smoker now for about a year(started when I was 17 when I was put on probation for two years), and I used to enjoy the taste of cigs. But now, it seems that they just taste like garbage. It upsets my stomach a little as well, which makes me think every time I smoke a cigarette that I need to quit. Just wondering if any of you guys have had this happen to you when you smoke(d), and if it drove you to quiting? Thanks, and any tips on kicking the habit would be appreciated!

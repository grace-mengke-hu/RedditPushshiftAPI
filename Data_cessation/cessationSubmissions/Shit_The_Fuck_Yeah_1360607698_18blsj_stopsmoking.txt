I went off the patch yesterday, I'm havin a hard time but I'm being strong!

Hey guys, I hope you're all staying strong!

So, my last patch (21mcg; Step 1/3) for the week fell off early yesterday morning.  I decided to say fuck it and go raw-dog for the rest of the way.  I have nicotine gum but I want this shit outta my body, I'm tired of being  slave.

For those of you who are new to quitting: it gets a ton easier every day.  The first day was very difficult for me, even with the patch on.  I think I'm good to go now, those motherfuckers are poison.  I've been smoking on and off for more than 20 years, I really hope this is the last relapse for me...

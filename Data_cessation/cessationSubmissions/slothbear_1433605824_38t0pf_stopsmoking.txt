Four weeks down, rest of my life to go!

Yesterday, was my 28th nicotine free day! Up until then, I don't think I had gone more than a day without smoking in 15 years. I'm feeling pretty good, and now that I can breathe again, it's time to start running. I think I've only posted on here once, but checking in every few days and reading this subreddit has helped. Cold turkey was tough, and I never want to go through that again. Also, my wallet is already $300 or so heavier. Thanks everybody, and keep up the fight!

It’s been 8 hours since my last cigarette and I’m excited to try and quit.

I have been smoking tobacco for two almost 3 years and I do it mostly because I smoke weed and it’s a lovely combination.  For a while I vaped but that just filled my lungs with what seemed to be more gunk than the cigarettes I was smoking.  

I am fine with how cigarettes have affected me up until now. I don’t tend to smoke more when I’m stressed either, mainly I smoke to get a buzz while drunk or high.  How it may subsequently affect my stress I have no idea but we’ll see.  My lungs are worse but not that bad, but man does the smell linger and stick to everything.

I quit this morning because I’m afraid of how it will affect me later, after maybe 6 years or 10 years of use.  I am fine now but most likely will not be in the future.  I decided to quit because the longer I wait to do it the harder it will be, and god it’s already real difficult.  

I think once I’m not so addicted, and I’ve gotten past the withdrawals, and it’s out of my system,  I won’t want to smoke tobacco at all. However, I think to help, I can’t stop telling myself I’ll get to smoke spliffs eventually if I can quit smoking tobacco entirely now and not smoke it by itself in the future.

Anyways, I’m going to be exercising, hydrating, and keeping busy for the next few weeks I’ll check back in maybe a week from now and see how it went!

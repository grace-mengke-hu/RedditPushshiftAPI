Trying Again!!

Currently 4 days 5 hours since my last smoke. Feeling proud of myself but a little guilty that I started on the patches on day 2 and an occasional lozenge each day. But after many failed attempts to quit over the last 20+ years, I definitely am feeling more positive this time around. Have also read Alan Carrâ€™s book which has really helped.

My husband also quit with me but he had a couple of smokes with a few drinks yesterday. I was so disappointed in him and the smell on him was a definite reminder of one of the reasons I want to say good bye to the control that the smokes have on me.

I am new to the site, but feeling a bit low today, and thought that reading about others struggles and successes would help me. Today I am missing the smokes and sort of feel like I am grieving the loss. I sound mad but I promise you I am not and understand that this is the addiction trying to get me to have just one more.

Positive thoughts for all of you who are taking control of your lives.

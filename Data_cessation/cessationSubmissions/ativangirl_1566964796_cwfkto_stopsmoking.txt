Please everyone I’m getting desperate

There’s a small voice inside of me calling for help. I want to run, I want to swim, I want to climb stairs. I don’t want to be attached at the hip to my vaping device. I don’t want the health issues associated with it. But it’s so hard. Am I in too deep? Why do I love how it makes me feel. 




Please help everyone. I want my life back. How do I start? How do I make myself start stopping??? 



:( thank you, much love

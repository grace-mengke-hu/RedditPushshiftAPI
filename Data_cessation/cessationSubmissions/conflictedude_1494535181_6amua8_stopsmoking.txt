Dealing with heartache, issues at home and studying for a standardized test for grad school. Can't seem to muster the discipline to quit.

As the title says, alot of things are happening at once and I've been chainsmoking like never before. Bored? Have a cig! Stressing? Have a cig! Boy I need a study break, I deserve a cig. Luckily at the moment I have at least been able to muster the discipline to keep my weight loss going and have been able to study effectively but I want to get rid of this damn habit. I've noticed since I've been smoking more I always feel tired and my sleeping patterns have been terrible. Do I just say fuck it and go cold turkey? Do I ween myself off of it? Any tips or advice appreciated. Thanks for listening.

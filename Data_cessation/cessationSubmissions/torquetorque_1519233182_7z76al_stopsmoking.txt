deleted the line item for cigarettes from my monthly budget today :)

i use a spreadsheet to track budget and spending... deleted the part of my budget for cigarettes today! that feels good :) $290 / month that can go towards other stuff! shit you could almost buy a new car with that money... like if you wanted a hyundai or whatever haha :)

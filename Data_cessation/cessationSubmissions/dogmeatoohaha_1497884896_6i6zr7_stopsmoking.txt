What is helping/has helped you on your way to quitting?

Tl;dr: Trying to quit again, used a weaning method last time. Looking for possible other methods to help. What did you try that helped or didn't help?

I've been smoking for a few years now and quit for a while when I got pregnant. It took me about 3 months using a weaning method, cutting out a few cigarettes a day to completely stop for a while. After the baby was born, and a bout of ppd, I turned back to smoking. In my mind it gave me a few guaranteed minutes away from my kiddo as horrible as it sounds.

I've fought past the ppd and I see my reason to keep myself healthier in her now. So I'm going to start the process again, but while the weaning process worked, I'm interested in other possible methods that may help along the way.

Thank you!

Day 6, still going strong

This past weekend was my birthday, and I told myself after I turned 22, I'd be done for good. Glad to say, my birthday was Friday, and I still have not smoked a cigarette since Saturday morning at like 6am (I was still up from the night before, so I consider it the same day). Haven't even hit my vape or anything. It hasn't been too hard. I just automatically shut down any urges I get immediately by telling myself "NO" over and over again.

Just want to share my minimal success thus far.

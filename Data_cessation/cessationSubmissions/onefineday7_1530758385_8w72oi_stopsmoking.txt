Day 4 - Let’s do this!!

Day #4 off of cigarettes and I am an emotional mess!  BUT, I have more energy and I’m not gasping for air after something as simple as walking up stairs!  I’m 22 and I don’t want to go on as a pack a day smoker...  I want my life back.  I’m excited for what my future as a non-smokers looks like.

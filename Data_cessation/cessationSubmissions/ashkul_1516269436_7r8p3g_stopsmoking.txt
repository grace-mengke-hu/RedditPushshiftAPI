SmokeFree Mission 19

Hi
I'm on the Smokefree app, and today I'm supposed to make a post about the things that have worked on my quit so far and why.
1. Drinking water
I increased my water intake to at least 2 litres daily and it helped me with cravings, removal of nicotine as well as making the skin a little better.
2. Meditation 
I did meditation using Headspace app for 10 or more minutes daily. I think it helped me GREATLY, as I didn't suffer any major cravings except on 2nd and 5th day... I do get cravings but they are negligible and I ignore them as try to remain in the present. 
3. Green tea
I am having different flavours of green tea. I think the antioxidants helped out in cravings.

Thanks!

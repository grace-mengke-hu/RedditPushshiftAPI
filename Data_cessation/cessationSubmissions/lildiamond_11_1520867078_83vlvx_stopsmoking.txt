Is it really quitting?

I have been smoking since I was 12 years old. I’m now 26. It’s awful. I never really tried to quit, I didn’t want to fail. I know how much money I’ve been throwing away, I see the way people look at me, my boyfriend tells me how bad it smells... there is no justifying why I tell myself I need that cig. Not to mention I’ve had  Type 1 Diabetes since infancy (for those of you that don’t know, smoking is much worse for people with diabetes). Smoking has affected the way I look at myself, the way I feel, and obviously my health. I know all the reasons why I should not smoke, that’s not why I’m posting on here. 

Anyway, February 28th a girlfriend and I were outside of work talking. Something sparked and decided I was going to stop buying cigarettes. Mind you, I was smoking at least a pack a day. 

We went to a little shop and I bought an e-cig. I’m now using that and haven’t bought a pack of cigs since. I feel proud of myself but still feel guilty. The first 3 days were awful, I wanted a real cig. 

Does it still count as quitting if I’m using the e cig? I know I’m saving a ton of money, but is it just as bad health wise?

Seven months today!

Hi, guys! Just came in to brag that today it's been seven months since I quit. I'm managing just fine, although I've gone up a pants size. That's been about the only downside so far.

I still get cravings, but I don't act on them. That's all I can do, and keep doing.

Best of luck to everyone else working at it, and congratulations to those who have also successfully quit smoking.

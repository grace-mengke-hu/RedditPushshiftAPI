Cold Turkey

Gonna try and go cold turkey in order to quit as fast as possible. Has anyone else done this? How did you find it? I'm only a few hours in and already noticing the effects of it, my vision keeps switching between being extremely clear or slightly out of focus. Its a really weird feeling.

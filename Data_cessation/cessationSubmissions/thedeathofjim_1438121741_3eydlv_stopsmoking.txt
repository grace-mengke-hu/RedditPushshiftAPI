I'm starting for my fifth (sixth?) attempt to quit tomorrow with the help of a program on my campus, and was thinking about keeping a short diary of it on this subreddit. Anyone interested in something like this?

Just as the title says. I've been smoking for five years, and I'm going back into the fight tomorrow. Hope all your fights are going well!

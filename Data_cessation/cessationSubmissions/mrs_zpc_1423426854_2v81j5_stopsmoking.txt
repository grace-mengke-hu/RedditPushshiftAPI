Day one.

So here I am with what I hope will be my last cigarette. 
I really don't know what to say that hasn't been said.
I have the same reasons as you all - i feel like shit.

Today is my second wedding anniversary and my husband and I have started trying for our first baby. I'm hoping that this will be motivation enough. I've always said that smoking is the silliest educated decision I made for myself - i know it's bad for me, but I won't do it if it effects anyone else like smoking around non - smokers etc.

March 12th is the one year anniversary of my mum's passing from stage 4 lung cancer. She smoked since she was 14. She wouldn't want me to smoke anymore and I don't want to die like that. 

So hear goes. I've had great motivation from reading the posts here. I'm going to go get ready for work and put my patch on.

Wish me luck!

7 years in, 3 days out...avoiding plateaus?

Biggest help for me has been having a golf tee nearby so I can lightly chew on it and sate the oral fixation...had a full pack of my favorite ciggs left at my house and haven't touched a single one.

Trying to keep it going but know that there are plateaus and hurdles still to come, would love any/all advice about avoiding plateaus and slip-ups as I'm still in week #1 and have lots of work ahead of me...

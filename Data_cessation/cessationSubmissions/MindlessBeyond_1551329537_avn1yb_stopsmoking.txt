Lunch break hell

I went cold turkey a week ago.  I had cut way back over the last year so it wasn't as bad as it could be.  What's killing me is my lunch break.  I work a service job that I hate (is there any other kind?).  It only takes me 10-15 minutes to eat and then I have 15+ minutes when all I can think of is how much I want a cigarette and how much I don't want to go back to work, and especially how much I don't want to go back to work without having had a cigarette.  Does anyone have any advice?

I know if I don't go outside I'll feel sluggish and depressed, so I've tried taking a walk and listening to music, but I mostly just think about how much I wish I was smoking.  Tried sitting on a bench doing sudoku but I couldn't concentrate.  One thing I know to do is to avoid the alley where the other smokers at my work hang out and I've been good at that so far.

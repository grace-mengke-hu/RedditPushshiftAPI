According to my flare, I'm 7 years nicotine free...that's a lie.

Right now my  badge currently says I'm at 2696 days of being nicotine free after 7 years of smoking (21-28).  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  For the past 5.5 years I've been relapsing reliably, smoking for a month or two at a time (up to a full year in the worst relapse) before quitting again, telling myself it's only a little cigarette vacation, I'm not a smoker.  Over the past 5.5 years I've rarely been out of the nicotine addiction / dependence cycle.  I've kept this sub on my feed as a pathetic attempt to remind myself that I am an ex smoker; but this was just a simple self deception.  In truth, I'm now admitting I've been addicted to the drug for 14 years. 

Most recently I relapsed because of relationship stress with a new girl i was seeing.  It's as though i was just waiting for something to come up, get a little rocky, so I could dive back into cigarettes.  I used the stressors of the relationship to justify smoking again, because that's what I really wanted...which then lead to the standard depression, confidence issues, lying, sneaking, and really screwed up any chance at that relationship.   I'm addicted to nicotine, it has had a hold of me for 14 years, and now I am ready to stop.

For the first time I read Allen Car's The Easyway to Stop Smoking. I've known about it from this sub since I first "quit" smoking 2696 days ago. I never read it because of I figured it was too good to be true, such hype couldn't be justified.  I finished the book today and am astonished out how accurately he deconstructed every aspect of smoking.  Issues I've been wrestling with for years about smoking, he made so clear.  I feel incredibly motivated, educated, and confident to finally become a non smoker.  I am excited for my future, disheartened by my mistakes, and so happy this supportive community exists.

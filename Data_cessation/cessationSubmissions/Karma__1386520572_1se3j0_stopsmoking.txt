Stopping smoking after being sick - Anyone else had this?

Hey everyone, for the past 48 hours I've been very sick and I havn't smoked or thought about smoking during the sickness, I was wondering if anyone else had experienced this and also will I start getting cravings again once I become well?

I've not even thought about having a Cigarette for the last 2 days and I'd like to keep it that way so I'm just looking for anyone elses experience with this, thanks.

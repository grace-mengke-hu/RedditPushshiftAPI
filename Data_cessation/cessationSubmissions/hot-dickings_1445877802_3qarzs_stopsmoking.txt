I have 30$ in my bank account and no cigs.. not freaking out though!

If this had happened to me last month, I'd have to debate on whether or not I needed to go donate plasma, gather coins, ask for money, skimp out on food etc just so I could put gas in my car and buy a few packs of cigs to last me until payday this Thursday.

I don't have to worry about that because I'm not a smoker anymore.

I can have gas in my car AND feed myself well on 30$ this week. Next month I'll have even more money because that's 55-110$ I'm not wasting on cartons of cigarettes.. less of a hardship right before I get paid! Guess this means I can't smoke!!

It feels really great... Not necessarily the being a lil' broke part, but the not having the **need** to buy those damn things!

Just wanted to share. :) How's that extra dough looking for you guys?

Day 6, Day Hell

I smoked for 20 years. A pack a day at least. Day 6 is tough so far. A good friend of mine was supposed to quit with me. She says "I've only had a couple since you quit, no biggie". It sorta pisses me off cause a couple is too many, and she can't relate. I know it's my struggle, my body and I gotta let the anger go!!! Makes me want a cigarette!!!

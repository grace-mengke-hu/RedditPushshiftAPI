Your thoughts on Vaping..(?)

Hi all

I've technically been "smoke free" for 18 days now, but I've been vaping. It's helped. A lot.

When I say "it's helped", would you say, "It's helped" or, "you idiot that's the same as smoking"...?

Is it any worse than say, nicotine gum?

Be honest here, hit me with anything you think.

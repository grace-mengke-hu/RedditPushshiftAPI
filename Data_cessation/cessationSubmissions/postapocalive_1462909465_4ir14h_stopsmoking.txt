Something awesome just happened...

Today I went into the gas station I go to nearly every day, I see the same cashiers everyday. They know me and would set my brand out. Today I said to them "No thanks, I quit". They literally started clapping and so did 3 people in line, everyone congratulated me and cheered. It was really moving. The little things like that are so motivating!

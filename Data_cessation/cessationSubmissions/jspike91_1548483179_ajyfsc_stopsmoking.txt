Using nicitine gum to quit and the 6 week taper seems a bit extreme to me

I smoked about a half pack of cigarettes a day and I'm just starting on the gum. It usually curbs my craving but the box says I have to taper for 6 weeks. Is this normal? If I feel I don't need a piece of the gum can I just skip out until I have a craving and do that for like one or two weeks and then increase my time between pieces of gum? Is there some hard science I am missing here?

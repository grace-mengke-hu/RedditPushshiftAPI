I ran my first 5k today!

The first time I tried to start running was last year before I stopped smoking. I was doing the couch to 5k program alternating walking and running, and never could get to where I could run for more than a minute and a half. So I gave up on the program. 
Well I started it completely over when I quit about three months ago and ran my first ever 5k in about 40 minutes. I never dreamed I could run for even 10 minutes! 
I was so happy that I cried when I crossed the finished line and the main thought in my mind was I AM SO GLAD I QUIT SMOKING. 
I hope this is encouraging to those of you who want to stop so they can be more active! I'm telling you, it makes a world of difference!

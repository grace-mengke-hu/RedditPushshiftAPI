Just starting into day 3..need help

So cigarettes are the only thing I can think about at the moment. I don’t want one necessarily but they just keep popping into my mind. It has me going insane. Please tell me this goes away I can’t handle constantly having cigarettes on my mind. Also these Night sweats are kicking my ass, has any one dealt with this??

8 days and 3 years later, still a non-smoker!

Still come here to encourage others.  If I can do it, you can too!  Yes, of course it was hard in the beginning, but everything worthwhile is!  Once I got past the first day, the first week, the first month and so on, it continued to get easier!!  So to those of you just starting your journey, stick to the basics:  Remember lots of fresh air and even more water.  Long walks, and giving your hands something else to do besides play with cigarettes, like taking up the art of sunflower seed spitting, or gum chewing, or model building, or anything but smoking!

Quitting smoking has been the best thing I have ever done for myself my whole life.  Do I miss it sometimes, sure.  But I don't have to smoke over it.  Not anymore.

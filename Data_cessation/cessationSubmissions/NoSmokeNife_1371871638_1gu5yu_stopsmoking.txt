Best time to quit is out of necessity

I have a shit job but after finally getting my loans paid back and a roof over my head I have come to the conclusion that cigs are simply a luxury I cannot at all afford. My phone will even be turned off tomorrow. I'm guessing its under these stressful circumstances that I will either succeed or fail. And since failure means eviction I'm quite sure it will go well. I stop smoking at 12am PST. Wish me luck and I will keep everyone updated on a 24 hour basis. Thanks for giving me somewhere to vent guys.

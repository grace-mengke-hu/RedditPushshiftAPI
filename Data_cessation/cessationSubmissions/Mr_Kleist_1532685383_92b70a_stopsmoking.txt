You probably won't get lung cancer but...

I've read a lot that suggests most smokers don't get smoking-related [cancers] (https://www.livescience.com/3093-smoking-myths-examined.html), although most people diagnosed with lung cancer are smokers or ex-smokers. I recommend this book called [Risk Savvy] (https://www.ft.com/content/c8b2c73e-e0ef-11e3-a934-00144feabdc0) by Gerd Gigerenzer if you want to learn more about risk and statistics - it also has an excellent section on smoking and health. I know many friends who point this probability out and continue to smoke, but like many of you here I have decided to quit and haven't touched a cig or weed for ten days now (longest most emotional journey ever). 

My Nan smoked for close to 50 years, and she has no signs of cancer. The trouble is she suffers from bronchitis, COPD, heart problems and was recently diagnosed with vascular dementia that the doctors believe was heavily influenced by her years of smoking. They say that the damage to her brain and the mini strokes she has had throughout her life are common in long-term smokers, and although she quit 15 years ago the damage she has done to her body cannot be undone. My Nan has been in decline in the last few years, and she is no longer the same person she was in her heyday. The COPD I think was the motivation for her to quit, but now she barely remembers stopping and sometimes doesn't even remember where she lives. I'm not saying that her smoking caused these, but many of the doctors we have seen over the years have bought it up and have mentioned how common these are in smokers and ex-smokers who smoked for extended periods. I think her stopping may have prolonged her life and possibly made it more bearable but trust me it is not a life at all. 

This sub has been a great motivator for me and for anyone who thinks they are statistically unlikely to get cancer, you are probably right, but you will most likely decrease your quality of life.

Time to quit this sub...

I'm proud to announce myself as an ex-smoker. Quitting was an accomplishment that I feel very proud of. With a few occasional slips  I was glad the day after those slips I had no desire of smoking. So here are a few things that helped me plow through the first weeks:

* throwaway last pack with some cigs
* Lots and lots of water
* Gum
* Relaxed environment first weekend
* Exercise almost everyday
* Wake up early
* Download app to monitor progress
* Ensure you're doing it for long-term reasons (health, change in lifestyle etc. opposed to only money or for someone else)
* Check ou the sub every once in a while
* Swedish death metal :)

I'll keep my subscription for a week. Feel free to comment and I'll provide feedack

Remember, consistency is the key

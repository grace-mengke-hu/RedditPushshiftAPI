Day 4

Day 4 approaching without nicotine and I think I can survive this. I don't like this withdrawal process but I can and have gotten through it without the world collapsing.... who knew :) 
BTW is it just me or is the repeated ecig conversation in this forum seem out of place? Yeah I know they've "stopped smoking" but hey you can give up injecting heroin and still be snorting the shit and still be no less of an addict...just saying.

Day 1, I'm done letting cigs control my life

Been smoking for 7 years.  I am done wasting money and killing myself.  Came to the decision while at the gym and feeling how hard I had to struggle for air.  This is going to be rough, but I am determined.

EDIT: thanks for the support guys, you're really helping me today!

Over 200 days! The cravings hardly exist anymore!

I sometimes think of smoking, but don't want it anymore. The craving hasn't gotten to me in a while now. 
I still sometimes think after a really nice long dinner with coffee and whisky and everything at the end 'a cigarette would be nice now'. But that feeling lasts for 20 seconds and then it reminds me of the smell of people smoking now that I don't smoke. Disgusting.

Anyways. Just here to show off my 200+ days badge now! Whoop!

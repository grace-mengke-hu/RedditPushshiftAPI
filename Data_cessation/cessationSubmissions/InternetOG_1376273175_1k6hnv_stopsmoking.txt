Went bar hopping this weekend, feel like crap

I must have smoked 5 packs in 48 hours, it feels horrible! Sore throat, bad taste in my mouth, my lungs feel tired. I feel like I am really ruining my body with this addiction. I have been smoking since I was 13 and just turned 21. With my introduction to the bar scene this year and with all of my friends and family members also being smokers I don't know how I'm ever going to quit although I think about quitting all the time and feel bad about myself almost every time I smoke. I've started reading Alan Carr as I have seen a lot of talk about it on here but I have my doubts about its prospective effectiveness considering the variables I'm surrounded with. Any tips would be really welcomed, I don't expect reddit to cure my addiction I know its up to me in the end, I suppose I am just looking for some advice. Have any of you tried quitting medications/patch/gum, did they work for you?

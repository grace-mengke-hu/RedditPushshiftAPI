I should quit but I don't want to... Anyone in the same boat? How do I change my mentality?

I was 18 when I had my first cigarette and it was due to the fact that all of my friends at that time were smokers. I would just smoke socially from time to time... maybe like once a month or once every two months. Until then, I was pretty on and off for until I turned 21... (I'm still 21... turning 22 in 2 months.)

Since then I started smoking regularly but not a whole lot like 1/2 a pack or a pack a day type of smoker. I smoke to release some steam from school stress, work, relationships, dieting, etc. Usually I would smoke 3 cigarettes a day and at most like 4-5 day, which isn't that bad, I suppose. Recently, I cut down to one a day or one every other day and so far it has been doable. I'm trying to quit just for the sake of "I shouldn't smoke" but nothing really compels me to really drop those cigarettes. But I've been feeling pretty down in the dumps these days and smoking doesn't really have the same effect as it had when I wasn't as sad. So I was thinking of quitting because I don't really relish my smoke break time as I did before. But I don't feel as compelled since it would be out of my routine to stop smoking, it feels weird to take out a regular part of my day.

Well, I had a doctor's appointment about a month or so ago and my doctor was telling me that smoking was the worst I can do for my body and that I could get cancer in my lungs, tongue, throat, gums, etc. The health risks did concern me for about 2-3 weeks or so, but as of now, I don't really... care. I know it's bad to think this way and I don't know why I am so apathetic about the unpleasantness of smoking. Maybe because it's been less than a year since I started doing it regularly so I feel like I'm not that "deep/bad" into the addiction and that I'm still "healthy." Maybe the mindset of the fact that I'm still fairly young makes me feel like I'm still okay...

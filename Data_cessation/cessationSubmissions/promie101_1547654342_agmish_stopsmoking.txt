Day 1 today! I'm very nervous. Last year I was 2 months in and relapsed.

I really want to quit. My family really wants me to quit. I've read the book, I've got the app. Previously I've tried NRT, it really helped until I tried to not use it. My job is very high stress and smoking is how I've always coped with it. But no more! Not one more puff!

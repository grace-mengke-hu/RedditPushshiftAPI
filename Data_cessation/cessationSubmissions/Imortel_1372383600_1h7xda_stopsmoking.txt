The time of reckoning is upon me

Hi all and thank god I read reddit else I wouldn't have arrived to this day.

Yesterday I found NoFap and StopGaming and yesterday I didn't fap and I've uninstalled all the games I had...

I've been smoking for 7 years and tonight I found StopSmoking and its time to stop that as well.

I'll be going for a hattrick with this. Should be fun throwing away 3 habbits...my brain is gonna be pissed!!!!

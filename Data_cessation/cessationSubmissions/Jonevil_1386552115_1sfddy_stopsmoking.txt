My second attemp to quit the stick, and I need your help :(

Ok keeping this short. 
last year, plans to stop smoking failed. also planned to buy one of those e cigs, but then i have my doubts (plus they're pretty expensive). 

This time, i want to be serious because im starting to feel my my chest become really heavy along with my breathing ( the type i usually feel after a 4k run) . 
oh and, i've just recently met a really nice lady that i don't want her smelling ol' human ashtray

so again, i really need some tips :( wil lyou guys help me out?

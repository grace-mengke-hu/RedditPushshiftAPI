Rough day

I'm hanging on by my fingernails today. It's been two and a half weeks since I quit. Unfortunately, it's been totally without support from friends and family. I don't have a single person who said more than "oh" when I said I'd quit. No one has even said "good job" to me once. It's been really, really hard. My husband is still smoking (he says he isn't, but he stinks when he comes home from work). I feel really alone and depressed today. Been crying for the past two hours, and all I want is a cigarette.

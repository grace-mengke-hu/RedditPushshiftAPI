At around 80-90 days, craving super hard

In the middle of a divorce &amp; still not smoking. Waiting on a phone call from my lawyer so I'm binge watching Sons of Anarchy on Netflix, and they smoke SO MUCH its driving me even crazier! 

I'm NOT gonna do it, though. For my singing voice, for my health, &amp; for my wallet, I'm NOT gonna do it! I'm losing my fucking mind, but I'm gonna turn off the tons-of-people-constantly-smoking-in-every-scene show, and go play guitar. Because I'm NOT gonna smoke.

Had to share my moment of solidarity. Good luck in all your struggles, ya'll. Gonna go play away my lust for a Marlb. Midnight. Fuck... x.x

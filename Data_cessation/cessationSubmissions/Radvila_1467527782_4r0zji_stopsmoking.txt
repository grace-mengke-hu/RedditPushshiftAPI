Relapse

I bought a pack yesterday, after 2 months of not smoking. Smoked maybe half of it. For some reason the wish to smoke has grown on me for the last few days and I just gave in, in a way, knowing that I will be able to quit again. Any advice, besides obviously throwing away the rest of the pack? Thanks.

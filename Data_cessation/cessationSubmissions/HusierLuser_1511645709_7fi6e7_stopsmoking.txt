Addiction question

So I just found this sub and I’m sure this has been asked before but I haven’t seen it. So I’m starting a new job the first week of December and won’t be driving for half my work day anymore so it’s a good time to stop right? I only smoke when I’m driving or drinking but lately I have been smoking at home (I usually dip at home.) Is it beneficial to pick up toothpicks or gum or just attempt to go cold turkey? My question of addiction is since I have only been smoking for about 7-8 years is it a tobacco addiction or an addiction with stimulating my.. mouth, face?  The longest I have been able to stop smoking was 3 months but I was still dipping, but I’m hoping to stop both. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

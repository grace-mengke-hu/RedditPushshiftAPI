That mild creeping, building bordem...

For a while now I have been trying to quit smoking I'm 23 and back to day one. I started smoking as something to do. In an effort to solve that mild and creeping bordem that constantly haunts me. All I have done is made it worse now my time has been filled with smoking instead of trying to find a healthy solution to the problem. Well I'm trying again. Using nicotine patches and here's hoping it kicks ads this time!

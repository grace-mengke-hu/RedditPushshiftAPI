I Want to Hit Rock Bottom, but Can't

Hey guys. I've smoked for about 3 years now (I'm 21) and am at a pack a day. Like anyone, I have a lot of reasons to quit. I'm constantly coughing, my lungs hurt in the morning, it's way too expensive, I smell terrible, and it has made my eye and neck motor tics significantly worse.

Now is the perfect time to quit. I'm not working and I'm only part time at University. The problem is, I don't think I want it enough. As angry and stressed as I am about being addicted, I still make constant excuses. "I'm trying a new medication", "I have a lot of schoolwork", etc, etc.

I've tried absolutely everything to try and psych myself into really wanting to quit, but it never hits me hard enough to really bite the bullet. I don't want to wait until I'm 30+. I don't want to wait until I NEED to quit because of the health risks. I want to quit NOW while I still have my health.

Is there anything I can do?

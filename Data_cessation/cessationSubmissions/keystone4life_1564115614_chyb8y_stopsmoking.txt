The first few days/weeks/months

I've quit before and I'm quitting again. Mainly because I notice how emotionally unstable I become when I smoke. I'm more irritable, more dependent, more sensitive, less focused, more distracted, I spend more money, I'm not as quick witted, confident, funny, charming, mindful, nice, friendly, enthusiastic, well mannered, and all other virtues. It's contributed to the failure of two serious relationships and some health issues(nothing permanent thank god). I've allowed it to be a drag on my self fulfillment, maybe because a part of me thinks I don't deserve it(but I know that part is wrong).

Tonight marks the second day of not smoking. I'm feeling quite vulnerable for a couple hours, then strong and brave for a couple hours, then it repeats. The fluctuations are wide, but I know that over time I will stabilize. I will fortify myself mentally by taking this opportunity to hone my patience, self love, friendships, perseverance, and drive. I had a break up last year and didn't smoke for a while but then decided to start up again. Since starting up I've been feeling like wanting her back desperately. I attribute this to the weak state I'm in when I succumb to smoking. I want her for the wrong reasons. Not out of love, but out of some unattractive neediness. I want to stop so dramatically pining for her in my mind. I want to meet new people and be proud of the person I present myself as.

Sometimes the hardest things to do are the best things for us. In fact this is usually the case. Pain and growth are two sides of the same coin. We learn from mistakes more than we learn from success. We are built to thrive when we are challenged. We are also our own biggest critics and sources of self doubt. The greatest battles are fought in our own minds. Not only must I remember that this short term indulgence is actually a detriment to my life, but I must remember to be easy with myself. To love myself completely, until I feel that I can share that love unconditionally with others. I must take things seriously, but not personally. Mindful and observant, without identifying with every thought.

This may not apply to everyone, but I seem to have an addictive personality. I tend to abuse things easily. So I have to take an extremely hard and mindful stance on some things. I have to be extremely vigilant not only with drugs, but with my own mind. I must constantly remember my self worth and that I deserve a life of value so that I don't cause a mental self destruction. My validation must always be from myself. After a while of sobriety I become relaxed and think I can handle some puffs, but this always leads to daily smoking and it begins to interfere with my life more than I would like. The cravings from trying to manage it and not having it constantly are bothersome, so it's best I don't indulge at all. I don't envy those that can manage drugs, I'm simply discovering that I am different than others. My heart desperately wants to love itself, and I simply need to get out of my own way.

Whenever I've stayed sober and focused for any length of time all sorts of opportunities and people began coming into my life. All of my best relationships plopped in my lap when I was in these self improvement states. Life will still oscillate between happy and sad, good and bad, but I will practice mindfulness and self love relentlessly so that I can overcome any challenge without foreign substances.

Our minds are powerful beyond measure. Rather fearing this power let's embrace it.

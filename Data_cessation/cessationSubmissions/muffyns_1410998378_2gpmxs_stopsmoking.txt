One Week In,will share some thoughts

So, i've read many posts on this subreddit and i want to make one too cause i really appreciate all the help i've received so far . My little story , smoker for four years 3 of them as a heavy 20+ smokes per day also combined with daily ganja smoking for about a year. I've been thinking of quitting for a long time maybe since i started but lately i was feeling so heavy on the chest and one night while i was having some beers with a friend we both made a bet to quit claiming that this was the last packet each of us ever bought, well i didnt even finish the packet and gave those last two fkers to my brother. I am really happy i quit i no longer cough every day at least 20 times , i feel so rested all the time except some rough days that i'd say are caused by withdrawal so it's ok,one of the best things is the time i dont waste thinking of wanting to smoke and smoking,finally i actually feel HEALTHY and i am sure i am done forever with this bullshit for i know everytime i am close to relapse remembering all the stories i've read here will save me, THANK YOU

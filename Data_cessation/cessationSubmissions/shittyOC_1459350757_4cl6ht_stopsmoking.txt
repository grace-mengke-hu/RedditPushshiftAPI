How long should I expect this cough to stay after having my last cigarette?

I understand that after you smoke, the process of healing the cilia in the throat can result in a pervasive cough. 

How long should I expect this cough to stay?  I'm 21 years old right now, been smoking since I was 16 years old.  The past three years I haven't gone three days without a cigarette.  Average 5-10 cigarettes/day, but going out to bars/clubs in Korea it would be 10-20 during the night. 

My last cigarette was 10 days ago. 

Thanks a lot.

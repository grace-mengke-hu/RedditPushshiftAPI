Occasional smoker, finding it hard to quit for good.

Hey Guys!

23,M, Started smoking at the age of 21, but very on and off. At first I used to smoke 4 cigs a day for around 6 months, excluding weekends where I would smoke 5-10 while drinking. This went on for 6 months, then I quit. 

Between then and now, I've barely smoked, only on maybe alternate weekends when I drink do I get the craving and I smoke 2-3 cigs. This has also been rare as I've been off smoking completely for sometimes almost a year in between.

However, I want to quit this too for good. The reason being smoking immediately starts to show its effects on me: My immunity drops like a bitch, my complexion becomes visibly darker and I feel little anxious and on the edge, which I feel is a good thing since it never allowed me to become a full fledged smoker in the first place.

MY PROBLEM: I am not able to control myself while drinking. As soon as I take the first few sips of alcohol, I start craving for a cigarette! Being a very rare smoker this should be easy to be honest, but I'm still finding it very hard cause that nicotine craving always remains innate in me. Other times I'm vulnerable to smoke is when I'm chilling somewhere and there's a beautiful scenery, long drives or basically when spirits are high and the slight kick of the cigarette would make things look beautiful! (Keep in mind I am an occasional smoker and hence a full cigarette does me a good buzz!). 

I have tried not carrying cigarettes when I go partying (since my friends hate sharing their cigs), but I always end up getting a strong craving and finding a cig from somewhere. 

Open to all kinds of advice and tips.

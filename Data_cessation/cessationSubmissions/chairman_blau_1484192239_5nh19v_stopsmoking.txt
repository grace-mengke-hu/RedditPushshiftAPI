One year today.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I smoked for eight years. 
2013 I quit for three months. Relapsed.
2014 I quit for 1.5 months. Relapsed.
2015 I smoked all the way through.
2016 I quit for a week, relapsed for a day, then quit again. Now it's been a year since I quit.

You got this. Even if your progress gets worse. Just keep trying.

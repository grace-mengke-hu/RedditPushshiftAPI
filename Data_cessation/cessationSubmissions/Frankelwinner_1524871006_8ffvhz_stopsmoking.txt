Just flushed my tobacco down the toilet.

Nearly a whole pouch after smoking a very satisfying roll up. 

The decision was made in an instant that it had to go NOW. 

As I flushed it away I had the overwhelming fear that I would regret it later, but I got rid anyway before I could change my mind.

Now the battle begins. 

I feel like I'm grieving for the devil that was killing me. 

I am 37 and I have smoked for 24 years. The longest I have given up before is 35 days. 

There might still be time to heal my lungs. Never underestimate the human body's capacity to recover.

The shame I feel is intense but I'm facing it head on and feeling it completely. Staining my teeth. Aging my skin. Making my beautiful innocent defenceless Norwegian forest Cat breath toxic passive smoke. Coughing up disgusting brown gunk. Â£13 every week that could be spent on innumerable useful additions to my life or saved up for an emergency that the universe may elect to blindside me with. 

So selfish and deluded.

This is serious business. I'm under no illusions. Its real life, a major addiction and a terrible life threatening affliction that is suffocating me. I will meditate through the withdrawals and the tears that always come on day 3. 

How dare the devil control my brain and convince me that I need his evil substance to function. 

The longing for the sweet smoke has already begun but I don't resist it. It is just a feeling that will pass. I embrace it and will enjoy the satisfaction as it fades and the dopamine canal is decommissioned. 

It's ridiculous how much of a challenge this is. Absurd. I refuse to participate in any emotional attachment to smoking. I'm staying happy through this because I'm in control of my mind and I'm grateful that I still have time to save myself. 

Sorry if this is bollocks but I felt compelled to share it with like minded people.

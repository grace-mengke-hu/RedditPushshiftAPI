Should I warn my husband?

I quit smoking today, after my 4-year-old caught me. He's never seen me smoke, never known I smoked, and I wanted to keep it that way. When he saw me smoking, he asked why I smoked, and I said "I've tried to stop, but I can't." He replied "That makes me sad. You should make better choices."

So I threw my cigarettes out, and now here I am 8 hours later craving a cigarette. I take Adderall, and that really seems to crank up the need for it. I have a hair tie on my wrist and my exercise bike if the craziness gets to me. 

My husband obviously knows I smoke (he's never smoked), and I know he'll be happy I quit. Should I warn him that after 16 years of smoking (sans pregnancies), I might have withdrawal and be kind of ugly, or just try and handle it myself? 

Thanks in advance!

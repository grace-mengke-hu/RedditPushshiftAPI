Almost at 30 days of reconditioning

I’ve smoked for 20 years and I’m going on day 30 cold turkey in another 10 hours. 

I read somewhere you’ve successfully quit when you’ve done everything you would have done with a cigarette without a cigarette. I’m astonished how much I’ve never done without a smoke. This is a pretty daunting task lol. 

But all wonder aside I’m smashing this quit. I feel good and go hours without thinking of smoking which is a vast improvement from every minute in the beginning. I’m keeping my guard up though. Not One Puff Ever. 

Stay strong, Friends. We’ve got this!

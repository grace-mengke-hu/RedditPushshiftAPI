Relapsed with 691 days

Hello all,

Just wanted to admit that I had a few puffs of smoke when I was under the influence of alcohol. It happened all so quick, I had maybe 2 puffs at the time and then immediately thought how stupid smoking was, I then gave it to someone else and went on back to my mates.

Now I'm not going to pick up smoking again, I do realise it is wrong for my health and goals. However I wanted to post that even though my count is back at one it shouldn't break my resolve.

I am a non-smoker and I hope everyone on their journey is to not get discouraged by relapsing. Keep at it! We're all going to make it :)

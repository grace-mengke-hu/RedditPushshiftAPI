Sports gave me a reality check

All my life I have considered myself an athlete until about a year ago when I switched from social smoker to an everyday smoker. 
I have stopped doing sports on a regular basis since I started smoking until recently. I started to feel that my lungs are not in the condition they used to be. I can't run as much as I want to. I could barely breathe after a couple of rounds. I'd even felt like I might faint in a few occasions. 
If you want a reality check of what cigarettes are doing to you. Give a shot in sports you will know.

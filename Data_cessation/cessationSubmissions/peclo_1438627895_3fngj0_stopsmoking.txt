I just got through the first thousand

Man, this is amazing. I used to smoke a pack a day. I did it for ten years, and I quit using this subreddit.

Of course, I don't use it as much as I use to, but I don't think I would have made it without it.

It is now really easy for me to not smoke, although sometimes I feel nostalgic, for like 5 whole seconds.

I always will be an ex smoker, and I pratice the NOPE : Not One Puff Ever.

It led me where I am.


Lots of love guys, and keep up the good work!

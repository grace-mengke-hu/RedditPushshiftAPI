Any short termers (quitting after a just few months)?

I don't relate to a lot of posts here. I quit smoking at 18 after a couple of years. Now 27, since then I've smoked for 3-4 months a couple of times and never had a problem quitting.

I've been smoking for the past 4 months and this time is really kicking my ass. I still feel terrible coming into my 5th day. Any other short terms experience variation between withdrawals? I don't remember it ever being this bad.

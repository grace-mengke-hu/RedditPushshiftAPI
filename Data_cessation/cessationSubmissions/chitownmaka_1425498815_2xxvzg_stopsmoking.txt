Mind over matter. it is all will power and the want to actually quit

Its day 24 :D and i don't smell.  i can taste everything.  my minor aches and pains are gone!  2 weeks before i quit smoking(12 year smoker, about 2+ packs a day) i gave up caffeine and alcohol, because they were triggers and negatively contributing to my smoking habit.  I smoked my last cigarette at 5 pm, went into LA fitness, got a gym membership and have been working out and not smoking ever since.. 7 days after quitting i went and had a drink i wanted a cigarette so i knew i wasn't ready to consume alcohol yet. 2 weeks in i had a glass of wine.  i could actually taste it and it was amazing, and i did not want to smoke.  i had 2 glasses ;)  i am saving so much money  if anyone reads this  and is having a hard time quitting download an application for your phone and see what the actual effects of smoking are.  since i quit almost 1 thousand smokers legs have been amputated.

I fell off the wagon momentarily, a couple of weeks ago.

I don't know what the ...oh, this is NSFW. ...fuck I was thinking, but the idea of ...trigger warnings and NSFW, ok?  ...of smoking one reared its ugly head. I spent the whole day arguing with myself to not do it, but you know how when you argue with yourself you can tell right off the bat that you're going to lose?  Well, I lost.  When I got home, I nabbed on of the wife's cigarettes and smoked the whole thing.

Tasted like shit and I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.  Hands and feet were all...distant and tingly.  But I survived.  Later on that night, I started a second, FREAKED the fuck out about it, doused it, and spent the rest of the night wondering if the human mind is just a puppet for the body.  ANYway...I'm not resetting my badge because I got back on the wagon immediately, saw even as I was doing it how stupid it was, and I'm doing good!

Also, just noticed today that I got my lungs back!  Woo!  So, *that* realization reminded me of my little oops a couple of weeks ago.

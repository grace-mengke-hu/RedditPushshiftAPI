Starting again

I haven't visited this subreddit for quite some time now, and discovered I still had a counter up. It was mighty depressing to see that I would have been at 395 days had I kept going; as it was I made it all of 30. 

Nonetheless, I'm starting again and I'm sticking with it. I had my last cigarette more than 24 hours ago, and I'm working through the cravings. I have no other choice. 

Here's to better health and more money!

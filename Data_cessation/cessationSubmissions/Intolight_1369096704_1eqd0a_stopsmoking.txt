E-Vaping - 1 week since a real cigarette. Best thing ever to happen for people trying to quit.

I've been a smoker for about 14 years.  I decided to quit last week once I bought an e-vape.  For people who don't know what it is, it's like an electronic cigarette but a bit bigger and you get to put whatever flavors you want in it.  It doesn't have any bad chemicals.  The only thing it has is nicotine and you can control the amount you want.

I got 18mg of nicotine in my bottle (roughtly 18 cigarettes worth).  The bottle lasts for about 10 refills (1 - 2 weeks depending on how often you want to vape).  So that's less than a pack of cigarettes worth of nicotine for a week.  No ash, smoke, and all the other harmful carcinogens.

It's been 1 week since a real cigarette and I haven't craved it in the slightest.  I have been puffing on this vaporizer constantly but it's a lot better than having even 1 cigarette.  

Breathing has become a lot easier and to be honest, I can go harder and faster for a longer while my lady and I get down to business.

It's been a lifesaver and I'm really glad I bought this.  I'm never going back to regular cigarettes, ever.

**Sidenote** - How do I change my flair so it says 7 days and not 698 days?

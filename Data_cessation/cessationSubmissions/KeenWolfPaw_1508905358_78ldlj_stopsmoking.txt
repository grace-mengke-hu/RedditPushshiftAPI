Incremental Withdrawal Method

I found this method while reading an article about sleep, the author calls it 'Incremental Withdrawal'. 

1. Count exactly how much you smoke per day. Let's call that number Baseline Count.

2. Take 95% of the Baseline Count and call it your Current Count

3. Every morning, make sure you put your Current Count into a cigarette box. Plan it as you wish, that box must be all you smoke on that day.
4. Do you feel any better on your 95% level? Do you feel you could sustain this indefinitely? If you feel strongly about those questions, reduce your Current Count by one.
5. Stick with your Current Count until you are really in a mood to make another step forward. Remember that reducing Current Count by more than one is risky to your resolutions. Remember that it makes sense to go through a whole constellation of days in your schedule (e.g. workdays vs. weekends) before you reduce your Current Count. Don't leap ahead before you are sure.
6. Go back to Step 3 and stay in this cycle until your Current Count drops to zero. Remember that the key to success is always feeling great about the procedure. You need to sense progress, and enjoy it without suffering too much of withdrawal consequences.

&gt;I like the incremental withdrawal method because it increases the chances of success. In addition, cold turkey is not without risks. Quitting is always great for your cardiovascular system. However, withdrawal can put a tremendous stress on that system.

Hope someone finds this useful.

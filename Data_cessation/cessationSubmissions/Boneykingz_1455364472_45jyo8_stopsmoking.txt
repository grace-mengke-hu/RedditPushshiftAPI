Day 1!

So ive smoked for nearly a year now after quitting for 3, today is the day that I quit smoking and I feel pretty good about it. I'm actually kind of enjoying the challenge and if I learnt anything from last time I quit it's that a positive attitude goes a long way. Good luck to anyone else quitting today!

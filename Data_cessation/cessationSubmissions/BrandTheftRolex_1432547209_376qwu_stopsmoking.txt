I'm really struggling today

I've quit cold turkey for just over 5 weeks.  This is my umpteenth time to quit.  I'm 36years old male and smoked for 20 years and 30 a day. Up till yesterday, I have been coping really well with my quit.  Here's a brief rundown on how it went for me in the past 5 weeks.

**Week 1** - It was tough, naturally. But that's normal.

**Week 2 to 4.**  -  I started having euphoric feelings, that I can get through this and everything in my life is changing for the better.  Everyday, I would be proud that I'm not smoking.  I wouldn't be feeling the need to smoke hardly and I was very capable to push away any thought of smoking if it came to me.  I could face other smokers as they smoked and not be phased.  I'm enjoying the experience.

**Week 5** - I've been anxious all week and it's really debilitating.   I can't focus.  Any ounce of stress (work, personal) gets amplified and I get uptight and just want to escape from it.   I know smoking would help but of course I am not going down that path.  Smoking may have been helping me most of my life with stress and anxiety to the point that I never knew that I may have a problem with anxiety.  I know that exercise will help, which I am doing regularly.  Perhaps certain foods in my diet could also help, including tea.  I am starting to look into meditation as a relief from the anxiety and stress.

**Today** - not really a stressful workday.  I'd normally take it into my stride.  But I just can't cope.  I'm gagging for a cigarette.  Of course, I will say "no way' but I just can't face it today and want it to stop.  I feel uptight and really anxious.... for no real reason at all.   Every little thing or thought process to get my work done is stressful.

Can anyone relate with me here?  Is this a temporary phase or do I really have an anxiety problem that's been suppressed all this time?

EDIT:  Just an after thought after posting this:  Could it be a possibility that my mind and body has got used to handling stress for 20 years with nicotine?  And now that I've quit good and proper, my mind and body are clueless how to handle stress?  Would that mean I have to "re-learn" to cope with stress through various techniques?

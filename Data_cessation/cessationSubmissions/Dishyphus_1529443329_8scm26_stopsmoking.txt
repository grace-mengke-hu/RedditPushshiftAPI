I smoked and it made everything worse.

It had been 55 days without a cigarette.  

The past few days have been "too rough" I told myself as I bought a pack of cigarettes.  My self hatred was already peaked from silly things that didn't warrant me smoking but I did it anyway.  The amount of shame, guilt and even more self hatred is through the roof right now.  I smoked three in total and feel sick, physically and emotionally.  My addict brain won even though I've been fighting so fucking hard over the past 55 days against it.  I feel lost and so shitty right now.   

My intention is to give the rest of the pack to a friend and start over.  I'm resetting my badge to keep me accountable.  Just because I want this so desperately to just be a slip up I need to remember that I lost today and need to start over.  I pray that I will stop beating myself into an oblivion about this in the coming weeks but right now... fuck am I at an even more low than I already was.  The past few days just got worse because the lies my junkie brain tell me.  

Ugh.  Just posting this because I'm sure some of you have done what I did and I hope there are some that got right back on that fucking horse and charged forward.  I think I can too just right now I feel like I'm the dirt and shit that gets trampled on by said horse.

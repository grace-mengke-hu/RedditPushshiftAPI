Day 2

I've made it to day 2 and even though I've watched the Allen Carr video and I understand I'm not missing out on anything good not smoking... I still have that empty feeling. I am such a creature of routine, I LOVE routine...not smoking is screwing with my need to keep up my routine.


I'm going to keep going, I'd hate myself if I failed...but this is so fucking difficult.... arrggghhh.

What difference does it make to not smoke?

It's been 3 days for me and the huge change is my energy when i wake up. Also my flat smells good (and i do too, even my breath in the morning is OK). 

I stopped because i got my wisdom teeth pulled out on monday but i hope to never smoke again now. 

For you, what did it change? Skin, smell, energy etc... 

I need some more motivation!

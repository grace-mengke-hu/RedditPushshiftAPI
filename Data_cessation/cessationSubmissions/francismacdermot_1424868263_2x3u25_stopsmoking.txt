Just starting out on my journey

So I stopped smoking yesterday, and I have to say that I feel relatively relaxed. This time definitely feels different to the last time I tried. I'm 23 and have been smoking for nearly seven years, watching old videos of my grandad who died 12 years ago really hit it home for me. In every video he had a cigarette in his hand. I don't want to be that age and still be in shackles, fighting for my health. I figure I'll drop in here now and again to help me along the road. Peace!

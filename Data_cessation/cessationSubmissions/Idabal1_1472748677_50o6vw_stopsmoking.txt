Third day today!

Third day! Yes I have the feeling a cig is in my head almost all the time. Yes When I have the feeling I really need a cig I have to stop and deep breath and drink water and stand up and move and try to think in something else. But I remember time by time why I was so sure about stop smoking when I was smoking that I don't want to go backwards anymore and looking forward my life is better without smoking. So I will be strong. This time is the time. All my support and strength too for everybody who quit just a short time ago. We will be here one day talking about weeks and months and years. But now one more day. Tomorrow a new one.

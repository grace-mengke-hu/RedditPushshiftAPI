Forgot to request a badge, but today is day 21.

What’s significant about twenty-one days? Well, according to Mr. Carr (who was a great help for me) twenty-one days – three weeks – is the time necessary for nicotine receptors to shut down. The chemical addiction is gone. Now only the mental triggers exist and, thankfully, they have proven so weak they’re hardly worth mentioning. I owe a debt of gratitude to you, r/stopsmoking; a source of information, motivation, and beyond anything else – for a guy surrounded by smokers who seem to almost uniformly lack the drive to quit – an invaluable sense of community. Nineteen years have passed since my first smoke, but finally I feel I’ve broken the habit for good.

And so can you.

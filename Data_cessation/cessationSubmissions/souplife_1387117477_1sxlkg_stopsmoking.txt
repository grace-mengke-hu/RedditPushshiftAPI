Well, here goes!

I quit drinking just over three weeks ago (shout out to /r/stopdrinking!), and now that I've got some sober time under my belt I feel ready to tackle my smoking habit. I'm really looking forward to breathing easier and saving some serious cash. 

This isn't my first attempt, but I have a good feeling about it being my last!

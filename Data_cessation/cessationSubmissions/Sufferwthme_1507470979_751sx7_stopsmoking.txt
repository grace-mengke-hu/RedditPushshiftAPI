2 years of smoking, will my stamina recover?

I’m 17 now soon to be turning 18 and I’ve just quit smoking, I’m now almost at 6 weeks. I decided to quit to help improve my stamina for boxing. The only reason I started smoking cigarettes in the first place is because I started smoking weed and here in the Netherlands we smoke joints with tabacco and weed mixed. (I also quit smoking weed) 
Now I’ve been smoking for 2 years and my question is: will my stamina recover completely or will some permanent damage maintain that prevents the recovery ? My breathing has recovered immensely but I know my stamina was better before I started smoking. On an average day I smoked about 4 cigs but days when I went out drinking it was more like 12.

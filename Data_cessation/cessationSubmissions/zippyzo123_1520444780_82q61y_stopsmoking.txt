Slipped up but was a lesson learnt

So after 2 weeks I had a “smoking day” yesterday, was my friends bday and really fancied a cigarette with my glass of wine at our lunch date, so I pinched some off her and then bought a pack of my own, smoked a few of them. Woke up this morning and threw the rest away, I’m pleased to say they all tasted like shit, we definitely are not missing out, and today I’m back on the wagon after learning a lesson. Hope your all well x

Quitting all over again.

So, I quit recently for about a month and a half, but ended up going back to smoking after a few drinks one night. Really stupid decision, but I guess I'm paying for it now. It's almost kind of funny because I didn't just gradually start smoking again. More like I went from 0 to 60 mph in one night and was back to being a heavy smoker in a matter of a few puffs. So, having accepted the lesson, I'm ready to quit again and make it last this time.
I'm on day 3 right now, which feels like every bit of a third step in a marathon, but it's proving to be a little easier this time. I think past attempts have shown me what works and what doesn't, which is proving to be really beneficial. For instance, I'm not drinking anymore and I'm going out of my way to avoid cigs. However, something roadblocked my progress for a few minutes this afternoon, which brings me to the whole point of this postâ€¦
I was getting a ride home from a co-worker when she asks, "Hey, promptplatypus, want a cigarette?" I politely decline, but she lights one up anyways. Had I not been a mere matter of minutes from my home, I might have caved. Which feels really bad that something as fucking stupid as nicotine has THAT much power over me.
So, I guess the point of this post is to reintegrate myself with this sub and provide a small bit of advice from a previously failed quitter. NEVER let your guard down. Even (maybe even especially) when you haven't smoked for a while, your scumbag brain will try to convince you that one won't hurt. Fortunately, you can tell scumbag brain to get fucked.

Cheers to quitting again!

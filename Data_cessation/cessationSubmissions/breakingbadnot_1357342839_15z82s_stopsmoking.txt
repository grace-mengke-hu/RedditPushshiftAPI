Should I reset my badge?

New years comes along, a few drinks, friends and familiy, good food...
The urge to smoke started growing since 6:00pm and became a monster by midnight. I lost sight of my motivation, my mind got cloudy, the desire was all I could think about. Plenty family members and friends were smoking, I just had to pick one and ask for a cig... I had made  up my mind! 
Told my dad, who hates cigarretes, he got me a cigar, Padron, from Honduras. Beautifull dark brown stinky tobaco. I smoked it, got a bit nauseus my tounge got irritated, I disliked it.
Fast forward 4 days, and I havnt craved another smoke, feel glad I didnt smoke a cigarete although my cigar probably gave me 10 times as much nicotine!
Thing is, I dont want to reset my badge, I feel the cigar was like a nicotine patch to deal with the craving... What does this comunity think, can I keep my (hard earned) badge?
Should I?

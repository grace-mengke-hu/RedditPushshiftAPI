Want to help my friends stop smoking

Hello, basically I have two friends who both have started to smoke quit a lot and I have only just realised this after going on holiday with them (I knew they smoked but not as much as they did).  I have spoken to them about quitting and they want to but they always say things like I will do it next month etc etc.  So I was wondering what advice people could give to me to help them stop.  They also say that they love the feeling of rolling cigarettes as well but I haven't found any healthier alternatives online.  Of course I don't want to force them too much as I know it is their choice but I am just really concerned for them.  So all in all I would like to know:

1) How to talk to them about stopping smoking and make them set and stick to a date.
2) What alternatives I can buy them in the meantime to help them on the way (it doesn't matter how expensive they are).
3) Anything else that I should know about how to support someone who is trying to quit smoking.

Thank you for your help!

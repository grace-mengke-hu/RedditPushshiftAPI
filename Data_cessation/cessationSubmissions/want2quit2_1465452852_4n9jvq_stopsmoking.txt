Trying, but lack motivation

I've tried so many times to quit and keep coming back. I signed up for a half marathon to quit, but can still smoke and run. I keep forgetting why I am even quitting. Why can't I remember the benefits. When I quit I have a few days and don't feel like myself so I start again just to feel normal. This is hard! Any advice is much appreciated.

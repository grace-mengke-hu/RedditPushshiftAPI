Recognizing the bad influences

Started over again yesterday. I’ve always been able to get past the physics addiction part of it without much pain, but I fall into bad habits when I’m around friends who smoke. It’s hard to be a part of the music scene, because so many people smoke cigarettes.

Everyone in my band smokes. Last night when they went outside after practice, I said I had to leave and took off. We’re playing a show tonight, and then I’m going to isolate myself from bad influences. 

Last time I went nearly 30 days without, and it felt great. I want that feeling long term. I’ve started biking, and this week’s rides were way tougher than when I was smoke free.

I got this. You got this.

I'm now adaquately prepared

Went to the dentist today and gained yet another reason for quitting. I've spent too much of my life in a strong relationship with cigarettes and today I'm ready to break it off for good. I'm going to go cold turkey and supplement my life with tea and a better diet. Let today be the first day of a better life.

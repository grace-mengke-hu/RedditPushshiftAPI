1 month down! Physically I never felt better, but

What a long month it's been. My grandma had to move into my parents house. Lost a great potential job offer after being unemployed forever. Gf went off to college. And now our relationship is on the rocks again. Decided to stop toking for job hunting. And well I'm more than thankful for those patches. I haven't slipped once. And I'm getting super fit. So hell yeah quitting smoking is the best decision I have made in quite awhile.

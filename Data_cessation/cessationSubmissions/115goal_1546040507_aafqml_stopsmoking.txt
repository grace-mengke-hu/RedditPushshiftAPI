I enjoy smoking only while listening to sad music and now don't know how to enjoy music without smoking?!

I've been a casual smoker for the last 5 years. By casual I mean I never consistently bought packs, always thought I was relaxed about the whole thing, only smoked when I was sad and wanted to be a pensive douche as I listened to music. But then when I moved back to my home city unemployed and bored out of my mind, I've been smoking my mom's cigarettes every day now, and I'm panicked because I can't seem to stop. The longest I've gone is 7 days, but then I hear a sad song, and I'm soooo desperate to listen to the music and smoke at the same time. I read allan carr's book, I downloaded apps, etc, but for me it's not the nicotine  -- it's genuinely the habit of listening to music in private and smoking 1-2 cigarettes.

It's almost like the physical embodiment of the nostalgia I feel when I'm listening to some songs. Instead of just sitting with the sad, bittersweet feeling the song invokes, I feel like I can enjoy the song more while smoking. Now I was plannig to stop again by trying to say I gotta look at smoking the way I do veganism (i.e. I never worry I'll break the willpower of being vegan, don't count days I'm vegan, etc, because it's so inherently something I know I am if that makes sense) but then the national accidentally played on shuffle and now I want to smoke and use waiting for reddit to respond to start again tomorrow! Help!!

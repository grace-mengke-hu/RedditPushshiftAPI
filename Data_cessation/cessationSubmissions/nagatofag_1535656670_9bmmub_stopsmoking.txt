Unusual aggressiveness on a second day

Have been quitting two times before.
Due to my wife being mad at me when I smoke, usually smoked Monday to Friday, and easily avoided puffing for two days during weekends. Without any efforts, easily abstained from smoking during holidays (two weeks and more in a row).

This time, on a second day, I found myself being rude to colleagues on a several occasions. I'm trying to suppress it in me, but I feel tons of irrational hate inside.

Those of you, who had similar problem, how did you deal with it?

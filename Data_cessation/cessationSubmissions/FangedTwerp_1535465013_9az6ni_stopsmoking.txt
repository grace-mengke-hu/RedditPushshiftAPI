11 months of depression after quitting?

Has anyone experience a significant upswing in depression and anxiety symptoms lasting nearly a year after quitting?

I used nicotine from age 18 to 33 in an attempt to self-medicate for anxiety and depression. I quit 11 months ago after very gradually tapering off on nicotine lozenges: 4 mg/day for a month, then 2mg, then 1mg. Quitting was not fun but, after the muscle pains passed in the first few days, it wasn't as miserable as I'd expected. 

The problem was that quitting left me an anxious and depressed wreck which deeply harmed my professional and personal life. I started seeing a psychiatrist and began taking Wellbutrin for ADHD/depression but the anxiety persisted. 

I took a nearly homeopathic dose of nicotine yesterday, maybe \~.5 mgs in lozenge form. I feel wonderful today: depression fog gone, anxiety quelled, sharp and alert but relaxed, etc., although I hate the nicotine vasoconstriction.

Has anyone else experienced such a severe reaction to quitting? Or to returning? I can't find any account or study documenting long-term depression after quitting. Perhaps the nicotine is simply displaying its antidepressant effects. 

I may need to talk to my psychiatrist. I'm loathe to return to nicotine but the effects are too drastic to ignore.  Thanks for any input.

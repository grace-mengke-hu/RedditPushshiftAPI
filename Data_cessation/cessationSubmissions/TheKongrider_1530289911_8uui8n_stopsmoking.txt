I need help to get my SO to stop smoking

We passed her date to stop smoking about a week ago and she doesn't seem to have the will to do it. I smoked cigs way back when we first started dating but now we have a 15month child together in the same appt and I can't understand how she hasn't been able to stop. She has been taking Chantix and has cut down to 4 a day instead of close to a pack but it seems impossible for her to take that next step to completely stopping. Shes tried the Suorin but always seems to misplace it and just goes back to smoking cigs. I need help.

How did you get over the alcohol trigger?

I'm probably going out to the bar tonight with some friends. I'm going to limit myself to one drink, two if I'm feeling absolutely fine.

I quit once before for 3 months and alcohol is what did me in. How did you get over the habit of associating tobacco with alcohol? This is probably my strongest (if not my only) trigger, but I feel ready and I'm not going to smoke tonight no matter what my brain tells me.

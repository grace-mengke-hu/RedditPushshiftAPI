Quit smoking 7 years ago. Feeling the strong urge again for some reason.

I don’t know why but I’m getting urges to buy a pack of cigarettes. Got a cigar the other week to get it out of my system. Then 4 or 5 days later I got out one of my old tobacco pipes. Mouth stopped feeling raw just yesterday. 

Anything to avoid a cigarette as that is what I really want. May try some patches. 

Anyone ever get this years after quitting?

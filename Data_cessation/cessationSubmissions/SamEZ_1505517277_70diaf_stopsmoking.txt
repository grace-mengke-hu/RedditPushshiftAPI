HEY MOFOS... NO MORE EXCUSES JUST STOP WE ALL KNOW IT SUCKS BUT ALL IT TAKES IS DOING NOTHING!! STOP NOW!

Today's day 6 for me! I recently turned 27 and have been smoking every day since I was 17 basically right after basketball ended my senior year. I'm finally starting to feel myself moving over the hump after a few sleepless nights and days laying in bed nearly grinding my teeth thinking about it... but you know what the cravings pass... the world smells better... I feel like I have a lot more time on my hand and that there's some light in this tunnel. 

Remember the reasons why you want to quit, get an app because now I feel compelled not to reset that number and let's all get through this bullshit together!!

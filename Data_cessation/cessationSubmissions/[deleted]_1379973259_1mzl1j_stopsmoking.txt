I Just cant stop myself

I have tried to quit over 20 times now. When I smoke I feel terrible and when I stop I feel great, but it isn't enough to deter me from continuing to smoke. 

A big problem is Alcohol. I am not an alcoholic and certainly do not drink every day. But when I do drink, the urge to smoke intensifies to an extreme level. I am starting to think that this is something I'll have to also give up to be able to successfully quit smoking.

I can make it about 6 to 7 days without smoking, then some strange thing in my head convinces me that its not really worth quitting and that I should just smoke a cigarette. Then there is all the other triggers like driving, drinking coffee, being around smoking friends, going to a store where you see them behind the counter etc etc. 

Have any of you guys felt this way? were there any small things you did that made this less of an issue?

I am determined to quit and have realized that my constant attempts at white knuckling it are pretty much futile.

At this point I have smoked for 10 years and am currently 26 years old. 

Would like to hear from anyone who might be able to help me kick this depressing habit once and for all. 

a thousand thanks in advance.

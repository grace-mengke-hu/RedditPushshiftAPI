So it's been two years for me and I've hardly ever slipped up, I literally never crave a cigarette but the only thing that remains is that social aspect of smoking. What types of things do you guys suggest I do to fill in the social/habitual gap that smoking left.

Like for example I used to love that I was actively going outside everyday, I'd sit and smoke and take in the scenery relax everyone would come outside too and we'd talk on the porch for a brief moment and head back in. Idk I was just a ritual I used to love that I find doesn't happen anymore. I try to sit outside but I just sort of stand there stupidly and Im not tryin to garden or something that's time consuming. Another example that gets me is like at a party or outing there's always those times I used to be like hey 'you wanna go outside an smoke?' To people, and it was a nice little calming intimate moment amongst the clutter that allowed you to really talk with someone without being odd or having any weirdness, but now I can't really be like "oh hey you wanna leave the party and stand outside with me for a couple of minutes and small talk alone?" Idk just imagining that is kinda awkward...so yeah any tips? It seems trivial but it's these specific moments that I end up slipping up, and I feel like I could do something I haven't thought about.

Withdrawals After Only 2 Cloves

I’m in a terrible situation right now. I only smoke from time to time, maybe 3 times a year on average, and I’ve never experienced addiction or withdrawal before. On Saturday night that changed. I smoked two clove cigarettes (Djarum black), which I had smoked before when I was younger. 

Ever since then I have been in hell. I have horrible headaches, a cough that won’t stop, I’m shivering like crazy, wake up in the middle of the night coughing, and my legs ache really badly. It’s been two full days of this now. I’m so confused why this is going on so long when it seems like there wouldn’t be much damage for my body to dispose of. Does anyone know of someone who had this experience? I’m certainly not keeping up this occasional smoking anymore after this.

How to deal with parties when your buddies smoke?

I have noticed that my will-power is weakest when I am drinking and when people at a party  
are smoking, it is easiest to slip.  What strategies have you guys used to deal with this situation?

After saying, I am trying to give up - some of them keep offering me a cig. I end up giving in every time.

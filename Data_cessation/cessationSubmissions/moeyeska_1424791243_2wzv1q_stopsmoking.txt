I know the patch i just a temporary solution but..

I just recently stopped smoking I'm proud to say it's been six days already. But I've been using the patch. Is there anyone who has successfully stopped smoking using the patch? And if so what steps did you take? I started with step one. Is it necessary to continue through all steps? I've smoked for about 10-11 years and I've had serious cravings but only because of stress. I want to quit and I am dedicated to not smoking again. But I just don't know what to do. I've been exercising and drinking lots of water but I'm just really curious to know your thoughts on the usage of the patch. Good or bad?

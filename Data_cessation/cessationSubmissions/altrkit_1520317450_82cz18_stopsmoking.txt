Help me

I FEEL DISGUSTED! Ive been smoking for the last 18 years with a break of 1 year 4 years ago. I want to quit, but everytime i strt my quit i get depressed and missing it and with full of loathing i light one. I know its killing me and i want to quit them for being around as long as i can for my children (i have 2) and wife. Sometimes i just want to cry at this helplessness and i curse the day i started every time i light one. Recently my quit length had been around 18hrs before i start feeling depressed and missing the taste and hit of cigarettes. I know im miserable and pathetic. Calling out to all for a SOS. Ive read tons of material and i want to quit but i just cant.

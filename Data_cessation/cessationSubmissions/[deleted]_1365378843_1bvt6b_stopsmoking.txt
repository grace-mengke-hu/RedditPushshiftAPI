I could use a little support over the next week or so.

Hello,

This is the last day that I will smoke a cigarette.  After years of on-and-off smoking, a large number failed attempts to quit, and a significant other who started to smoke because of me (he/she recently quit, thank god), I need to do this.  

I'm writing in hopes that some of you fine folk will check in with me over the next week or so.  I don't intend to depend on r/stopsmoking, I'm just trying to add as many layers of support as I can. 

If anyone would like me to do the same and message with check-ins, please let me know.  Congratulations to all of you on quitting/deciding to quit.

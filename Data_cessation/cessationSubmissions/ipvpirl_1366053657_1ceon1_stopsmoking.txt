Day one. With help.

I've been smoking a pack to three packs a day for the past four years. After hearing quite an inspirational quitting story (woman in my church quit this year cold turkey after 5 packs a day for years), I decided that it was my turn. I have a patch on today (a friend gave it to me. Called nicoderm cq) and it is quite effective. Although now I know why they say hairless (ouch) area to be applied. I'm going to pick some more up today (after some research). Now all I'm worried about is the habits that I picked up (going outside to smoke, etc.)

I've tried quitting before many times but haven't had things like the patch to help me (mostly negativity through smoking which didn't help) and the occasional beer increases my craving so much,  so hopefully this is it. I apologize for the long message, but caffeine.

Day 5 and still going strong, sorta...

Did anybody else actually find it harder as the days went on? I was told the first few days were the hardest, but its just getting harder :( I'm loving the new taste and smells, but I do miss that sweet smell of a roll up, it feels like I've lost a friend, even though it was a friend trying to kill me..

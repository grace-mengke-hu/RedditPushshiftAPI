I had a hyper-reallistic smoking dream, last night.

In the dream I was outside McDonald's and I lit a cigarette, started smoking it when the realization hit me: I had been smoking an occasional cig for the last couple days, which meant my streak was over and that I'd have to reset.  I felt so bad, knowing that I came so far and that I let myself down.  

Then I woke up and realized it was only a dream.  The joy I felt was only surpassed when I looked out the window and saw that it snowed!  

Anyway, I've had a number of smoking dreams in the last 19 months, and in each one I think about this group.  Y'all are tremendously important to me and every ex-smoker out there.  Thanks for helping me quit!

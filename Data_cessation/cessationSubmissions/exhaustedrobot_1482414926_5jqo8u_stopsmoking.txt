Stopping smoking starting today

Been smoking for 4 years and wanted to quit for most of them. Decided I'd stop smoking for the new year, but run out of baccy so I'm starting early. I normally smoke about 10-15 a day but have cut down to 1-2 since getting home for Christmas last week. 

Planning on going cold turkey, and going to leave ID at home for a while so I don't get tempted to buy more (I'm 20 and look younger, never get served without ID). Also going to put aside the Â£10 a week I would have spent on cigarettes and save up for something nice.

Any other advice for staying motivated and resisting cravings? It's only been about 20 hours since I last smoked and it's basically all I can think about.

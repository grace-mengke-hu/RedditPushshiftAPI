guidance needed!

I am 20 year old male and I'm a fairly heavy smoker. I feel it is time to quit.  Besides the obvious I just generally feel shitty and I really really want to try and quit. As I am typing this out I am puffing on hopefully my last cigarette ever. What are some tips and tricks that the reddit community at large has found useful? Thanks for any help you all can offer!

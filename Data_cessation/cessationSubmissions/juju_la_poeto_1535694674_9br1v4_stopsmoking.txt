trying to stop the urge

I've been smoking lesser and lesser sticks for the past few days, and today is the second day since I last smoked. Frequent urges to smoke just one stick is haunting me every time and it drives me crazy. 

So what do you guys do when that spectre of smoking just one stick haunts you?

Zynan Not Working

I had been quit for over 1 year and 6 months and right before the holidays I tried to just have a few while I was out.  Both  times quit tobacco successfully previously was with Zyban/Wellbutrin.  

First time I just stopped right away.  Second time I didn’t think it was working but Day 9 they started to taste really weird.  Day 10 I took one puff and puked and I was good.

This time I’m on Day 14 and still really enjoy smoking.  A few times last week I almost puked but now they taste normal again and I can smoke a whole one without any problems.  I’m worried I went to the well one too many times.

Having a really tough time getting started

I want to quit so bad. I feel like shit all the time and I just found out that my fiance is pregnant, so now is the time. I smoked one yesterday morning and threw the rest of the pack away. I made it to about noon today and started freaking out and went, bought a pack, smoked one, and gave the rest of the pack to the lady in line behind me. This is always my problem. I hate smoking and I hate the way I feel when I slip up like this. I was so proud this morning of having made it 24 hours, now I have to start the stupid clock again.

Any advice for someone like myself who keeps getting sucked into the "Just one more" trap? I feel like a total failure.

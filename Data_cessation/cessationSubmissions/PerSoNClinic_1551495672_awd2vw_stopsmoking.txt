I love to have your feedback to make it work for you. Would you give it a try and give us your feedback. 

FYI: we created PerSoN based on NIH research and in collaboration with 9 different researchers. however you are the ultimate judge where we are on right direction or not. We think we are :-) 

Love to hear from you.

So I'm coming closer to the conclusion that I should quit

So I've smoked for a little over a year, not much I know, but I've gotten dependent/addicted. At this point I'm about 2 packs a week if I'm lucky, usually closer to 2.5. 

Anyways, its hurting my health. I don't exercise anymore, so I'm falling into bad shape. I don't enjoy the bastards anymore, I just smoke on impulse. Furthermore, they cost a ton of money (which I don't have), and, more seriously, they're causing some slight insomnia, and exacerbating some issues I have with depression.

I've considered quitting before, but now I really feel like smoking is the biggest weight in my life. If I can throw that off, maybe I can start getting everything else in order.

r/stopsmoking, I have no idea where to go with this; I'm assuming there are some pro-tip people on this subreddit who can get me started.

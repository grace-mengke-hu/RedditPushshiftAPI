How long is using the gum appropriate?

Hello friends. 

I quit at New Years which I'm thrilled to have accomplished..might be the only resolution I've ever actually held onto this long. Though there is still plenty of time ahead, so we'll see. In any case, I am curious about other peoples experiences using Nicorette gum. 

I use cinnamon Nicorette, 4mg pieces and I eat half a piece at a time.... Same price for 100 pieces for 2 and 4 mg so I figure it's a better deal. Anyhow, I usually eat 2-4 pieces a day and was wondering how long I should go until I wean myself off of it. It's kind of a both a dependence on the nicotine as well as a security blanket. 

Thoughts and advice welcome. 

Thanks, in advance.

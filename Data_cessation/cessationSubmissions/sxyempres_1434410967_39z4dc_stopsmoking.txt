2 weeks strong!

June 1st was day one of being smoke free, and I still am! Now, Saturday was hard. I was at a couple of parties and everybody was smoking, not to mention I'd had a few drinks. But I held strong. However, I did have people blow smoke in my general direction so that I could smell it. But no puffs... :-)

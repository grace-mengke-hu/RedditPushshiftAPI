Needing support...

Haven't had a cigarette since last Wednesday. Feeling like I really want one but I know I will let myself down as well as my friends. Any ideas on how to  either clean things up where I usually smoke or something I can do to take my mind off it? Only been smoking about 9 months but it got to a point where the people around we're just disgusted with my pack a day habits. Any support is appreciated.

I got into a fight with my boyfriend.

It's day three for me. Quitting so far has been relatively easy thanks to Allen Carr's book. It's been the hardest at nighttime, but I get through it. I've been enjoying the benefits already, and have no intention of ever smoking again. 

Then my live-in boyfriend and I got into a huge fight. He is staying at his moms house tonight because of this and I will be alone. I don't intend to smoke at this moment, but I am worried about later tonight. A week ago I would've watched tv and chain smoked for a few hours to calm down and keep myself occupied. Tonight I'm already fighting a craving and no one would know if I did go buy a pack and smoke. So I'm telling you guys. 

TL;DR - Got into a fight with my SO and want to spend the night alone chain smoking. 

Edit: My best friend came over and we watched The Walking Dead. Didn't smoke!

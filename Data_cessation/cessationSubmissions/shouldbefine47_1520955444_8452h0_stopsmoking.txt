I slipped. Do I reset the timer?

Quit 3 months ago, had really bad cravings for a few days and today I decided to say screw it. Had one cigarette, remembered how utterly useless they are and how they aren't what I was romanticizing them to be in the last few days. Do I reset the timer? Do I keep "being a non smoker"?

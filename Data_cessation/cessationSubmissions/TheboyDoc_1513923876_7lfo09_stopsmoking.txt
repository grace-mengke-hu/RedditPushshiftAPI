Almost quit. Need help with the last lap.

So I have finals in about 2.5 weeks. I started in college and have managed to bring it down to 3-4 a week. I work out and lead a healthy lifestyle otherwise. When I don't smoke at all for 2-3 days I get really crazy cravings and have to have one cigarette which tides me through the next 2-3 days. How do I kick away these cravings ? Do I take the gun or should I finish off my exams and then totally quit. If I give myself leeway I know I'll use exams as an excuse and make my habit go upto 1-2 a day. Please help.

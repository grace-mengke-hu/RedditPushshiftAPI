Don't use calendars, using January 1st as a starting point.

I'm 25, male, Australian who's been smoking for 6 years as of today (Jan 1st 2017) and have finally come to accept that it's time to kick this demoralizing quality of life and financially burdensome monkey off of my back.

I'm not very well organized in terms of keeping track of dates so I've decided to use the first day of 2017 as my starting point for a cleaner, better lifestyle.

I really hope I can stay consistent in my resolve to quit this crippling addiction. I haven't informed any of my friends or family about it and would prefer to keep it quiet for a while, I'm also going to distance myself from the friends and family who smoke as well for a while so I can better enable the impulse to deaden. 

Been a lurker for a good year trying to work up the guts to eventually quit, so I'm just posting to say I'm ready to give it the good old Harvard try. 

Cudos for the inspiration and literature over the past years, guys.

P.S. Happy New Year!

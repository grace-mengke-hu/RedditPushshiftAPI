Constant phelgm. 21 years old, is this normal?

I quit smoking it's been 3 months now.
I smoked for 4 years starting at 17 until now being 21. 
 
Basically I wake up everyday with clogged nose and boogers having to be blown out first thing in morning, and every now and then there's black/gray streaks and then throughout the day many boogers and I sneeze many times every single day is this normal?

Thank you and God bless !

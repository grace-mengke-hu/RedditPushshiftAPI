One day down

So last night I was browsing reddit before bed, and my last smoke, and stumbled across this subreddit.  I want to quit, but someone had posted something that really resonated with me.  I have always said I'm quitting, but now I just say I'm not a smoker.

What's more, most of the smokers in my family have quit and I'm one of the last people out of all my friends/family that still do it.  I hate myself when I'm around them because not only do I feel weak compared to them, I can tell they smell it on me. 

I'm tired of being the smoker in the group.  I'm tired of my lungs hurting before my legs when I go for a run.  I'm tired of cigarettes being my crutch.  I'm done smoking, and I look forward to posting my progress here!  Cheers!!

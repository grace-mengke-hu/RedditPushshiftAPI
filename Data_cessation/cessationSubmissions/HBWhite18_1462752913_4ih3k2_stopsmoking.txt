The "First"

The first are the hardest. Well, for me they are. I am a 70 day non-smoker. (Yay and Go Me) I've have gained 417 hours of life, I have not smoked 2,435.7 cigs and I have saved $750.00. This is all good, but the "FIRST" is still tricky. These are my "cravings". The first time I did this or that (without). Examples, the first time I woke up and had coffee to the first time I traveled. The "first" are very hard. There is nothing I can say but.. It's the first time I got up and didn't crave. It's the first time I can say I'm a non-smoker (AND I DO IT DAILY, BUT IT COUNTS, DANG IT), It's the first time I can take a deep breath in years. It's the first time I'm not weezing. So, If your first is hard... BREATHE!!!! YOU CAN DO IT

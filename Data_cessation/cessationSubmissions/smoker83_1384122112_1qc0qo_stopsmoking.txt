Quit 5 days ago

Hello everyone. Long time lurker, long time smoker. Like many I have tried to quit so many times its hard to count. I got lucky and got a little help with a huge sickness that made smoking tough. I have gone through this before but usually just powered through to have that needed smoke. Not this time.

Thank you everyone for your great stories and advice. You give me hope that after 15 years of smoking I can still kick the habit.

About 5 months post vape and 17 months post cig. Feeling like caving.

I just cannot shake the urge lately. Everything has been reminding me of the good old days with cigarettes. It’s been lingering for a month or so now. I’ve been really close to caving in and buying a cigar. 

I’m considering charging up my vape and having a good low nicotine juice on hand just in case. I’d rather have that be what I cave to than a giant cigar or a pack. Is that smart or will it be all the more tempting?

Have any of you quit all together and gone back to vaping once in a while without going back to a full blown addiction?

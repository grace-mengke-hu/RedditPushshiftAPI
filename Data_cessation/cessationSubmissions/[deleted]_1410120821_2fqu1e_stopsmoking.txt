I guess I missed my 30 day mark

It's been over a month since I've had an analog cigarette.  I've been vaping to curb the cravings and I've worked my way down from 24mg to 6mg.  I'm almost done with my current bottle of vape juice and I'm thinking of leaving the e-cig behind soon.  I plan on resetting my badge when that happens.  Also, I feel like I will need something to chew on to replace the actual physical habit.  I've heard carrots are good for that.  What helps/helped you all with the physical habit?

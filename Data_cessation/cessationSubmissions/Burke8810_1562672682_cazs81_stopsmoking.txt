I’m on day three and I am an emotional mess

Hey everyone. Started smoking a pack a day at 14 and I’m a month away from turning 31. I’m on day 3 of quitting and my cravings aren’t horrible and I’m super glad that I’m a non smoker but I’m having a hell of a time regulating my emotions. Like the smallest things from my wife make me feel like it’s the end of the world and we’re doomed for divorce or something. I’m not much of a cryer but spent a lot of time yesterday crying like a baby and I’m getting really discouraged I don’t know how to regulate my emotions and my mood swings and my poor kids must think daddy is going crazy. I’ve explained to them that I’m just a little emotiona due to quitting and they seem to understand. Anyway idk where I’m going with this just looking for a little encouragement I suppose thanks

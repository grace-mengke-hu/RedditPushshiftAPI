I Ran Seven Miles!

When I smoked, the farthest I could run was about three miles.  I thought of anything more than that with a feeling of awe and the thought "I could never do that".  Now I feel like I could do almost anything.

At first I was frustrated because I didn't feel like I was getting the positive effects on my lungs fast enough, but now they are very clear.  Hopefully this will make it easier to burn off some of the weight I gained while quitting.

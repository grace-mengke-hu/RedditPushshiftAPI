5 days in and going strong. Ex 10 year smoker

I have had my share of cravings and a few times I found myself almost ready to leave the house and grab me a pack but I fought back and have stayed clean. The craving episodes are getting a lot easier to handle and the frequency of cravings has also reduced. 

I still have random panic attacks that stem mostly from my fear of having some breathing related issues. So far I have been able to walk 3k with very little issues, hold my breath longer and just overall feel much better but the fear lingers. 

I know that with time everything gets better and the longer I stay quit the better it is. I plan on going all the way with this quit and picking up some hobbies to help during the hard episodes. 

I want to thank all of you for being an inspiration to me and specially those who sent me pms saying I can do it and to not stress too much. They all mean a lot to me.

Cheers

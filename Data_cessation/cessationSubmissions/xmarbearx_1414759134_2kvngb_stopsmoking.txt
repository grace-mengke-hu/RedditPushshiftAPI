4 1/2 days in....please tell me it gets easier soon?

I'm irritable, wake up all night long and have had a headache every single day. I think about cigarettes obsessively and the only thing stopping me from buying a pack to smoke "just one" is the fact that I don't want to put myself through this misery all over again. If it doesn't get better soon, I don't think I'll make it.

Day 2...

I'm a 30 year old male that's been smoking a pack a day since I was 12. I quit for 2 years before, but started back up again 2 1/2 years ago now. The quitters flu is way worse this time around. Started weaning myself down a couple weeks ago, but that had me feeling like I was losing my mind, so I went cold turkey yesterday. My symptoms are driving me crazy, but that's just motivating me to stick with it more. Once these toxins are out of me, I'll feel so much better.

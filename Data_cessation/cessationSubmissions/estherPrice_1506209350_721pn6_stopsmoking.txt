In need of advice on how to persuade someone you love.

My grandfather passed away from cancer that was smoking related just a couple months ago quickly and un expectantly. My aunt is in hospice with long cancer with only a few days to live, and her husband is currently in chemo also for lung cancer. My mother is a pretty heavy smoker. Even her mother died from lung cancer many years ago. I try not to be too hard on her but watching everyone in my family pass from cancer has me really worried for her. All of these people were healthy until suddenly they weren't. But when I talk to her about it, it is like she's almost delusional and says things like "we aren't sure it was the smoking" or "well then its probably too late anyway" or "it was probably many different causes". She's only been to see them a couple of times and I feel like she is avoiding it because deep down she doesn't want to see the consequences. My aunt is only 57, and my mother is only 52. My mother is still very healthy and I wish I could convince her to do something to stay that way, she smokes, she drinks, and she hardly eats and doesn't exercise. I realize I want her to quit for selfish reasons, but if watching everyone around her die of lung cancer doesn't even make the slightest impact on her what will? It's breaking my heart watching my aunt and uncle being consumed by cancer, and all I can think about is my mom laying in that hospital bed with a respirator on. It's totally crushing me and I feel so powerless. Is there anything I can do? Anything I can say? 

This probably isn't the right place for this, but I wasn't sure were else to post and I just need some input. So thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and reply.

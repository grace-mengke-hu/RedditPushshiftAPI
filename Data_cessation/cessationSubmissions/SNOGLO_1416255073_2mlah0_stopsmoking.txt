"slightly hyperinflated" on my chest x-ray

I smoked for ~10 years before stopping 126 days ago at age 29 (maybe on avg. 3/4 pack a day).  I recently got a chest x-ray for a job coming up and the report said "slight hyperinflation".  :(  

If you look online, that can mean the first early stages of emphysema.  GOD DAMMIT.  All those years of saying "fuck it, I'll do it after this little vacation I'm having" or "I can't do it right now. It's a really stressful time".  I just kind of thought "I'm still young; the body is resilient enough to repair itself when I stop soon."  

I feel fine, like there is nothing wrong.  No shortness of breath, no tightness.  Can this condition go away with continued abstinence and cardiovascular exercise?  Will it just stay this way (as in, not get *worse*, but not get *better*)?  

If you're in your 20s and still smoking, fucking stop you fool.  *Now!*  You're gonna have to pay the piper, even at a young age.

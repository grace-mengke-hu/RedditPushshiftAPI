Never been a better time to quit!

This summer my casual smoking habit got a lot more intense as I moved in with 4 other smokers and also I got a job. BUT! I am about to move in with a non-smoker in the next week, I currently do not have a box of cigarettes or enough money for one (job still hasn't paid me, don't worry I'm on top of it), and I have a sore throat so the idea of smoking is really off-putting to me at the moment.

I'd love it if anyone could offer words of encouragement to me to keep me from buying any in the next week. I'm not sure if I'll go completely off them, next time I go out drinking I might have a few, is this completely dumb? Help me Reddit, you're my only hope:)

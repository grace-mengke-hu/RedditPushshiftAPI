I will not have to reset my badge

I just got through an almost 4 hour quarterly business report with my boss. I normally smoke immediately after and chain smoke a few. Today I sat down and had a cold drink of water. I also realized it was a fantastic meeting that I did not need to stress over. Please join me in not smoking today.

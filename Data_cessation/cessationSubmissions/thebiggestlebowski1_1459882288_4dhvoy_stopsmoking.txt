For those who want to falter

I've gone 26 days now without a smoke (ignore the badge).  For those of you in the early stages I just want to say its so worth it to stay clean.  I feel so much better. I don't have to brush my teeth after every smoke or wash my hands when i don't need to or re-apply cologne.  Although theres something in your head telling you a smoke will feel good, its bullshit. It won't feel good, it will take all your progress away.  My biggest help has been exercise, and i guess guided meditation. By guided meditation I typically go for a walk and throw in headphones and listen to soft house music and I just breathe and I can't tell you how good I feel.  Finally, for those of you in the early days Muhammad Ail once said, "...Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion." take this quote to heart

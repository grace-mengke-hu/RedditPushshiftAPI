Need some advice on dealing with family members who smoke.

So I quit smoking a little over a week ago, but my mom still smokes. Basically, whenever she smokes in the house, my chest starts to feel really tight and my head gets fuzzy. I've asked her to smoke outside, but she just moves to a room farther away from my bedroom, which doesn't help at all because our house is pretty small. I don't want to seem like an asshole, but she knows I quit, and she knows how hard it is to quit because she's done it in the past, and it bothers me that she's not willing to respect my request to live in a smoke-free environment, at *least* until I've been smoke-free for a few months. How do I approach her about it without seeming like a dick or a pushover?

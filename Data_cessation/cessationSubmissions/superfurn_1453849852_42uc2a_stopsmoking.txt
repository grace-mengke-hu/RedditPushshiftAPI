Tomorrow is day 1

I have decided that tomorrow will be my first day smoke free in 33 years. After doing a lot of reading,  I have decided to go cold turkey. The main reason I decided to go this route was because I want to get nicotine out of my body as soon as possible. I will be checking in here frequently tomorrow to update my progress and get some support. Wish me luck!

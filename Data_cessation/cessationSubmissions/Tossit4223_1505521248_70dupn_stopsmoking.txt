So here's the plan

Im a planner. I hate change. I plan things to the T to force myself to stick with the plan because I hate change. If I dont follow the plan I wont change. Stick with the plan -  the plan works. 

Phase one: quit drinking alcohol because cancer sticks and devils juice go hand in hand. CHECK. 7 months without a drop. 

Week One - Start date tomorrow. Double down on the Wellbutrin (meaning actually take it) and read the paperback version of Alen Carr. Physiologically I think hold a book will 'work' better. 

Week Two - next Saturday. Quit day. Start a 3 day juice cleanse. 

Week Three  - hit the dermatologist &amp; primary doctor to see what damage has been done.

Week Four - start with the nutritionist and personal trainer. 

Week Five - Dentist to have teeth bleached.

Im a heavy smoker. Over 20 years at 2 packs a day. Sad to say it is now engraved in my identity. I know in order for me to stick with anything I have to plan and go hard at it in order to evoke the change. 

Adding in the potential health scare and the vanity to keep momentum and plan on dealing with nic fits with Ngum, when needed, Wellbutrin and the r/.

Any holes or speed bumps any can see?

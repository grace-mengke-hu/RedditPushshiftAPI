Over two week no cigs

Don't give up dawgs. I don't know why but this timer app has really made a difference for me. I think just getting a constant reminder that I'm done with that shit has helped. This was the first time I had legit withdrawal. Terrible headache, couldn't concentrate on shit, and super grumpy.

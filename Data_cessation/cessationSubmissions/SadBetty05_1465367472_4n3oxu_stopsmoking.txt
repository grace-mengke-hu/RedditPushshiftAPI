After a year of not smoking I'm back.

Obviously this is another account,  but I am very depressed. I intentionally avoided smokers and places where it took place for months until my willpower was under control. It got to a point where I could be around smokers, decline, and have a good evening.

Tonight I smoked 6 cigarettes and feel....just horrible. Don't do it yall. It's not worth it. Ugh.

**Edit**: thanks to those of you who offered support and advice. It was very much appreciated.

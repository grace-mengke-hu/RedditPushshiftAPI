So, I found myself getting reeled in by the nicotine addiction after a good 6-month run. Not again. Not this time.

Made the well-known mistake of "I only smoke on parties, while clubbing" which worked really well the first couple of months. After a while, I caved.

Not gonna happen again. No smoking for me. No excuses. Either I smoke or I don't. And I don't want to. Don't want to lie to my GF about my smoking. Don't want to fool myself and lie to myself. 

So there it is: quitting cold turkey.

Smoked for approximately 4 years so I guess that looks easy for some of you guys. (pack a day). I'm looking forward to a smokeless life!

To all of you: keep on going and if you have any advice, I'll be glad to listen!

EDIT: goddammit. badge requested 2012 instead of 2013. so it should say 2 days instead of 367. my bad.

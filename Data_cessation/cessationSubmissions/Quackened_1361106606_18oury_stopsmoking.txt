I'm going to quit again today but I need advice

I'm not sure whether to use nicotine supplements like gum or patches or just go cold turkey. I tried quitting cold turkey before and it made my depression go nuts and anxiety issues were through the roof, also a certain bedwetting problem of mine returned which funnily enough went away when I started smoking at 17 (don't laugh, it's the reason I have depression/anxiety issues today).

I'm worried that the lack of nicotine just shook up my body so much that everything kinda went haywire and I really think going cold turkey again wouldn't be smart, but does anyone else have a similar experience? 

This subreddit is so inspirational by the way!

Edit - I quit for financial reasons and went to a shop nearby to see how much patches or gum was ... more expensive then a pouch of tobacco. That's fucked up.

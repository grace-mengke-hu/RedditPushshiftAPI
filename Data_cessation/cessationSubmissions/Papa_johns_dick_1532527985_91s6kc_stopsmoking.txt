Day 28: 4 WEEKS!

Omg I'm speechless. 

Never went that far with cold turkey quitting.
I read Allen Carr's book 3 or 4 times and I finally quit for good. I just know inside I am a non smoker for the rest of my life! It hasnt been easy but yeah i'm here. Also I quit drinking. My head is so much clearer now. I dont even know why I smoked in the first place it seems so stupid now.
Here's my advice.
If youre struggling. Just don't smoke. No matter what
And if you want to quit, just don't smoke another cigarette. And read Allen Carr's. It worked for me.

Love you guys!

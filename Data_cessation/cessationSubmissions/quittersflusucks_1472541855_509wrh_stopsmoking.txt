Withdrawals are this bad or im being a baby

I smoked for 9 years. Last time i smoked i was smoking nearly if not a whole pack a day maybe more cause of friends. I decided to stop and didnt even have a last one T.T. Any ways the first few day i was fine and then i started getting "sick". I thought it was the flu but then i thought that maybe it was nicotine withdrawals. I looked up symptomes and they were spot on. Sweating bullet, insane headaches, and all that good stuff. (My head is throbbing as i write this unable to sleep). Its been i would say a week orweek and a half now but this quitters flu is crazy painful. When im out i kinda just deal with it but when im at home im lying on my bed hoping the headaches and chills and hotflashes go away. I feel like im treating it worse than it actually is? Its my first time quitting and was surprised by how easy the first 2-3 days were. I didnt crave or nothing but now i feel like i should get patches or gum to make these symtomes go away. Gimme some good advice/opinions peeps

Cheating wife, divorce, time to quit smoking

Got back from annual training and found out my wife wanted to be "independent" whatever that's supposed to mean. The following month my smoking ramped up from 7/8 per day to about 15 and it was only getting worse. I could feel my health plummeting already. Said fuck her! I'm not gonna let her break my heart and give me a heart attack. 

After 5 years I am now 4 days smoke free using step 2 patches. Gonna take the money I save from cigs and whatever I can get from pawning her ring to buy a plane ticket to Mexico ;)

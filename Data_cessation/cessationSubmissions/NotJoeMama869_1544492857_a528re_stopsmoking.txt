I have decided to stop smoking however the only thing making difficult is my anxiety levels have gone up though the roof. Any helpful suggestions?

Idk if it makes a difference but I've smoked for about 4 years and about a pack a day or every 2. My craving for a cigarette doesn't so much stem from wanting the nic buzz but really just to curb the anxiety

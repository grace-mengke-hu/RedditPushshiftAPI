First day quitting, smoked two.

Like I said. Didn't buy a pack (my goal is saving money for a new car payment) smoked two of my bf's cigs just now before bed, had the opportunity to smoke up to 7 or 8, I didn't count how many he actually had. My goal of approx $5Ã—30 days/month will pay for half of my new Jeep. Pack a day, down to two smokes, maybe less tomorrow :)

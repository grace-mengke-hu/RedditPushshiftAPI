I just can't seem to stop

every morning I quit, every afternoon I light up. Today I didn't even wait til afternoon. I happily made it 30 days w/o alcohol and have no plans to go back to drinking alcohol. I quit drinking on Jan 5. I am going to quit smoking tomorrow, Feb 5. Please send positive vibes my way.

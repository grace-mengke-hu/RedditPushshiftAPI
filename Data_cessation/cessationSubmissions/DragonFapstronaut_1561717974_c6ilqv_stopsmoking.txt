IF YOU WATCH PORN

 First of all I used to be someone, when I woke up the first thing I would do was light up a cigarette, and probably another one after that.

 I was also a porn addict I watched it everyday and also masturbated while doing that, its a very popular addition nowadays but also very very hard to break, I have found out about r/nofap a couple months ago and I have been trying to break the addiction since then.

 What I didn't know was that whenever I am above 20 something days without mastrubation I can stop smoking very easily.

 Like I couldn't think of anything else besides smoking when I was in a lot situations like social situations, after meals, and so fourth, and now they don't even come to my mind.

It will not be super easy but its much more easy to break smoking addiction while on NoFap then otherwise.

I could barely go a couple days without smoking, and now Im on my new record of one month and some weeks and I don't even think about it, I don't even count the days.

 So if you masturbate oten and/or watch porn, I would advise you to stop and visit r/Nofap. Also you should read the Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr

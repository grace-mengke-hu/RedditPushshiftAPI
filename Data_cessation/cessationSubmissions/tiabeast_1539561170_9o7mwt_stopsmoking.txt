48 hours and counting

doing it without cessation aides. my withdrawal symptom are minimal so far....except for the indigestion :( this happens every time i quit. 

the patch helps ease my stomach pain, but it also keeps me craving nicotine for longer compared to the times i managed to quit cold turkey. any advice/moral support would be greatly appreciated!!!!

Happy friday non-smokers!

Tomorrow it will be 7 days since my last smoke. I woke up this morning and I could smell how nice it smells outside. my breakfast tasted better.. hell, even the whiskey I had last night tasted amazing!

I don't know if its just because I'm a bit agitated, but since I quit it feels like I'm getting tempted around every corner. I'm staying strong. I'm not going to be a slave to cigarettes! Good luck for the weekend! We're all in the same boat here, and the amount of people that is reaching 365 days gives me hope!

First time in my life I wasn't self conscious!

There was an award ceremony at my work where you go up on stage and shake hands (or hug) with some higher ups. It wasn't until I sat back down that I realized wasn't completely self conscious of the way I smelled. These are people that I really really look up to, who are invested in my future and have seen me grow over the last two years and I am just so proud that I didn't reek of cigarettes for this. 

I've been cigarette free now for 17 days and this was really the first time I was extremely proud of myself!

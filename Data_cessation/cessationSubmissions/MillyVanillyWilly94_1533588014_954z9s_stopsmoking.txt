Why do people want you to fail?

I quit smoking and failed in the past, my longest streak was 2 months. Now I'm on my 19th day, it's my third or fourth "attempt", though I really want to stick to it this time. 

Now, my friends, coworkers and other students are all like "Hell yeah! You can do it this time!" whereas my family, of all people, are like "Meh you're going to start smoking again after summer/ a month/ soon anyways". They are all smokers with one exception, two failed quitters amongst them. All I could come up with is that at least I keep trying?

Shouldn't family be the first people to expect encouragement from? Am I wrong to think that my family fucking sucks? Am I just this angry because of withdrawal?

End rant

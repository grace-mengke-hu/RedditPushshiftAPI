i need help

i cant resist more than 3 weeks without smoking. Im writing this after i just finished a demon stick after 3 weeks of  smoke free lungs. Im getting depressed and i`m ashamed for smoking but the craving is just to much. and its not only the craving its like im cutting out a part of me thats been there for the last 10 years , even if i know that part of me is evil i just cant let go . What the hell should i do ?
PS : sorry for the bad english im romanian and english is not my first language

Day 1....here we go!

(Former) ent, last toke was late last night. Currently in a little bit of trouble for my habit, so I figure this is the wake up call I need. Not sure if this subreddit is just for cigarette smokers or if it is open to all smokers. Would be grateful for advice about how to reduce temptation.

I would be lying if i said I weren't a little bit excited that I am stopping :)

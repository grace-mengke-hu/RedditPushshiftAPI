Today will be a week - 1st day back in the office

So this has overall been one of the most pleasant quits ever.  I used to never smoke at work, but lately had started taking breaks while at one office that I consult for on site. There's just one particular employee who grates my nerves. 

Today I will bring ear buds and snacks and as much patience as I can muster. 

I WON'T SMOKE TODAY!!

Day eight, thanks to this sub and a little vaping.

It's been almost 15 years when I started smoking. I wanted to smoke so bad, despite it making me want to vomit with every puff.

We got a kid in our grade who looked older to buy us a pack each, I got him to get me two because that was the point in my life when I decided that I will become a smoker no matter what.

This year I'm turning 30 and I smell up my apartment, car, people have to constantly wait for me as I have a cigarette and everyone I hang out with no longer smoke.

Well, this time last week, I was 15 hours without a cigarette and hanging for a cigarette but in a few hours time I start vaping for the first time. I buy a cheap $100 sky cloud vapor kit and I smoke the menthol flavour without any nicotine. It's been two days since I last vaped but at least I have something that can distract me when or if I get close to relapsing.

I just wanted to say thank you this to this sub, especially when I have other people I can relate to when the cravings get tough.

If anyone wants any info on vaping, let me know. The idea isn't to give up one thing and start something else. It's about giving up altogether and living a healthier lifestyle.

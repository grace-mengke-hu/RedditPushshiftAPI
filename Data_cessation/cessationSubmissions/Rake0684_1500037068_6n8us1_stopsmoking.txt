Day 1

Trying this again. With the other vices I have had, death always seemed so imminent, but smoking typically doesn't get you for a long time. I've smoked for 15 years now. I'm genuinely tired of being a slave to it, but as this morning drags on, I keep thinking about licking this patch on my arm.

Doing my best today. Root for me yall.

chest discomfort?

background; i'm a 24 y/o female, and have smoked at least a half a pack a day since i was around 18 years old. 
I recently am cutting down to only one cigarette a day if that, and have been using a vape pen mostly. 

i've developed this weird feeling in my chest/throat, like i'm getting a cold. it feels similar to getting bronchitis, which i have only had once before. no pain, just the need to cough, and i feel like the back of my throat is raw?
i quit for about a month back in january using the patch and the vape, and never felt this in my chest then.


has anyone else had this type of experience when quitting or cutting down?

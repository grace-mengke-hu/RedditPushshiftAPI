Remembering why I don't smoke any more...

So it's been over 2 years, and I've had some cravings, though they're not tough to ignore any more, it still worries me that I might slip.  Then I started thinking about what it used to be like - the cigarette hangovers after a night out at the bars - that chalky, chemical feeling in my blood, the aches, the queasiness, the jitters... I've said it before, it's really like a bad relationship.  Somehow I forget these bad things and just remember the rush, the comfort.  It's good to remember the really horrible things, so staying off the cigs doesn't just become about self-restraint or commitment to health (not that these are bad things,) but that there were really shit consequences to partaking.

Probably lucky(day 6)

So today actually a tank and juice came in it was non-nicotine juice btw. 
I've been 100% cold turkey until today, and it turns out the coil doesn't work with batteries I happen to have. So I didn't get to use it.
I think actually this was a good thing. I shouldn't try to imitate smoking or use any kind of crutch. 
So Instead I'm going to get some gum, like regular chewing gum. Man fuck this nictoine/cigarette bullshit. 
I mostly wrote this for myself but yeah fight on everybody. I'm noticing I feel happy after eating and whatever else now instead of freaking out, needing a smoke immediately after.

Why people don't finish Allen Carr?

Hi Quitters!
Just a note to say that after more than 11 years since I read AC's Easyway I'm still smoke free and don't even remember what its like to smoke, it was easy, painless and very empowering to quit my 20 year pack-a-day habit.

But, I've loaned the book to several people, who have wanted to quit and about half have read it and stopped, the other half couldn't get round to reading it, I know its subconscious but I'm always disapointed when this happens, I want people to get the same gift of freedom I received, I don't push the book on them - just mention it and if they want to, I loan them a copy.

Having had such great success I feel incredibly lucky that I discovered this method and I'm happy to answer any questions on it. The main point is, it removed my desire to smoke, overnight.

Anyway - good luck to all, its really worth it, I should really read the alcohol one but I'm guilty on that score too!

Many thanks, and fond farewells.

I am leaving reddit for voat (or I plan to).  I wanted to tell you guys that I appreciated all the help and support this thread provided.

I am nearly at 3 months and I couldn't have done it without this thread.  I hope there's a '/v/quitsmoking' over there but either way I don't plan to start smoking again.

This is a victory for me but for us all in a way.  Thank you all very much, keep on keepin on!

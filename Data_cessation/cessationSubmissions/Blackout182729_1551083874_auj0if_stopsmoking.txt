is it too late for me?

I am 26 and have been a smoker since the ages of 10-11. I consider myself a heavy smoker and back in the day people use to say I smoke like a chimney.

I am gong through a lot of stress at the moment and I have been smoking more than ever. I easily smoke about 25 roll ups a day maybe a bit more and I am getting worried now. My mouth always tastes fowl and my chest tighter by the day.

Do you think it's still possible to be a non smoker and improve my health?

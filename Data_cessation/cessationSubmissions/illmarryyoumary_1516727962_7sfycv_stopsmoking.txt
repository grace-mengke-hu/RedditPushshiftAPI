I smoked but, i'm not smoking

A few very stressful events unfolded and I broke down and smoked. I smoked all day. That night before bed, I looked at the pack. I had two left. I decided to smoke both of them before I went to sleep, and I haven't had a single one since. that was two days ago.
  
In the past, when a slip happens I give up and am a slave to the cigs again. This time, I thought fuck it. I just dont want to be a smoker so that was a big slip, but im not going to punish myself by smoking forver now.

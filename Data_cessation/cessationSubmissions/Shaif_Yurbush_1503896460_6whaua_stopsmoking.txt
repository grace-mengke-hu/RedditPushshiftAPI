Using patches/gum to get rid of habits?

Usually just out of boredom, I find myself lighting cigarettes more frequenly even without the feeling the need to. I dont even feel the rush that smoking gives me , just looking for something to do with my hands. 

I find that on days where I can't smoke at all (eg. lets say I'm traveling or visiting a hospital for hours) I just throw a patch on and I don't even think about smoking, but as soon as things like drinking coffee, energy drinks, eating, driving, etc. I want to light up even If I have a patch on. 

That's one of the main problems I have when trying to quit. The other problem I have is anxiety and sleep, I have anxiety bad as is and I can't deal with withdrawal anxiety + work anxiety at the same time, I just dont see it happening. How did you guys do it? Waking up without a cigarette is bad and it's the only thing I can think of to calm me down enough to think. 

(Please dont refer taking pills because I'd rather not take them).

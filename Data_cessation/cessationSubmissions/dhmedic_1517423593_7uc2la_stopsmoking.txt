Just quit monday, and I keep finding packs of smokes.

Seriously, the universe is a jerk. A friend was like "hey you left this at my house." Its a full pack. Another friend just fixed his vape, and asked if i wanted the pack he bought. and then I found like a full pack on the train. Smoking has never been so accessible. Luckily I'm still fresh, and the motivation is still strong, and I didn't keep any of them.

I think there will be no Circle 4 for me :( ....

... because Saturday the 21.02.2015 was my quit day and this upcoming Saturday is my first star as well xD

Since I do not want to disappoint you by the click on this post I want to share a thought I had the last couple of days inspired by an older friend I have who also stopped smoking years ago:

I talked to him and said "Fuck, why can someone be so stupid and to start smoking... everybody knows it's unhealthy and disgusting. Why had I been so weak?"

He responded with a smile "You know, there is a beauty in being an ex-smoker. You are a winner. One of a few only."

I was a bit confused on my way home when I realized how right he was. So many people get trapped and only a few make it out of there. It is such a big thing in so many peoples life and not rarely it is the reason of depression and a feeling of being out of control or weak. That is just a small extract of all the negative sides of smoking on ones psychology! 

A lot of people fear to never forget about being a smoker once. About cravings till the day they die. But what if you see it from another perspective? Think about it as a reminder of how awesome you are. Every time you get this craving you get remembered. You don't have to stand in front of the mirror telling you how awesome you are to finally believe it. Just wait for the craving, enjoy it and you'll feel that you are a winner. One of a few only.

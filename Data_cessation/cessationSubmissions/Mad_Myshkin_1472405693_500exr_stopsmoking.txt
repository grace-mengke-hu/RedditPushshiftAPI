How not to be a jerk to my girlfriend.

Hello folks,

Here's the quick n dirty: Smoked a pack a day for about 10 years. I'm currently on my third day of quitting. Using mg nicotine gum 3-4 times a day. 

Question is: My (non-smoker) gf is very supportive of me quitting. But the problem is that my mood swings are getting the best of me and I find myself being snapping at her. 

How do I control my mood swings during these times? She's understanding, but it's not fair for her to sit back and take me being a jerk. I want to have some ownership in my moods. 

What are some ways you control your irritability?

If someone paid me $100 to stop, I would. So now I am.

I've been at about a 1/2 pack a day for two years. Before that I had quit for 3 years and started up again after a bad breakup. My boyfriend hates it, I'm constantly worried about how my clothes and car smell, and it's just a source of tension all the time in my life.

Anyway, I was driving to work today worried about money and I thought "If someone paid me $100 per month to quit, I absolutely would." I'm spending more than that on smokes right now, so I'm going to kill two birds with one stone. Save some money and remove the tension.

The biggest hurdle for me is going to be removing nicotine from my drinking routine. Right now, a cigarette when tipsy is just about my favorite thing. 

Wish me luck!

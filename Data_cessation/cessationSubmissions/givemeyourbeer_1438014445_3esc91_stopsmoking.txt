Quit for 5 months. My mom died and I relapsed.

Been smoking since the end of May. That makes it 2 months as a smoker. I've tried to stop but I keep giving in to the cravings.

My mom always hated that I smoked. She asked me to quit, because her parents and my dad's parents smoked and they paid the price. 

I need to stop saying "I'm smoking cuz my mom died." I need to say "I quit smoking for 2 reasons; to honor my mom's wishes and to be healthy".

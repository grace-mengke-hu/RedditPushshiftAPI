Getting harder to resist

Hey first post here    just came to me to check reddit for support before I pull my eyes out. 

Back story   started smoking in 93 to be cool   many failed attempts at quitting later last month I went and got a champix prescription.  Rolled through the 2 weeks of medication while drastically cutting back  15 a day downtown to 3-5 hit my quit date March 18. The first day was really rough but manageability was there. Had a cheat the second and third days didn't beat myself up.That cycle of 1 good day followed by a bad day or two had been keeping up till friday. Then a realisation hit the drug makes the cigarette not "scratch my itch" so why am I prolonging this misery?  So none since then. Thankfully no one around me smokes so that temptation isn't easily available.  But tonight I am dieing to smoke. It's taking all my will power not to leave and go get a pack.

Sorry to be so rambly but I just needed to say something to cays who understand. I really want a smoke right now but I'm gonna tough it out   just typing this makes me feel better

Ugh, I slipped & tips for living with a smoker

It just kind of happened.  I had been sick for the longest time, and I got out of work early and the next thing you know, I'm smoking with my husband.  I have to start all over, don't I?

My husband is not ready to quit.  I honestly don't think he is going to.  I am not one for trying to push people.  I honestly don't know what to do.  I can't very well tell him he can't smoke at home (he only smokes outside).  What can I do to keep myself on track?

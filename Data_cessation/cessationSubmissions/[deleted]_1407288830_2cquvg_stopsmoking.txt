It's Day 21 and I Just Don't Feel Well

Mentally and emotionally drained. Physically exhausted probably from being inactive for so long. 

I also deal with chronic pain which has flared recently for no good reason. I haven't been able to see my cat (my only family I really like) for a while after being together 24/7. I need good music to wallow in. I'm romanticizing a smoke a little right now to be honest. I used to wallow with cigarettes.

Just before I quit I was practically chain smoking them, little over half a pack a day (12-15) never quite hitting that proper "ahh" like I couldn't inhale them quickly enough. So it really did distract me. It made me distressed that I wasn't hitting the nicotine peak. 

Music suggestions and a kind word if you could, please?

How to reduce/get rid of phlegm

Hi there, it’s been more than a month since I’ve quit smoking. I have googled up some questions about phlegm building up in your respiratory system during your quitting process; I’ve also seen some posts in which they mention it could last more than a year or so. My question is, how can I reduce or get rid of the phlegm in my system? I’m tired of always trying to find a bathroom to spit it out and it’s disgusting to swallow it. What do you guys do to deal with it? Thanks in advance.

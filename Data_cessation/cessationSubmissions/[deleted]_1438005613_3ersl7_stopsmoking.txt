Advice for someone who is allowed to smoke at work?

I work in a small office and everyone smokes. EVERYONE. I tried quitting before and bought an air purifier to keep by my desk but the cigarette smoke lingers and I am taking it in all day no matter what. 

When I get home I can be fine and have 0-3 ciggs but at work all day not having to leave my desk I can smoke half a pack to close to a pack. 

Any ideas of what I can do to help get past the work day smoke habit? Everything else I've got down to quit. This is the last problem.

Friday night I smoked my last cigarette

Friday night I smoked my last cigarette and went to bed. Saturday I didn't buy any more. Today, my will is holding strong. I've been a smoker for 9 years and I have quit a few times unsuccessfully. Cold turkey is the closest to quit I've come.  I know from past experience that I have a hard time making it through week 2.  I get very anxious and break down to smoking a cigarette. This time may be different because my smoking roommates are quitting also, and I am more keenly aware of stress management tactics and I know I can either suffer through a hundred three minute cravings or a lifetime of poor health. 

I am tired of wasting $6 a day for a pack of cigarettes, but that's not my only motivation to quit. Through diet, I have lost 30 lbs, and I finally got some booty the other day. I want to be more attractive with whiter teeth, better skin, better odor, and leaner figure. It's hard to exercise when after a run all I want to do is put another cigarette in my lungs.  Cigarettes are a filthy, slow, progressive, wasteful drug delivery system and nicotine is a drug I ought to do without.

Since it's legal in some states, and virtually legal like music/film piracy, condoned by some but not by all... I feel safe to say I do like marijuana. I've been smoking pot for the same number of years as cigarettes and it's not the same evil as tobacco.  For starters, I don't have to chain smoke pot. Sometimes I like to be high, sometimes I don't. I only blaze after work and throughout the day there are no cravings. The smoke from kind bud is soft, white, cotton like. It still has tar, I know... But I only smoke the strong stuff and don't smoke as much. It has health risk, but there is no denying that it is a safer alternative for recreation enjoyment. Safer than alcohol, safer than tobacco. I am not a drinker, after kicking tobacco and fast food I'll have to think real hard about marijuana or at least switch to vaporization.

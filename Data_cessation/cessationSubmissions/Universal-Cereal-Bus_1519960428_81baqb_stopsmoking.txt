Almost perpetually sore throat since i've significantly cut down

Long story short over the next few months i've set a schedule to cut down cigarettes to eventually quit. I'm doing this on advice of my GP since i've tried cold turkey a number of times which never worked.

So i'm in the first stage of my weaning which is going for a cigarette every hour and a half (12 a day down from 20). Next month i'll be going every 2 hours (8 a day) then the final month before i stop i'll be going every 3 hours (~5 a day).

But since i've cut down my throat has been perpetually sore and red. Smoking makes it worse and it's usually alleviated by drinking some water but it's ALWAYS red even if it's not sore.

I read that this sort of thing can happen when you actually QUIT but can i be getting some of the same symptoms from cutting down? It's driving me nuts. I really don't want to fail again so i want to keep with the weaning.

Any insight into why this is happening or what i can do to help alleviate the pain?

Cheers

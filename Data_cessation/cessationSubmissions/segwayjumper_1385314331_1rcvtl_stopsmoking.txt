Though I had many close calls, two weeks Cold Turkey. Mmm...Turkey

I've found pulling myself away from situations and friends that will trigger me has been my best ally. Luckily my SO doesn't smoke, but she does trigger me with some stress. If I can conquer it when I'm with her, I should be fine soon to hang out with friends. Cold Turkey is the only way to go. After the initial 3 days, it gets much easier.

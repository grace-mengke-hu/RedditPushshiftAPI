I bought my last pack on the weekend.

I decided earlier on this summer I was going to quit smoking after some things calmed down at work and I wasn't stressed all the time. I'm holding myself to it now. All part of my "get healthier" plan. 

I bought (and finished) my last pack over the weekend. Sunday was the first time in a long time I haven't bought a pack of smokes during the day. 

Here are the issues I see coming up: 

1. Drinking. My friends and I go out for beers on the regular, and I go out for a beer after hockey. This is a huge trigger for me. I'm wasn't a heavy smoker until after a couple of beers, and then I could kill almost a full pack with my friends. 
2. Lots of my friends still smoke. I slipped up on my first day of quitting (Sunday) because my friends and I were at a concert and they kept all going out between bands. I had picked up a cheap e-cig during the day but I live in Canada, and they don't allow e-cigs to have nicotine in them so it didn't really help. It also didn't have the same feel to it. I ended up bumming a couple smokes off a friend just so I didn't go insane. 
3. I actually enjoy the act of smoking. I don't particularly like tobacco or any of the other horrible stuff that comes along with cigarettes, but going outside (even in the bitter cold), lighting something up, and burning it down is relaxing to me. I've been looking into ways I can drop the nicotine but keep the 5 minute breaks to myself during the day: eg Herbal cigs, higher-end vapourizers. 

I've tried quitting cold turkey once or twice in the last couple years, and each time I've gone 3 or 4 days before relapsing back into it. The combination of nicotine addiction AND changing my habits throughout the day has proven to be too much. 

If any one has any tips or tricks, or just words of encouragement, I'd definitely appreciate it. 

Thanks.

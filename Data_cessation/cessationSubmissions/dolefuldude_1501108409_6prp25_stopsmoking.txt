13 days, starting to suck.

So I'm a musician, and I never considered smoking to be influential to that process. But I guess after 6 years things sort of connect in a way. Like not getting a melody line just right and being able to step away and have a cig really helped that process. Anyway, since quitting I really haven't been able to write like I used to, and it seems like a stupid reason to start back up but it's getting frustrating. Any tips would be sincerely appreciated!

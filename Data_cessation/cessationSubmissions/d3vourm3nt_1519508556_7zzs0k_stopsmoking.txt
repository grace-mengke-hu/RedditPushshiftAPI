Relapsing, need advice.

Hey guys. I quit smoking about three years ago, and lately I've been smoking again. It started out as just being drunk, socializing, but now I'm buying packs and chain-smoking.

Any advice for nipping this in the bud? Anybody else fall into same gutter and climbed back out?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Tough lesson. Learning to depend on myself and care for myself. Not trying to motivate someone else to join my path. Feel guilty...Minding my business.

My partner of 18 yrs has been a heavy smoker and never wanted to quit. Always said it was good for you etc etc.. when plp talk about how bad it is. Infact last time I quit my partner was the one who gave a cigarette to me, that I smoked. Well, I'm the one who smoked it. I'm not pointing fingers. 

All this while I've tried to get my partner to smoke less, to exercise, to give up smoking inside the house. Nothing works. Now, I have finally (hopefully for the last time) realized I have to first do it for myself. I cannot motivate others even if I want it for the best of their health - minding their health mental and physical is non of my business. A trap I keep falling to with people I care for - partner friends or family. 

The past 5 years I've steadily tried to improve my health n the main goal to quit smoking. I tried many ways but after all...this is the time it's sticking. I got into exercise, slow and steady to heavy exercise, then nutrition like crazy, I lost 40 pounds. Then past 5 months it's all gone down the drain. Due to laziness. The good side is I gave up smoking. I am proud of myself.( I Put on 4 pounds. I don't care. Better than 15 smokes a day)

I find it selfish at times that I can't help my partner/friend be more aware of their health. But they don't want me to.. it makes me  feel a bit bad that I'm focusing on myself. Well what can I do, but mind my own business :)

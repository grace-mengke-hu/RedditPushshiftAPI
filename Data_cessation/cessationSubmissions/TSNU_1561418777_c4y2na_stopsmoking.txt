Really needing to quit. What's worked best for you?

I'm 22, been smoking for 5 years now, anywhere from 10 to 20 smokes a day, depending on my mood. I've tried quitting a couple times but after a week or so I get really depressed and really angry at stupid little things. I've tried to pick up a new hobby to stop (got back into reading), but I just felt hindered by reading. I'm lost at this point, and recently found this sub. Thought I'd ask for help. Thanks.

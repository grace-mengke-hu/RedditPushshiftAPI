Am I cheating ?!?!

I have been using the NRT Patch for 20 days now, going to do the full 12 weeks on the patch.  Knowing that if I attempted to quit cold turkey so many undeserving people would be left in my path bleeding or crying.  I need to get rid of the typical habitual things about smoking first I think, then deal with the nicotine thing.
Can I call myself a non smoker yet ?  Am I cheating

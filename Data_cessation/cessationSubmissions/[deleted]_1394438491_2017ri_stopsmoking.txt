Day 1, I hate everybody..?

So, I decided to quit yesterday. I caved last night on the way home and bought a pack from the service station I live next to. Didn't even smoke half a cigarette before regretting it and stopping. Today has been better, I gave the pack away to an old smoking buddy from work and then successfully walked past the service station without buying any! I *really* wanted to though. I'm getting super bad cravings but I am trying to replace them with drinking water/green tea and then forcing myself to do something to keep my mind off it, so far that seems to be going pretty good.

My big issue is that I have noticed that I essentially want to cut anybody who vaguely annoys me into teeny tiny little pieces... And I am usually a very happy friendly person! :( I have resorted to starting a new civ 5 game and locking myself in my apartment for the night (I was meant to be going out for dinner). Is this normal? Any advice on how long it lasts or how to deal with it better?

I survived the gas station today.

I quit about a week ago and really wanted some Mountain Dew. While I was in line, just the sight of 50 different brand of cigarettes was driving me crazy. No lie, I was almost salivating. Then I started rationalizing about going back to tobacco, but soon enough, I was out of the store. Really glad I resisted for the first time in a while.

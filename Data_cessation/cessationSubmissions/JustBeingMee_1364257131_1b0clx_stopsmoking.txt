My one month mark smoke-free is today!(2 months for Cannabis) You can do it too!

I'm 21 years old and i've smoked since i was 14. Up until the age of 16.5 i have been a constant pack-a-day smoker. The way i was able to start my cold turkey journey was change of enviornment. I left with my SO to visit her folks way up north for 5 days and decided to challenge myself to see if i could survive the 5 days in the middle of Canada's north without cigarettes. Being pre-occupied with farm work and such i found myself not thinking about it at all, only for brief moments. 

Once we got back into town it was hard not to drop by the corner store and pick up a pack, but i just kept thinking "if i went this long without cigarettes, i can go longer' a week later and i never had any compulsion to get a pack.

Anyways i thought i'd share my success story and say that if anyone is looking for answers to their questions about smoking feel free to drop me a PM.

6 days and counting ⏳⏳⏳⏳

After failing on many occasions to give up smoking I am giving it a go again. This time I believe my resolve is stronger.
Entering the sixth day today, the urge to smoke has not been that strong so far. However I have a strange feeling in my throat now. It feels a bit constricted. Any suggestions on how to deal with this? Also the mucus in the chest feels like it has a life of it's own. After going through so many failures I'm shit scared I'll go into a relapse.

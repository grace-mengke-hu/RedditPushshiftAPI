My two biggest concerns about quitting--any input would be highly appreciated!

**Weight gain**

The solution is pretty obvious: exercise and eat right. I've selected my quit date so that I have enough time to get into a routine so that I don't blow up. However, I recently lost a good deal of weight (about a year ago I was ~30 pounds overweight and I'm finally at a healthy weight) and it would be such a shame to gain all that back again.

**Focusing**

My number one biggest fear about quitting is that I won't be able to do anything. I won't be able to read, study for school, pay attention in class, write my blog, etc. I tried to sneak up on myself and just quit today. I went 3 and a half hours and my brain just melted in the middle of a blog post. I was writing crap. I finally caved and bought a pack of cigarettes and reviewed what I wrote for an hour. I have to scrap most of it because it was terrible. And that was with *a lot* of coffee and water.

How can I combat the mental sluggishness that comes with cessation?

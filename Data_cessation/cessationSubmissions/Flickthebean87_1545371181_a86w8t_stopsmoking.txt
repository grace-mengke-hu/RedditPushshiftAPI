Day 3. Why is this the worst day? I really want a cigarette but I will fight it.

I’ve never posted here so please be kind. Lurked here for awhile and I want to thank you all. I want to thank the person who draws on their breaks instead of smoking. Everyone who’s struggling but still pushes through. 

I started smoking when I was 17. I was in an abusive relationship for 4 years. It made me smoke more. Before that I smoked one cigarette every few days if that. Now that I’ve quit I feel the final piece of his power will be gone. 

I smoked for 14 years. I cut back to one pack, half a pack, hell I’ve quit once for a month. I made every excuse I possibly could. 

I also have asthma. I got pneumonia in July and it scared me so bad I started making attempts. Unsuccessful, but attempts. 

I decided I didn’t want to take cigarettes into the new year with me. I was sick of constantly coughing, wheezing, and smelling disgusting. 

After months of excuses and “Just one more pack/cigarette” I decided it was time. After decreasing from two packs to one pack. 

Something helpful: I started to adjust my schedule prior to quitting. On breaks at work I made myself sit inside. I would smoke at different times not to form a pattern or expectation. I formed a new routine. 

My only problem is I’m used to that pack of cigarettes in my pocket. I grab for it and just the vape and my phone is there. It’s not a trigger the absence is weird. Like losing a long lost best friend that was slowly killing you. It’s a happy moment, but also sad. 

Anyone have issues on day 3? I know I’ll make it through I just wanted to at least vent it out a bit.

I've been smoke free for 54 days and I just can't stop eating!

The first two weeks were completely fine and I didn't eat more than I normally do but the last month has been a very tough one and I have had to go through some extremely dramatic events so I think most of it comes down to comfort eating - something I've never done before as I would've been smoking if I wouldn't have quit.

Does anyone have any tips or ideas in terms of what I can do to stop this? Putting on weight is just adding to the pressure and negative emotions that I'm feeling at the moment. Almost considering starting to smoke again, but I really don't want to.


^(Should also mention that I am working out 3-4 times per week so it's not like I'm not trying at all)

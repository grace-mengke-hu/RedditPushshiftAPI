Just popping in.

Hey guys. I'm at the year mark, wanted to share my battle with quitting smoking.

I started on this subreddit right after my decision, it always helped me to know the badge number. It always served as a reminder how long I've been smoke free. 

You see tons of advice here, that allen Carr book, etc. I didn't need to read a book to quit, I truly believe if you really want to quit, you can quit. I never referred to myself as a non smoker, but an ex smoker. It kinda helped me to think it's something I used to do. Every craving, fight it, don't give in. It's a test of your will power, and I think everyone is strong enough to quit. 

It's not gonna be easy, but it's worth every second. I'm only at a year, and still have a ways to go, but I wanted to share my thoughts.

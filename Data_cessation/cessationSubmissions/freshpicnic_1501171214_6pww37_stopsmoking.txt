6 days in, could use some advice

Hey all, for some background; I'm 19 and started smoking around 10 months ago when I started university. I decided to try and quit 6 days ago (cold turkey) and it's been pretty good so far.

The first couple days were okay, cravings weren't too bad, and I actually began to feel a lot better about myself as I've been eating healthier, drinking lots of water, and exercising. However, it's this sixth day that I'm just feeling kind of bummed out. I thought now would be the perfect time to quit since it's summer, but the issue is I have a resit exam to take in around 3 weeks and I just don't have the attention or drive to study. 

I worry that quitting now is going to hinder my results in my exam, and as I still have about a month after the exam until I go back to university I wonder that I should postpone quitting until then since I really need the focus to study. 

So yeah, I'm just looking for some advice on whether it would be a good idea to postpone quitting until after my exam or just keep enduring as I am. Thanks for reading.

Want to quit after 10 years!

Hi All, I’ve been smoking for ten years and the last few weeks I’ve started smoking a lot more than usual. After noticing the physical toll it’s taking, as well as finically, I’ve decided to quit. I’ve quit twice before when I was pregnant but started again shortly after. I have also tried Chantix with a lot of negative side effects. I think I’m most anxious about the withdrawal from nicotine and how to stay strong through it. Any tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

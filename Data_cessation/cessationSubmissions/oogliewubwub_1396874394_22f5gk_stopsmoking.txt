Smoking Dreams

I did not really have smoking dreams right after I quit like others seem to do. I'm 90 something days in and have had them two nights in a row. Of course I feel terribly guilty when I wake up, even though I didn't REALLY smoke.  I think that the idea of smoking in my subconscious is making me feel that guilt.  I guess I miss it more than I would like to admit sometimes, especially during times of stress.  I'm proud that I haven't given in,but I do wish that the temptation would be totally gone.  
Ah well, I did this to myself and have to deal with it, right?

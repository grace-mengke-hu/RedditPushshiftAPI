how i quit smoking

i was hooked to the max when it came to any kind of nicotine, and i shit you not when i started smoking weed i said fuck this and i was actually able to quit, bc during withdrawals i would just get high.
i’ve started smoking bc i can’t afford weed
and nicotine is the only thing that calms me with anxiety, but if y’all can afford it please give it a try bc it helped me so much

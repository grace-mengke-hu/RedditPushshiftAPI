Day 4

I'm feeling pretty good and I can definitely feel my respiratory function improving. A few weeks prior I had been cutting back to one or two per day and chose Monday as my quit day. It's tough but it's manageable. I know if I give in I'll be pissed at myself.  The other night I was at a bar and I realized how much more I enjoy interacting with people as a non smoker. I didn't have this social crutch to lean on so it kind of forced me to be more personable. Anyway, sorry for the ranting just thought I'd share.

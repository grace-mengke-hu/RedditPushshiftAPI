This time, I want to quit for good

Smoker for 3 years. Turning 30 pretty soon.  

What the hell happened. I never thought of myself as a "smoker". I was just smoking for fun, during some parties. Next thing I know is every 2 hours I need to take a break from work to take a puff, or otherwise I'd be getting way too anxious and irritated.  

I want to change this. I want to stop smoking before I'm 30. I hope it's not too late.  

I hate that I reek of smokes. Especially in the summer. That sweat and smoke mixture of pure disgust. I hate that I need to plan in smoking breaks whenever we go somewhere with my GF. Shopping? Gotta stop for a smoke. Lovely dinner outside? Gotta have that puff afterwards.  

But most importantly, I feel like I'm letting my girlfriend down. She doesn't smoke. She always wishes a happy future together. I know that that future will be limited, or even non-existent if I continue. I feel ashamed of not being able to quit. She has witnessed me try and quit (and ultimately fail) for about 4-5 times in the past 2 years. I feel like she has less faith in me due to this.  

So, for all the fruitless efforts of trying to quit smoking, I am writing here that I can finally, hopefully, quit for good this time around. It has not even been a day, and I'm stuck at work thinking about the next puff. This is going to be hard, but I want to change and quit for good.

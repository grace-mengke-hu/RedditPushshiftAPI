Day 16

Feeling less and less the need to post on here for myself and more interested in sharing my experience with those not as far as me.... looking back over the last 2 weeks it feels almost surreal,  I'm not having intense cravings anymore.  I just read allen carr again,  I think it helps. Jason vale,  stop smoking in 2 hours app has helped a lot too. It feels like I'm through the worst of it,  I told my family a week ago that I quit, so I cant go back now.... lol. Not that I  want to remembering the phlegm, the smell, and the taste... God awful!

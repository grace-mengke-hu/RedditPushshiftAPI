A year and two days!

I quit on new years eve last year, and I forgot to post a thank you to the r/stopsmoking community! I would browse a lot in the early days and I still do quite frequently. If you are just starting out I wish you the best. I did it by using Champix, reading the Easy Way, posting and reading on here.

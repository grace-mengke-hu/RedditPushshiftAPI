Depression...

So, I battle with depression as someone who does not have insurance to afford medication, therapy or even a councilor. I also battle with anxiety, but to a lesser degree.

Today and yesterday, I have felt incredibly depressed, more so than usual. Almost crying for no reason and not wanting to move. Smoking has always seemed to "help" with it.... That voice in my head is saying "Smoking will help, just light up and you will feel better, it's ok". I don't want to listen but it is getting hard... I am so upset, I don't know what to do.

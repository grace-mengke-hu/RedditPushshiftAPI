(Meta) i think this subreddit needs to define what is it that you are really stopping

I realised while reading the controversial post that hated on vapers that there are (at least) two types of people in this subreddit  -  those that regard quitting as quitting an addiction, and those that regard quitting as quiting smoke/other harmful chemicals in combustion. So im curious what do you believe? Please be civil.

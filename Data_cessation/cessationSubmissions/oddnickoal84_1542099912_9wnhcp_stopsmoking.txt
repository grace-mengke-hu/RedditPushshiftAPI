My mom is 39 and won’t stop smoking.

Hey, 16 year old here.

I know, smoking is addictive. She has been smoking since she was 15-ish, so awhile. She’s quit a few times, first time cold turkey and it lasted barely even a week. She started hearing things so she smoked again. The second time was just a year or two ago. She used patches, they worked amazingly they’re also only 30 dollars, which is way cheaper then buying 4 packs a week for the rest of her life, but she stopped after she craved them again, due to her not having patches one day. She knows all the good things that come from stopping, but she doesn’t. She smokes on the porch and the smoke comes in, I tell her that it does but she thinks it doesn’t. It’s literally just a screen door that she closes. Doesn’t stop the smoke one bit. It smells so bad, so so bad. She’ll smoke in the morning before work IN the house, she makes clothes smell and the house, and does it in the car all the time. It smells so bad.

Don’t get me wrong, I love her with everything. But I don’t get why it’s so hard for her to buy patches and stop. I don’t want her to get Lung Cancer, esophagus cancer, or any other cancers or diseases that happen due to smoking. I also don’t want to be affected for her decisions. How did you get your parent to quit? How did you stop yourself?

What has helped me so far

I set this subreddit as my frontpage on my mobile reddit app.  4 or so times a day, its an automatic reminder to read a few posts and renew my resolve.  This has helped me to keep the reasons I quit fresh in my mind, and get excited about how far I've come.  Whenever I get a craving I do a set of pushups, drink a glass of water, and read a few posts on here.  100% success at destroying cravings so far.  I'd even go so far as saying it not only stops the cravings, but gets me excited about quitting.  I also write down all of my reasons when I feel strong about it to read when I start to crave.  I know none of this is novel or new, but I hope something here helps someone else.

Smoke free for 2 months, but still thinking about cigarettes very, very often

I have been a lifelong smoker of 15 years. I've smoked heavily, there even were weekends where I smoked 5 packs per day. 

Two months ago, I've quit. No more. The first few weeks were rough. Like really rough. But I've managed to squeeze through. 

Now, I'm not craving, I don't need a cigarette, there is no physical connection to it, but I've been spending a lot of my time just thinking about cigarettes. Sometimes things like "I could smoke right now, but I will not" or "In this same exact situation 2 months ago I had a cigarette in hand"  and things like that. 

It's getting annoying, but I hope those thought will clear? I mean, I'm not addicted anymore, and I don't need them anymore, but why am I thinking about them for a good part of a day? Even after all this time?

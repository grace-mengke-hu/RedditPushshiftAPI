Quit 4 months ago. For the las 2 months or so I smoke when I drink

I quit using Allen Carr's book more than 4 months ago and I haven't teally had any problems while sober. 
At first when I drank or got high I even completely forgot that I was ever a smoker but after about a month I got wasted and lit one up.
Ever since, I smoke whenever I am drunk, or lately just after I started drinking. The wierd thing is that this only happens when I am drinking, while sober (alcohool-free actually) I don't feel any need for it, I find nauseating even.

Smoking drunk is not the major issue, I could live with that, but I am afraid that if I keep doing this I wil eventually start smoking sober.

Anyone else going through this ? Any advice ?
Thank you!

How do you cope with post-cessation brain fog, depression and lethargy?

I just can't pull this off. Once the nicotine withdrawal begins for reals I'm completely useless, have to really force myself out of bed, brain is mushy, can't work properly, can't please wife, kids become background noise, insomnia etc. 

I honestly feel like the only way I could do this would be in supervised asylum over one month holiday.

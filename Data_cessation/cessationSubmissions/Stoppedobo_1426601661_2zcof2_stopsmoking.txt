Tearful Day ...

Hello All, sorry me again!
Ok, so yesterday I was grumpy, made it through the day, exercised in the evening, then in the evening was on the phone to bf said he wasn't coming round tonight and suddenly grumpy turned into weepy! And today weepy is still here. Ok yes I know the addict in my brain. But omg, how do I make it stop?! The relationship with bf is about the best thing that has ever happened to me and he is so scared to say the wrong thing! I feel like I am seriously losing it and him along with it! I do not like this non smoking me! She is shouty and not rational and the thing in my stupid head is telling me that having a ciggie will sort it out and I will go back to the calm and loveable person I was before. Which I know is STUPID, but I can't shake it. Thanks for reading! At least typing has, if only briefly stopped the shouting addict in my brain!

I can't believe it

It has been over 10 days, and the biggest craving I've had was when we stopped to fill up at a gas station.  I popped a lozenge in my mouth, asked if my hubby could get me a Vitamin Water, and that was that.



We've been so busy with unpacking and sorting things out in the new house, I haven't really had time to stop and have a smoke.  I'm amazed, quite frankly, I can't believe it!  I'm doing so much better than my previous time!



I'm not stressed, I'm not getting nervous tics, my asthma is kicking up a little bit but other than that...  I'm thinking positively about all of this!



I have my last empty pack attached to the fridge with the words "DON'T GIVE UP" written on it in big block letters.  It's keeping me on track!

Want to quit but I don't at the same time.

I've been smoking since about august, started off with about a pack a week, maybe two. Now I'm up to a pack every two days, one a day if I'm out with friends or drinking. 

I've said since October I'd quit on January 1st so it wouldn't be too hard to quit. I don't get mad cravings and know I could quit without too much hassle.

Only thing is I really don't want to. I really enjoy it and I love the social benefits. I made my closest friends in college through the smoking area between lectures and we go for drinks after college every thursday and the smoking area is always a good laugh.

I could easily say to myself I just won't smoke and I'll still head out to the smoking area in college/the pub but I don't think I'd be able to resist the temptation of having one with them.

Also the smoke breaks I get in work are really nice too.

Any suggestions or arguments that can persuade me to quit? Personal experiences would be a nice bonus too.

Thank you!

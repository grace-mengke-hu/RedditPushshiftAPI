Cravings are gone and blood pressure is almost normal

So I'm 27, been smoking for almost 10 years now and have tried to quit multiple times. Always failed because I like to have some drinks on the weekend and that leads to me buying a pack.

This time it's sticking. It's been 2 weeks and my cravings are gone. I'm especially thankful that I don't crave them during my 45 minute commute to and from work every day.

Another benefit, I've been on BP medication for years. I checked it last night before taking my pill.. 136/77. Usually it's around 150/90 at this time. It's been staying stable around there for a few days now.

Can't wait to say it's been a year or more!

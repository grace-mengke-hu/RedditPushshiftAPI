Stopped smoking eight days ago. Found a single cigarette in my car during lunch break. Didn't smoke it.

I held this cigarette in my hand and stared at it for a good five minutes as if it would start taking to me or something. I wanted to smoke it so bad. Then I destroyed it. I'm proud I didn't smoke it and know I would have felt guilty after but man it would have been nice to have one last one. But I guess it's never really the last one if you give in.

Really don't think i'm the type of person that can quit cold turkey, could use some advice.

Hey you guys, here's a little backstory: I started smoking when I was 14 years old. Older friends bought me cigarettes, I thought I was cool. By the time I was 19 I was up to a pack every two days. I've since stopped hanging out with the same people (honestly I spend most of my time alone). I've been thinking about It lately & I've probably "quit cold turkey" about 5 or 6 times. I'll go 2-4 months without a smoke & I always go back to it, smoke an entire pack, feel physically & emotionally awful & quit for another 2-4 months. My question is, Is there some sort of plan I can use to help me stay away for good? Maybe there's a website somewhere that offers a plan? I feel like I wouldn't be able to stick to a plan I made myself because I'd just end up bending the rules. Also, how the heck do you occupy your hands & mouths in social settings? This really gets me when I do go out because I spend a lot of time at venues & there are never not going to be smokers at venues. Thanks, I love this sub & reading everyone's stories. I wish I could quit cold turkey but damn.

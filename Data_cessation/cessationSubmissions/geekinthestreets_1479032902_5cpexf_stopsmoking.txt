One month. Some reflections.

Well today I hit 1 month and I feel great.

I've been criticised by a couple of ignorant people on here for the way I quit. I stopped smoking and vaped. My plan was to reduce the strength of the liquid gradually but within a week (and just before I was going to make the first reduction) I lost the desire to vape and therefore take in nicotine.

I know for most people that cold turkey is the best way. Not for me it's not and not for a lot of people or there wouldn't be nicotine replacement products.

I have only seen a few cold turkey snobs on here. The rest of you are supportive and have helped me and others get through those first horrifying weeks.

Remember, we're all doing the same thing. We're stopping something that is killing us. As long as we stop, does it matter how?

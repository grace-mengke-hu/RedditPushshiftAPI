Fell off the wagon at work.

Jumping back on today. For some reason, I was super stressed out and smoked like 6 or 8 cigarettes tonight. I normally smoke one or two at most on the weekends, and have been considering that cutting back. I quit drinking nearly 5 months ago, and I thought the urge to smoke would cease when I quit drinking, but I still turn to it. I also justify my smoking because "at least I'm not drinking." 

My mom (56) died of lung cancer five months ago and it's motivated me to quit. I've smoked off and on since I was 15 (I'm 27), with year or two here and there of quitting. I'm currently in grad school, serve/bartend in a pub, and am doing a lot of volunteer work with a local music organization. I also smoke marijuana. I would like to continue to use it for pain and anxiety, but move form a joint to my vape. I have one, I just have opted for the joints because they are more like smoking. Sometimes I will go days without a cigarette but have a few joints. 

Ugh I hate that I give into this impulse so readily when I know it's just hurting me.

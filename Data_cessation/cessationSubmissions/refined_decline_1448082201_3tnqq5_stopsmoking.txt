Terrible Withdrawal

So its been nearly two weeks since I decided to quit smoking, mostly cutting down, having one or 2 a day. It's been 36 hours since I stopped completely, and I feel fucking fucked.

I am grinding my teeth. I have had a near-constant headache. I've got stomach cramps and nausea. Is this normal? When the fuck is it going to subside? I haven't even craved a cigarette yet. I have been too busy feeling all this other bullshit.

How do I make all this stop?

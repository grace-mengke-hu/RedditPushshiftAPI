4 days cold turkey and I am the anti-christ. I have been running to help with cravings but it doesn't stop the hell I have been giving my roommates. What else can I do?

I must add that I quit drinking on june first and I changed my diet drastically to stop binge eating. I am the biggest cunt on the planet and I am fairly certain my roommates hate me. What can I do besides running that will help with this emotional turmoil?

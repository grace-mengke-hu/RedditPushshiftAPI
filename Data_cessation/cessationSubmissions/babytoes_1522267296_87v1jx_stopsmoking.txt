I need tools to quit for good.

I don't know what's wrong with me... I quit smoking 5 years ago. But over the past two months I've started sneaking cigarettes here and there. I've been hiding it from my husband and friends.  I know the reason, I've been under a lot of stress and I'm having a hard time handling it all. It makes me so sad because I've done so good for so long! I just don't know how to stop before I light up... I always feel bad after, not during. I know I'm not addicted, because I have like 2-3 a week and I'm not craving them. I just feel a build up of the stress and I find a moment when I'm alone and Bam! I sneak one from the secret spot in the freezer and go light up. 
Ugh. 
I just need to stop this!!! Does anyone have any tools I can use to sway me from this distructive path??

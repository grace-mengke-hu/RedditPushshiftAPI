Fourth attempt at quitting. I've lost confidence if I can or not.

I will describe my experience with quitting so far here, some words of advice will be appreciated.

About two years ago I quit cigarettes by replacing it with nicotine gums along with 2 of my college friends, it went alright for about a week, but that didn't last and we started smoking again.

Then I left college, and stayed home for 7 months, the cigarettes stopped because I was with my parents, and I didn't want them to know. But not completely, I used to smoke anytime an opportunity presented itself. Most I didn't smoke was again a few weeks.

Next I started living alone abroad, and had a breakup. I started smoking about 20 a day. My chest started hurting, and out of fear I quit cold turkey. I was clean for a month. I just started feeling better when I went to a pub, and the smoke from others got into me. I was drunk, and went out and bought a pack. That was one year ago.

Now I am over the breakup, have finally settled down mentally in my home abroad. I want to quit now. But that factor to push me is absent. Is it burning a hole in my pocket? yes. Am I feeling scared for my health? yes. But there's no friends to do it with me, I am living alone, and no chest pain(I smoke about 10 a day, it might start soon). I think I need an immediate factor to push me. Also, there's this fear in the back of my head that I won't be able to do it because I went back in after staying clean for a month.

I have given myself a deadline, this September is the last month I smoke. Not sure if I'll be able to keep it.

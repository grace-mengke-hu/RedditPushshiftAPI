I'm trying again. This time, I won't fail.

Hi everyone.



I know I've said I would quit before, and I would give it my all...  I failed miserably.  I tripped and fell and curled up into a ball with another pack of smokes and just...  Well, for anyone who's slipped up, you know how it feels.



I've set a date.  September 9th, 2013.  We're moving into our new house then, and I want it to be a smoke-free house.  We'll be getting a hot tub and I love organizing stuff, so setting everything out properly will help keep me occupied.  There will be plenty of stuff to keep me busy, hopefully, and I'm going to talk to my doctor about Champix or something that will help me.



I need to do this, before it's too late to tell my Gramma that I don't have any cravings anymore...  She quit cold turkey, she's my inspiration, I know that I can be strong like her...  I just need to apply myself and keep busy!



I'll keep y'all updated on the 9th, and I'll post once I wake up that morning.  :) sort of a "Day 1" kinda thing.

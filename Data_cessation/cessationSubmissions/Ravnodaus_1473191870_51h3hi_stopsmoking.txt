Chantix Day 5

Edit: I wrote this on day 5, but I'm going to streamline it and continue updating daily. Thanks for the comments and advice!

Let me walk you through a brief summary of the effects so far. This is everything, so... side effects of the med, withdrawal, and misc life all rolled into one.


Day 1 - nothing

Day 2 - remembered my dreams (normally extremely rare), slight low level anxiety, I smoked more than normal

Day 3 - remembered my dreams, very energetic, mild stomach distress

Day 4 - dreamed a lot, listless aimless energy that I couldn't focus, I forgot to smoke for several hours at one point (which was cool) 

Day 5 - intense chaotic dreams, I smell the smoke (and it is repulsive), and... I'm not thinking like I normally do. It feels... foreign. 

**Update:**

Day 6 - My sleep was disrupted and felt restless, was hard to wake up, feel very mellow today

Day 7 - Vivid chaotic dreams, my whole body aches, I'm smoking less than normal without trying, not freaked out by changes in how I'm thinking anymore - it is actually kinda nice

Day 8 - Vivid horrifying dreams, had trouble sleeping, mild body ache, feeling just a little emotionally unstable (Up to full dosage today), smoking less

Day 9 - Vivid weird dreams, extreme anxiety

Day 10 - Vivid long lasting and interesting dreams, feeling good, smoking less frequently

Day 11 - Strange antagonistic dreams (dreams are getting so vivid it is hard to tell them apart from reality... other than like, logic... so I'm going to stop saying "vivid" every time), feeling good, smoking less

Day 12 - Silly fanciful dreams, feel great, cravings nearly absent

Day 13 - Upsetting dreams, feel fine, very little smoking

Day 14 - Nightmares, Feel a little tired, very little smoking

**Smoke-free:**

Day 15 - Quit Day. Upsetting dreams, a little sluggish. No smoking, and almost zero desire to.

Day 16 - Chaotic mad dreams, no smoking or desire to.

Day 17 - Nightmares, emotionally oscillating for no reason, tense, minor desire to smoke, didn't.

Day 18 - Really screwed up dreams that'll probably haunt me forever... feel great otherwise. No smoking or desire to.

Day 19 - Action packed, and disturbing dreams. No smoking, no desire to. Mild headache. I'm eating more food. A little tired.

Day 20 - Unsettling dreams. No smoking still! Feel great, breathing is noticeably easier. Feeling tired though.

Day 21 - Action/adventure dreams (a relief, had all been bad dreams for over a week now), felt very long in duration. Responding to stressful situations better than ever. Mind feeling consistently sharper. 7th day of no smoking :) Still very tired all the time.

Days 22, 23, 24 - Jacked up dreams, restless sleep. Always feeling tired, more sleep/naps don't help. Decided to cut dosage down to 1/2 to see if it helps.

Day 25 - Dreams screwing with sanity. Was half convinced reality was an illusion when I woke up... worrisome. Still feel extremely tired.

Day 26 - Losing sight of dreams vs reality when I first wake up. Troubling thought patterns in the morning. Exhausted.


**Totally done...**

Day 27 - I got up in the middle of the night and did a bunch of random stuff and didn't remember any of it in the morning. Feeling like sleep doesn't work, feels like I haven't slept in days. I really wanted to make it to my original 28 day goal... but... naw, I'm done. Not taking any more Chantix.

Day 28 - Still dreaming, but less vivid for the first time. I didn't sleep well, but it is the first time in over a week I feel like I've even slept at all.

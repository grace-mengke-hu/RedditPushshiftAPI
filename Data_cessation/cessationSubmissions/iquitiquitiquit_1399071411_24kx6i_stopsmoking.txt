326 Days And Counting!!!

Hey guys,

Just wanted to check in here and offer encouragement and hope to anyone just beginning their quit journey. I know that 326 days ago, smoking 1.5 packs a day, I thought that making it past even the first hour of the first day was impossible.

Let me know if you've got any questions about potential challenges you might face, situational tactics to avoid triggering cravings, etc. My quit was pretty damn brutal, especially in the first few months, so I've got all sorts of little workarounds that i can share.

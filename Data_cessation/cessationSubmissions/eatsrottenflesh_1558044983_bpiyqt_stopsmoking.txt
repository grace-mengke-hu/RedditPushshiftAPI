Day 4, body count: 0, so far.

Been smoking a pack a day for about 27 years (43 years old now). Going back to college for an engineering degree. Started a chantix prescription around the end of April with the idea of quitting right after finals. I've got an internship this summer along with my regular job, so I don't have time to be a smoker anymore. I keep a pack of altoids in my pocket for something to chew on. It's been 4 days without and I haven't killed anyone, yet, but I am looking for volunteers. It's been a rough week, but every time I'm ready to give up, I think of my coworker who quit. If that jacka\*\* can do it, so can I. I'm going for a long weekend with the girlfriend to try to get away before my internship starts on Monday. Wish her luck.

It's finally time

I haven't been smoking for nearly as long as any of you guys (alil over 2 years) but I'm a pack every two days kind of guy. I've tried quitting a lot however the longest I've been able to go is about a day but that changes today. I'm only 19 and I hate not being about to run without feeling like my lungs are on fire and I hate smelling like shit. I'm a healthy, active guy and this has been holding me back for so damn long. I only started because everyone else did it but I've recently moved 8 hours away from my hometown and I want to start fresh and clean. Any advice would be greatly appreciated especially for the first three days. I think smoking is the biggest regret I've ever had in my life and I'm looking to put it past me. I want to be able to run a five k, I want to be able to not wake up and need a dart within the first five minutes, I want to change. I've been lurking for a little while and and I'm ready to join the club. I've requested a badge. This is happening.

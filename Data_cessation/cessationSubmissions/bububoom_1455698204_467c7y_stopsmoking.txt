366 days. A fucking year!

A whole fucking year disappeared. For the last few months I didn't even register myself as a former smoker. Once I was with smoking people I didn't "when i smoked i". It's such a strange feeling.

It feels very good to smell good and be able to go outside just to clear my head for 5-10minutes without any urge to smoke a cigarette.

Seems like it was very quick but then I realise how much was done in that 1 year. I ran for more than half a year(now winter is ending, will start again). Bought a bike(an expensive one and it still cost like 1/3 of the smoking price for whole year) and going to the gym for a few months now.

Quitting smoking trained my will very well. I noticed that I take decisions much better and stick to the plans much stricter than before. My wife noticed this very well and compliments me very often on that.

I don't call it a victory yet because it still sometimes seems like a good enjoyment to smoke and I think that maybe someday I will if I want. I don't bash myself for that. I am not a robot, I have feelings, urges, desires, if one day I will want to smoke, I have a few packs at home(had those 366 days) ready to aid me :D.

What helped me if you ask - complete honesty with myself. No Allen Car book(didn't read it), no vaping, no patches, just went from 20cigs/day to 0cigs a day within a moment I was sitting in front of the computer and realised that I no longer want to feel that guilt of a smoker that I am damaging myself and I need a change and each time I urged a bit to smoke I remembered that it's not "I hate cigarettes" or any other bullshit. I liked them enough to smoke for 8 years and telling myself how I hate them would be a lie. I wanted a change in my life and my health and that's the thoughts that kept me strong.

FUCK YEAH

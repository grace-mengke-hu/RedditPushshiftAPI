End of the day wind down syrategies?

So I'm 15 days smoke free and here's my dilemma. Every Thursday or Friday night I used to smoke and drink and relax and hang out with friends.  It was a wonderfully relaxing way to end the week. Now I've given up my cigs, my friends, and drinking only makes me want to smoke. Its very depressing. Im working on new friendships but it takes time to build them and i need to not relapse now. How do all you successful quitters celebrate the end of the week and wind down?

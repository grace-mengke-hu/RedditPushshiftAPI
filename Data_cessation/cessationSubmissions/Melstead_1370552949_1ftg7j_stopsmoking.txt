Day 3 Smoke FREE: Its an Illusion...

10+ years and many quitting attempts, and i thought i was hopeless.
I was an anxious wreck who depended on cigs for....  for...

Then it hit me.  Im depending on cigs for everything, including MY SENSE OF SELF?!?!
I realized the little fuckers were brainwashing me into thinking I AM THE PROBLEM, not them, never them.  I was at the point where my entire day revolved around the next smoke.  Pathetic.

So i said FUCK YOU.  And took my life back.  All the reasons i COULDNT QUIT were perpetrated by the CIGS THEMSELVES.  *When you quit, you lose the illusions that you cant quit.* 
Cigarettes are basically an ABUSIVE PARTNER that creates the problems, tries to convince you everything is your fault, and then PRETENDS to be the solution for every problem. 

They make you depressed - then tell you they are an anti-depressant.

They make you lethargic - then tell you cigs are exciting.

They make you anxious - then tell you they relax you.

They make you lonely - then tell you your special.

They make you sick - then tell you it's medicine.

They make you smelly and gross - then tell you that you're cool and suave.

They make you burn money - then tell you its worth every penny.

They fill you with doubt - then tell you cigs make you confident.

They create fear - then tell you they give you courage.

They make you impotent - then tell you they are amazing after sex.

THEY LIE TO YOU! THEY'VE CAUSED EVERY PROBLEM YOU'VE EVERY HAD WITH THEM.   IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT - IT IS THEIR FAULT!  You MUST forgive yourself, it was never your fault.  We are confronted with the 3rd MOST ADDICTIVE DRUG ever made, right behind Heroin and Crack.  And it's legal.  Pathetic.

Now, get RIGHTEOUS, and never smoke one again.  Let THAT be your fault.  It is incredibly liberating knowing you *no longer need to divide yourself into two conflicting personalities.*
But you MUST commit to HATING nicotine.  Any mental doubts will manifest themselves as physical withdrawal symptoms - this is how nicotine hooks, it's a mental parasite.

This is a BATTLE that you will WIN.  Ironically, all you have to do is IGNORE YOUR OPPONENT to claim victory!  (this actually takes LESS EFFORT than acknowledging all the withdrawal symptoms and false emotions.)  Nicotine always loses this war, because it CANNOT IGNORE YOU, and therein lies its only weakness: *It depends on your mistakes for survival.*

If you feel like your making a sacrifice, it has tricked you. You are NOT sacrificing anything by quitting! If you smoke, your sacrificing your health.   Remember, you aren't being deprived of ANYTHING.  Cigarettes have NOTHING to offer besides POINTLESS DEPENDENCY and AGONIZING DEATH. Let me reiterate:    *A.G.O.N.I.Z.I.N.G.   D.E.A.T.H.*

If you KEEP LOVING YOURSELF, and STOP FOOLING YOURSELF, you will succeed.  You are already more than strong enough to end this blight on your soul.

FUCK EM!  It's you or them. 

(note: please live a healthy lifestyle - that's *your* responsibility, and it will help you quit.) 


*TL;DR* - get ANGRY at the smokes.  HATE them for their DAMAGE and LIES.  And QUIT happily.  

*EDIT:* I have since been updating this article as a record of my convictions.  My hope is to have a concise record of my "manifesto".  These are personal revelations and may not apply to everyone.  And, thank you for all the wonderful comments and support! Special Thanks to Allen Carr, RIP.

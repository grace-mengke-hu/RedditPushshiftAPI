I quit for a while every year or two...

Cigarettes are super expensive. I was spending about $100 per month on them. I feel like shit every time I wake up from a night of heavy smoking. They don't even get me high or anything. I've been off of cigs for 3 days so far this go-around, and I have no idea why I want one so badly right now. What is the deal with these fucking things?

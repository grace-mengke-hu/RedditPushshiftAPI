Almost one week- made it through the weekend

I feel weird posting about this, all of my friends either smoke or just don't care so it feels like bringing up the subject of quitting to them is taboo. 



I smoked my last cigarette on the 31st before going to bed, woke up and downloaded the Stop Smoking app (which suggested posting on here). The weekdays weren't too bad, but I bartend and finishing up a shift late on Friday or Saturday without a cigarette is the toughest thing I've had to do in a long time. Cheers to anyone else closing out their first week

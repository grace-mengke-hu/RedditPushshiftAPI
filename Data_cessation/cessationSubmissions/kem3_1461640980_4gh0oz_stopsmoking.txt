Anxiety and smoking linked?

I've been noticing that quite a few people on here talk about anxiety, and relieving symptoms of anxiety/stress through smoking (myself included), so I did a quick Google and came up with [this abstract](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933800002091) from 2000 that seems to validate my thinking (edit: that people with anxiety take up smoking).  If this (one) study is right (and mind you, one study is never enough to prove anything - science has to be *repeatable*), I wonder if it might be a good idea to start addressing the anxiety issue on this subreddit, perhaps by putting anti-anxiety resources in the sidebar.  Anyone else want to look into this and see if there is, in fact, a connection between anxiety and smoking?

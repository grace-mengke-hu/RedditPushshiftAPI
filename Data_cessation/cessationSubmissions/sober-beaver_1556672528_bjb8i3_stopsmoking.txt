7 days!!

Just finished a week since my last e-cig puff! It's been a very different experience compared to all the times I stopped smoking cigarettes cold turkey. For me, the cravings have been more frequent, but each one has been less strong, compared to quitting cigarettes.

For whatever reason, the cravings are hitting hard today though -- much harder than the past few days, but I'm too proud of having completed a week to give in now. I think it's gonna be one of those days where all you I can do is not smoke.

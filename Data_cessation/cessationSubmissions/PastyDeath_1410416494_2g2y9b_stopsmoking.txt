One Week, and My Reward Wasn't a Cigarette!

I've been on a Deployed Ship for almost 9 months now, and when I started smoking for the 10th time near the start of the trip, I figured it would be simple to put down again (as it was in the past).

Queue at least 3 *real* attempts at quitting, each ending with a night in port and some alcohol then a cigarette as a reward, and right back into smoking again. Now today I hit that day 7...and ate icecream instead! 

Just want to thank everyone here for the support; even just seeing the awesome posts from people one or two days ahead of me have kept me on the right track, and honestly the cravings aren't very bad at all (I don't know why, but I wont question it!)

Cheers all, and if your day 3-5, stay in there! The extra couple days makes everything even easier! That hill can be a steep one to climb, but it's going to be worth it when I can answer simply "No" to the doc when he asks me if I smoke :)

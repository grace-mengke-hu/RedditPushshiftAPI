Day 4. Was doing fine, got walloped today.

Brief background:  I am an adult-starting cig smoker.  Smoked 4 a day (sometimes 5, sometimes 3) for a few years.  Got addicted.  For whatever reason it never increased.  So I decided to quit while starting a keto diet.

So the first three days weren't bad.  I craved them, but it wasn't awful.  But today I accidentally made eye contact with my ex in a parking lot (through a car window, no talking, no waving).  We have an agreement not to talk for a minimum of 2 years.  I haven't seen her for 13 months.  It just instantly sank me.  I feel awful emotionally, and it's 5 hours later now.  

I guess my questions is...is this kind of overreaction emotionally because of quitting cigarettes possibly?  I feel like my emotions were totally in control before, but not today.

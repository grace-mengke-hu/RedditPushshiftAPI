I've tried to quit a few times.

I haven't been able to. I was never a heavy smoker, at my worst I was at about 4 packs a week. For most of the time I've been at about a pack and a half a week. Lately (the last 2 or 3 months) I've been smoking a lot more, maybe 3 packs a week. Suddenly cigarettes started tasting weird to me. The last pack I had just gave off this weird taste. like.. I really don't know how to explain it. There was some weird, strong chemical taste coming from them. I figured it was just the pack of cigarettes and tossed the rest (admittedly, not many left in it). Next pack (bought from a different store about 4 days later), same thing. Can I use this to help me quit? I find the taste disgusting but it's not quite stopped me from smoking (it has slowed me down a bit, though).

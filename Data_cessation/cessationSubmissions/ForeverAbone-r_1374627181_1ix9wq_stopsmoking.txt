welp...I fucked up guys (and gals)

Smoked a cig today. I know stress shouldnt be a trigger but..a tree almost fell through my roof, I had to fire a long time employ for fucking up bigtime...sorry but yeah I lit up. 

I Hated it too. 

I read a study from Duke University that said smokers who smoke, while on the patch, had a better chance to quit. But that's no excuse and I hope you all can learn from my failure. I'm gonna keep trying though. Thanks for everyone's help so far!!!

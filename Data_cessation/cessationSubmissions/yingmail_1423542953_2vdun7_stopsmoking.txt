Exercise while smoking. Some questions.

Currently a smoker who runs about a mile and a half every day. Smoking makes me feel like junk, but I can't seem to say no to a cigarette before or after my exercise.

My hope is that just by running I will naturally just slow down and stop. So far this is not the case. My lungs hurt all the time :( fuck.

Anybody go through some of this junk?

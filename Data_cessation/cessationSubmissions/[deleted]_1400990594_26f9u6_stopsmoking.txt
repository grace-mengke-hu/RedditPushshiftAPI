So Far So Good! It's been 3 days.

So, I quit cold turkey. The amount of support I've received here is amazing, and I'm so lucky to be a part of this now. My cravings have been very little. I've noticed an increase in my anxiety levels, but I found that even just the motions of going outside, playing with my phone, all the things I used to do when I smoked, has helped me. Several trips to the gas station for gas, snacks and drinks have all been a test of my commitment, but I have not bought cigarettes. 

I had this terrible cough for weeks. It was a combination of post-nasal drip from allergies and the shitty condition my lungs are in. Now, it's only been 3 days, but my cough has improved immensely. Still have a bunch of phlegm and inflammation in my sinuses, but now my coughs are more productive and my throat doesn't feel like it's on fire.

I don't need cigarettes. I watched my mom die from lung cancer when I was 5, I watched my dad lose a kidney to cancer from cigarettes. I have seen what smoke and nicotine does to walls and how much work it takes to clean it. I WILL make better memories for my son, instead of perpetuating the nightmare that was my childhood.

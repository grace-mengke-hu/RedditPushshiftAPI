fell of the wagon..a little bit

ok...tomorrow marks day 28! 4 weeks without smoking...I found a smoke today...I lit it...I had 3 puffs and got rid of it....I feel like I am setting myself up to fail....gah!! Why!!!!

...Do I have to start day 1 all over again?? Is this just a blip? I think it also bears mentioning I have been off the Champix a week. I got the flu over Christmas and stopped taking it as I felt crummy enough without adding to it. I took a Champix right after I got rid of that smoke. It's clear to me I still need the Champix, but I can't do the full dose. I spoke to my pharmacist tonight and he told me to cut it in half..So going foreward that is my plan. I will split a pill in the am and take the half twice a day.

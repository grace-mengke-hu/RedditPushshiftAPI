I have officially started smoking again

So just a few hours ago, I have finally smoked my first cigarette in a long while. I feel really sorry for myself but I just can't help it. I'm really stressed out with my job and specially my family. I hope I can get back when everything is fine and I do believe I can get through these tough times. You guys stay strong!

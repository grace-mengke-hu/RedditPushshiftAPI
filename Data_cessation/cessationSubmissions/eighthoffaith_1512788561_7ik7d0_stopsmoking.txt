Happy birthday Grandpa

I need somewhere to vent for this one. I quit smoking cold turkey two days ago. I've been managing my cravings and resisting successfully, but today has been weird. It has simultaneously been the hardest *and easiest* day to resist cravings. 

Today would have been my grandfather's 68th birthday, and that man was the only father I've ever had or needed, and I miss him. When he passed in 2011, it changed my whole life, and I haven't been right since. In 2012, I started smoking. I was 15 years old, and I kind of associated smoking with my grandpa, since he was a smoker for my entire life, all the way until the end. He was the smoker they warn smokers about; emphysema, cancer, and early death at 62 years old. Strong as he was, the cigarettes controlled him til the end. So now, on his birthday, I'm two days into my journey of freedom from smoking. 

I said today has been the hardest and easiest day for resisting. It's been the hardest because I miss you, Pappy, but it's been the easiest because I know you're proud of me, and I know you want this freedom for me. I'll keep fighting. I love you.

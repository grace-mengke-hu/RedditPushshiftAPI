I noticed I go red in the face and am short of breath a lot...the main symptoms of emphysema...my motivation within.

As mentioned above, I easily go red in the face and run out of breath. I remembered this condition from when I studied pathology. I just checked my uni notes, its the symptoms emphysema. I'm not rushing out to the doctor but I am stopping smoking. I can't have a healthy life as a smoker. Time to stop.

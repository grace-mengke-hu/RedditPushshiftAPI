Withdrawl Symptoms

So, I've been a long time quitting. I haven't smoked an actual cig in a long time, almost three years. In the meantime I was vaping, and then this year I used the patch to gradually step down, control intake of nic, and I'm going off this weekend. At this point, I've actually been cuting 21mg patches into 4ths for 5.25 mg of nic a day. 

Withdrawls aren't that bad, mostly I feel spacey and its hard to focus on anything. I have a shorter temper, but not as bad as when I tried cold turkey 3 years ago now. 

Question is, how did you deal with withdrawls? Is there something you took that helped? How long did they last? I've heard three days and they subside immensely. I've been taking st. johns wart for depression, did that help anyone else out?

Television and smell induced urges

Okay so I've been smoke free for almost 2 years now. Best decision I've ever made. 

I'm writing this post because even after having come this far I still get urges to smoke when I see people enjoying a smoke on TV or lighting one and I'm like FUCK I could use a cigarette right now but then I remember it's not what I need or want really. I literally couldn't watch Shameless anymore because Lip is a chainsmoker and it was starting to get to me ðŸ¥´
Also when it comes to cigarette smell, sometimes I'll catch a wiff and I'm like damn that smells GOOD and sometimes I catch a wiff and I almost gag. I'm not sure why it's so hot and cold when it comes to smell. 

Am I alone? Anybody else get triggered by TV and movies?

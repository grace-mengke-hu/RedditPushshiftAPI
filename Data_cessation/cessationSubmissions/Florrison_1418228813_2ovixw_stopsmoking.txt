I'm done.

This will be my first post on reddit and it is actually something I'll write for me more than anybody else. It's not important that people will read this post, it is important that it is out there for me to revisit anytime I'm getting weak.

I've been smoking for about 8 years and it has been a huge part of my identity. I started when I was 16 years old and back then, it made us feel like adults. Partying, drinking and smoking. It was a great time. 

But now smoking just makes me feel sick. I tried to stop many times now, but it never really worked for me, as if I'm still clinging on to it for old times sake. Hiding behind it in bad times and just wanting it to feel like it felt back then.

But it won't. Things change and thats a good thing. Now, I just want to be free from this addiction that has become a mere burden to my life. 

So I will quit now. For the last time.

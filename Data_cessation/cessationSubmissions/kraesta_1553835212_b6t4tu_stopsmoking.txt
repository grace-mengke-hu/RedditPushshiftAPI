Has anyone had issue with memory after quitting?

This might be super weird and unrelated, but I’ve only been experienced this since I stopped smoking and I think it may be correlated.  At the beginning, I was your typical scatter brained quitter, having difficulty focusing on one thing for too long. That felt normal. My brain was focused on its lack of nicotine. But it kept getting worse. Now, as I’m nearing 3 months, I’m discovering actual acts that I have no recollection of at all. Text messages sent, conversations with people, simple things around the house. Is this normal? Does it fade? Has anyone had any success boosting their memory post quit?

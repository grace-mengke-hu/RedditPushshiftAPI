Feel like utter shit

Nicotine withdrawal gives me the same symptoms as depression and a lot of things are already stressful right now in my life and tonight I can barely cope. I won't kill myself or smoke a cigarette but I just needed to shed a few tears and write about it here. Never thought I'd still have days like this after all these months, at least the dark feelings never last very long, already starting to feel better.

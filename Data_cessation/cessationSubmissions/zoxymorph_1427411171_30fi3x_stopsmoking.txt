Did anyone get foggy-headed and lethargic while they were still smoking? Does this go away with time?

Has anyone here had the experience of feeling foggy headed WHILE they are still smoking? I know it's common to experience this in withdrawal, but I seem to be the opposite. I was smoking a pack a day and I've only been off the nicotine for a day at this point, but I already feel more clearheaded. Maybe it was the carbon monoxide? The foggy-headedness and just noticing how bad cigarettes made me feel basically constantly despite the temporary satisfaction is the main reason I'm quitting.

My question is, has anyone had a similar experience with the fogginess? Did it get better a week or a month or something after you quit?

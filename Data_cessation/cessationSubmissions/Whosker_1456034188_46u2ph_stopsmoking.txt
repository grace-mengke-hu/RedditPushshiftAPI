1.5 month smoke free... Needing some encouragement

Hi everyone!

Stumbled across this sub in my google efforts to find some articles or forums to read for a good pick me up. I'm 1.5 months smoke free. I wasn't fully ready to quit, but when my S.O went 24 hours without a cig, I had made a promise that I would stop with him. So here we both are smoke free. Honestly, it does feel great now that we are past the "worst" of it. 

My problem is the weight gain. I've always been a relatively thin girl, even prior to smoking. So far I've put on 6lbs. It doesn't sound like a lot, but the sudden change is noticeable on me and really making me uncomfortable in my own skin to the point where I've selfishly considering smoking again several times. I have joined a gym & started jogging. My eating habits haven't changed much, but I am making an effort to eat a bit healthier and not snack as much. Will the weight eventually come off as my body readjusts to not having nicotine or should I get use to the extra weight now & push even harder at the gym? What did you do to shed the weight? How long did it take? 

Thanks in advance for any tips.

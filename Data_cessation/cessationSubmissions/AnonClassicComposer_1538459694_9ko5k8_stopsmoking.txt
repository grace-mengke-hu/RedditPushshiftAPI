Give wellbutrin a shot

Hi I’m 26 have smoked 10 years.

Damn i found the cause and will to quit so suddenly 1.5 months into taking Wellbutrin for unrelated depression. Am now 2 weeks off and have never had such an easy time ignoring the urges (I’ve wanted to quit every day for years now)

I would highly recommend ATM. But of course I am early in the quitting stages, so maybe someone had advice for me?

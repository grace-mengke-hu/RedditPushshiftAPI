61 days.

I've been vaping and using nicotine lozenges. Steadily dropping my eliquid. I'm down to 3mg from my initial 9mg. And I'm down from 8, 4mg lozenges a day to 2, 2mg lozenges. I want to wrap up my nicotine replacement by the end of this month. Lozenges will be done in about 4 days and I'll move to 1.5mg eliquid in another week or so.

I've been doing so good but right now I'm really struggling. Right now I want a cigarette. Like a lot. A lot a lot. I'll be around them later because family. I have the strength to resist. Right? Just make it through today. I have to keep dropping my nicotine. I want to be free. Can't use NRT forever.

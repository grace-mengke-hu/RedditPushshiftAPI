I tell myself/people that I'm trying to quit smoking, but I'm not doing anything about it.

Context: 21 (f), smoking since I was 15.

It's in my head, constantly, the thought that I want to quit. Most of the cigarettes I smoke, I don't enjoy. My lungs feel tired and shitty, and I don't want to do it anymore. But I don't suppress my cravings. I don't even try to stop myself when I crave a cigarette, I just light it up. 

Sometimes I rationalize it by thinking, I'm in my senior year in university and writing my grad thesis, I'm really stressed. There's no way that I can quit smoking at this point in my life.

But at the same time, I want to quit. I want to stop. I want to stop spending 10$/pack 3 times a week. It's a ridiculous expense that I prioritize over groceries. 

The most frustrating part about all of this is that I'm specializing on the neurobiology of addictions, and I know what's going on in my brain when I crave a cigarette. I know where the cravings come from, but I don't even try to distract myself from them. I hate it. 

I have been thinking of buying a pack of cigarettes and destroying them, I feel like I need a symbolic "quitting ritual". If I destroy a full pack of cigarettes, I will feel like I'm destroying 10$ that I really need, which is exactly what I'm doing by smoking anyway.

This is a ridiculous addiction and it makes me sad that I feel so weak.

Edit: Wow. Shit just got more depressing. I just saw that my flair is still there, 104 days. An attempt that lasted a week and a half.

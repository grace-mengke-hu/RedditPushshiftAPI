I'm sick of this disease. I want out.

I can't count the number of times in the last few months I've woken up after a night of drinking and chain smoking and thinking "I gotta quit this shit." The last 6 nights I hung out, drank with friends, and smoked a whole pack every single night. Today I woke up and decided I'm done. I'm scared shitless about it. I worry about not being able to hang out with my friends as much, about caving in as soon as I'm not hungover anymore. What if I make it really far, then slip up? All my progress?
My husband wants to stop too. I hope we can beat this together. I actually want a cigarette right now, but I'm also trying to picture myself running a 5k. I want to beat this so bad.

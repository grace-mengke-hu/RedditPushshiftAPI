3 weeks since I quit smoking!

Just feel so excited cuz it has been three weeks since I attempted to quit smoking.
I have to say that I felt quite good at the first period(the first week). I tried doing exercises, I learned cooking and I reduced the time with my smoking friends. 
However it really became worse from the second week. When my friend asked me to have a cigarette, I accepted.... However it felt awkward and I couldn't stop feeling disgusted... And then I threw the cigarette and bought myself an iced coke to relief from the uncomfortable feeling.
I have to say that it will be really u comfortable when u pick up a cigarette after u quit smoking for a while. And from that time, I kept on quit smoking since now.
A weird thing is, now I even cannot suffer the smell of the cigarette, and when my boyfriend smoked at home, the smell always made me dizzy and disgusted. But I used to love this smell, all that changes is the attitude towards smoking and I also found that my skin situation became better and I can concerntrate more on my work without a cigarette.

For those who is doing the same thing--quit smoking, my suggestion is, do more exercise, take some snacks instead of cigarette when u feel alone or bored, and the most important thing is trust yourself that u can suffer the process of the quit attempt. It's also better to find a friend quit with you.

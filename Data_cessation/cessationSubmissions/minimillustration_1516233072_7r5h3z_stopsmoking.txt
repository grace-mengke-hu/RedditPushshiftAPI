5 months into my quit and You can quit too!

I just thought I’d pop Incase anyone just starting needs some motivation... because it totally gets better! After 3 months I can go weeks without a craving or even thinking about cigarettes. Now at 5 months it’s even better. One thing that trips me out are the occasional smoking dreams, but in those I usually feel so guilty and then relieved I didn’t actually smoke when I wake up. So if you have dreams like that it’s probably a good sign. For me cold turkey was key, I armed myself with lots of snacks, made a pillow fort and locked myself in for the first two days. I really think that’s the way to do it. Just brace yourself and run full stop until you’re out of the woods (like three days). You can do it!

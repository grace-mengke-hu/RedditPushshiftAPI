Need new tricks!

So I was doing so awesome and not thinking about smoking at all and feeling like a total super star all this time and suddenly, two months after quitting, i really want to smoke again!

I think it's the nicer weather or maybe how social I've been hanging out with smokers often - but suddenly it's like my first week of quitting all over again!

To get through the first time I just bunkered down stayed inside alot and ate alot of candy. I don't feel like doing either of those things now though, I want to go out and do stuff I used to do while smoking and not be bugged by the cravings! 

Situations I am looking for tricks with:

-Hanging out on a balcony with my girlfriends drinking wine and smoking cigarettes. This is my biggest trigger.

-One on one hang outs with smokers. I can't really leave them and find something else to do while they are smoking so it's just mentally straining to resist in those moments!

-Boredom at work. When things would start to feel too office-y for me I'd go out for a walk while having a smoke. Now the idea of going for a walk stresses me out because i'd be thinking of smoking the entire time!

**-Cigarettes are my reward system! What besides cigarettes (or candy) can i reward myself with?**

What are your tricks in these situations? I'm open to any of them!

Thanks! :)

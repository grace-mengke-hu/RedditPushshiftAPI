I just wanted to say that I am so done

I am 28 and I have been smoking since I was 17. 

For the past year or so I have kicked other bad habits to replace them with good ones

which is cool, but I always said that quitting cigarette was just too hard for me at the moment.

I just always saw myself as a smoker even though it makes me feel weak every time I take a puff.

I can visualize the poison getting into my body and I'm done neglecting my health.

I'm hoping to talk about it in this subreddit will help me get support!

It has been 2 days now, wishes me luck guys!

Smile, life loves you :)

Last year today, after a hard workday, i ran my first 500 meters with feeling of dying at the end, so i decided this is my rock bottom and going to quit smoking, it gave me power, motivation and most importantly, confidence to do whats in my heart, so i threw away cigarettes, got out of a bad relationship, and started sports again.

Today, i'm happily married to my guitar , can spend 7 hours riding a 2000 meter mountain up and down over 130 km, run 5 km in 21:59 and swim 3 km straight, each with less effort than those 500 meters last year.

The reason you want to do something, is because you know deep down inside you can do it, despite what your current mind-state or outside world tells you, life is good my friends, life is good :)

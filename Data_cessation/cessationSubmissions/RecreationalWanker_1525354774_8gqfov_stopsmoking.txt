Stickier, whiter semen after quitting smoking?

I quit smoking a little over a week ago and I've noticed a massive difference in my semen.

It was a dull shade of white and on the watery side for years but over the last few days it has been bright white and very sticky. 

I haven't been doing anything different recently except for quitting smoking so I'm guessing it must be down to that? Has anyone else noticed a difference in their semen since quitting smoking?

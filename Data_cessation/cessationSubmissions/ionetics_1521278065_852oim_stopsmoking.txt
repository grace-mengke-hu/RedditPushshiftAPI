5 days of dental pain... didn't crack

Would like some pats on the back for not breaking. 


Severe dental pain and three emergency dental appts over 4 days. Dentist mystified, as tooth nerves allegedly stripped out in the first session. Pain would return in spades every time the latest anaesthetic jags wore off, throbbing and shooting up the whole trigeminal nerve distribution. 


Work unsympathetic, with team leader hassling me that I wasn't pulling my weight, causing me to respond via text that I had barely slept or eaten for 4 days and had only ibuprofen for pain, so would now be going off sick. How did she like them apples?


Dentist must've realised I wasn't malingering when I phoned daily, in tears, begging for another set of palatal/maxillary jags. She finally drilled out the dressing on Thurs to have another looky-see, and- wouldn't you know- found more very narrow and sclerosed nerve canals to strip. Finally I was given some decent painkillers, which I enjoyed with Netflix and Malbec over two days of now unnecessary sick leave.


So I managed to piss off my work, my dentist, my partner and  myself very thoroughly, but I did not crack. I did not take one puff, one sip off a vape, one half a lozenge.  I am so happy I've given this gift to myself! 


My app says I'll be saving Â£2,300 this year, and my partner and I are now planning a dream trip to VietNam with cash saved. Thank you to everyone here who keeps me strong. You are such a great bunch of motivators and role models.

Day 5 - massive headaches?

I'm on day 5 today and I have had a horribly persistent headache for the past 3 days, plus some sinus issues. I've quit before for about 5 months and do NOT remember this happening. Anyone else experience this? How long did it last/how did you deal with it? I'm also lacking energy and not sleeping well.

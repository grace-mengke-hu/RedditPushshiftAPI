2 weeks smoke-free. Coughing a lot

Although my lungs still feel like Normandy beach on D Day, I'm feeling on top of the world.

The first week was no walk in the park, with all the heightened anxiety and random body aches and cravings. I've been drinking a lot of water and sleeping a lot. The cravings are now very, very easy to ignore. AND ALSO GUYS I CAN FEEL SMELLS AGAIN. I CAN BREATH IN PARTICLES OF A GOOD SCENT AND DERIVE SENSORIAL PLEASURE FROM IT. THIS FEELS SO NICE.

I also can kinda sense my focus beginning to improve (I don't need to interrupt what I'm doing every 20 minutes to self-destruct, after all). And really motivated because of my renewed sense of being in control over myself.

Stay quit everyone! A lot of things feels so much better than a short-lived nicotine buzz.

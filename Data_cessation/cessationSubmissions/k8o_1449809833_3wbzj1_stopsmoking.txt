I have severe pneumonia

About two weeks ago I got a cold, which turned into a chest cold which turned into severe pneumonia. Before this I smoked about a 1/2 pack a day. And surprisingly the smoking had very little to do with the pneumonia. I've been in the hospital for 6 days and obviously had not smoked. Without even trying I've pretty much quit smoking. Im torn about this. I've always wanted to quit but on my own terms. If I knew my last cigarette was going to be my last one I would have enjoyed it more. And I wouldn't have just spent $70 on a new carton. 
It's one thing to say quitting is easy when I'm in a isolated hospital room. I'm afraid of when I leave the hospital and start my daily routines what's going to happen. I know I have to get rid of the new carton. I don't know what I'm trying to say here. To be honest I'm a little out of it!
But i was wondering if anyone had a similar situation and how did it work out for you?

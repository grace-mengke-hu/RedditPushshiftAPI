Three months smoke free but three months of fatigue

Hello everyone, 
I decided to quit back in March after 10 years of smoking. I love the smells, being able to breath, physical activity, etc. but I have found that I am tired all the time. I smoked as a crutch to stress and attention issues - was diagnosed with ADHD three years ago. So for two years I ran the caffeine, nicotine, amphetamine trifecta. I switched to a non-amphetamine medicine, I cut back caffeine, and now quit smoking....slowing weening off of them. Since quitting smoking my average of 3 to 4 hours of sleep and functioning completely fine has turned into passing at 9 and sleeping 8 hours. What can I do to help with this? I feel like I accomplish nothing with a 60 hour a week job and being tired all the time. Thanks in advance.

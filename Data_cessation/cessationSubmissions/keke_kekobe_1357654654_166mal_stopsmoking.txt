I don't feel like a smoker anymore...

I haven't smoked in a little over two weeks, and honestly, I don't even feel like a smoker anymore.  It's almost strange to me that I even WAS a smoker, let alone 2 packs a day for 12 years.

I have more money, I have more energy, I feel better, smell better, look better, am working out daily, am moving forward.

Don't give up.  It's fantastic being free of that shit.

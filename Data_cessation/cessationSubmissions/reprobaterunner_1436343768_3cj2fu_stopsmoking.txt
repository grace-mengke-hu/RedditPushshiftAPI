Day two: surviving the dinner party

Dinner parties are one of those things that suddenly just creeps up on you. An alarm bell seems to go off in your late twenties brain and says – you are mature now, its time to sit down and eat food over wine by candlelight while awkwardly listening to someone describe their IT job.

“Fascinating:” someone will say, eyes fixated on the bottle of wine in their hands. 

Before, my respite came in the packet lying on the windowsill. I could excuse myself, and spend a few minutes trying to think of witty repartee. Inevitably sitting back, no wittier than I left.

The truth is, smoking doesn’t improve cognitive function, nor make me any funnier than I was before I came back smelling of ash. 

Yesterday, something was different. I didn’t want to smoke. Normally, I would feel the urge, the need to escape. I smiled, and laughed. The anxiety was gone, I wasn’t even looking for a way to escape. I was looking for reasons to stay.

On day two of quitting, I survived the dinner party without a single cigarette touching my lips. Despite seeing the smokers huddled by the window. Onwards to day three.

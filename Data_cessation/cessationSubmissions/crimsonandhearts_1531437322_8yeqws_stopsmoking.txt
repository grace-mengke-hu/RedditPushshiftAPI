Day 12 on Chantix

You guyssssss!! I haven’t had FULL cigarette in 2 days and I haven’t bought a pack in 4!!! (I’ve been taking drags from my boyfriends cigs when he smokes) 

I had 5 puffs of one this morning and not once since. The mornings are definitely the hardest and that’s going to be tough to get through. But I’m going strong and I’m determined. 

The sleep trouble is getting better and I’m only having a little nausea after the second full dose of the day, but if I eat with it or after it, it goes away. 

Thanks for listening guys. Can’t wait to be officially smoke free!

New college grad looking to make a change

So me and my friends are going on a cruise to celebrate our recent college graduation. For many years, my friends have always made it know that they do not support my smoking habit and how it annoys them how I periodically sneak away to have a cigarette, missing out on parts of the party. So for this trip, as a gift to them and as an attempt to better myself, I want to quit smoking. I struggle heavily to not smoke while drinking, and I will be drinking for the majority of the trip. I'm just looking for any tips or advice to make the process easier, and to make my attempt to quit as successful as possible. Thanks for any help!

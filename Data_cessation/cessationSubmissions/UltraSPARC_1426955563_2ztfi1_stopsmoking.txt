A few days tobacco free...

So I only have a few days tobacco free. I'm vaping right now (not sure if that counts as quitting), but it's been very helpful. I'm 31 and have early onset COPD. I've been smoking since I was 13. I take Advair twice a day and have an emergency inhaler. If I don't take these I wake up in the middle of the night wheezing, unable to breath or am short of breath during the day. I'm just getting over my second upper respiratory infection within two months.

I'm dealing with the very real consequences of smoking right now and it sucks. It's time to quit. My doctor tells me if I quit now the chances of my COPD going away are very high.

Thanks for reading. I just needed to write this down to see my own insanity that I've been putting myself through for the past few years. If you're still smoking now, just realize that you too can suffer these consequences. I'm lucky I have good insurance. Advair costs $400/mo and ProAir HFA costs another $350/mo without it!

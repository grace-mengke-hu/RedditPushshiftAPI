50 of smoking

I started to quit on Monday - now on day 6 This is how it went Monday had 2, Tuesday had 9, Wednesday had 3  Thursday had 2 Friday had 2.   Considering I was smoking 35 per day and have been smoking for 50 years, I think thats pretty damn good for me.  I am struggling hence why had the odd ones during last 5 days.  I am trying to continue andto be hones if I manage to get my smoking down to single figure per day, its got to be better than I have been doing at 35 per day.  The nrt Gum is the only thing I am using and yes I think it works well, but my jaws ache with chewing.  Any comments would be appreciated.

New Years Quitters...We are in week #3!!

Time flies huh? Week 3 here we go! I have to say, I think of smoking less and less. Actually, I can't even think of the moment when I had strong cravings. It's more of a "Hmmm...I would have a cigarette right about now before.." I am glad I don't have to worry about it any more. I don't have to go inside the gas station to buy them. 

My car smells sooooo much better now. My clothes too. My hands don't stink anymore. My breath feels fresh. I love it!

Hope you guys are hanging in there! Gotta keep on truckin'! We got this. It's easier and easier with every day that passes by. 

On an additional positive note, my workouts are getting better and better. I am finally getting back to the weights that I was lifting 3 years ago. I actually enjoy working out and I am looking forward to hit the weights after work. Feels good to get my lungs and heart pumping!

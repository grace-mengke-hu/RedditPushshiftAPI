WEIGHT GAIN...

What the fuck! Im almost at 2 months without a single puff. I count my macro nutrients (carbs,proteins,fats) on a calorie deficit. I have 3 weightlifting and 3 cardio days (run 5k or insanity tape) AND I STILL CAN'T LOSE THIS 10lb weight gain since I quit. What gives?!?!! I'm really scared to drop my Marcos even more for the sake of losing muscle or stamina...

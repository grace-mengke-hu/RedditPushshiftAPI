I had my last cigarette 29 days ago but I can't do it anymore.

I have been on the nicoderm patch for 29 days. I have not had a drag of one cigarette. I required that my doctor put me on the nicoderm brand name patch. When I went to pick up my third box of patches on Tuesday before work, they gave me CVS brand patches. I had to go to work, I didn't have time to call my doctor to have it fixed. So I just took those.


It's now Thursday and I have been on the CVS brand patch for 3 days. I want a cigarette today more than I have ever wanted one in the past 29 days.


I'm about to rip this waste of money off my shoulder and buy a pack.

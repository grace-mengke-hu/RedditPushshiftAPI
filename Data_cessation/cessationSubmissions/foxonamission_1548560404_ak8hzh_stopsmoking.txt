Getting deep today...

Approaching week three- 21 days- tomorrow. Using the smoke free app and reading this sub. The past week has been deep &amp; kind of dark. I just have this horrible toxic attitude that I can’t shake. I feel angry that I’m such a hot mess, irritated at everything &amp; I feel deprived of cigarettes as a vice &amp; reward. I feel like I don’t know how to deal with my emotions because for the past 18 years I’ve been using cigarettes in reaction to every emotion I’ve ever felt: happiness, excitement, celebration, anxiety, boredom, sadness,  anger, etc etc. It’s just SO sad and I’m just SO over my negative attitude. I have sticky notes &amp; positive affirmations everywhere, I’m surrounded by loving &amp; supportive non smokers...I should be HAPPY, PROUD, and RELIEVED to be at three weeks. Why is this such a heavy emotional process? Has anyone else had this experience at three weeks? Is it just another stage in the process? I would love your thoughts because I don’t have any smokers in my life who have quit and I’m really struggling with this negativity. 🙏😩❤️💪🤷‍♀️

12 days until my old record

I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com//r/stopsmoking/comments/2h5sz0/52_days_and_i_smoked_today/) today. It's my first ever post on this account and I believe it's the reason why I made this account (my previous account had my name in it)

This time I am so much more confident than the previous time. It genuinely does get easier every time. I'm a non smoker now, there's no turning back, but I cannot wait until another 12 days pass. Feel like it'll be a bit of redemption for harder times.

thanks /u/smotpoker34 /u/stormshooter /u/tastyscrumptiousness and /u/my_vape_self for giving me advice in the previous thread. I really understand it now

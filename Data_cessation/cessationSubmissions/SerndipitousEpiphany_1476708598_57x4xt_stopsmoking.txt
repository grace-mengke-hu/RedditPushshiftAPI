One month of not smoking. Here's what I miss:

Nothing. I really don't miss anything about cigarettes. After smoking for the majority of two decades, and many, MANY attempts to quit that usually didn't last a day I finally made the decision one month ago today and stuck with it. So instead, here's a list of things I DON'T miss:

 

I don't miss smelling like stinky cigarettes.

I don't miss the yucky aftertaste of cigarettes.

I don't miss sneaking out at lunch time to rush a cigarette.

I don't miss the coughing (it's hardly there after just a month).

I don't miss clearing my throat all the time (looks like it was related).

I don't miss not being able to taste food (now that I know what I was missing out on).

I don't miss spending my hard earned money on something truly useless.

I don't miss constantly checking my pack to see if I have enough smokes left to last me until the morning.

I don't miss the shortness of breath after working out.

I don't miss staring at the jar of a hundred cigarettes butts wondering what my lungs must look like.

I don't miss wondering why I just couldn't break free from cigarettes even though I knew they were slowly killing me.

 

The bottom line is, I am so much happier knowing that I've broken the habit and that I have no desire to go back to smoking. Once my mind was made up and my thoughts about smoking were in the right place it wasn't even that difficult. I know that each and every one of you here can do the same and I wish you all the happy smoke free lives that you deserve!

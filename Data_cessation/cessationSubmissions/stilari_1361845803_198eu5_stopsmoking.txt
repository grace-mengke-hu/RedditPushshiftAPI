A Small Victory...

I'm not usually one to count days or anything like that, it's been roughly 10 or so since my last smoke.

After a hellish day: irritation at SO, at my dog, even my door nob!

Went to the corner store fully intent on using my 5 bucks for a new pack, asked for my usual brand, right before the cashier rings it up I say wait and opt for the crappy over-the-counter ecig.

I'm glad for this small victory.

It's the small victories that keep my life rolling I guess.  For the past few years, I wasn't the pack-a-day smoker, I had whittled it down to about 2 per day.  And now I'm just looking to whittle them away altogether.  Anyway, stay positive guys & gals.

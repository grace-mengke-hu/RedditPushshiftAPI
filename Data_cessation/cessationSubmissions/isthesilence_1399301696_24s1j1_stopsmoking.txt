SECOND MONTH TRAP

i am on my 45th day. i feel pretty much OK. my sleep became normal, tension decreased, i don't tremble anymore. but still i want to smoke. sometimes i find myself talking like "come on just one time not a big deal" kind of stuff.

i would like to hear advices from experienced redditers how to overcome these thoughts. thanks.

Anger

Hey /r/stopsmoking,

So I quit a month and a week ago and my anger and general character has become so terrible, I wouldn't want to associate with me.

The anger comes in short intense bursts. It doesn't feel as if it's the lack of cigarettes causing these mood swings, since I'm not "clucking" for one when I get so angry. It is however the only association I can make, since it only started after I'd quit smoking.

After week #1, I was cycling through town. Someone shouted something at me through their car window. I got off the bike and walked over and they rolled the window up. At that moment, it was like a switch. I was so angry, I smashed the door window and started punching the driver in the face.

I am now facing fines of around 5,000â‚¬ and potentially losing my driving licence.

The other day on the motorway during rush hour I was traveling at 130kmh on the motorway, as was everyone else. The roads get so full around that time, you cannot possible go any faster. The guy behind me started flashing his headlights at me. I stamped on my breaks and came to a complete stop on the motorway.

I came to my senses and didn't get out of the car, but that could have ended real bad for all parties involved.

It's clear to me that I need to get this under control. This is so out of character for me. I usually "wouldn't say boo to a goose".

Is anybody else experiencing these short episodes of anger and frustration to such a high degree?

Has anybody got any tips on getting this under control?

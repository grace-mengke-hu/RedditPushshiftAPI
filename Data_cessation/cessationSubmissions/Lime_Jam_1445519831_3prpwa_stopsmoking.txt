I've lapsed after months of being smoke-free.

Today is my birthday, I don't have any friends, so it's usually a depressing day. I just got a major craving and couldn't resist buying a pack of 10 as a treat. I'm worried I'm going to slip up and start smoking like I used to. I didn't get much of a buzz because I use vapes as well. I don't know whether to just discard or give away the rest of the cigarettes after my birthday.

Just popping in to let you know: YOU CAN DO IT.

You can quit. It's tough in the beginning, heck, it's hell. It lasts a few days, and it gets easier. The cravings fade. You start to revel in how good you feel. You take up running/walking/biking.

Holy cow, did you just go a mile? It felt good.

Man.. this feels really good! Food! You taste good again!

It get's better. You smell smoke for the first time after being clean for a few weeks. It makes you sick.

You're done.

You can do it.

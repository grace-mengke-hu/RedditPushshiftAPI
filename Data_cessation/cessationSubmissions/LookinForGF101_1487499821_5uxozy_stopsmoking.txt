Fool me three times, shame on both of us? :D

Hi. I'm in my early 20's. College student. Been smoking for 4Â½ years. Type is heavy smoker, usually slightly over a pack of 20 of a high nicotine % a day. Tried to quit 3 remarkable (I mean, I really tried) times in the past and here we are again.

Failed attempts:
1)Almost 7 days.
2)About 12 days.
3)Bit over 3 weeks.

Quitting time: Feb 13th 00:00. Quitting method: Cold turkey, replacement: Vaping.

That's all you need to know for now. Wish me luck ;)

When you quit, did you want to?

This probably is a really stupid question, but I am actually wondering:

Did y\`all really want to quit, when you did? I am asking because I quit yesterday, pretty much 24 hours ago after smoking for 8 years. It was a spontaneous decision, stemming from me planning to quit in November anyway (with the help of a seminar). But a close friend of mine quit a good week ago and told me that it is incredibly tough, but rewarding at the same time. So yesterday (while having a smoke) I decided to just quit now, which seems really stupid in hindsight, honestly.

Now my question comes from the thought that...I actually really like smoking. I always liked it. I mostly like the taste, the feeling and also as a fashion accessoire. I actually like how I look and feel with a cigarette in my hands. I think it fits me quite well. But obviously smoking is stupid as hell. I know about all the damaging effects physically, mentally and monetary. And still I never had any problems with any of these points (aside from the money from time to time, but always managed well enough).

So...these thoughts dont make any of this easier. But here comes the difficult part (for me). Is this only my addiction speaking? How can I be sure? I feel like I am trapped inside thoughts that I am not sure of if they are my own. But at the same time I know that I had the same view of smoking for the last 8 years.

Did any of you go through a similar thought process? What was it like? Do you genuinely stop to like smoking in all of its facettes after some time?

Thanks a lot in advance for your thoughts!

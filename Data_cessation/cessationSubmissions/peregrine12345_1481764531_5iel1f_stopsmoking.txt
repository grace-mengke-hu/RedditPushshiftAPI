One week in and Allen Carr makes so much sense!

I finished the book this morning. His message that we're treated for a drug addiction with the same drug (nicotine) is so obvious I really think it can be a blind spot for people trying to quit and an obvious reason for failure to quit for good. This last week I've been using an e-cigarette but after reading the book I threw it out this morning. Fast forward on a few hours and I have less cravings than when I was using the e-cigarette! It seems mad, I don't know how to make sense of it, but the book seems to have helped get rid of the cravings! I've been smoking for 21 years, more than a pack a day, and always felt I had no control over my habit. Has anyone else read his book and had a similar experience? Good luck to all here - it's a great and supportive forum! :-)

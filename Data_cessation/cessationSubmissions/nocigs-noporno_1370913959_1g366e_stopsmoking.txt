For all the new quitters or the people thinking about quitting.

Read allen carr's easy way to quit smoking.  It help me some much its nuts.  I smoked a pack a day or a half for 7 years.  After rereading his book, a second time i quite.  The first time it didn't work is because i didn't smoke to the end of the book.  I thought im done and quite in the middle of the book.  I didn't even make it a day.  then months passed and i stuck my head in the sand.  It than came back into my mind i should quite bc i had to go to the dentist.  So i reread it, got a fresh pack and chain smoked and read the whole book in two sittings.  than after i read the book.  i had my last cig and now im done.  that was last sunday.  kinda when on a rant there but read allen carr's book if it doesn't work read it again and pay attention.  Good luck and Don't think you can get away with the one cig

I’m so proud of making it to Day 9 however the struggle today is damn real.

All day I was telling my colleagues about how proud I am of myself and that I’ve actually not even really thought about smoking the last couple of days. I think I lulled myself into a false sense of security by reaching week 1 and then feeling that the cravings had massively subsided.

Today after work I met with a friend for a couple of drinks. I have been avoiding alcohol the whole time I’ve quit bar one beer generally because I know it will tempt me. All I could think about while we were chatting was having that ciggy. We decided to go home and shower and have dinner and then meet up later tonight to finish our catch up. I’ve got home and just had to let him know that we should catch up another time because I’m tired and I’m scared I will be tempted to smoke. 

Damn it’s really eating my brain and trying to take control. BUT I am fighting this. I will get through this day. Today’s mission on the Smoke Free app was to repeat the mantra “Not another smoke, no matter what” 10 times, at 10 different points of the day. 6 down. As silly as it sounds I will continue to do it another 4 times today. Anything to help.

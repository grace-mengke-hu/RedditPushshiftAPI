Please some words of encouragement

I’ve been smoke-free/nicotine-free for 18 days now. I have been and I’m still going strong. My cravings had significantly reduced. 

Yesterday I found out that my sweet feline companion has cancer. The vet says it’s not looking good and implied I should have him euthanized sooner rather than later. 

Reddit, he seemed completely fine a few days ago. This dropped like a bomb and I am having such a hard time coming to grips with the new reality of having to lose my best bud. 

Thank you for letting me share my pain. If you have some words that can help me deal and not succumb to the relief a cigarette seems to promise, please share.

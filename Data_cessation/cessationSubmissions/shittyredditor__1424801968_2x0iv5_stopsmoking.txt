Took all my rolling tobacco (about 2 lb), papers, lighters, destroyed them last night. Place in a big back and filled it up with water, chucked it.

So day haven't smoked since 9 pm last night.  Got nervous, but took a nicotine gum and calmed me down. 13 hours in. 11 hours left until I get to day 1.  If I can get 72 hours, it'll be out of my system and hopefully all psychological. Smoked on and off for 17 years

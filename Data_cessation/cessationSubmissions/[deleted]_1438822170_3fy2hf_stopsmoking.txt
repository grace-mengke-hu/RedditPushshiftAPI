Just tore up the rest of my cigs

I had to finally do something. I was getting sick of being a "smoker" I hated how I knew what I was doing was killing me but kept puffing down like 7-8 cancersticks everyday like I earned it. I'm only 20 years old, and honestly I have no excuse to be doing this antiquated drug that does relatively very little for me in the first place. It's a dirty, filthy habit that stinks up your breath, yellows your teeth, makes you smell like an ashtray even after bathing. What is a nicotine 'buzz' anyway? Like, it's kind of like having a slight headache? Does that really warrant smoking?



I'm gonna stick with the vape for a while to stop craving analogues. 

GOOD LUCK TO ME

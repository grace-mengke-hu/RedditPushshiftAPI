Dehydrated vs Craving

When I was a smoker, I barely drank any water and it rarely seemed to affect me, or so I thought. I'm on day 73 and noticed that when I start getting what I think is a craving it's just my body telling me that I'm an idiot who needs to drink more than a half a glass of water over the course of 5-6 hours. Once I pound a glass I feel infinitely better and the craving is gone. Anyone else confuse cravings with dehydration? Wonder if half the smokes I smoked were actually in response to my body being thirsty...

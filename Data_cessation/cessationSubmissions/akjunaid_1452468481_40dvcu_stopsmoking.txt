Relapsed on new years eve

I quit smoking on september the 13th 2015 and relapsed on new years eve after 109 days or so. Thats correct new years eve when most on the planet prepare to make positive changes I decided to quit quiting. And 11 days later with my thoughts filled with regret and guilt, it is now day 1 (approx 22 hours) since my last fag. I have buckled in and am willing to do it all over. As I have experienced too many positives to let the dark side win. Going cold turky like last time so wish me luck.

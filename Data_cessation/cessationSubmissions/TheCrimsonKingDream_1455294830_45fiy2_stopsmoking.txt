Advice on mary jane

So I quit smoking 10 days ago and did well.
But today I had a few puffs on a joint my mate rolled, it had tobacco in it. 
Is this, like, failure? I'm scared because I enjoyed that joint a little... too much. And I often smoke socially and everyone I know mixes. When passing a joint around, they want nothing to do with pure weed joints. And I really don't want to quit, not just for social reasons, but I enjoy weeds effects and always have (even before I got into smoking. In fact, smoking baccy with weed is what made me start smoking fags in the first place because I had baccy to mix, and when I couldn't smoke joints, I started rolling fags to smoke instead).
I havn't got baccy, like I said, it was my mates roll, annd his baccy. He's gone now and I have no more baccy. But he'll be back one day, and he'll bring baccy.
Any advice?

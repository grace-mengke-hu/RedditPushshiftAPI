Nicotine might save my quality of life and I don't know what to do now.

I've been faced with a very serious dilemma today. And after trying to see if someone has previously posted about this issue, I found one thread from 9 months ago which prompted me to do a bit of research.

You see, I've had a rough past with health issues, mostly in the last two years. With my GI tract causing severe pain and resulting in my 21 year old self having colonoscopy and endoscopy, spending 3 whole months, my entire summer, in bed with the worst intestinal pain of my life.

Things were up and down. I didn't smoke during all that time but once I had a method for keeping my health in check I got a new job and faced smokers without knowing how to combat it after spending the last 7 months in my house with no triggers or cravings because I was too ill to feel much beyond pain or the haze of prednisone in my system. So I went back to it.

I'm exactly a week quit now and I'm in pain again. Looking back on the start of my GI problems, I had also committed to quitting and had my last smoke exactly a week before I was in the ER with the first day of severe pain.

Turns out nicotine can often be a mask for diseases like Crohn's or UC once they're present or even alleviate or lessen symptoms of an already existing IBD. (even though smoking can increase the risk of getting these diseases in the first place). So this leads me to a challenging position--do I test out other nicotine products (NRT or vaping) with small mg in order to test if that will help my pain and other symptoms, with the risk of going from cold turkey to addict once more? Or tough it out (the pain isn't as severe as it was before) and hope that my quality of life doesn't tank out like it did two years ago.

Have been quit for 5 days now and it's getting rough

My quit date was one week ago after going back to smoking about 2 months ago. The first two days didn't go too well but I ended up quitting this past Wednesday. The problem is quitting has made me very depressed and since I have bipolar disorder it makes me feel even worse because I had been stable for so long. I'm using the patch but still get really bad cravings sometimes. I'm just looking for some support I suppose on ways to deal with it better and beat these cravings without becoming depressed.

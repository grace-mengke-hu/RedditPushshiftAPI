Made it 3 Weeks! This is the longest I've gone!!

Thanks largely to this subreddit, I have made it 22 days without smoking. This is definitely the longest I've ever gone in quitting. I even made it through an entire Pennywise/Bad Religion/Offspring concert this weekend without caving! Past attempts have failed by having at least 1 cigarette a week. The cravings are still happening, though it is getting less frequent. When they come on though, they come on pretty strong... I don't have much of a support network around me, so I'm really just throwing it out here for some reinforcement and positivity. Keep kicking ass, everyone!

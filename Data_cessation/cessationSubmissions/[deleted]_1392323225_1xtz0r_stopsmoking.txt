Backslid after a rough morning and very shitty Day 8 and 9 ... Ready to try again.

For about five and a half years I've been what I think is an over-zealous "casual" smoker, anywhere from 3-5 most days to more (up to ten?) on a bad day or nights out. I cut down to 1-2 for about a month. It's funny that I think I could go having one a day forever, but what's the point, might as well be done with hiding them. Last week I tried to quit. I made it 8 days and Day 8 (yesterday) was especially hard because of stress at work. I had my only restless night in the process.

So this morning find out that my grandmother is rapidly failing which brings up memories of when my mother went through the same thing (which is when I started smoking in the first place). I have a terrible, high pressure, highly unpredictable appearance to make at work in front of a powerful person regarding a bunch of people who don't like me or each other ... you can guess what I do ... and I backslid. Bummed a cigarette before and bought a pack afterwards, fully ready to smoke it over the next couple shitty days, or maybe just keep them  in case I needed one, or for guests. Probably to do something concrete about how I felt.

I was unhappy buying the pack and unhappy smoking. I can still taste it hours later and it tastes like carbon monoxide smells. I can't believe I'm standing under this awning in the freezing rain. For what?

A bum walks by, smoking, and I give him the pack. He didn't even want it at first, and finally took it. Fuck it. Ten bucks. I felt bad doing it but I didn't want them in my pocket anymore.

I'm not doing that again. I want to make it a game. How much better can I feel about this bullshit than I did at that moment?

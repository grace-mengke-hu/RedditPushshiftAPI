sometimes I feel like I don't want to quit because it makes me realize I'm not "young" anymore

I mean, I'm still young. I'm 25 but when I was 17 it was like fuck it doesn't matter I'll quit when I get older and I don't know. I just don't feel like I'm ready to let being young and those things I did while younger go.

Now I'm older. Soon I'll be 30 and then 40 and then 50 and then 60 and then dead. I really need to quit before time creeps up some more.

And who really wants to budget smoking related medical expenses into their retirement planning? NOT THIS GIRL

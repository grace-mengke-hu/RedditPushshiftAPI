Questions about quitting

I’ve been a smoker for over a decade now and have seen the detriment it has caused to my physical health, my mental well-being, and past relationships. I understand that I’ve let myself stay in one of the most unhealthy relationships I’ve maintained for a little under 1/3 of my life (tobacco) and even though I want to quit and know I can quit, I always seem to end up back at the starting line.

I’ve ‘quit’ before but then let myself fall back into smoking for reasons unbeknownst to me. Luckily, at this point in time I don’t live with someone smoking as incessantly as I have been but I know the slight temptation will be there when I see him stepping outside for a smoke.

Overall, I’m just looking for some tried and true methods for breaking the habits I’ve formed that would normally beckon a cigarette (hopping in my car, talking to friends and family on the phone, after a filling meal at a restaurant, etc).

What are some ways that you have distracted yourselves from wanting a cigarette after years of triggers that you had let yourself fall into? Thank you all in advanced for any info, methods, and support. I’ve lurked on this sub for a while and have been encouraged by the success stories I’ve read.

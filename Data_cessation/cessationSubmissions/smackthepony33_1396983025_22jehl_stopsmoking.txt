I'm a little over a month in. I miss them like I miss my ex's.

And believe me, my ex-girlfriends are trouble. Just like cigarettes. That's why they are ex's! 

Quit day was March 5th, and I just kind of kept it to myself until I could get through the worst of it all. I had to actually physically remove myself from situations where I would absolutely crave a cigarette. (Skipping band practice, not going out to the bar.)

Now I am 33 days in, and I have never been so high strung in my life. I am not sure if this is me getting extra energy back, or my mind and body throwing a shit fit because they don't have what they want. I couldn't even sleep last night but I have not broken. 

Smoked for 11 years, and damnit to hell if I'm not trying my hardest to kick the habit! I have many reasons to stop, but I mostly want this for my health. 

Anyways, I just wanted to say hello to all of you! I hope you all find the strength to keep going until you realize that you aren't quitting, but that you've quit. Good luck.

Quick side note. My brain just told me to punch something really hard and yell at everyone in sight. Is...is that normal? Am I having Nicotine Fits still?

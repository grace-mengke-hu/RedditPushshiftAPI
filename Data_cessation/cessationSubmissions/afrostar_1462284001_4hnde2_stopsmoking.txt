Quit Day 13

Smoker for 20 years, and I can't believe that it even lasted that long. How did I get this old?!? Anyway, I never smoked more than a half pack a day. When I quit, I was at 4 cigarettes a day. Even though I was a light smoker, I DO feel the benefits of not smoking. I wish that I would have done this 10 years ago, but better late than never. Like many other posters, I do still have cravings, but they are manageable. I'm looking forward to the day that I don't think about cigarettes too often.

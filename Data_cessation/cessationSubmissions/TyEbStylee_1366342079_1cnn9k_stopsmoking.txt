I got this (:

I know people here beat you to death about it.  But seriously... just read the fucking book.  It will get you into the right mindset.  After half a dozen or so failed attempts using my willpower,  I finally feel like I'm free as opposed to giving up something.  11 year smoker.  24 years old.  It's my time to quit.

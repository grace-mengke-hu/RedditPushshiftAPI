Day 3 - My toughest day

When things got tough during my first two days, I recited the reasons of why I'm giving up in the first place. There are a dozen reasons to quit and not one good reason to smoke.

Despite my list of reasons to quit, all logic seemed to go out the window once my cravings kicked in today. I even tried to lie to myself to justify having one. "Just have one to prove to yourself that you've quit". I'm glad I came to my senses, but I'm also worried at how close I came to caving in. 
Let's hope tomorrow is a better day.

Sliding into 30 freaking days...wow, what a ride

I'll hit 30 days in the evening tomorrow. 30 days!! I won't have time to post about it then, so I'm doing it early.

Quitting has been such a rollercoaster ride. I feel like I've learned a lot about myself, though, and I'm sure there will be more to come. Other than having yet another nasty chest cold (I swear, I've NOT been sick maybe 4 days out of the last 30), I feel pretty fucking good right now. And solid. No cigarette will ever be worth getting back on that rollercoaster. Ever. 

I'm grateful for every deep, sweet breath I take, free from nicotine for the first real time in 14 years. Wherever you are in your quit, take a minute to breathe in and congratulate yourself for getting this far. You have a lot to be proud of.

I'm going to honor one month of this journey by splurging on some wonderful-smelling essential oils, to celebrate the fact that I can smell and taste things again. Thanks again to this sub and all the support. <3

ETA: I quit cold turkey :)

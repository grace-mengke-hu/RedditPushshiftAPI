I started taking chantix again yesterday. I am currently smkong my last cigarette. here we go?

I've tried to quit numerous times before. quit for three months with an e-cog but ended up going back. I'm tired of smoking. most of the time it feels like a chore. I hate coughing up shit, i hate not being able to breath, and i hate smelling like smoke. my mom is a smoker and we still live together so I'm really hoping i have the will power to do this. my job is stressful and im hoping i can find ways to deal with it other than smoking. im scared but I'm SO over it, it's time for a change one that lasts this time.  my boyfriend is allergic to cigarette smoke and when i go over to his house i dont smoke for about 12 hours. the crazy thing is, with or without chantix im usually okay not smoking around him! it's once i leave that its hard again. anyone have any advice?

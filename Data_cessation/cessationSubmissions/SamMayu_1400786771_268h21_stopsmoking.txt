Experienced a WIN! But my true test is coming up...

First win was day 3, I was on addy studying, and didn't have a cigarette. Usually on adderall, I chain smoke like a mother fucker. 

Second win, day 4, I got drunk with a friend watching the kings game. I stood out with him for EVERY cig break he took (and usually I'm right there with him), but instead I grabbed my seeds and I was fine (not going to lie, I wanted a fucking cig so bad). 

NOW FOR THE TRUE TEST: I'm going to vegas this weekend. I'm going to be drunk, and around a ton of smokers. It's vegas. What happens in vegas stays in vegas. Blah blah blah.

If I can resist smoking this weekend, I'm pretty sure I've kicked the habit for good. FUCK YOU MARBORLO 27'S!

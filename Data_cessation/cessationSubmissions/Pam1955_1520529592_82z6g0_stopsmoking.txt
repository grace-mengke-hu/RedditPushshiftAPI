Okay - today is the day

I have quit today! Scared that I will disappoint myself again.  Have tried many times.  But for today I am not going to smoke- I am making a pledge to you today.  I need to stay strong, so I have decided to try this sub and see if it helps me get through the humps.  Thanks for being here! I will not smoke today!

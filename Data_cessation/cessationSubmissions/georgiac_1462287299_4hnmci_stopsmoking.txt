Hate nicotine gum. Is there any way to make it better?

My vape pen just broke and I can't get a new one right now, really don't want to go back to cigs though so I bought a pack of nicotine gum today to tide me over for the next few weeks. It's a lot worse than I expected (and expensive as fuck!). Is there anyway I can make it taste better? Or any alternatives to gum?

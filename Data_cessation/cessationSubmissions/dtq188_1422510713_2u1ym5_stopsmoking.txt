I messed up on quitting...

Long time lurker of reddit, just need some advice about quitting smoking.
Some backstory, I've tried quitting through patch, gum, etc. 
I decided to go cold turkey on Jan. 10th. I did so and made it through the first week with only some I'm going to murder the world feelings. Well I went to the bar with a friend about a week ago and smoked a couple of squares with him.

I've been smoking pretty much everyday since. The worst part of this is my girlfriend of three years if so proud of me that I quit and doesn't know that I relapsed. I feel like fucking shit for not telling her so I don't know what to do. 

When I quit cold turkey I was a miserable human being. My girlfriend will know I had to quit again and I can't keep disappointing her on smoking. Any advice on how to breach the topic with her that I relapsed.

Month and a half-ish

TL;DR: Cravings went away for a while but now they’re back. Is that normal?

I’m about a month and a half in. I started with a vape about five years ago, transitioned to 5-10 ciggies a day, then back to a vape with considerably higher nicotine content while smoking maybe a pack a month. 

It’s been about a month and a half, although to be honest I’ve had a few small relapses, trying to tell myself I could hit a vape once in a while without any trouble. 

It’s been a week since I last hit a vape, and I literally hit it only one time, but my cravings are getting pretty crazy. I’m not craving any form of nicotine specifically, I’m just craving that little “up” you get. I can kinda sorta get it from caffeine, but it isn’t the same. 

Have I been shooting myself in the foot with these mini relapses? Are they the reason I’m having cravings again, or is this normal? After two weeks the cravings left for a few weeks but now they seem to be coming back and I’m not sure what to do about it.

Chantix after quitting smoking

Has anyone used Chantix after they already quit to help with cravings and long term success? My boyfriend has quit and started multiple times some times for year or more but eventually goes back. So currently he’s been smoke free for 3 weeks. He’s still having cravings and his doctor prescribed Chantix saying that it will help even if he’s not actively smoking but I can’t find any information supporting that. Does anyone have any experience with this situation they would be willing to share? Does he need to start again to “properly” stop? That seems counterintuitive to me but I’ve never been a smoker.

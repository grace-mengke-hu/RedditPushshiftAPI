To Everyone Joining Us Today!

Welcome. You can do it. I promise. Today I'm at 100 days free from cigarettes. I was a smoker for 11 years, starting when I was 14. I didn't know how to be an adult without my crutch.  My best advice (other than reading and rereading Easy Way), is focus on how you frame quitting. The language you use makes a world of difference. Don't say, "I'm trying to quit." Say, "I'm not a smoker." Don't say, "I want to quit." say, "I quit." Even if it sounds silly, or like you are lying. Keep lying until its true. You're addiction wants you to feel silly and hopeless. Fuck that. You are strong. And do whatever you can to get off the stick, even if you have to put the next one off "for another hour" for two weeks. And once you're free, which will happen sooner than you think, don't have that cigarette that shows how strong you are. It is a trap. That's how I failed every other time. There ia no "just one cigarette". Remember and stay focused. This is the best gift you can give yourself.

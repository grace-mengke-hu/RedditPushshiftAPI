This is it!

I've been smoking for over 10 years now (and I am not even 30) and I am fed up with it! 
I've tried to "reduce" my cigarettes or just buy tobacco and roll cigarettes, I've justified my addiction with things like "Oh well I can afford cigarettes" or "Everyone dies, might as well enjoy cigarettes" - my friends stopped smoking; I continued, my family stopped smoking; I lit another one; my granny got lung cancer; I would still smoke like I'd be the new Malboro Cowgirl... but now I don't want to anymore.

I don't want to smoke anymore and I will stop it! 
I know it is hard and I know I'm going to need motivation so here I am ... gimme some loving?

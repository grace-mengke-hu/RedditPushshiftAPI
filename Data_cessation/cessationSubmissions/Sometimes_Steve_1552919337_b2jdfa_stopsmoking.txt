I barely even smoked and the compulsion is strong

I've never really smoked, maybe a few drunk cigs a decade ago. Now I'm 29 and having recent problems with weed/alcohol that I'm successfully kicking. I've smoked 2 packs of cigarettes in the past few weeks, kind of in lieu of my other vices. Well I haven't smoked for 4 days now but I want one. :( It's terrible. I can't believe how addictive they are.

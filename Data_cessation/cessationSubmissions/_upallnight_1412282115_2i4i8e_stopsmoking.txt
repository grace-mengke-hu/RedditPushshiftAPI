Started Day 1!

I recently posted here because I felt like I really didn't want to quit but knew that I had to. Well after reading all the material about what smoking does to your body I was still not really ready. However, on another subreddit I found this article

This guy was/is addicted to fast food. He talks about how is addiction owns who he is and how he lies to himself to feed his addiction. I realized that I was doing the same thing with tobacco. I let tobacco become such a big part of my life that when I said I don't really want to quit, It was my addiction talking. Sorry for the text but it was eye opening for me.

Only on day 6 and losing it

I just posted yesterday about being on day 5 of quitting my <5/day habit. It hasn't been easy the past 6 days (kind of a sad number, I know), but I felt optimistic and positive until today. My god am I losing my shit today. My patience is so fucking thin and I am on the verge of tears. If one more person asks me for something at work, I'm going to freak the fuck out.

I am scouring my brain for reasons why I cannot give in, but this is so horrible. Fortunately, I have my first appointment with a new therapist this afternoon, so I'm sure my insane withdrawal ramblings will take away from the real reason I'm actually going to therapy.

Sorry, now I feel awful and selfish for being such a complainer, but this sucks. Not as much as willingly choosing to significantly increase my risk for cancer, but it still sucks. Just needed somewhere to vent to.

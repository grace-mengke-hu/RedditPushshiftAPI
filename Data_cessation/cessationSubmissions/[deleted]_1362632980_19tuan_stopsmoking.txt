Unique circumstance, please advise.

Hey guys, ive been rolling hard since Jan 1st, not a cig since, cold turkey, and im quite proud of myself. Im facing a rather serious decision, and I want to ask your advice.

I am an actor (you may know where this is going), and I was recently cast in a film in which I am required to smoke on camera. After reading the script, the character I was cast as is a punker type, bad attitude, etc. Smoking totally fits his character, and the script shows that. This is my dilemma. Should I bail on the role, or accept it and hope I don't relapse? I feel after this long, I could probably handle a cigarette or two without making it a habit, but at the same time, I don't want to take any chances. Ive been on this streak for 2 whole months, and while I know I wouldn't truly be betraying myself, I don't want to ruin a good thing.

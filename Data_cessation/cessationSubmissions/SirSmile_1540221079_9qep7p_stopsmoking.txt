Non smoker bought 2 packs today.

I had like 6-7 cigarettes these past 5 years, only smoking when really drunk and someone offers them. But today I bought my first two packs, I don't know I'm just so anxious and depressed all the time, I thought why not I'm old enough to buy them so fuck it. Smoked two cigarettes, it did kinda relax me. But now I'm having second thoughts, on the way home I smelled the smoke all over my clothes. Got home, washed hands(twice!!) and still smelled it on the fingers that were holding the cigarettes. Brushed my teeth yet I'm still feeling like my mouth is an ash tray. I don't want that, what should I do with the 2 packs?

Hell yeah, number 2

I quit smoking on Thursday evening.

The free 14-day trial has expired :).

Tomorrow I am going out with my friends for the first time since quitting and I have been mentally preparing myself not to smoke. I am not going to drink because I am not sure that I would not cave.

I'm going to win this thing.

**Update: Have not smoked at all. There were not even any special urges to smoke. But I have to keep fighting the good fight.**

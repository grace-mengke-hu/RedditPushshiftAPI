staying strong when drinking

I know how important it is to avoid triggers, like drinking alcohol, but I was curious if anyone had tips for staying strong when drinking.  The times I've stopped in the past I was always very good about not drinking the first few months, but I have a birthday party for a good friend tomorrow and I feel like I cannot miss it.  It is, of course, at a bar. 

Any tips?  Nicorette maybe?

edit: thanks everyone!

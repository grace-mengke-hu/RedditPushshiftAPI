Effective way to cut down if you smoke a lot.

I know this is a quit smoking all together subreddit but I have share my success because it's relevant in the pursuit of quitting all together someday.

I was smoking a carton of cigarettes a week. 
I switched to rolling my own cigarettes and now I barely smoke a carton in a month.
My only rule was no pre rolling, just roll one at a time as needed. 
It's worked amazingly, and now quitting seems way more within reach than it did before.
For the people who feel hopeless, try this. It's a small change but has tremendous effects on cutting down. The pure inconvenience of having to roll one every time you get a craving literally slows that mental process down.

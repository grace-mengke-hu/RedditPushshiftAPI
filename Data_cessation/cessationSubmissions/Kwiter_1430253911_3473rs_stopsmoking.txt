I'm stopping after almost 30 yrs (with some help from Champix)

Canadian, white, male, used to smoke 10-15 cigs/day, turning 44 in early May, tried to quit a few times over the past couple of years without any real success.

Read about Champix, thought it'd be worth a try and it seems to really be helping.  Had to pay about $110 out-of-pocket since my extended health benefit plan wouldn't cover the cost but I figured that's less than I spend on smokes in a month (they're about $12/pack here in BC).  Haven't experienced any of the side-effects at all.

I would recommend Champix to anyone considering it; the most effective part of it is that it completely takes away the pleasure of smoking (by clogging up your nicotine receptors in your brain, or something like that).  So smoking is not enjoyable anymore.  Tastes bad, no rush or sense of relaxation or relief, all those "joys" of smoking just disappear and you're left with a burning stick of paper and tobacco in your fingers thinking "wtf? this is gross!".  There are still some occasional, intense cravings but I put these down to habit and routine, not nicotine dependence necessarily.  Breaking the habit of going for a smoke is the hardest part for me, like at work or after a meal at home.  To get over those moments, I usually just get busy cleaning, play some apps, play with my kids, whatever distracts me enough to get through the moment. 

I've been on Champix for almost 2 weeks now.  Today I've only had 2 partial smokes, and I'm looking forward to being a non-smoker when I wake up this Friday, May 1st, 2015.  Wish me strength!

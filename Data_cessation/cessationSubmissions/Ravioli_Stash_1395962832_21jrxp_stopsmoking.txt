Six days in after about 6 years of mild to heavy smoking, the beautiful things I've observed so far

So today was day 6 for me, and there are so many things I have noticed that have amazed and angered me. Angered because I didn't do this sooner. 

1. I went to lunch at Golden Corral with some coworkers. The food was AMAZING. Not because of quality or anything, but because it was the first semi nice meal I've had since I quit (I also decided to start a diet while I quit). 

2. Breathing is so much easier already. I can workout and not be panting after every set, I'm not out of breath by the time I walk to class, when I walk up to my room on the third floor I don't have to take a giant breathe and take a minute. 

3. I have less than half the laundry I normally do because I'm not constantly throwing coats and pants in the dirty bin trying to hide my smell.

I'm really mad I haven't done this sooner, but I'm glad I found this sub because seeing all you other people succeed just makes me want it more. Thank you /r/stopsmoking

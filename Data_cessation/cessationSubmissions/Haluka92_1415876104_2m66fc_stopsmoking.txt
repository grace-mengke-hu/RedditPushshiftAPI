What are the side-effects of quitting smoking?

Hi guys.

I'm on my 12th day today and have just started to go through the phase of repairing.. I think. I've recently been waking up with a dry throat and coughing up stuff. I did just yesterday lift like 15kg and have some pain behind my shoulder blade on my left side and my chest on my left side so it's sending me mixed signals and it's really quite weird.

How long will this be going on and is it going to get less painful or more painful as recovery goes on?

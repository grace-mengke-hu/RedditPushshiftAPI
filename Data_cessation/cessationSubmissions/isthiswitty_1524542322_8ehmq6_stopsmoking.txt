Last one was on my way home

Trying another quit starting about two hours ago on my way home from class. It was my last one in the pack so I can start fresh tomorrow, I have family coming to town this weekend and I don’t want to have to ashamedly stand outside during a visit or sneak one late at night and have to wash my hands and spray on perfume before I actually come back in, and I honestly just need to anyway - it’s terrible for you. 

Here’s to this one sticking.

3 days in. I'm a bitch but I'm doing it!

Started Saturday and not feeling great but know I will a year from now. Hubby and I are both quitting..... Poor kids. I stopped several times, at least when pregnant, easily. I am really struggling this time. Husband seems okay but I am edgy, bloated and have the attitude of a 17 year old whose parents took her keys away! I'm using the patch when I can't take it anymore and broke down and chewed gum today. I can do it though. Well wishes appreciated!

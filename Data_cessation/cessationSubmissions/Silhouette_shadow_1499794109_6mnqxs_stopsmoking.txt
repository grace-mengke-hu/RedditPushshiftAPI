I relapsed hard

I did quit for over two months, got use to being around other smokers. But one day I got a little to cocky and hit a vape pen. Next thing I knew I kept hitting the vape, then a real cig. I went down hill from there. I've bought three packs since. I gave away the first pack, smoked the second and now debating on throwing away the third pack. I feel so weak going back to hiding smoking.

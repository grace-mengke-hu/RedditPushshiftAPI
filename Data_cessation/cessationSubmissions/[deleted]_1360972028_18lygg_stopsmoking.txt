Is it worth it?

I am two days into quitting after almost ten years of smoking, I began when I was thirteen. I feel miserable and manic, as well as sick from eating so much. The amount I have spent on snacks and chewing gum is probably greater than what I would have spent on cigarettes, and I have been so distracted debating whether to quit quitting or not that I have not got any work done, which just makes me feel worse. I only seem to be friends with smokers, and as I have smoked for such a large part of my life it seems like being a smoker is part of my identity.
Any advice? Please?

It’s been six months today!

I found out I was pregnant six months ago and quit smoking right away. I’m ashamed to admit that I didn’t fully quit when I was pregnant with my son but did cut down to 1 a day for a few months before fully quitting. This is the longest I’ve gone without a cigarette in about 12 years and it feels good! Praying I don’t feel the urge to start again and that my husband can quit too for his health and for our kids!

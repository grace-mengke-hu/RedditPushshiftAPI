I've escaped the fear and the cage...

Don't even want a cigarette... yet. That Allen Carr is a genius. Would definitely recommend anyone thinking about quitting to read his book. I read it after I decided to quit and it as it's written by a confirmed ex-smoker, he knows the psychology behind the habit. The sub-reddit has also been a massive form of inspiration. Thank for all the stories.

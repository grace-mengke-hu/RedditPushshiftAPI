Getting drunk at the moment and a little worried

Just drinking with my boyfriend at his place, but he's a smoker and I'm not.  The weather is beautiful and what I want more than anything is to go outside and to smoke after a couple of beers - that would be so nice.

BUT IT WOULDN'T. And I'm trying very hard to stay inside and not think about but I'm having a hard time and he's not being very helpful. Any words of encouragement or support? I feel so enraged about all this shit lakjsdf.

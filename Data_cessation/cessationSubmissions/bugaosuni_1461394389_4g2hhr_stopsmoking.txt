I have a difficult situation today.

It's a bit stressful and I'm not sure what to do with myself.  But whatever I do, it won't involve squinching my face up and forcing myself to inhale toxic smoking fumes that do nothing but perpetuate an addiction that has only negative consequences.

I'm not going to force my heart to somehow deal with a whole bunch of smoke clogging up blood flow pathways.  I'm not going to subject my lungs to carcinogens that lead to breathing problems.  And I'm not going to subject myself or others to the stink that comes with nicotine.

Instead I'll probably have some juice, do some stretching and read a good book.  That sounds better to me.

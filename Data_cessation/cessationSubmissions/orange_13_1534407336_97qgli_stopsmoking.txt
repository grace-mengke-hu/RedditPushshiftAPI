How do you guys not smoke when you're stressed?

I've smoked for the last couple of years. Heavy smoking for the first year, light since then. I've been meaning to quit. I'm not addicted to it. I think I could give it up. But every time I stop smoking, eventually something really shitty happens and I get stressed and I feel like I'd much rather die smoking than live to go through that shit. And it's not limited to smoking, I begin to indulge in every vice I have. How the hell do you guys stay sane through it all without giving in?

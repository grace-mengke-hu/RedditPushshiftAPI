I have to quit today

So, I have asthma and I'm a smoker. Ive been smoking only since march of this year, but I'm fully addicted. I don't really want to stop, but my asthma just can't take it anymore. Every time I smoke I know my lungs are going to suffer. Last time I felt this way I kept smoking and I ended up with a really bad lung infection and it took me two weeks to get better. 

So I come to you, my Reddit friends...  help me want this! Knowing I need it is enough to start, but I'm going to have to want it to keep it up. I don't want to start again just as soon as I feel better.

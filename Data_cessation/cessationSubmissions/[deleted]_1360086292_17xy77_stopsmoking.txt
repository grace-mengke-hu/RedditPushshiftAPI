Increasingly Easier. 

I've incorporated a work out plan that stretches from morning to evening, began bringing literature for my work breaks, and have stuck solely to drinking water. The need to smoke has all but diminished in this time. The habitual feeling to keep busy is still there, but I feel... I just feel a lot better. More energy, happier, etc. But my journey has just began. I'm in this for the long haul brothers and sisters. I support you as you support me, so what are some things you do in order to keep busy, in order to avoid the habitual sense of smoking?

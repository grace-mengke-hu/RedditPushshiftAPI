Been two days (2d week of champix)

I've been here before but it was a failed attempt. I'm listing my attempts here;

1st Attempt : Champix - stopped using in the middle of it beacuse of my stomach ache. 2 weeks

2nd Attempt : Allan Carr's book. Cold turkey'ed. But when my anxiety was on the peak at the thirth week, I had a horrible break up, the most terrible day at the work (had a verbal fight with another worker and not because of nicotine withdrawal anxiety, mobbing) Later that day, I noticed that I've already bought a pack and smoked 2-3 cigarettes instinctively. With all that misery on my, I kept smoking.

3th Attempt (Now) : it's been two days and completing the 2nd week of Champix. I'm taking stomach protectors before taking champix now. And avoiding the placed that makes me crave cigarettes at all cost. Going to read the Carr's book again.

Today I do get lots of craves but I'm shocked that I can suppress them quickly. On my previous attempts they've resisted for more then 10 minutes. Now it just takes seconds to suppress.

But for two days, after the meal I feel lightheaded.

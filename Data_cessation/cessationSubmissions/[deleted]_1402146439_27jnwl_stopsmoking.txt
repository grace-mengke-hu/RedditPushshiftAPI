Coming into day 2. Tonight will be the toughest challenge

So it's Saturday and my friends and I usually go out on the town in the evening. Of course it's filled with drinking and singing and dancing, but a lot of my friends smoke and drinking and smoking go together like coffee and cigarrettes. I know the common practice when trying not to do something is to keep distance from it. I know that if I were a heroin addict I would need to stay away from other heroin users. That's the problem with smoking. It's EVERYWHERE. In our movies, in public, you name it. Even when I see an anti-smoking ad, all I want then is a cigarette. At some point I'm going to have to face the world and no matter if I hunker down and remian inside all day for the next few weeks, I will have to face the music or quit drinking, but that's not happening. So tonight will be the hardest test. The temptation will literally be right in my face the whole night, but I will not falter this time. I will control myself and I will wake up tomorrow to see a tabacco free day three

3 weeks and wobbling

Today I made it to day 21, 3 weeks! 
My longest quit which is amazing, but I’m feeling a bit wobbly and weak willed! 

Sounds strange, but I don’t want to smoke, and yet I feel like it’s going to solve my problems. I know it won’t, so I’m posting here. 

Damn smokes, you think you’re free and suddenly you see someone smoking happily and you think it will solve all your problems. 

Any advice on overcoming this lull would be welcomed!

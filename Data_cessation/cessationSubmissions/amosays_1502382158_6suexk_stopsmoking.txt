"A year from now you'll wish you had started today"

I am day one into my 6th?7th?8th? attempt to quit. This quote has been on my mind for a couple months now. All I can think about is that if I had stuck with it last time, I would now be at 4 months...or the time before that I would be at a year and a half... The time is now.

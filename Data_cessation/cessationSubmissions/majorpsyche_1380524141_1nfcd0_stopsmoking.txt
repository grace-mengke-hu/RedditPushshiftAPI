This shit sucks guys...

Why did I start smoking cigarettes in the first place? What part of my brain looked at the little white sticks that give you cancer and thought "I should smoke that"? When did I switch from only smoking when I'm drinking, or only when I'm stressed, to lighting one up every time I walk to and from class? How did I justify the obvious and frequent negative side-effects from tobacco use? Where did all that time and money that could have been used for much bigger and better things go? Who is to blame for my nicotine addiction?

I am.

I started smoking to fit in, and because my (smoker) friends told me it would help make me relax. I thought "They can't be that bad, besides, its just one cigarette I'll never become addicted". After my parents split up my freshman year of college, I started drinking more often and I was constantly stressed out to the point of insanity. I was a fool for thinking that cigarettes were an answer to my anxiety, and now I realize that they never helped at all and only made things worse. All that time that I spent smoking just might contribute to an earlier death, and all that money I spent on Marlboros and Pall Malls might as well have been lit on fire with the stogies.

I joined this subreddit and started my quit 9 days ago. I am very sad to admit it, but I have smoked since then, a total of 4 cigarettes whilst drunk. Now compared to the 10+ cigarettes I used to smoke daily one might see this as an step in the right direction, but I only see myself leaning on a crutch. I want to quit. I want to be free from this terrible habit that I can't seem to shake. I want to be a **former** smoker, and I want it now.

Thanks for listening

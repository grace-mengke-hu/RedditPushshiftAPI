Quit two weeks ago. How to help with weight gain?

Quick history: Nearly a 20-year-smoker (35-year-old male), and had my last cigarette at 5:00pm on July 31 (ran out of cigarettes, simply decided not to buy more). I have been vaping to help with the nicotine cravings.

Two years ago, I tipped the scales at 230 lbs. I am hovering around 210 now, and despite jogging for 30 minutes every other day and making a serious attempt to eat healthy, I can't seem to go below 210.

I weighed myself just now and am 211. I am nervous that quitting is going to cause me to gain weight again. I do cheat sometimes (had a bacon cheeseburger for lunch with a friend today), but mostly stay on a decent diet.

What are some tips to make sure I don't balloon up again? I absolutely do not want to get up to 230 again. I was miserable. I'm still not thrilled with 211, but it's better than 230. If it helps, I'm 5'10".

Thanks for reading.

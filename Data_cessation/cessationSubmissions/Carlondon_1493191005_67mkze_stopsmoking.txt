Nearly let myself down

After countless failed attempts prior to quitting again I am giving it another go. Yesterday was tough. I felt the 'smoking devil' goading me to make a purchase of some tobacco and it almost got me. I tried my two local shops for my usual favourite rolling tobacco but both didn't stock it! I decided to get home to my children. I was in a foul mood which I blamed on hunger but I'm truth it was the devil who was pissed off and I was merely his speaker. 

Today I realise, each day must be taken as a new day, and a day without smoking is the only was it can be. This morning I feel great. I beat the devil yesterday after a tussle before arriving home and surprisingly I slept very well. 

I have the 'QuickMist' in my bag and I'll use it when the time comes. It tastes horrendous but so does smoking right!? Here's to a new challenge â€“ today. Bring it on.

1st day. Cold turkey. 

Quit for 7 months two years ago. been smoking a year now but around 10 years all together. Last night I got really drunk and smoke a pack in like 5 hours. today I feel like shit and my chest hurts.. duh. Any way, ta hell with this. I'm done and I know in about a day I will want one really bad but its time so wish me luck too.

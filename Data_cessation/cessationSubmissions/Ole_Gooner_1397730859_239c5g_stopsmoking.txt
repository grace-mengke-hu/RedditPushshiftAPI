38 days. Can I only carry on if I don't drink?. Also does smoking pot count? Need answers to these questions.

I used to smoke about 10 cigarettes a day for the past 3 years. I quit cold turkey sometime in mid March.

The changes that people have mentioned here, do happen. I don't smell like crap, my sense of taste and smell has remarkably changed. Though, I haven't felt a remarkable change in my stamina. I'm a professional footballer and train almost every day(My coach knows about my habit). But that little increase is still helpful nonetheless. Most of all, I don't have that urge to leave my room, light one and feel the world get clearer.

Here's the reason I quit. I was a tobacco addict. I needed my fix every couple of hours. Without it, I genuinely couldn't think straight. I wonder if anyone else went through this whilst they were smoking? I was basically paying major corporations to control and slowly kill me.

I have a couple of questions. About a week back, I was out with my friends and had downed about 4 or 5 pints. That's when this tremendous urge to smoke kicked in. The only thing I could do to not get myself to smoke was leave immediately. I knew that if I lingered any longer or consumed any more alcohol I'd have smoked through a pack that night.
Question 1. Do you have to quit drinking too, in order to stop?

Also I've noticed that my pot consumption has increased. Previously, it was a joint on the weekends. But these days, it's almost every second or third day. The joints have minimal amounts or next to  zero tobacco. Am I substituting weed for the tobacco I'm not smoking?
Also does the 38 days count if I've smoked weed?

P.S Thanks guys. I come to this subreddit everyday. You guys have been phenomenal. It's probably the only reason I quit.

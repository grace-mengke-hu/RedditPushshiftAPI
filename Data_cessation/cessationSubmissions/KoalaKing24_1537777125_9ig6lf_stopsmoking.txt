I want to quit smoking but i also dont want to

I started smoking only about 8 months ago, I started smoking after going through a break up with a great girl.  Life happened and one thing lead to another and she had to move away for school for reasons beyond her control.  I thought it would be best to cut things off so that we could focus on ourselves and move on.  That was the beginning of my current self destructive tendencies. 

It started with smoking nearly a pack a day for a few months until i stopped smoking for a few weeks.  I hit a rather rough patch on my birthday and smoked an entire pack within an hour, ever since then Ive been smoking almost half a pack a day.  

Whenever I couldn't smoke id get high or drink till i fell asleep.  As of late I havent been able to go to sleep without some kind of stimulant in my system, Ive been beginning to think that life is so much better when your mind is in an altered state.  Recently ive been tempted to try some harder drugs but i know that its a dangerous gamble and knowing myself and how little willpower i have it will very quickly become a slippery slope.  

I know i need to quit smoking and stop being self destructive as a whole but i cant beat my reasoning that life is just better when you have something in your system.  Life can suck and is unpredictable but chemical compounds will always be there.  I want to quit but then again why should I?

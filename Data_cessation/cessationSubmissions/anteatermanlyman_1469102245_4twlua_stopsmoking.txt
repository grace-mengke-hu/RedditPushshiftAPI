3 weeks, hard to believe

It's hard to believe that one comment hit me, and it was just that, basically, it's all in the mind. I wasn't planning to quit the day before just yet, and I just set my e cigarette down then just denied the urge from there on. The next day, I did pick it up and take a few puffs (which was almost exactly 24 hours), but I said that wasn't too hard and just threw away the batteries then and there. I'm amazed I'm here lol.

Last week I posted something about depression, but felt a ton better after waking up monday. Was very productive that day, and tuesday, and yesterday, having some of the best days since a while back this week. Some of that I credit to deciding to cut out some things, but prolly had more to do with the drug being out of my system.

But yeah, I'm still watching for urges. I remember making it a month and a half, but the urges were there quite often for some reason. Boyfriend is trying to quit right now too, he made it a 24 hours a couple days ago. I am trying my best to encourage him, but I feel like he's gonna take some time. He only really smokes three or four a day and has been doing that for a while, though.

50 days.

Two and a half weeks and I can drop the patch as well. This is going very, VERY well. So proud of myself. I have confronted all triggers (Playing pool, drinking, playing pool while drinking, casino, hanging out with smoking friends, dealing with the in-laws at Thanksgiving) and I passed them all!

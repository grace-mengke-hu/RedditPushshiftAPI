Irl cake day, 1 month in to the quit, some observations, some thoughts

Today is my 20th bday, and i woke up feeling horrible. I had dreams about talking to an ex girlfriend(from like 3 years ago nonetheless) all night last night, and when i rose in the morning the depression was thick, and i wanted that tobacco inside of me like craaaaazzyy. It felt like my brain was getting sucked out of my head from the cig withdrawal feeling despite how long its been... idk if this is normal or not, maybe its because im around smokers often or something... I just want to feel normal again, and i havent since i stopped smoking, and I dont know why. Its so sad that addiction can make a person feel this way, it makes me wanna die i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy. Hopefully soon life will feel like something again, and my anxiety will decrease(i have bad anxiety anyways but hopefully it returns to reasonable amounts). However espite how shitty i feel, i still feel better than when i had cigarettes(or at least better than how i was an hour after a cig) i actually want to do something with my life now, and i feel as though i have squandered my precious time smoking. However, i still feel like spongebob at sandys with his pinky up as he dries into oblivion, but dammit its so nice in here i think ill stay anyways. Pinkys up gents, you can do this. I believe in you :D Feel free to share your thoughts and opinions, lets keep things nice and open circle-y :)

Ps; Sorry for rambling i had a few beers and felt like sharing, Thank you all for listening you guys, keep that quit up, i love you all!

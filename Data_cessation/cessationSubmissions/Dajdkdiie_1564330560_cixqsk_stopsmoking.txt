Almost 7 months in and I caved

I blame myself, but I refuse to feel bad over one bad decision. 

I quit on New years. The first 3 weeks were the hardest goddamn thing I ever experienced, but well worth it. 

I caved yesterday at the club. I met a pretty girl with a devious look in her eye and on a whim I said "hey let me hit that". I smoked 2 cigarettes yesterday. 

Anyway it was a good run, but I guess I'm gonna restart my clock again ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜­

I'm going to quit for the last freaking time in six hours.

Yeah, I'm sick and tired of smoking and I hate myself so much for not being able to quit. I can last a day or so, but then I'm at it again.

I have tomorrow and the day after that off so I can go bonkers in peace. I have my Allen Carr in hand and I'm freaking done.

Day 2 on patch. Hard. HARD! HARD!!!!

This is my... fuck, don't know - 100's time quitting? Longest I've gone smoke-free was 6 months and when I went back to smoking, I stopped trusting myself when I quit subsequently. 

Wednesday is going to be brutal - going to the funeral of my best friend's sister (she was only 27) and I know the "after funeral" will be vodka-fueled hysteria with tons of smokers. 

Sentient alien beings help me....

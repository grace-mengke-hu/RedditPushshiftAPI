Day 51

I have put on so much weight. I have put on 20 pound in 50 days and i'm being serious. I knew I would put on a lot because those first two weeks my headaches were horrible but I eat so much nonsense such as 4 brownies a day (I knew it was bad but better than smoking and I haven't been doing that since day 10). Last week I went for a hike from bottom to top of a mountain on a hot day, Played soccer twice and ran around a lot and I played touch rugby ANNNND went on the running machine for 30 minutes one day at the gym. I weighted myself Sunday night and after all that I put on 2 pounds. Is this normal or is this to much? Anyone else put on a ton of weight? I'm 242 pounds I have always been a healthy 200-220 because I played rugby and squash and lifted weights and ran so a bulky 210 on average but now i'm a fat 242 but ironically probably fitter judging by how i hiked a mountain without stopping

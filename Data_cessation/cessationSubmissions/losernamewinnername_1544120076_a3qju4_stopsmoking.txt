BLOOD FLOW PLS HELP DAY 8

Are my sinuses just fucked up from bad genetics n other shit or quitting seriously reduces blood flow to the brain at first because I'm waking up feeling like death though I feel my body is clearing... 

I'm scared a little about how much this will go on.

I mean it's nothing too bad, sorta gets easier, but feels like my blood barely flows to my brain...

10 Days again.

I quit for 1 year and then, 4 years ago, I hit the "just one trap".

I handle somehow to keep "safe areas" like my house or when I was with not smokers, for around 2 years but in the last 2 years these areas become more and more small, so now I didn't feel like a free man any more. 

It's 9 days and counting and feeling OK, the cravings are there but I'll never fall again for the just one trap.

Looking for a bit of help quitting smoking?

Hi, 
I have tried to quite mutiple times making a variety of lengths 2 days, 1 week, and even one month, but I always relapsed. This time I used an audiobook about quitting smoking called Allen Carrs, Esay Way to Quit Smoking. It sounds like an Ad, and I'm sorry for that, but it helped me think of cigarettes in a different way which I desperately needed. Please consider using a quitting book or group of you want a boost in your journey!

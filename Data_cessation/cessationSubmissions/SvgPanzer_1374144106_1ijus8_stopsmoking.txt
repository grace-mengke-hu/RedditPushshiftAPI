Enjoying a few with my coffee.

Got a few left in the pack and I'm smoking a few before a 12 hour shift. But I've grown tired of hiding it from my girlfriend and friends. I treat my job like a getaway where I'm safe to smoke as much as I want to. This has caused me to hate being at home and around my girlfriend. The habit is going to stop.

I've got a few boxes of patches hidden away and today it stops. One long shift stands between me and a three day beach trip with loved ones that have done nothing but supported me in quitting and I've done nothing to them but hide and lie.

Here's to being able to bike ride to work again and extra money for college and not sounding like a dying animal during sex. You guys are really a great safe haven for a rant.

Also, any good android apps I can use today? What gives you guys a good boost of confidence?

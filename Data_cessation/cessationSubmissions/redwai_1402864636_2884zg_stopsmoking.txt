Day 5 or 6 (badge is slightly off) The most depressed I've felt since last time I tried quitting.

So the days are blurring together now about when I stopped but I've been smoke free since my last post and extremely miserable. On top of getting over a sinus infection I caught the usual "Quitter's Flu" that I always get when I try to stop. I feel depressed as shit and starting to ponder all my failed life choices. I'm being dramatic but some days it is really hard. Been sticking by my choice to stop smoking though so there's THAT to be happy about. All the things I keep thinking about are driving me nuts and make me feel so bad about myself and where my life is going and why I haven't progressed in my life as a 26 year old. 

Right now on my day off I just want to play mindless games like Candycrush or Peggle and not feel guilty about being a lazy POS during this withdrawal time. Once my sinuses clear I'd like to take a nice walk.

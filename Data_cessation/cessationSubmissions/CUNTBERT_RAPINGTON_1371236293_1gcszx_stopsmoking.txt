Month 6, how do I get past the irritability?

For the first time, I kept my News Years Resolution this year.  The first few weeks I was in an intensely shitty mood, but that has subsided.

What I'm dealing with now is longer term, low level irritability with occasional small bouts of rage, lashing out at family, friends, coworkers, etc (not insulting or anything, just angry, and I usually apologize for it and explain to them the situation, which they understand).

How do I beat this?  I run 4-5 miles a day, no luck with that.  The only things that seem to hide it are shutting myself in to make music or play a video game, but I'd rather do something more productive.

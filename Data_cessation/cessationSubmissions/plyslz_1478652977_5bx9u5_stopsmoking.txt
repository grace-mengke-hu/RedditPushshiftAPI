Day 2 - no smoking - no drinking... why do I feel so completely despondent?

This has got to be what depression feels like... I felt pretty damn good two days ago.

Funny thing - I keep telling myself that I'm now a "non-smoker" and just one cigarette never killed anyone... shit.  I've become stupid... and psychotic.

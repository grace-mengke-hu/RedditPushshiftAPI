I quit smoking about 3 months ago and have gained 10 pounds.

Gaining weight was my main hesistation from quitting, and sure as shit, I'm gaining weight. Instead of smoking, I'm eating. If I'm not doing either, I'm biting my nails, picking my face, or pulling my hair. It's something about the hand-to-mouth action that seems soothing.

How do you guys cope? What healthy things have you replaced smoking with?

Edit: I also think it's relevant to point out that I work and go to school full time, and my commute is 45 minutes one-way. So... not a whole lot of time for working out. And eating/smoking/biting is mostly done in the car.

Dream about going down the rabbit hole

Well it's been about 3months. I had a dream last night I smoked a cigarette and justified it as 'it's only one, no harm' 

Then the next 6months flashed before my eyes, full blown smoker again. 

Let's not kid ourselves. One will never be just one, it will be the plunge back down the rabbit hole. 

Good luck to all and stay strong!

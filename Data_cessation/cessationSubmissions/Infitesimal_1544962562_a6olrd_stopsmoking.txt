Living with smokers and quiting

Hi everyone! I've been trying to quit and having some issues. I managed to stay quit for 2 weeks, then relapsed for 1 week sadly, and now quiting again. My main problem is my husband is still smoking and doesn't plan on quitting. My relapse started because I took one of his cigarettes saying 'just one' and went downhill from there. I now know smoking anything at all will get me smoking everyday. 
Was anyone able to quit with another smoker in the house?  It's so hard for me to get through cravings when his cigarettes are available, and he still smokes in the house as well. Any tips?

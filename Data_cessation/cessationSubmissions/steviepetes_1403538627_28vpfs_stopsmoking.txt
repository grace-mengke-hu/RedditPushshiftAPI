Anxiety - Fail!

I posted a couple weeks ago about how my anxiety had completely diminished since quitting smoking. This has now drastically changed!

My life isn't extraordinarily stressful right now - things are going well, there's not much to get stressed about. Yesterday after going for a 10k run, I started feeling funny and almost drunk about 2 hours later. Realizing I may have triggered an allergic reaction I have to shellfish by running (I ate snails the night before!), I went into a full blown panic attack. Since I wasn't sure if it was panic or allergy, I took my epi and went to the hospital. Has anyone else been experiencing panic attacks since quitting?

I'm not planning to smoke at all but it scares me to think this may be my life now without cigarettes - I hope it wasn't masking an anxiety disorder.

I usually drink one venti soy latte and one cup of drip coffee a day. I'm now wondering if I need to cut this out now that I don't smoke? 

Has anyone else experienced a huge increase in anxiety two months after their quit? Is it related? Help!

I'm tapping out of this subreddit, but before I go

It's been 3 1/2 years since I quit smoking, in large part because of the resources and support in this subreddit. Little did I know that only 7 months after I officially quit smoking that I'd get diagnosed with breast cancer. Now I'm both cigarette-free and cancer-free. 

If you are reading this and thinking of quitting, I want to encourage you. Going on 4 years, I cannot imagine there was a time when I actually smoked. Every now and again the desire creeps up, but then I think of the smell, the money wasted, how bad I felt, the addiction itself———you can survive stopping and life will be better on the other side. I'm living proof. 

I used a combination of Chantix, The Easy Way to Stop Smoking (A MUST READ), and plain ol' fashioned willpower. It sucked for a while, but it is far, far in the rearview mirror now.

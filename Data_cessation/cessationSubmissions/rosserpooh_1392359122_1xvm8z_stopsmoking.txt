Day one- Completed!

Yippie-ki-yay, i've made it a day!
After a week full of "i'll start tomorrow" the true tomorrow finally came. I've been planning on quitting seriously for about a month or two. Told myself that whenever it was that i started there was no way it would extend past Valentines. (being the full fledged procrastinator that i am, i of course waited till the day before...)
I used nicotine gum to get through today, with little to no trouble at all. I don't want to just transfer my nicotine addiction to something else though, so i plan to eliminate the gum as well within the next couple of days.
I can't wait for the health benefits to start reveling themselves, but the sheer feeling of accomplishment gained just through taking action is quite wonderful itself :)

I relapsed after 3 months and had nicotine gums. When will this craving feeling go away?

I was a heavy smoke, around a pack a day. I had anxiety because of which quitting had been extremely hard. Even when I'd go to a no smoking zone, like a movie, I'd carry nicotine gums and use them. Finally, after 8 years long struggle, i quit and it had been 3 months. Since then, I've been home with my mom, who doesn't even know I smoke. I can't smoke here and I thought it won't be a problem. But then a past tauma resurfaced. I saw the man who had molested me as a kid. It brought back the bad memories, the anxiety (which hadn't really gone tbh) and the craving for cigarettes was back. I tried to resist but lost and gave in to nicotine gums. I'm not going to smoke now, but I again chewing those damn gums because I'm too weak. Will this craving ever go away? Just feeling really shitty about it and wanted to share with you all as I am going crazy and frustrated dealing with this alone here.

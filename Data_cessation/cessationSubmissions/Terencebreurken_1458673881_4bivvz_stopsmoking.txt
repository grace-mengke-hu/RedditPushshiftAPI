Gonna stop smoking, needs some advice, what-to-do's and don'ts etc

Tomorrow will be the day i'm finally gonna start stopping my habit.
i smoke around 30 cigarettes a day and i want to stop because 2 years ago i tackled my overweight and i feel i'm on a dead end because of my smoking.

I just want some general advice on what is the best motivation to keep continuing?
First i'm gonna keep putting the money i spend on the packs to an extra account so i will see the difference in about a year for a new holiday.
People tell me there is a cool app to download to keep track of what you actually achieve day by day, anyone knows what app they mean?
Is there a good book to read about kicking a habit or a stop smoking book?

I just want some advice! :D actually looking forward to it.

Hope ill make it through!

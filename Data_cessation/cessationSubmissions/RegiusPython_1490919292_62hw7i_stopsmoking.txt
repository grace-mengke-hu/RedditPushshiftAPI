Withdrawal migraines, help?

Anyone have any good remedies or preventions for migraines due to nicotine withdrawal?
I've stopped smoking probably only since Sunday, and I'm getting really really bad migraines that (when I've tried quitting in the past) I've only gotten from nicotine withdrawals.
I've tried ibuprofen, aspirin, caffeine, excedrin, warm/cool showers and I'm running thin on ideas and it's slowly becoming unbearable. 
Yeah yeah I know it'll go away with time but some immediate comfort would be nice.

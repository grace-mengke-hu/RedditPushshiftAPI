I'm sorry for wasting your time.

Today I was with a friend who was my smoking buddy for a long time. He seemed to have quit earlier, but he's smoking more frequently again. He offered me one and without hesitation I turned it down. I didn't have to convince myself of it, I honestly did not want it.

During the night, he had about four cigarettes around me while we just hung out and talked. I thought to myself, "Ugh, hurry up and finish that so we can carry on with our lives." Then it all came rushing back. The countless times I've had a smoke with a nonsmoker friend while they waited for me to finish so we could go back to whatever we were doing.

I'm so sorry to everyone i put through that and thank you for your patience. I don't know that I'll always have it.

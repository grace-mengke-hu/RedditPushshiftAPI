Emotional turmoil... day 35.

Today is day 35 without a cigarette. Yesterday I lashed out at people at work. People I consider friends. I lost a lot of trust. I still don't think I was wrong in confronting the problem that cause me to get angry. But, I'm sure quitting smoke had something to do with it.

I'm a basket case emotionally right now. I want to smoke but I'm not. I keep reminding myself how bad it was when I was smoking.

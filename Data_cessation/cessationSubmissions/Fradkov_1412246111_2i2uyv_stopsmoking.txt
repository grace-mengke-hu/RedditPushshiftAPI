It's been close to a year

I've smoked twice since the 18th of October last year. Once on new years and once again in may. Both times on huge parties. 

Now I'm at a period in school where I have 3 tests and 3 essays to turn in within a week and I'm stressed out. I haven't wanted to have a smoke this badly even the week after I quit. 

I keep thinking to myself over and over again "just one, it won't hurt you. Just one, ask that person over there.". I want it so badly that I feel dizzy. This has been going on for 2 weeks and it's driving me crazy. I've started eating breath mints like candy again but I can't supress this urge. I want to smoke but I don't want to.

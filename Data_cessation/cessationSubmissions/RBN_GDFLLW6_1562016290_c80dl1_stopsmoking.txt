Three days in, lots of creeping anxiety

So I’m three days into my first big quit attempt (smoked for like eight years on and off, I turn 27 in September) and I’m aware that your body tends to start to expel all the crap inside it - I’m coughing more and quite often there’s a small amount of pink-ish blood. I’m wondering, was this a common experience for a lot of you quitters? I think I just need some reassurance that things will start to get better and that it’s not too late. 

I also need to stop consulting doctor google

300 Days apparently. Almost to a year. Thanks.

Thank you to the badge for reminding me how far I've come.
I spent two years psyching myself up to quit by lurking around here. Then got the last push from Welbutrin. 
Looking back, it's easy to see how much this has helped my satisfaction with life. 
Good luck to everyone!

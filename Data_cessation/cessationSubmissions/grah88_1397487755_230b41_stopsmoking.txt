Almost at year ONE

As I draw closer to my year. I have to say I lost track of the time. Not smoking wasn't near as hard as everyone makes it out to be just takes motivation. I have gained more friends which has improved my attitude towards people ten fold. I'm actually in a relationship I think that is because I can have a conversation and not take a "smoke break". My blood pressure is down. I have lost weight going to the gym was my stress relief. For all the redditors just starting your journey don't give up it is well worth it.

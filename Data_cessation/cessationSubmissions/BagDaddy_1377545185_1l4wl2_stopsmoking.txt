I keep screwing up

43yo M, married father of 2. I did ok at the start of the year, started to run regularly 7-8 miles, my climbing went thru the roof. I started to taste, wake up with fresh breath, loved it.....and then I got drunk, had a smoke, got drunk again, had a smoke, again drunk, bought rolling tobacco, more drinking, no running, now buying cigs on a regular, haven't ran in a month, have not had 2 sober days back to back since February.

TODAY it counts. TODAY I'm hung over. TODAY I go out for a walk, then tomorrow for a run, then at the end of the week for a climb and a swim. Please stay away from the booze.

Quit ecigs today. Felt nothing but a calm mind. Is this normal?

I started with 12 mg blus late last year. I had smoked on-and-off, but it was definitely not an addiction. After a few months I was hooked. It helped lower my stress, which I normally did by running, but I could no longer run due to an injury. My current nic level is 6 mg. I'm a heavy vaper. 

I've been hating nicotine ever since. I hate the dependence on it, and now I feel that it makes me even more stressed. 

So today, I said fuck it, let's quit. I thought the cravings would be terrible, but they don't last that long and for the first time in half a year I think life without nicotine is a possibility. It's been almost 20 hours and no desperation has kicked in. This is awesome.

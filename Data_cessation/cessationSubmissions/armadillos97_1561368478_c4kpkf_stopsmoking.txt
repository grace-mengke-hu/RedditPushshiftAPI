A few notes.

I have a few things to share and I'm looking into the resources you guys talk about. I need to get the app. 

This is a poem I wrote a little while back.

I live in an ashtray,
and sit on the floor.
I look out the window,
while locking the door.
My hope last for minutes,
but soon fades away.
I dream of tomorrow,
but don't live today.

My partner smokes and the pack is 6 
inches away from me right now. 

I've walked several miles with my dog which made us both happy. My hands were shaking when I woke up today. It's going to be alright. 

According to research, hypnosis is a pretty solid thing to try. If it's bullshit, you have placebo on your side. There's that Allen Carr book that people talk about. I read it but I don't remember it. 

One of my favorite guided meditation / hypnotists on YouTube is Michael Sealey. I've only listened to his quit smoking one a few times in the past ( not nearly enough to say I've made a consistent effort.) but the imagery was strong. It's been months and some of what he said is still with me. It will just randomly pop up in my head. It's kind of intense and I'm going to listen again. I've been looking at smoking as self harm and maybe a way to deal with anxiety inappropriately by sticking things in my mouth and sucking. All of these things are just little trains of thought that might be useful. 

I'm still an addict. I have no doubt that my brain is still up to some shit and will be coming up with lies / excuses by daylight.

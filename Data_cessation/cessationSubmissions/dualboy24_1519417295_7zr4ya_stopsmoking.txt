6 Years down, can't believe how much has changed

Well I am 6 years free without any smokes. I have really cut down on my drinking (occasional beer), started to get into shape, and feeling great. 

I suggest everyone stay strong and do things one day at a time, it gets to be so easy that you look back and can not believe you were ever held prisoner to a horrid habit.

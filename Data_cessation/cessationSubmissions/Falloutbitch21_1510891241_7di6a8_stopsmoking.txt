I'm in a really bad place and am dying for a smoke. The stress is unbearable

I quit smoking I don't even know how long ago anymore. It was after I found out I was pregnant. Well, I had my beautiful baby girl and all was well... or so we thought. Turns out she got sick because I wasn't treated for something I had while pregnant, which they were supposed to test me for and didn't, and she ended up born with it and got transferred to the NICU at a different hospital away from home.


Her father and I are staying out here and he took time off from work and I am beyond stressed. I just want my baby. I hate to leave her to eat or go to bed and bawl my eyes out every time I leave for the night. 

If I wasn't breastfeeding I think I would have failed by now. But I'm about ready to give up the breast feeding and smoke . I could use encouragement

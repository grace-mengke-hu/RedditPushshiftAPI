Voice sounding weird after I stopped smoking

Hey guys, 

first of all, thank you. You are part of why I stopped smoking 9 months ago for good. 

Now, in the last 3 months something came up. My voice started to sound weird. 

I was a heavy smoker for almost 16 years. I had vocal and singing lessons when until I was 16. My voice is something I really need for my job. It's usually very deep and smooth but now it completely changed. It is very high pitched (for a guy) and I have to be VERY careful because if I stress the wrong syllable I just sound like a whiny man-child.

Did anyone else had this problem? Does anybody know what I can do?

Physical effects

Hey everyone, 2 days done now! Hope youre all feeling good! I had some sort of chest infection this week, but quit smoking 2 and a half days ago. I was just wandering if having slight trouble swallowing/tender throat, mood swings, chest pain that comes and goes, bloating, slightly numbness in legs that comes and goes are all normal? My head also feels quite congested

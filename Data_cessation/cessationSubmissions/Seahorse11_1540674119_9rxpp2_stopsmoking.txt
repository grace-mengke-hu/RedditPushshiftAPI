It’s been a year ago since I’ve read Allen’s words about nicotine. Ever since I read the book I felt enslaved but I still kept falling for that ‘only one’ sigaret mind trick. For some reason I feel that I’ve learned from all those little misstakes last year and that I’m ready to free myself forever &lt;3 myself.

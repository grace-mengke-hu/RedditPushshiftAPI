Quitting cigarettes, pot and alcohol today...

I can't drink without smoking so I figured I should quit them at the same time. I don't smoke weed often so that part should be easy. I would consider myself borderline alcoholic because I'll drink alone just because I'm bored. That's what I did last night and getting up for work this morning sucked. I've also been really depressed lately so hopefully quitting will help pull me out of it. Wish me luck...

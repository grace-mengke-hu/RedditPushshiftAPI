Getting close to around the 24 hour mark, feels for real this time

I haven't smoked a cigarette in two days and last time i had nicotine was a pinch last night, it's only a small step but I feel down with it this time. My roommate are still smoking and I haven't even felt horribly inclined. Also, was nice being able to buy a six pack and effectively spend as much money as I would on any other given day.

I just quit cold turkey after 25 years. I used Noopept and haven't had any cravings.

Nootropics like Noopept help a person to create new neural networks.  I've been working with neural networks for awhile, but this time I am applying it to stop smoking.  I got the Noopept and realized it would be perfect for quitting, and sure enough, it is. very mild WD and really no cravings other than my desire to go stand outside, which I do.

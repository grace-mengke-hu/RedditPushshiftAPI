I've really messed up

So I've been patting myself on the back for the last 18 days for not smoking cigarettes anymore. That's great and all but I smoke shisha too and I've compartmentalized that as another habit that I will get to stop as well. I used to smoke like 4-5 cigarettes a day and then a shisha at night. I've dabbled with vaping for a while. Now I chew nicotine gum too! There really is no limit to what kind of shit I can put into my lungs and body. I'm ashamed of myself. I need to set another quit date now and stop patting myself on the back. I'm not going to smoke or anything, I just can't label myself a non-smoker till I've stopped cheating.

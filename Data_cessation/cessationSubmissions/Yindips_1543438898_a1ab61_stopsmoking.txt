Struggling with putting the vape down!

I made a post a month ago how I want to quit. I relapsed 12 hours later. It gives me heartburn, it dries my mouth and leaves me dehydrated but I just can't put the thing down. I would much rather spend my money on something else but I just can't put the bloody thing down ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­

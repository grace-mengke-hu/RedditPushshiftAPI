Something I do that helps

If you have to go outside to smoke like I do this might help. I usually have triggers at night so now when I get the trigger, I immediately get into the shower and put on my pajamas even if I’m not going to bed. For some reason, it helps a lot. I’m too lazy to get dressed, go get cigarettes, spend money, then make myself reek... I just got out of the shower... not sure if that will help or not. I’ve been desperate for anything to help me quit.

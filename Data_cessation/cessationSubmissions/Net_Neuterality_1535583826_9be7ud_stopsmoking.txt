GI issues after quitting Juul

Hey everyone,

I threw my Juul in the trash this past Friday night after using it for about a year and a half. The cravings are there I guess but what's really bothering is all the stomach issues it's seemed to cause me. Warning for the upcoming tmi but basically I've had diarrhea every morning and thrown up every large meal I've tried to eat. Obviously I'm watching my hydration and my doctor has ordered a few lab tests in the meantime. 

Has anyone else experienced these kinds of side effects from nicotine withdrawal? I'm just a little concerned because I'm now 5 days clean of it and still feel sick. 

Anyway, any input would be comforting.

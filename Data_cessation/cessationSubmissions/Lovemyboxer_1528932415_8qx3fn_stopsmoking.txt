A little irritated

Hi All. I’ve been home sick for days and today I’m just starting to feel better. I am headed back to work tomorrow, after missing three days. I’m irritable with my man. I’m trying to not be.  He keeps smoking in front of me, and he knows from past times, that I would like him not to. I guess it’s not fair to him, that I’m changing our dynamics in our relationship. Sigh. Time will get me through this. Thanks for reading!

Day One. What physical changes do I have to look forward to?

I'm a late 20's female and smoking has consumed my life for the past 8 years. I smoke anywhere between 3-6 cigarettes per day. I don't know why I do it as I find the taste disgusting and need to drink something with every puff I take. I suppose I've come to associate it with stress & boredom relief. I've lurked on here for some time - many times I don't even read the posts in fear that it might force me to realize the true dangers of smoking. Yesterday, I read through a few of the posts on this sub and it was enough to get me to stop smoking as of today. This is the first time I'm seeking the support of a community to help me with my plans to quit and I'm optimistic that I will be much more successful than going at it alone. I know these next few days will be hard. What are some positive physical changes that I can look forward to over the next day? Week? Month? Year? Additionally, what are some negative physical/emotional effects that I may encounter? I've been feeling sluggish/lazy for years now, and I miss feeling lively and full of energy. I don't even know if that's caused by smoking, but it's one of the main motivating factors for me. Thanks for listening :)

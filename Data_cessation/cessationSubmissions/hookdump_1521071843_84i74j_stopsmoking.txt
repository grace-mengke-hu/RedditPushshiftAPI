My method for quitting smoking

Someone just asked me for tips on quitting smoking, and I ended up writing quite a bit. So I decided to post it here in case someone finds it useful! Enjoy!

*Disclamer: I'm no doctor. I'm just a guy who researches addictions.*

I recommend starting with a better goal instead of **"quitting smoking"**.

I recommend: **"understanding your addiction to smoking"**. 

Now light one up and keep reading...

Imagine you have your favorite food in front of you. Smells great, looks amazing, and is likely delicious.

And right before taking the first bite, you think "I shouldn't!", "It's not healthy", etc. And you try to resist. You put the fork down.

You control yourself, of course. You're not a pig!

But...

But... it looks so delicious! It's not *that* unhealthy...

No! I'll muster all my will-power.

Yes, I can do this.

A nice dish won't beat me. I'm stronger than that!!!...

AHhhh... fuck it! Let's eat!

... 

...and right before taking the first bite, a friend you trust yells "It's poisoned!".

And of course, you immediately put the fork down.

Did you need will-power for that?

Did you need self-control?

Did someone order you not to eat it?

Did you have to fight an internal struggle between eating it or not eating it?

Nah! Once you have all the information, it's naural not to eat it.

Rejecting that delicious food became an *effortless* task now.

You might imagine where this is going... "Cigarrettes are poison"... But nope. Nothing about that. You already know this. This information would be useful and convincing if you were a non-smoker. But if you're already an addict, you won't care about it. **In addictions, scare tactics don't work.**

So, what do we do?

Well, first of all, know that "trying to quit smoking" is stupid. You are just battling yourself with your weapons of "self-control", "will-power" and other stuff that is great for other situations, but not so great for curing addictions. It's as if your friend who yelled about the poisoned food, instead came running to you, silently, and struggled to get the fork away from your mouth, without explaining anything. You'd be confused and fight him off until he lets you eat!!!

There's no such thing as "trying to quit smoking". How is one even "trying"? Usually attempts are as effective as trying to fill a bucket with a hole at the bottom, without fixing the hole. No matter how much you try, you will never fill it. 

When you get addicted to smoking you get *programmed to smoke*, and usually to smoke more and more over time, and to not fully grasp the nature of your addiction. Your brain will make crazy rationalizations for every step of the process, and you'll believe all of them. You are blind to your addiction, and that's the first thing you need to comprehend.

The addiction builds up stealthily, underground, silently, while you convince yourself "you can quit at any time", "it's not that bad". And suddenly, you realize you are already an addict!

Aaaaanyway, what to do, then?

First you need to understand **addiction**. What it is. What it does to your brain. Why it happens. You can look this up online.

Second you need to understand **nicotine addiction**. How it works. How it is different than alcohol or heroin. What makes this addiction unique. What are some specific challenges of it. The audiobook "The Addictive Brain" covers this well. The book "Easy Way to Quit Smoking" by Allen Carr too.

Keep researching. Go deeper. Re-read things. Write your own summaries. No matter how long it takes, just make steady progress on this study.

*BTW: You can smoke all you want while you do this.*

People usually spend many years to get a college degree, to become experts of art, of finances, of medicine, of engineering.

Well, now, buckle up, because you're about to become a goddamn expert about addictions. It could take a week, or it could take a year, so you better start working on it now.

Finally, once you truly understand how your addiction works... once you can explain it in detail to a 10 year old or to your grandma with your own words... then you'll get it.

Then you'll have the whole picture.

You'll immediately put the cigarette down. And when you do, you'll come running to thank me for this advice. And I'll ask you:

**Did you need will-power for that?**

**Did you need self-control?**

**Did someone order you to stop smoking?**

**Did you have to fight an internal struggle between smoking or not smoking?**

And you'll probably respond:

**Nah! Once you have all the information, it's naural not to smoke.**

**Quitting smoking was *effortless*.**

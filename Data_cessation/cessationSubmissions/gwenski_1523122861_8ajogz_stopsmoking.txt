About Yesterday... (Day 5)

Yesterday was a bad day. The sun wasn't out and I had lost the energy high from the previous 2 days. I was yet again depressed and dreading the weekend of no smoking&amp;drinking. I got through job 1 okay but then job 2 went from chaos to crisis in no time. My cravings were OC. When I got to my car all I wanted was to smoke...
Instead, I cried. And then somehow had the willpower after my 30 minute drive home to pass the gas station and not stop.
Everyone keeps telling me I should feel proud, but I don't. I'm not sure I feel anything except at a loss...
But at least I didn't stop.

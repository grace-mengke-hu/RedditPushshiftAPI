Here I go Yet AGAIN

So I sort of tried to quit. If I'm honest, I went half a day and then the spawn had a meltdown and I went outside and lit up.

Ya'll, I really want to quit. I really do. I'm just terrified of losing my temper when the child has a fit or screams at me or has a meltdown. So my solution? I'm going to let him do whatever he wants for a few days while I fight this temptation. Bad parenting? Perhaps, but it isn't it worse parenting to be teaching my son bad habits?  I need some feedback here, can ya'll help me out?

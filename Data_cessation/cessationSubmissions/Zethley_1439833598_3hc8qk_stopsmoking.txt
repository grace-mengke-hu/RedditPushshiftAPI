Today I decided. Now he just needs to decide too.

I am not a heavy smoker, but I am a smoker in my early 30's and I don't want to be anymore. The problem is is that my husband is a very heavy smoker (in his early 40's). We have both tried to quit on our own at different times but that obviously didn't work and we know now that we have to do it together. 

I know I can't force it if he isn't ready again because being mentally ready is a big part of it and I know he is scared of how difficult it will be for him. (Especially since we live in a weirdly smoking friendly town, so many people smoke and it is totally socially acceptable) Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to broach the subject. Should I make a plan for us and present it to him or just start dropping hints of quitting again and jump on any thoughts of his that point in that direction?  

I want us to kick this for good.

I was also thinking of buying Allen Carr's book for us to both read, I've read good things about it. Has anyone here read it that could give a review first hand?

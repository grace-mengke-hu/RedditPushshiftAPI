Dont miss that feeling...

Went to a bar this weekend that I have been avoiding after quitting, due to the fact that half of it is a smoking lounge. Of course this is the area my friends like to hang out in it. So I avoided it, thinking it would make me want to smoke (like old times) But it did just the opposite... seeing everyone in there light a cig after cig for hours made me realize that I dont miss that feeling of "needing another one" that annoying anxious feeling you get in a setting like a smokey bar. Watching everyone else have that feeling reminded me how good it feels to not "need" one. I can just drink and hang out and not smoke! I dont use cigs as a social crutch anymore. I just am a non smoker.

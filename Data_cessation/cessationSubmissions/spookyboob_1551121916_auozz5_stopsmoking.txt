Stopped cigarettes, started vaping. How to cut back and/or quit?

I quit smoking cigarettes last August and was so proud of myself. I exchanged it for vaping and it’s way better in every sense. However, I feel I have become more addicted to nicotine since vaping and I need it more often. It’s easier than cigarettes because I can take a few hits and be alright for about an hour or two but then I need it again or I get cranky. 

So I guess I am looking for how to quit vaping or at least cut back so it doesn’t become a problem at future jobs. Any advice is appreciated :)

[advice] Tips on helping my best friend quit!

So like the title says,  I need help with my best friend and his attempt to quit smoking.  He has been smoking since he was 14 and he is now 26. He's wanted to stop for awhile now and I just need advice on how I can be super supportive without being overbearing.  I have never smoked so I don't quit understand how hard it is to quit.  I have been buying him the Zonnic gum and regular gum to keep his mind off of it. 

We also work together and he says when Im there it motivates him to not take a smoke break because he doesn't want to disappoint me.  Any other tips or advice on how I can really help him succeed this time are appreciated.  Thank you!!!

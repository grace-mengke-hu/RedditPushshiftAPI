Trying to quit... but it's a weird feeling of loss of identity.

I'm trying to kick the habbit before it kills me. I'm in my early 30s now and I can feel the effects. I just find it incredibly difficult to stop. It's like it's part of me, part of my "identity". Bored? Smoke. Break at work? Smoke. After eating? Smoke. Etc...

It seems every single little thing can almost be linked back to smoking. I'm fully aware of the money and health related returns for quitting, but I just find myself getting extra anxious when I don't smoke for even half a day. Not smoking, for me, feels like if I decided to stop eating. It starts out okay for the first little while... but it quickly starts feeling like it goes against some basic instinct, feels like I'm doing something unnatural that I'm not supposed to be doing. (I know it's the addiction... but holy shit.)

I can't do patches (they give me massive headaches and make me feel dizzy, even the small ones)... I guess I could try gum? I don't know what could be effective to really help.

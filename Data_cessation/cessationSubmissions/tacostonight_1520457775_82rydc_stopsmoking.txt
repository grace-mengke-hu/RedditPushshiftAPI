Just realized. It's been 1 year! 25 years 3 packs a day.

Was on Facebook and saw a photo of me from a year and a day ago.. it was my last day. I smoked 3 packs a day for 25 years and drank a 12 pack of beer a day with it.

I have an occasional drink but haven't touched a smoke in a year.

I tried everything prior and the night before I decided I wanted to quit and came up with a plan. I stuck with it and fuck.... one year .

Good luck everyone and remember , we all are different people and your way of quitting should be tailored to who you are. When you want to quit, really want to quit, you'll first analyze yourself . That's when I knew last quit attempt would work for me.

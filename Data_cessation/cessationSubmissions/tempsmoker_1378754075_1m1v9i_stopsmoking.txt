Is there a point quitting now or should I just wait?

I've been smoking since I was 18, turning 22 in October and I'm just starting my last year of University. 
It's been 2 and a half months since my last cigarette...and it's been 2 and a half months since I've lived away from home in my Uni digs.
When I go home for the holidays by the end of the first week I have no cravings, and I barely remember smoking at all.
I guess it helps that no one knows that I smoke and would probably judge me.
Now that I'm back at University, in the first 24 hours I've already realised that I'm failing hard, and am really tempted to just start smoking. Especially since I've got a pack here just waiting for me..
I'm debating the thought that I might as well try and cut back this year, but still smoke because I enjoy it and the social side.
Is this stupid? I'm not sure if this sounds reasonable or it's just the nicotine temptation talking.

tl;dr:  
Don't smoke when I'm away from uni. Smoke when I'm at uni. Starting last year of uni. Smoke during last year then give up at the end? or just try really hard and struggle to give up now.

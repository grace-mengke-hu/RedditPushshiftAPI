God I feel awful

I've tried and failed to quit so many times.  Recently I came clean with my wife about my drinking problem that I had been hiding from her for the last year and a half.  I lost all her trust. 

Ive been sober 79 days thus far.  I had made an appointment with a doctor to see what I could do to quit smoking.  I didn't go cos I felt like I was only going to waste 20 bucks for him to tell me to try the patch or gum.   Idk....probably stupid thinking on my part.

I told my wife I didn't go and why.  She's not so happy with me at the moment.  I'm at my wits end.  I feel like all I'm doing is fucking things up.  

.....

What are some good ways of kicking this disgusting habit?  I'm so tired of letting her (and myself) down.  Idk what to do anymore.

Day 6 - No That Hard Except One Thing

Greeting Gentlemen ! 

Currently on Day 6, and it does get a lot easier, the fight with craving  
isn't anymore so bad, the memory's of having a good smoke start to look like not so good thing. 
Starting to feel the benefits of having the ability to smell and taste food, overall feeling better. 
Still having a little bit of a problem with sleeping but it's completely manageable, but I have one problem .. 

Here is the deal : 

Those Fucking Mood Swings, I mean, after 2 minutes of having a mood swing, I think, what the actual fuck, am I a complete idiot, going completely mental ? 

My lovely mother buys me 2 small pizzas, awesome, love them, okey, start to eat them, and somehow I don't like them, the meat on them isn't something I liked, it was eatable, but not enjoyable. 2 Pizzas laying there, one Pizzas has 2 bites in it, and one mother fuck going completely mental next to them. Angry at my mother, angry at my self and angry at the pizzas, after 2 minutes of being angry and swearing, I get to normal mental state and think, that's just stupid. A normal person doesn't go fully mental over it. 

So when did the mood swings go away for you gentlemen ?

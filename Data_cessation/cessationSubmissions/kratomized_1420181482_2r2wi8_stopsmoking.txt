How the fuck do I quit vaping?

I've been vaping since last spring. Before that, i was a light smoker for about a year. Since I am an idiot, instead of just quitting the smokes i switched to vaping 24 mg e-juice. Yeah. I've worked my way down to 8mg juice, that i puff on throughout the day. The longest i've been able to go without vaping is one day. I don't get cranky, or achey or whatever I thought would happen. I get really fucking terrible anxiety, i get soaced out and depersonalized, and its very shitty. I don't know how i can stop. I dug myself into this hole, how do I get out? Just keep tapering until i get down to 0mg?

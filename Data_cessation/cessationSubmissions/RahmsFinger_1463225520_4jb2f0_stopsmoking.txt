A letter to me and you....500 days

Dear Me (and hopefully you),

Depending on the time zone, it's been close to 500 days since you accidentally read a book that some random person on Reddit recommended to you for understanding anxiety. If you could figure out who that was, you would give them a huge hug.

You thought this book was silly, especially after you realized most of it was about not smoking, which wasn't what you were thinking about! You had a full pack sitting right there on your desk. The outside was just a few steps away. But you read that silly book anyway, and learned that stupid, repetitive prose caused you to cease thinking smoking was social and/or calming for your anxiety. All it did was restart the clock, as to the next time you could run out to smoke again. And you felt stupid, and stopped it all. The next day. Cold turkey.

It was weird and tough at times. But this sub helped, even more than your kitties who were so obviously proud. You only confided in one IRL human friend for a very long time, and she told you, you were so strong! You pretended to agree. Eventually, you believed her!

Then, you had to say goodbye to your older sick kitty, and you didn't even think about using that as an excuse to smoke. Instead, maybe 4 or 5 months later, you felt ready to adopt a precious pup, barely a year old. She's become the apple of your eye, and you are glad she never knew you as an ugly human who smoked.

At some point you had to remind yourself to come back here, and support everyone the way they supported you. And it gets difficult, not because you don't want to help, but because you have such freedom. No scheduling everything around your next smoke break!!!

Back in the day, I smoked a pack a day, or shamefully quite a bit more. No one who has known me ever thought I'd be a non-smoker. 

Please join me. Or at least do a discreet little dance with me, for my 500th smoke free day! Let's not smoke today!!!!!

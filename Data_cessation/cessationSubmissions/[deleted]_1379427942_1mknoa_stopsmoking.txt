17 days cigarette free and feeling sick?

I quit nicotine in all forms on Sep. 1st.. for the first 2 weeks I was feeling fine but just recently (the past 5 or so days) I've been feeling like garbage. Really fatigued, achy, I coughed up some brownish stuff earlier today. What's really worrying me is yesterday (my birthday, lolz) I woke up to a tenderness in my neck, when I touch it I can feel a bump underneath the skin.. I assume it's a lymph node but yeah.. don't think that's normal. I don't think it's anything serious, though.. idek. Anyone ever hear of anything like this? 

edit: forgot some info. been smoking a pack/sometimes a pack and a half a day for the past year and before that 2 packs/week for 3 years. I'm 19, going to the doctor this weekend.

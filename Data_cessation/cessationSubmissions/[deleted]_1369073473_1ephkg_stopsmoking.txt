After seven years, I'm done, but there's one particular area that's going to be difficult. Advice?

As I said in the title, seven years of smoking, and I'm finally **ready** to be done with this. This is my day one, and everything has generally been fine.

However, the time I always want to smoke is when I'm driving - it's been a habit that's been built up all these years, and I drive quite a bit to/from college and work every day. This is when it is going to be the worst for me. Does anyone have any tips or ways to keep my mind off it? Thanks!

3 days no smoking

It's been 3 days since iv'e quit and its amazing how different I feel, I have more energy in the mornings, I sleep better at night and my hands and feet are not cold all the time. Biggest improvement I noticed was blood circulation and how my heart doesn't feel like its going to jump out of my chest. It's really amazing how you don't notice what you're going through until you quit smoking and see all the benefits.

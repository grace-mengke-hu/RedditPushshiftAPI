Threw out a cig for the first time today.

Now I have to fight with myself. One part of me is saying "Great job", while the other one is telling me that it was a mistake to throw out a cig I got for free, FREE. I can't believe I was foolish enough to start vaping, then transition to normal cigarettes. In Poland we say *Curiosity is the first step down to hell*, now I'm in this hell.

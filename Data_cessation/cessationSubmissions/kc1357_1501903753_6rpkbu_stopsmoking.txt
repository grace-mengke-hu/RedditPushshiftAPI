Idk how

Today is two weeks without smoking. I don't know how I've managed it, but I have somehow not had a cigarette despite having drank considerably a few times (which is the only time now that I really crave cigarettes). Anyway, I guess I'm glad to and I hope you all choose not to smoke today. Or maybe not have that next smoke, either way

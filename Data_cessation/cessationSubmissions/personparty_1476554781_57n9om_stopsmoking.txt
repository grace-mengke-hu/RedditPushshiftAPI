I made it 30 days!!

Wow I'm just so impressed with myself. I've been trying to quit *all year* but never managed to make it past day 3 or 4. This time I just did it. This morning, right before I woke up, I had a dream that I lit a cigarette while still in bed. It felt so real, I could smell it and feel the smoke in my lungs... I was so upset with myself. Until I woke up!! Ah it feels like Christmas, the momentum is really taking off for me.

went out to party after 28 days. Smoked two, don't regret it.

I will not start counting from day 1 again and that has one simple reason.

Yeah I went to a party and yeah I smoked 2 cigarettes after 28 days of not smoking but luckily i also drank waaaay to much. Why luckily you ask? Because the next mornig I woke up to a headache and the feeling of having to vomit any second so I kept saying to myself that I'm feeling like shit because I smoked, to get my consciousness to believe that. Actually today when I think about smoking it makes me wanna puke so I guess thats a good thing. Lets see how long this lasts.

Keep up the good work guys!

EDIT: Holy shit. Didn't expect these kind of comments. I guess I was just sugarcoating the fact that I smoked again. Thanks for opening my eyes...resetting the badge :,(
off to a new start!

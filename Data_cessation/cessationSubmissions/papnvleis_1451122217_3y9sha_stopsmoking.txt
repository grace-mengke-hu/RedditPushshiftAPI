Husband is trying to quit, help

My husband is 25, he has tried to quit previously but after a few days he will say he is having a drag to help him cope then a drag turns into half a cigarette and so on. He told me last night that he has had his last cigarette. He is trying to build muscle and get fitter. I want to be supportive though in the past he hasn't always listened to me. I have never been a smoker. We live with my mom who smokes a lot, they usually smoke together, especially when we are out. They also drive to work together and smoke the whole way so it will be hard for him but I don't know what to do to help him. He is already slightly moody.

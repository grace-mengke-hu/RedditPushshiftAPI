Going on day 6 - Journal

Today I had TWO bad cravings, same ol' nothing to report except that I was simply ignoring my urge to smoke.. wait NO! I HAVE SOMETHING AWESOME TO REPORT!


The other days I wasn't WANTING to smoke, but the thought crossed my mind a bunch, just the idea of smoking, the fact that I wasn't smoking etc was just crossing my mind.
Today I simply just didn't think of smoking! The thought just DIDN'T cross my mind! Just those rare bits when I had those cravings, but I didn't even think about it otherwise!

Kudos to me!

Any other Ladies have more cravings with PMS?

Just started my First period without smoking. This whole week I have been craving cigarettes (and dark chocolate- duh!) 

I easily couldâ€™ve bought a pack yesterday. I really want a cigarette. 

It just occurred to me that it could be the hormones. 

Anyone else fighting cravings along with PMS/ period hormones?

Words Of Encouragement

I've had a few thoughts tonight of wandering down into my town and buying a pack of cigarettes.

I won't do it; because I know that for every day I do not smoke, my body is healthier.

Not only is my body healthier; I can run faster, lift heavier, and think clearer.

Don't give up! We can all win out over this goddamned scourge called cigarettes!

We can all do it! We can all make it!

God Bless You All!

Help! Gums bleeding after quiting

Hi All,
My gums bleeding a lot. I am on week 4th almost 1 month.
It started about after 2 weeks smoke free..
I know it is 'normal' and it happens with several people.
But how long does it take? I feel blood in my mouth, i hate it..
I just wanna be a happy, healthy non smoker!!
I am grateful if you write me gum bleeding stories.. thank you!

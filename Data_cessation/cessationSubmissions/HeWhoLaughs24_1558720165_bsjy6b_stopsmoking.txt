Today makes one full week since my last cigarette. Would love to celebrate with a beer but am absolutely terrified.

I'm sure this doesn't even need to be explained as most smokers know just how easily cigarettes and alcohol go hand-in-hand. How did you guys approach your 1st drink after quitting smoking? Any tips? I thought the 1st common sense approach would be to not get hammered and take it easy maybe just a couple beers for a nice buzz. Then again, I thought maybe I oughta just wait 3 or 4 months to really remove myself from cigarets before I even attempt to have a beer. What did you guys do?

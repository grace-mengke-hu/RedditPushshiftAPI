Stop smoking by smoking cannabis

Disclaimer: I have no scientific back up on this its pure empirical experience before criticizing me give me the benefit of the doubt and try it for your self. 

So I decided stop smoking (Nov 30 2013) have been smoking daily for at least 6 months great withdraw symptoms by just quitting one day, seeing a person lighting a cigarette was like a torture I craved that nicotine rush in my head and then decided to quit just because I want to see my grand children grow.

Since (Dec 1st 2013) every time I craved a cigarette I smoked some cannabis after the first two weeks I just smoked cannabis once a day just at night it relived all my stress and anxieties. Nice, quiet & cold night blazed as hell listening some good old albums. 

Note: Probably never smoked more than 2 grams a day.

After 1 month (Jan 1st 2014) I decided to take the next big step quitting cannabis, first night was hard I couldn't sleep so I had to take melatonin next day was better I struggled in bed a little bit but I rested that night. 
After 3 days without cannabis nor melatonin (5mg) a little desire for tobacco came back so I smoked some cannabis and the craving sensation went away.
Since then I have been smoking cannabis every other day or less Haven't touched a cigarette in 52 days. 

Additional info: While doing this I exercised like once a week and was supplementing with multivitamin and Rhodiola rosea (500 mg).

Feel free to try and share hope it help you like it helped me.

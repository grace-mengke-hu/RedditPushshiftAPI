Need suggestions...

My quit date is...well, the morning. It's after midnight but I'm finishing my pack. I need suggestions to help with stress. Smoking is my stress relief. And honestly, I LIKE smoking. I enjoy it! Is it bad for me? YES! Does it cost too much? YES! But I like it. I enjoy it. And it's my stress relief. I'm a single working mom of a teenager...and it's hard. 

I started smoking when I was 15. I quit cold turkey when I was about to turn 23 on a whim...and was successful for 4 years. I started again when I was about to get divorced...that was 13 years ago. I've been trying to quit ever since and have always failed. 2 major problems...I like it and it's my stress relief. And it doesn't help that I already know the stress relief is in my head only-I know that. I need suggestions to manage the stress. 

I can't chew gum or suck on candy due to dental issues. I have a full time job so I can't just go for a walk whenever I want. 

I want to succeed in quitting for good this time. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.

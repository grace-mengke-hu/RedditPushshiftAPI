One Pack Left: Advice & Why You Quit

Hello everyone.

I have one pack of cigarettes left, and after that I am taking my first ever stab at quitting. In the grand scheme of how long a lot of people around here have been smoking my time has been short. I'm going on five years soon.

Here's what I'm worried about:
Replacing the habit with something else. Smoking is, for me, largely an emotional friend and a time-killer. I smoke on my breaks at work, because I'm not sure what else I would do with ten minutes, and then small amount of time outside helps me gather myself to go back to what I'm doing. I work as a barista. It's not nearly as bad as it was when I started smoking (I waitressed at a diner), but people can still be frustrating, and taking those minutes in solitude helped me keep my cool. What else can I do in those ten minutes other than sit pointlessly around?

Walking - what do I do with my hands? I live in a pretty urban place, and I walk absolutely everywhere.

Initial cravings - I know that they say cravings for anything last between three and five minutes. What do you guys do to take your mind off of it?

Lastly, I'm interested in why everyone decided to quit. Mine is pretty vain, but a reason is a reason. I saw a picture taken recently at a party. My teeth are soooo yellow. I've never had nice teeth, but most of my motivation is coming from the idea that I can get some whitening strips after a month or two, and it might actually matter. Plus, I'll get insurance through my job soon, and I can start taking better care of my teeth as a whole. Why did you quit? I'm curious.

Any other advice would be great. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Cravings again, after almost a year

I quit last year around New Year’s Day and it’s wild to think that I will almost be smoke free for a *year*. However, the past few months have been very tough and I keep trying to find a release, a way to relax and de-stress. One of my friends picked up smoking again and while I still hate the smell there’s something about it that’s appealing. I’m reminded of how good smoking used to feel even as I tell myself I don’t want to go back to that. 

Any advice on staying strong almost a year in? I can’t explain why I’m feeling intense cravings again (it’s been so easy for so long to not want cigarettes) but I think it’s mostly in my head.

Angry and emotional

I am going strong at 38+ days, but over the last week I have been very emotional, crying for no reason, feeling blue and worst of all blowing up at people for no reason. I just feel angry and annoyed all the time. I have been avoiding bars which is making me feel less social, but I am getting mad at my husband and friends. Even though I am not craving, I think about starting again just to get back to feeling myself. Did anyone else experience this when quitting? Please tell me it's just a short phase.

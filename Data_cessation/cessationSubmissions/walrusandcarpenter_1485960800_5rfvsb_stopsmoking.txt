Almost a year in, some thoughts

I find myself, after nearly a year since quitting, becoming....unkind in my thoughts and feelings toward smokers. I look at them with disdain, rolling my eyes, etc. I wish I had compassion for them, but I don't. And I feel bad about it. 

It also doesn't make sense, because I still crave/think abt cigs fairly regularly. So it's not like I am that different or any better than current smokers.

Why don't I feel sympathy towards smokers? Instead I just feel angry with them. I think I may be jealous of them.

Being a nonsmoker is hard. I think it always will be. But it is worth it. I feel physically so much better since quitting. And I also felt very guilty and judged by others for smoking, and I no longer feel that way since quitting. 

But nothing worth doing is easy.

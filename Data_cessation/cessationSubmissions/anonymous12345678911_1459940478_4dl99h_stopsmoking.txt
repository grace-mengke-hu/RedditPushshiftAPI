Day 5: Help

Currently trying to stop smoking. Need a bit of help. I asked my friend to hold on to my pack, but the urges are real. 

I smoke about 5-7/day, when stress kicks in as a college student, 10/day(round ball). 

I lead a VERY healthy lifestyle (bodybuilding and dieting properly) but the habit is hard to kick. 

How can I continue on my streak? I have tried to quit before but lasted about 1-2 months. 

Any help is much appreciated, thank you so much!

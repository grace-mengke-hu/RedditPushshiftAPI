It's high time I quit and I'm scared of failure

I have been smoking for 18 years now. I have quit a couple of times but end up starting back when my stress levels get super high. I've taken Chantix in the past and been successful but I know that's not an option this time. I'm not in a mental state where I can handle the side effects right now. My intentions are to get the patches, take Welbutrin, and maybe watch Allen Carr's film. Are there any other tricks that have worked for you that might help me succeed?

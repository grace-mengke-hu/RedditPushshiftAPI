Smoked during New Years Eve party, and here I am going through withdrawal again.

Hi all.  I've been a non-smoker for about a year now, but today I am once again going through the withdrawal symptoms I remember very well from when I first quit.

I had an amazing party with my friends and our wives at my house for New Years.  One friend in particular, well, we have always enabled each other.  And this year he brought his usual pouch of tobacco and we started rolling up cigarettes.  I knew what I was doing, but figured a little bit couldn't hurt, it was the holidays after all!  Of course it didn't turn out to be a little, we smoked our asses off while drinking our asses off.

Well, here I am today, coughing up phlegm.  My mouth tastes terrible.  I'm getting chills.  I remember all of these symptoms quite well, because I've quit before.

Not even one, never again.

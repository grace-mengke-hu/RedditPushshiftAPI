Realized that I didn't think about cigarettes at all yesterday...

I'm just past 30 days which is huge for me. At the end of the day yesterday, I was browsing on Reddit and it occurred to me all of the sudden that I hadn't thought about cigarettes at all during the day. The obsession is beginning to lift for me with time. It really does get easier!

Day 2-Smoke Free :)

Starting day 2. First thing I noticed this morning is my apartment really smells of cigarette smoke. Not in a good way. I'm thinking I'm going to do a major clean but since the smell is kind of making me sick, I might not. I think I'm going to keep the smell to help me not smoke. A little reminder of how toxic that shit is, at least for now.

Now off too to do whatever non-smokers do...which is whatever the hell they want.

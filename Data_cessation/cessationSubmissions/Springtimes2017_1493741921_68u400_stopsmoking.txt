Very grateful near miss...

I've just come back from.the shops having got so upset this afternoon (again by an email sent by my daughters dad which means i cant do the national 3 peak challenge which was a motivation for me to work towards and stay quit nor take my daughter on holiday abroad) and walked there with 4 pound coins to get some cigs. On the way to the shop im.thinking ill have to reset my badge, ill have to go through that acute withdrawal again, what if i dont get back off them.  Hands shaking, got to the shop ask for the cigs and the till rings up at Â£5.19 - total godsend, ive walked back home with no cancer sticks cried some more and am.still 17 days smoke free.

Im posting becasue im grateful I didnt do it, I havent let myself.down or what feels like my fellow non smokers.on here.

Its uncomfortable what im.going though but the cigarettes wont make them.less so - just give me bad breath whilst im.feeling shit anyway!

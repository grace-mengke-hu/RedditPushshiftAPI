50 days and I'm feeling fine!

I can't believe the time has gone so quickly! 

Thanks to Allen Carr I managed to kick a stupid addiction to a ridiculous chemical that I've had for more than half my life. 

Hooray for me! I just did a 10k walk to celebrate :) Breathed all the way and never coughed once.

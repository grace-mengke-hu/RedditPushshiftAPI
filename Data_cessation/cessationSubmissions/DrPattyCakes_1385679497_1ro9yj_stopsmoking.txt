Day 4 Journal v2

I have this, it's easy. I'm not going to smoke anymore, but I had a HUGE craving today, I just knew I was just going to "not go for a cigarette" it's easy!
The craving is there sometimes, and the craving is STRONG! But want to know why it's easy? Because free will! Just don't DO it!
Simple as that! Just DON'T!
Think why you decided to quit smoking in the first place, remember all the stuff you saw that scared you back out of smoking, and presto! Next thing you know, the cravings you had that you thought were going to last forever just lasted 30 seconds!


Quitting is easy :D I think I could do it again for a nice cash prize ;-) But since no one is offering it, I think I'll just consider my soon-to-be pink lungs a good enough prize :D

Not to mention that food is DELICIOUS!

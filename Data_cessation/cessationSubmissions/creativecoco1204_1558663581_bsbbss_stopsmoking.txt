On Holiday

Tomorrow I start a 2 week holiday with a group of people that are a majority of smokers. I’m 24 days in to my quit. And I’m nervous to be honest. I was going into this week really strong, but as the days get closer, I’m finding myself in a ‘celebratory’ mood with the thought of holiday and the urge to smoke is getting stronger. My addict brain told me twice today to go buy a pack! That bitch is so pushy sometimes! I’m fighting back the need for a nicotine reward.  Good so far, but struggling. I’m reminding myself of all my tricks. Drink water. Do something else for 15 minutes. Take a walk. 

Anything else I could add? That maybe wouldn’t take me away from the group? Or will there be times that I’ll just need to turn in for the night? 

I’m trying to prepare myself the best I can.

I wish others the best on whatever phase of their journey they’re in.

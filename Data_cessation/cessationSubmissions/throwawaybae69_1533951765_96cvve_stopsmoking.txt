About to be done with day two

...and I have work tomorrow. Only one other smoker there, but I'm still worried I'll bum one. I really just want to be rid of this gross habit that's ruining my skin, health, teeth, and using up my spending money. I've quit before and know I can do it for good, I just need to get through the next couple of days. How many attempts did it take y'all to quit, and what was the last straw?

Just called it quits! - new to the sub.

I just quit after lung pains. It's been about a week ~ 6 days. But now I have acid reflex, I am constipated, I have some abb pains, and I have intense insomnia. I usually smoked 2-3 cigs a day, and I did not expect this to be so hard on such a light dose... It is driving me insane, but I am working through it!

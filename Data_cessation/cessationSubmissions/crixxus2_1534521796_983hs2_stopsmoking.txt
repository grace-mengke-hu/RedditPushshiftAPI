Half a year in, can't stop thinking about the haze of smoking cigarettes

Hello, all, first time posting. Guess this would be the right place for some advice on the matter.  


I am nearly half a year into not smoking. After one unsuccessful attempt that lasted nearly 3 months at the end of last year, I picked the habit back up. I knew at the time, I was picking the pack up only for a short amount of time, and that eventually I would quit. And so I managed to stop mid-February, and until now it has been my longest streak without smoking.  


 I figured if I got past a certain milestone, I would start getting disgusted by cigarette smoke to the point of feeling utterly repelled from the thoughts of the haze of smoking. But not in my case. At first the temptations were revolving around the cigarettes helping me out to deal with negative emotions. But that slowly passed. It is safe to say the physical necessity of the early stages of quitting has also completely passed.  


I cannot, however, get to the point of not missing the experience it brings. I miss that haze of smoking, where it is just you and the pack. I don't feel complete without it, really; feels like something is missing. And my job being intellectually challenging doesn't help at all.  


The good thing is, the physical necessity is so low, that I do not feel the danger of picking my butt up to go out to the store with the clear purpose of buying cigarettes. That thought is very far away from my mental process. However, I really cannot stop thinking about the bloody haze.  


Anyone who has been on a longer streak, have you guys conquered that feeling? If yes, then how. If no, how do you cope with it?

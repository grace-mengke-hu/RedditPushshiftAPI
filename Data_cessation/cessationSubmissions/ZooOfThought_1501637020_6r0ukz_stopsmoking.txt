I struggled to quit for years until I realized the real way to stop. It's not very complicated. It can be difficult but not impossible, not at all crazy like some would make it seem... it's not like it takes alot of will power or an abundance of self discipline. It just takes a little bit of control and the full truth. If you want to quit that means there is a reason for you to quit. Remember your reason. Never allow yourself to lie to yourself. You don't need to feed your nicotine craving to deal with anything. All you need to do is rid yourself of this idea that nicotine is a stress reducer. If anything (for me) it adds to the stress in the long run. It truly takes ahold of you and holds on to you as long as it can. But it feels better to be in control of this and that feeling of control transfers to other aspects of life. If you're just starting your journey- tough it out, it's sooo worth it and  know that for whatever your reason to quit- is only scratching the surface of the true benefits of putting it behind you for good.

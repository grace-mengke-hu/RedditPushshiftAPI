A revelation

It just dawned on me how much of addiction is psychological/emotional.   I smoked a pack and a half a day for ten years.  It's been ten years since I've had a cigarette.  I was able to quit smoking by switching to nicotine gum.  I was addicted to nicotine gum for ten years.  18 days ago I made the decision to give up nicotine entirely.  The first 7 days were brutal; I chewed a boat load of regular gum, slept in shifts and warned loved ones and coworkers that there was a raging demon lurking just under my skin.  Here I am today, 18 days nicotine free, completely free of any physical dependence on nicotine, in the middle of a frantic, obsessive, borderline deranged craving for Orbit chewing gum. Addiction is hot garbage and I hate it.

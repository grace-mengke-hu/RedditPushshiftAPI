I made it almost 3 days but relapsed when I came back home to my smoker BF

So yeah, I went on vacation with the remainder of a pack. Finished Allan Carr’s book then finished the last 2 out of the pack and quit. It was so easy, I went on hikes and enjoyed life. I even enjoyed coffee and meals with no cigarettes. When I came back home where I live with a smoker, the cravings had already started hitting pretty often.  

Yesterday after 2 and a half days smoke free, I lit up with him. I got a crazy buzz that I wasn’t expecting, and I realized how insidious and powerful the drug is. This morning I bought a pack. 

I want to quit again, this time for good. Every cigarette I smoke, I’m either unconscious of smoking, or I’m wanting to quit. What do you guys recommend for my course of action? I’m thinking I should listen to the book again and follow the instructions again. But how should I go about a smoke free life while living with cigarettes basically in my face and in the house all the time? What would you do to combat cravings when it’s so easy to give in?

Coming up on 500 days...

which really is meaningless.  I quit.  That's the meaningful part.  I just stopped.  I read Allen Carr ( I owe him a meal if he'll ever accept), but I didn't even follow his full advice.  He said to keep smoking until finishing his book; I was ready to quit 20 pages in.  Point is, if you're reading this you want to quit.  Bigger point, it's not as hard as you think.  It could surprise you how easy it is, it did me.  First 20 days or so...... yeah, it was on my mind.  I just kept reminding myself...' I don't like this .'..  and 'it makes me cough'.....

Well, it *does* make you cough, and no, you don't like it.  Admit that, and you're halfway there.

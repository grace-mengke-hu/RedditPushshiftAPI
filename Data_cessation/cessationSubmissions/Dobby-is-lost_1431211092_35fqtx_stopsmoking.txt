Need advice...going to try to quit soon

New to thus subreddit.  I am a 25 year old female,  and I have been smoking off and on for nearly 7 years. I desperately want to quit. I have managed to cut down how many I smoke. I usually now smoke 1 to three a day. For some reason I just can't seem to quit. My daughter's second birthday is the 20th if this month, and I would like to be rid of smoking, not only for her, but for myself. I am in general a healthy person. I run, bike and eat healthy. Smoking makes feel like a pathetic little bitch, who can't overcome this addiction. And, because I have an anxiety disorder, I am terrified of dying  from lung cancer.   Is it possible for me to quit within the next couple days? I want to live my life as a non smoker. I want to see my daughter graduate and get married if she chooses. Please help me r/stopsmoking

18 days, 6 hours and 4 minutes

I’m struggling,,,The physical cravings I can deal with .. it’s the mental game that I finding tough..
I have people congratulating me and telling me to keep up the good work and I’m thinking to myself..save your breath I’m probably going to smoke again!!!
I gave up previously for 5 years and every single day of that 5 years I craved a cigarette 
I’ve been diagnosed with emphysema and have to go on nightly oxygen once I’ve been off smokes for 3 months
Have a multitude of other health conditions which see me at home by myself all day every day and my smokes helped break the day up
How do I get in the right frame of mind????????

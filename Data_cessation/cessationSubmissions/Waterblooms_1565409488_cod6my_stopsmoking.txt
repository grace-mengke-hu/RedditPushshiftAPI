Question about quitting

So I have been a pack a day smoker since my teens....Now 44. The only time I quit smoking was when I was 24 and pregnant and the longest I have went since then was a couple of days. Long story short I NEED to quit and for whatever reason wearing the patches make me anxious so I bought a Juul. I have not had a cigarette since Monday but have been hitting the Juul here and there throughout the day. I consider this a success, but when I think about it it itâ€™s not? Ugggh. thoughts? Help?

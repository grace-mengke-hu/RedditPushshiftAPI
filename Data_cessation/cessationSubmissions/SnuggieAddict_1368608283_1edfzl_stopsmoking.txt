A little cognitive exercise for cravings

My pdoc taught me this method for dealing with panic attacks, but it seems it also helps curb cravings.

S - stop what you're doing for a moment.

M - tense and flex your hand/foot muscles.

E - exhale, inhale and breathe deeply

R - reassurance - think about the benefits of nonsmoking and
How great you are for doing it.

T - take it easy and carry on.


Get smert! We can do it!

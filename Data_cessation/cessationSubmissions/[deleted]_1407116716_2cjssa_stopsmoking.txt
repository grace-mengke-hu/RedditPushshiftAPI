The most stressful event ever today...

My car got stolen from me this morning while I was pumping gas. I didn't run to the store and buy a pack. I was hyperventilating, terrified and crying. But I made a 10 min walk into a 2 minute run home and I wasn't out of breath. And I didn't walk to the grocery store and buy a pack when the cops left my apartment. I'm going to bed now and I don't have a craving. I'm just glad this day is over. Celebrate small successes. 

Good night.

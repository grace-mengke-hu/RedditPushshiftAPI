My "I fucking quit" thread

Someone else gave me the idea to comment on this post every day during my quit and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

I have a long flight tonight and it all begins then, it will give me a good headstart.

Enough is enough, I want to be much healthier and I'm going to spend the money from a pack a day on learning a new language.

£3650 a year for bad health, wheezing, a waste of time, bad breath and smelling horrible 

£3650 in a year if I had a 1 hour private lesson on italki every single day with a professional teacher and would almost certainly be conversationallu fluent at the end of the year.

Easy choice isn't it?

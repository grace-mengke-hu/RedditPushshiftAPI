Resisted temptation when I could have gotten away with it...

My housemate ran out the door for a bus and left his skins, tobacco and filters on the couch. I could have easily rolled one and he would know no better. No-one was around and who would miss one rolled cig? No-one would notice. I'm hella proud of myself for not doing it... one of the hardest challenges so far!

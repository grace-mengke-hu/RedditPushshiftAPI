One of the most important days in my life

I had a flu few weeks ago and a terrible cough. Once I was coughing in the morning very bad and I saw blood in my mucus. I had that smokers caugh for a long time but never with blood. It repeated for like 4 mornings in a row. So I left my job in the US and went back to my home country. I was very worried, couldn't eat, sleep ant so on... I've got an appointment with my doctor, told her about everything and she checked my throat listened to my breath and etc. She told that my throat looks like 40yrs old. I'm 21 btw 7yrs 10-15cigs a day. She send me to do an X-RAY. After that I was waiting for the results behind the door.  I didn't know what to expect. It was today. I thought It can change my life upside down. It was the longest 5 minutes in my life. Then the doctor came out with the results, gave me the paper and didnt say anything. I unfolded the paper and my heart stopped... the results for cancer were negative... such a relief. I still have to do some blood tests and check a few more things but it was a pleasant moment. I will never ever start smoking again. Because before going to the doctor all i was doing is thinking about death and how my family will have to deal with it...

45 days in, saved 2000 nis (~565$ USD) think i'll treat myself with a Nexus-5 as soon as it comes out :)

I found out that setting a goal for yourself (Nexus 5 for me) helps a ton.
every day i see my stats 
(how much money i saved, how much cigs i didn't smoke, etc')
and recently i have noticed the money saved stat had grown to a respectable amount! it is rewarding as hell.
I can't believe that i used to waste such copious amounts of money on shit that is literally only harming me, it's like paying someone to hit you in the face every day.

also, recommending "cessation nation" android app; 

the first app i tried changed themes recently and got ugly & looked childish.
cessation nation on the other hand is plain: black text on white background
with simple stats, which is basically all i want from a stop smoking app.

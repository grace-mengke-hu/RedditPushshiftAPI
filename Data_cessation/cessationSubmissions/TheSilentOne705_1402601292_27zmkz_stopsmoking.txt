Irrational Anger Issues

Three weeks, everyone! So far, I'm doing well, but I seem to have a lot of anger and depression. I've looked at withdrawal symptoms and noticed that these are possible symptoms, and that I've been very short-tempered as well. 

How do you deal with these issues? What do you do to relax now? I'm trying not to act like a child, but it seems like I've become much more sensitive than before I stopped smoking.

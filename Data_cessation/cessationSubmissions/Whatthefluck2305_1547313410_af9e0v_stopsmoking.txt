2 Weeks Smoke Free

Can I get a hell yeah? Been through airports, alcohol and uncomfortable calls, no smokes needed. Cravings getting few and far between. I have a pack of smokes that totals the cost of my smoking for 14 years plus the next 14 if I relapse. Seeing $66k tied to something so ridiculous really helped me focus (pack a day former smoker here).
What was your focus when you were first quitting?

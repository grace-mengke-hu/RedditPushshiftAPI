Help underage Smoker

Hello everybody, I've been smoking since I was 14, It started off as something i'd just do with my friends and such but it all changed when i got the confidence to buy my own packs, Then it was very light maybe 1 or 2 sticks a day but it slowly got worse, this leads on to where i am today, i average about 10 - 12 on a normal day and 15 - 20 on days when im super stressed. I stopped for a month and a half about 6 months ago and i felt great, then shit happened and i started again now its back hard as ever, I've tried gum, patches and sprays and none of them work for me, One of my good friends stopped smoking via the help of a E-Cigarette. And i want to try that, any way i can get a vape underage to help me stop? Could i try talking to my doctor? My parents won't help me so im on my own here, any advice?

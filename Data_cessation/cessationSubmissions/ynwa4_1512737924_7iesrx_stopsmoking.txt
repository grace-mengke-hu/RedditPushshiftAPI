16th Day

Was never a heavy smoker. Picked up this habit when I started college, over the course of the last two and a half years, I would have smoked to the tune of 800-1000 cigarettes. I promised myself that I would stop before I was done with college.  It has been 16 days, the longest I've gone without smoking, drinking and wanking. Though I do not feel any difference physically, there is a lot of change psychologically. It always hung around there in the back of my head, bothering me. Thank you for being amazing reddit, now I shall try to pick up 3 hobbies; one that helps me stay fit, one that helps stimulate creativity, one that helps me earn some money (Thanks to reddit for this again). Stay strong friends, addiction to anything is a disease, a deadly one.

 Peace

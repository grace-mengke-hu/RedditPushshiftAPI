999.999.999 Damn Days !! (Open discussion)

Hey guys, I'm reading a lot of your posts and I want to truly congratulate each and everyone of you who managed to quit smoking. However, I'm a little bit curious on what's going on with all those numbers? I mean, well done! It's your trophy! But all these digits make me feel like the higher the number, the more difficult it gets to reach. I understand that it is nice to celebrate, I personally stopped smoking 7 months ago, but isn't it a little bit weird when other people suffer aswell right now, reading us, to see a front page full of 1023 days, 643 days, 564 days etc. Too much attention on the time period when honestly, it is not so important for somebody who struggles to quit it at the moment. I'd much rather enjoy seeing a first page full of feelings expressed and a glimpse of what drove you to quit it... Now don't get me wrong here, of course the first couple of days, or even the first couple of weeks are very difficult and you are welcome to write down all of your thoughts, your problems, what motivates you etc. and release yourself from the burden. But after, let's say 100 days just share with us your journey, or a part of your experience in the first line. Nuking people with digits is not always the best strategy. Making them find content related to their lives a little bit easier, could work better. And please, correct me if I'm wrong, I'd just really like to see the community evolve so everybody's opinion is important. Thanks.

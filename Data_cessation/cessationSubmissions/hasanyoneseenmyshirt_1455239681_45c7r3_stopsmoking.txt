weird cravings?

It been about a week since I went cold turkey. A few minor issues like coughing and still have that weird flemmy feeling in my throat. other than that it not been so rough. I do have like the weirdest craving for eggs though. I have no issue eating 4 hard boiled eggs for breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

I was wondering if you guys have any interesting or weird cravings as well(cigarettes aside, for obvious reasons)

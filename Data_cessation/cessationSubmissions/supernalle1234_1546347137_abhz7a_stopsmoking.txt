Quit caffeine (11 days in) and now smoking/snus makes me depressed, anyone else noticed something like this?

Read topic.

I chose to quit coffee and all other caffeine sources 11-12 days ago. I chose this path because I've tried quitting smoking/snus a million times and the anxiousness/jittery feeling caffeine gives me always draws me back in to cigarettes.

I also doubt that I could have quit both at the same time.

Maybe I'm depressed because of caffeine withdrawals, I was always helluva sensitive to coffee and its cousins.

So, does anything notice anything similar?

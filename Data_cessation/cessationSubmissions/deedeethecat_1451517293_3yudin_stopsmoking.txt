Scared shitless

Half an hour ago I got a call that I have a diagnosis of COPD. I am scared and cannot find a lot of information like life expectancy on the Internet, in real words.  would love to hear from anyone who has this diagnosis. I am a 38 year old woman! I can't believe I have a progressive disease. I feel like it is too young. I bet that is what everyone says.

Why I'm here? I'm quitting cold turkey. I have about three or four more cigarettes, was going to pick up more tonight, but I'm not going to do that. Wish me luck!

Today is day one....doing it the way I did it before, cold turkey, no patch, no special pills or special gums

I have slowly cut back on my daily smoking for the past few months and now I am just ready to stop.  I averaged about 7-10 cigs a day for the past few months so I have slowly been weening off.  

Look forward to chatting with you all.  best of luck

Nicotine and Tourette's, ADD, and movement disorders in general...

Hello!


Today is the first day of the last time I quit smoking. It's going well but I have taken a nicotine tablet. I have a ton of lozenges, tablets, and quickmist sprays on hand from past attempts and am right now considering whether I should turf them or use them.


I wanted to quit cold turkey but I have Tourette's and some other related disorders (ADD, dyslexia) and have a deep fear of tics getting out of hand. I was wondering if there are any here with a similar experience of having a movement disorder and quitting smoking.


Many people with movement disorders self medicate with tobacco. Nicotine really works wonders! I do however know a few people who have never used it and manage very well. I want to be one of those people but I have used nicotine for almost 30 years now. I'm heavily dependant on it! Perhaps it's physical, more so than someone who doesn't have a movement disorder, or just in my mind. This is why I'm posting. I don't want to deal with a huge increase in physical tics but I'm ok with some increase. I really don't care about physical tics as I'm quite comfortable with who I am. I'm more concerned with the mental tics or mental perseveration that is associated with things like ADD. I need to work and make a living. 


In the past I was ok with the idea of a shorter but better quality of life. Now, in my forties, I want both quality and quantity. I have never taken prescription drugs and never will. Instead, I'm using fitness, food, and self discipline with lots of love and kindness towards myself.


I have a lot of fears about giving up nicotine and was wondering if there are any here with similar circumstances that would like to share some of their experiences.


edit: the 'start smoking' story was irrelevant and a little too personal so I've deleted that part.

I've been a smoker for 3 years, I know that isn't much, but today I'm celebrating my 31st day without a cigarette, and I feel great!

I started out as a social smoker, and it quickly became a habit. At one point last year, I remember going through two packs a day, on top of Hookah and Marijuanna.

One night, as I was laying awake, unable to fall asleep - it suddenly really dawned on me. *"I could be diagnosed with lung cancer any day. I might already have it."* ... and it just shook me horribly, I felt a chill right to the bone. Never had I ever examined my own mortality so closely. That was 31 days ago. I haven't touched a cigarette since, and I want to keep going!

24 hours ago I quit.

Recently turned 18, and I've been smoking for roughly 2 to 3 years, started sophomore summer of highschool, and I'm graduating in 2 weeks.  I never had a problem with smoking, and never really wanted to quit, but my friends made me promise that I was going to quit the day of graduation.  I was dreading that day, and I knew it wasn't going to work, because you have to quit for you, and other people can't make it happen. But yesterday I decided I had to stop, it was becoming a problem.  I was smoking on my way home, with the windows down, on a cheap cigar because I was broke.  It was raining, and I wanted my nicotine fix so bad, but I won't smoke in my car with the windows up, so I was driving, got about 6 drags in, and realized that I was so addicted I was getting soaked, and soaking my car, just to get my fix.  I threw it out the window and decided to stop.  Haven't even felt the need to smoke today, hoping it goes well.
TL;DR: Smoked 3 years,  quit yesterday because I hit a new low.  Going well.

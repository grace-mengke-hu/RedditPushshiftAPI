Question about how to deal with a husband that still likes to smoke

So, I had quit for a little over two weeks. However, I was having a few issues. First, I was tired all the time. I could hardly keep  myself from yawning and I would be falling asleep at around 8. Secondly, I was having a lot of anxiety. It was starting to get a little overwhelming and i was constantly worrying and getting upset about everything.

My husband had been very supportive, but I knew that he was still smoking. He wouldn't do it around me which was an easy thing to do because he worked nights and I worked days. The problem with him came in when he would be home with me on the weekends. He would like to get a pack of smokes when we drank, and because of my anxiety he kinda encouraged me to smoke a little bit to help ease all of my freak outs. That doesn't sound very supportive, but I know it came from a good place.

For the past couple of weeks I have been smoking on and off, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to deal with a situation like this? How to deal with the sleepiness, anxiety, and a husband who will still be smoking around me?

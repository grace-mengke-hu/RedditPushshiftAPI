Clean Break

I am currently on day 4 of my clean break from all nicotine.  About 2 years ago I quit smoking tobacco cigarettes.  I was nicotine free for about 2 months with the help of wellbutrin.  I didn't really like how the antidepressant was effecting me so I stopped taking it.  I didn't go back to tobacco cigarettes but started smoking juul.  At first it was only as needed when I felt the need (when partying, stressful work times), but after a few months of that it became an every day type of usage.  I was always careful with how I used it though....never during the day, at work, or in the car.  I would only smoke it at home, after 8pm.  But I would smoke it steady for a few hours before bed.  

Anyway...I decided I wanted to be done with that too.  I finished my last pod on Sunday evening and decided that was it.  No more.  So far things have been going okay.  Weeknights are little stressful as I would normally be juul-ing (I hate saying that) at that time.  But so far those have been my only cravings.  I have worked through those with sunflower seeds and gum.  

It seems so strange to me to not be using it.  It feels the same as when I first stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes.  Now it seems so strange to me that I ever smoked tobacco cigarettes.  I cannot wait until I get to that point w/ the juul.  I know I'll get there.  I just have to be patient.  I have to take this one day at a time.  I'm ready to be done with nicotine for good.  It's so silly to me that I spent so much money on this stuff and let it control me for so many years.  No more.

This Is WAR!

I've been smoking for about 18 years, with some breaks. I most recently quit December 8, and I was doing awesome until the past week. Within the past week or two, I started to get these intense, intrusive psychological cravings, seemingly out of nowhere. 

I was winning the battle, but today I ended up buying a pack, smoking a few cigarettes, then throwing out the pack... and then later in the day, bought a pack, smoked a few and threw them out again. THIS IS CRAZY! What an insane waste of money.

I feel like for the first time, my brain is truly divided. I've never had such a hard time giving into cravings! Normally I would have just surrendered to them completely and fully resumed by habit. But I can't seem to let myself do that this time - I can't get on board with going back to smoking. Somewhere inside me is this deep, angry voice saying "NOOOOOO!!! NO NO NO!" 

I'm angry. I hated those cigarettes I smoked. They didn't help. They didn't make me feel better. The thought of being controlled by them just makes me want to scream.

I feel like its CRUCIAL that I don't give in again. If I stop now, I wont experience physical withdrawal... I'll just have the exact same psychological cravings I've been had this week BEFORE I gave in. But if I keep letting myself slip, I'll be in over my head before I know it.

Maybe this is my final battle. Maybe this is the time I'll beat this for once and for all. No more lies. No more giving in. This needs to stop. Smoking doesn't fit anymore - its not me. Its an old part of me that I need to let go. Its a broken crutch that can't hold me anymore. Using it will only further disable me. 

I can do this. Someone tell me I can do this.

How do I get rid of the romanticism?


Hi guys,

Keep trying to quit smoking this year, but never last longer than a few days/weeks. I think it’s because I haven’t been truly ready to say goodbye to cigs forever. However, my age (35.5 male) and general lifestyle (I like to keep active, swimming, gyming etc) are making it evident that I need to stop. For good. 

The thing that always brings me back is the thought of never having a cigarette with a glass of wine ever again. I see other people with a drink and a cig and I’m so jealous. I guess it also reminds me of youth too, when I was carefree and didn’t need to worry about my health. I still view a cig and a drink as a romantic, hedonistic, sun-kissed scene, one that I’m scared to never really have again. In reality of course, daily smoking is a disgusting, savage, often miserable act. But it’s those scenes in my head, a pack of tobacco on the table, a lighter and a drink whilst chatting to friends. I can’t shake it, and I’ve really tried. 

I read Allen Carr’s book recently and it did touch on this aspect of the addiction but I don’t think I was truly honest with myself when he said “you must KNOW that you’ll never have a cig again”. I didn’t know, I think I just kidded myself. I think I need to read that again. 

So anyone else have these hedonistic feelings about smoking and how you’ll never be as relaxed or as lucky as you once were or as people who are still able to smoke with their drinks? 

Thanks for any advice.

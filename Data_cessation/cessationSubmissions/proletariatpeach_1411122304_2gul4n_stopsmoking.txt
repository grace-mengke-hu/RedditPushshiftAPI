Quitting with an e-cig

First post ever, woo.
I'm around 7 days without a cigarette, but I've been using an e-cig pretty much non-stop to combat the unpleasantness. It's been working pretty well so far, my cravings are under control for the most part, despite all of my friends being smokers. The other night I went out drinking without smoking for the first time in over 5 years. So basically - has anyone else managed to quit completely by using an e-cig or is it (as most people have told me) just a way of delaying the inevitable relapse?

I've been reading this subreddit a lot and it really does help, so thanks to everyone on here.

100 Days!!

Never thought I would get this far. I still think about smoking often, I don't think that's going to go away. But the activity is out of my daily routine and it feels great.

I smoked for about 8 years and quit when I found out my wife was pregnant.

I have puffed on a cigar or two while golfing or hunting.... It's cliche but... If I can do you it, so can you. Only quit once you're absolutely ready.

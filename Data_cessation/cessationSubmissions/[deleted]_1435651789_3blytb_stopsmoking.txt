Sick of this shit.

I keep trying to quit smoking, over and over again. I really fucking want this. Every time I start again, I chainsmoke until I get a headache, then get frustrated and rip apart/throw out the pack. It's so stupid. I know it's stupid. I'm throwing money and time away, and I'm frustrating myself to no end. 

I've told my friends. My colleagues. My family. That hasn't helped.

I seem to have almost no issues / cravings making it all day at work when I'm occupied. Smoking is mostly a ritual caught up in boredom and when I'm drinking at a bar. I definitely am getting moody and craving as a result of quitting (it's been almost 12 hours, most of it spent sleeping) .... but in general, I think I can handle it.

However, I've learned that I simply cannot tolerate alcohol while quitting smoking.

Unfortunately, most of my social circle is smokers/drinkers, which makes it very hard for me to hang tough on my quit. I've read some research which indicates that if people don't change their social circle, they'll relapse within a year.

I am angry, I am frustrated, but I WILL BE VICTORIOUS.

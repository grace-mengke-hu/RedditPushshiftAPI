If you think quitting smoking is impossible, then it is.  If you think it is easy, then it is.

My two year anniversary of quitting smoking recently passed unnoticed.  My wife and I both read Allen Carr's Easyway to Quit Smoking around New Year's of 2011 and both became non-smokers on the same day.  You get to keep smoking while you read the book and there's no horror stories about cancer or any of that nonsense.  As a former smoker, I know how useless scare tactics are.

It really is about getting your mind right and this book does it.  Nobody wants to quit smoking.  What we want is to have never started in the first place; to be a non-smoker again.  My wife had smoked for about 5 years and I smoked for about 10.  Neither one of us had any cravings or negative side effects at all after reading the book.  We tell everybody it was like a magic button.  After previous failed attempts at quitting, we would say that we can't imagine not smoking for a whole day, much less for the rest of our lives.  Now, it's just the opposite, we can't believe that we were ever smokers at all.  

I estimate that we've now saved approximately $10,000.  I would give Allen Carr a kiss if I could.  Go to Amazon and read the reviews.  It's the one with over 1100 reviews if you're having trouble figuring out the right one.  It's the best $10 I've ever spent in my life.

25 Hours in! Day 1's Experience.

This is my second post.  Last night I made the declaration that I was quitting smoking once and for all.  I wanted to post an update. 

I woke up today to a little anxiety because I knew I couldn't have my morning smoke.  It's a little depressing, but I quickly moved on.  The day started off slow and I had to keep busy to keep my mind off of smoking.  Honestly, you can't keep your mind off of it.  I've come to realize you have to accept and acknowledge these intrusive thoughts and push them to the side.  It sounds strange, but it's the best way that I can explain it.

I wear a Gear S2 Smart Watch that automatically takes my pulse around once an hour when at resting.  The difference between today and yesterday is astounding.

August 18 (Smoking Day)

Minimum: 62
Average: 81
Maximum: 103

Today, August 19 (First Day of Non-Smoking)

Minimum: 62
Average: 69
Maximum: 86

Pretty crazy differences.  Throughout my entire time owning my Gear S2, I've never had an average pulse of 69.  It goes to show you what a drastic effect smoking has on your body. 

As for my mood, I'm still really excited.  It's an emotional rollercoaster but I'm not letting anything stop me.

I'll be back to post tomorrow!

Good luck to all who are quitting, as well and thank you so much for the kind support from this community on my first post.

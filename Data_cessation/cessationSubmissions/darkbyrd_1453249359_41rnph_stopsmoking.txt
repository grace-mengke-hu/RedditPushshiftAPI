fell off the wagon

tl;dr quit 2 years ago. Social smoking 3 months ago. Started bringing them home when a friend died around xmas. Just got back from the gas station after 2 good days on NRT. Sucks. :(

edit: I just came to rant, but I got a whole lot of support and wise words. Thanks friends, I'm climbing back on the wagon today

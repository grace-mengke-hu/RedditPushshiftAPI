Reading Someone's Cancer Journal

I used to say you can't scare a quit into someone, but this woman's cancer journal just might be the exception: http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Deborah.html

It's been 3 days for me, cold turkey. To say I'm doing well would be a lie, but I could be doing worse (as evidenced by what she wrote). It's long, but trust me, once you start reading, you won't even notice. Had me in tears a couple times.

I'm so sick of this addiction. This go around, I'm getting really pissed at it. Like "You m*ther f*cker, I'm so sick of your sh*t! GO AWAY!!!" It's really quit therapeutic. I am just so fed up with being weaker than the addiction. It's time for those tables to turn.

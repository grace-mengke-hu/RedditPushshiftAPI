Canadian here- Cravings always get worse in the Winter for me!

Hey. Pretty decent little subreddit you all have here.  A little background about myself; I quit smoking with much more serious intent this year at the end of september. I am 20 years old, and have been smoking on and off (heavily, not socially), since I was 14. 

I finished up a roofing job this year, and at the end of the job my lungs felt fucked. It was really hard to breathe (I'm already an asthmatic) and I decided fuck it, I need to quit. And you know what, I did! It also made it easier that I quit taking my Vyvanse under my doctor's supervision. It's fuckin hard to not smoke on amphetamines.

Anyway, I kind of needed to vent and was also just wondering if anyone else finds they actually get MORE cravings in the winter? A good smoke in the morning now would really wake me up, but my lungs and my anxiety can't handle it. I'm still using nicorette quickmist spray, and I don't plan on stopping that anytime soon.

Hope you all are staying strong and doing well.

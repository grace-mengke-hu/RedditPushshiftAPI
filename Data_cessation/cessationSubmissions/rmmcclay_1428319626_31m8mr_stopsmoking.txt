Observed A True Addict Today - It's Sobering

Yes.  Today was sitting at my favorite spot next to a creek under trees. I love to sit at a low stone table and sip water or beer and read after work and on weekends. I used to love smoking there too.  Boy did I! But the cigs are gone.  It was really really weird at first, not having them. Less weird now.   

As I sat reading tonight at dusk I saw a fellow, probably in his 40's descend to the steps creekside on stairs next to a little bridge.  Being above, I could see him but he didn't notice me.  He lit up and started smoking.  Standing.  He was puffing every 5 to 6 seconds. Then a pause... then more. Like a choo choo train!  Deep inhales, clouds of smoke, smoke on second, third and fourth exhales from one hit. 

I went back to reading.  Then looked up again and saw him still puffing like crazy.  I thought that that was too long, couldn't be one cigarette. That was correct.  He had lit another and was choo chooing that.  THEN, after smoking that down to filter he lit another one and started in on that as well... at which point he went up the stairs and crossed the bridge leaving a trail of smoke. 

I've seen people do this before international flights, but not out in nature. 

Made me glad I'm not a smoker.

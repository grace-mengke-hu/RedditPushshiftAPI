Advice for quitting after smoking for a short time

I started smoking cigarettes when I was 24, last November (I'm 25 now). 

When I started, I did it just for the heck of it, while I was in a particularly low point in life. I'd always wondered what it was like, having worked with smokers for a few years. I recognize that this is probably the dumbest, but maybe a common reason why people start. 

Anyway, I don't smoke all the time. Last time I smoked was back in December, I think. And last week, again, for no real reason, I just bought a pack and started smoking again, not really intending to do it regularly.

Long story short, I don't do it regularly, and I don't want it to be a habit. Although I know it's bad for me, I like it, and I feel guilty when I do it. I don't want it to effect my health, get cancer, etc. How did any of you effectively stop smoking for good? Any suggestions? Should I see a doctor and start an "ex-smoking" regimen?

Worried about a friend

Hey, so I'm new to this subreddit, I honestly looked for it because I wanted to post this. 

So, I was talking to a friend and he was talking to me about how he smokes a little bit when he's super stressed and how he just recently smoked with a friend. I (knowing next to nothing about smoking) became instantly concerned, I expressed my concern to him and he told me it was okay and that he didn't even smoke them "right" (what does that mean?) so he wouldn't "absorb as much". He also said that a couple cigarettes every once in a while is alright. Is that true? Also, he said that he would only smoke "a pack a year maybe". I trust him to make the right choice, but I'm still worried.

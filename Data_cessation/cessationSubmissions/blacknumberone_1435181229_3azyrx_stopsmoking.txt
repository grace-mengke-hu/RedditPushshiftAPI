5 months ciggy free and feeling spectacular - If I can do it, so can you. Trust me!

I quit smoking cold turkey 5 months ago today and it was the best decision I have ever made. I **never** want to look back. I used to be a pack-a-day smoker, heavier on the nights I would go out with friends (~3 nights a week). I loved my morning cigarette with coffee, my after dinner cigarette, and especially my smoke-break cigarettes at work. In my head, I knew I could never quit smoking...

But I have to say I've really surprised myself. I quit during a very stressful time in my life (moving across the country, away from family, no secure job, expensive city) where cigarettes normally would have been my security blanket. But after waking up coughing, scraping change jars for cig money, and not having any health insurance for a time, I decided "fuck this, what the fuck am I doing". 

I've never felt better. I don't have to take my daily asthma medication (only occasionally now b/c I'm a masochist who is allergic to cats but owns a cat), I have extra cash on hand, I'm not constantly clearing my throat, I don't stink (!!! huge one, it feels great to not smell like shit), and I've even built up the motivation to get some exercise (would have NEVER happened as a smoker). 

If I can do it - so can you. I loved smoking with all of my heart but realized it's like an abusive SO and would result in nothing good for me if I stayed in the relationship. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and move on!

Smoking a blunt led right back to smoking for me.

150 days, my longest streak ever, thought I was done for good, but I ended up smoking a blunt with a girl the other night on a stupid impulse. I got anxiety, and I hit her e-vape a few times (it had nicotine, but a really low dose.) Later that night I noticed I was still having anxiety and I was really wishing for the e-vape, instead I went off and *dug the fucking tobacco* out of the damn trash just to roll a joint out of cigarillo tobacco. I got a nice buzz, and I remember thinking, "well, it's just one cigar, and a cigar won't break my cigarette streak. Cigarettes are what count."

WRONG. Cigars have nicotine and tobacco and I'm just lying to myself. Last night I ended up buying another two packs of swisher sweets, just so while I was at the bar, I would have something to do with my hands while all anxious.

Somehow, I haven't managed to smoke a cigarette yet. But I have one more cigar left and I think I'm going to try to smoke that and call it quits and reset my counter, or just throw it away and reset it now. Either way, I'm really upset with myself. 

Does this mean that I can't smoke weed with blunt papers at all? Will blunts always have a small amount of nicotine or is it so small it's not really significant enough to make you want to smoke? Is the reason I wanted to smoke from the e-vape or the blunt wrap?

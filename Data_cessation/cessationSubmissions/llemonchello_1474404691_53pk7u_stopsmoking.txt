Cigarettes, Marijuana, and Stimulants

Let me explain my situation:
I am a 20 year old college student, taking 40mg of Vyvanse, smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day. When I'm off my meds, it is not as bad, however I still smoke relatively half a pack or more normally. I have a few friends that smoke, so there is a small amount of social pressure surrounding cigarettes. I also smoke marijuana daily. When I smoke marijuana, the cravings for a cigarette do increase, but not as bad as when I take my Vyvanse. I also do not plan to quit smoking marijuana anytime soon so this is one large issue. I have made plans to stop quitting and even taken steps to prevent myself from thinking about cigarettes, but to no avail. One thing that makes quitting even harder for me, though is driving in the car. My attention span is virtually null and void when I drive so even before I started smoking cigarettes, I would bite my nails, chew a lot of gum, anything to distract myself. This is a main issue I have with quitting. So if anyone can offer any good advice on how to quit given my situation, that would be amazing, because I feel very stuck in my situation (even though I'm not, obviously), and don't really know where to go from here. Thanks.

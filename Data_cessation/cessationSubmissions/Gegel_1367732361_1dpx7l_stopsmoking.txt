Afraid to go back !

Looking for advices from you quiters, or maybe cheering readers. Sorry in advance if the post get detailed, just feel like writing it down will help somehow. Skip to the tl;dr toward the last paragraph for the actual question if you don't feel like reading.


* Male, 25, from France. I have been smoking for ~7 years. One parent is a smoker, friends smoke, brother smoke. You know. For ~2 years now have some bad nose-throat condition. Nothing serious, mainly chronic swollen tonsils. Likely caused by other health issue, but figure out smoking is not helping. So I have been thinking about quiting. Also gf at the time is not a smoker, so she push me to lower, at the end I was smoking around 5-10 a day. Also I smoke oranic rolling tobacco with no additives, I really feel less addicted than during the years I was smoking "regular" blonds.  


* Anyway, time pass, still smoking, and finally in Feb I fly away to South Ameristralia (former Australia). Here almost no one smoke, tobacco is crazy expensive and taste gross. Plus I have to ride a bike ~25km a day, so I think it is best time to quit. After 1~2 weeks of reducing but still smoking when booze is around, I finally throw the shit away. Was a month ago. Feel better on the bike. Feel better not being the akward only smoker. Feel better reduced snoring, sleep apnea and stuff. Sometimes I want to smoke again, but it's ok, can deal with it. Feel kind of proud.  

* Only bad thing is I easily "got" habbits. During my time here get addicted to bike, not a problem, feel like it's helping. On the other side I started to eat junkfood (I have always been kind of addicted to food, eating a lot and usually meat+ pasta/potato+sauce, this kind of stuff, but normally not between meals). Also drinking every night. I deal easy with no nicotin, but I miss "the act". Feels bad because was doing well the past few months back home, eating way healthier than I used to do, and almost never drinking since being single in Sept. Now eating candy almost daily, and drinking a ~1 bottle liquor a week. I don't think it is big concern for now, but kind of kill my good mood from not smoking.



**tl;dr** I have been abroad for 3 month. Quit smoking a month ago. Started junk food between meals + drinking. At least doing lot of biking/hikking, which help a bit.

* I am going back home soon, and I know being in a familiar environement, with way more smokers (and no bike !) will make it hard, specially because my tobacco addiction was more social than anyhing else. I am confident I will deal with the junk/food drinking thing, but how can I resist going back to smoking?

Dear redditors, any help/cheering you could providing me with about this issue?



*Sorry about the potato english, hope it was not too much of a pain to read*

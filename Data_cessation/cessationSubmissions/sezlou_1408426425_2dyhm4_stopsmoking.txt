Beat those cravings!! These are some tips I've found useful :)

Dunno if these will work for others or help anyone, but I've found them to be lifesavers when the cravings have hit. Sometimes you have to try a few different techniques til you find something that works for you. Here's a list of how Ive stayed smoke free so far:
- taking a couple of deep breaths, really focussing on the action of taking air in and expelling it (cliche I know, but it seriously helps!!)
- blasting some upbeat music and dancing round the room until I'm out of energy
- walking around outside, in fresh air, just enjoying nature, but not near any smokers of course
- chewing super sweet lollies, sucking on a powerful mint or sipping a strong tea to overwhelm my taste buds
- play 'thinking' games such as sudoku or something else that requires a lot of mental focus and will take up all your attention
- have a conversation with someone and lose yourself in the chat until you've forgotten about smoking
- looking up ideas for what to buy with all the money saved since quitting!
If you're struggling its worth giving some of these a shot, hopefully they will help someone!! Good luck guys :)

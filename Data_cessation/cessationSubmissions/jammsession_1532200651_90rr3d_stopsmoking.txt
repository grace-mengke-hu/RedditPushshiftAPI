Back at home, this is hard

I stopped smoking 7 days ago cold turkey. I was on vacation and had enough going outside a hotel to smoke. First day was ok. Lot of cravings but not too bad. Second and third day were an absolute nightmare. I got very depressed, had a fight with my SO. I had a very pessimistic outlook on everything in live. Then it got better. My mood lightened up and I can smile again. But now I am back at home and the cravings are back. It is so strange not to smoke after I had a coffee. I even went on the balcony just to realize that I donâ€™t smoke anymore.
English is not my native language, hope you can understand what I mean.

First day but 1000th try!

I've tried quitting so many times in the past but by the time the evening rolls round I always cave and have 'just one'. Well after watching the Pokemon guy for the past 120 days I'm done with smoking. Seeing all your posts and how motivational you all are gives me hope! Good luck guys! We got this! 👍

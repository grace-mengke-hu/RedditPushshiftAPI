My day to shine. 1 year today :)

Never thought it will become so easy after sometime. Day 1 vs Day 365. So much different and comforting. 8th Jan 2016 was the day I completed Allen Carr's Easy way and smoke my last cigarette. Never looked back since. Now, even if someone put a gun to my head and ask me to smoke, I'd pass ;)  
Stay strong fellow ex-smokers.

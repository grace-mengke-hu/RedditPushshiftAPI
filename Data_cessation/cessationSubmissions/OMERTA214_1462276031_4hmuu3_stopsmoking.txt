1 year ! Lets go!

Did not even realize that my one year quit anniversary had passed 9 days ago. I'm at the point where I rarely remember that I was almost a pack a day smoker. My lungs feel fantastic, my morning cough has disappeared, and I have much more money in my wallet every week to spend on things I enjoy. 

For everyone starting their quitting journey, I beg you to just get through the first couple weeks or so. It does get easier with time. Before you know it you'll be shocked that a year has gone by just as I am. YOU have to want it though. I finally succeeded when I quit because I truly wanted to be done with them...and not because my parents, or friends, or girlfriend thought I should. Do it to better yourself. If anyone has any questions or just needs some advice on coping methods that helped me, shoot me a message. I quit cold turkey. 

Good luck guys and gals!

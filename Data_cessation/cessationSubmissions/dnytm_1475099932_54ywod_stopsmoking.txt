Finally quitting

Started when I was 16, few months from 29 and finally quitting. Smoked a pack a day for 10 years of my time smoking. Listened to Allen Carr book and decided to quit for real this time. Have tried a few times over the years but never made it past a day or 2. Only been 8 hours so far this time and already feeling pretty terrible, stomach in knots and anxious (already have an anxiety disorder which ain't helping), lethargic, hard to focus. Any advice to chill all that out would be appreciated. Last thing I want is a cigarette but at the same time I do hate feeling all these symptoms and even tho smoking wouldn't help much it'd do more than nothing.

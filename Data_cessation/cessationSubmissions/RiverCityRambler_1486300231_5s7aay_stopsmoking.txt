30 years old, smoked for 12 years... 36 hours into quitting and just need to say it so someone holds me to it.

I've tried quitting about five times in the last year and have caved after not looking for any support or push back... Just wanted somewhere to get it on record so that I can hopefully stick to my guns this time.

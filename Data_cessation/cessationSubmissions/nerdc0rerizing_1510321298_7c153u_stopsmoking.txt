Happy 3 weeks!

This is definitely the longest I've ever quit, my sense of smell and taste are way better, I don't tire as easily, I snap out of bed in the morning with so much energy. Not to mention most of my withdrawal symptoms &amp; side effects are gone minus a few mouth ulcers and acne which hit me a bit late.

Cravings hit only a few times a day and they're manageable.

I don't see myself going back to smoking. Looking forward to learning more benefits. Just really happy the hell of the first two weeks is over.

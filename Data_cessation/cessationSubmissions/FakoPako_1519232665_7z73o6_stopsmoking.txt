782 days...wow

How fast time goes by. Unreal. Just little over 2 years ago I was smoking a pack a day and dreaming of quitting. I tried everything... gum, Alan Carr, patches. Nothing worked as best as good old cold turkey!

After 23 years of smoking....I don't even think about it anymore. This stuff absolutely stinks to me and I can't imagine ever smoking again. 

Stick to it. It's a wonderful thing not to smoke!

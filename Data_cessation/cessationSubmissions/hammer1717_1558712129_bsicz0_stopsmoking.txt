Anybody have success juuling there way to stopping smoking?

I've been a smoker for a bit over six years and I just moved and wanted to quit. I was nervous about quitting cold turkey so I got a juul and have been using only that for about two weeks. The problem is that I feel like I'm becoming more dependent on nicotine as a result. Im able to juul more often than I was able to smoke and I just feel like I'm giving up one bad habit for another (albeit less smelly) one. Has anybody here been successful cutting nicotine out of their life by using vapes to slowly cut themselves off and if so, do you have any tips?

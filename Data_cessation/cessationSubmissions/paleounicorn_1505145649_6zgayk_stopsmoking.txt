When did you feel a difference in your chest?

I started my quit with vaping in about 2 days time my chest felt like I had someone squeezing them/an elephant on it. I chilled with vaping after a week since I read a lot of people have chest trouble. At this point I was scared went to the doctors said everything was fine in my X-ray might be anxiety. The next few weeks I would take a huff of my vape maybe a day. Then 3 weeks ago I threw it away. My chest isn't as bad since when I first started but it still feels like someone is squeezing it a little/heavy still. I'm 71 days cigarette free, anyone having this issue 2.5 months in? If so when did it chill out for good? 

Ps. I've never had anxiety issues before or really after smoking.

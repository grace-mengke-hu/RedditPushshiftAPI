What's the most important thing to remember when quitting?

I've been smoking for just over 4 years now, and I really want to quit. I've tried multiple times, but I always end up buying another pack and telling myself it'll be the last one. Over the past 3 years, I'd say the longest I've gone without a cigarette is one week. I'm smoking almost a pack a day now.

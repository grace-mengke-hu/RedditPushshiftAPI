How I quit

A week ago I made a lightly intoxicated deal with a good friend (who is also in the process of quitting). The first person who smokes has to make cocktails to order for all the guests in a pink ballet dress during a party which the winner must throw. A lot of people are going to be present whoever wins this... Anyway I drafted a quick contract on my phone and we signed it. I think I've made it legally binding.

I've been wanting and trying to quit since a year or two. If one of us fails I will be back with pictures.

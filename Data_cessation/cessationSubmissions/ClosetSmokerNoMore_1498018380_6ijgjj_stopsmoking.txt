Six Days

Ok this is so hard. I have been a "secret" smoker for five years. It started with smoking while traveling (it doesn't count if I'm in Paris!) to when I was home alone and stressed about work deadlines...then somewhere along the line it became something that controlled me. 

I've been using nicotine tabs since last Thursday and doing OK, but the urge is there when I get a call from my best friend and want to sneak outside and chat with her and light up, or something stressful happens. To the outside world I look incredibly healthy and you would never think I'm a smoker. I exercise regularly but at a crazy diminished capacity. I'm sick of lying and I worry that at my age (45) I've already ruined my heart and lungs. I want to feel good again and I'm worried I'll go a few weeks, then convince myself just one won't hurt and undo everything.

Day 43- I can finally breathe properly again!

Feels incredible. Ya know, breathing is something you take for granted and likely aren't aware of at all times. Probably any smoker can relate to this. Smoked for roughly 8 months, about 4-6 a day. I'd wager to say that I'm pretty much off them entirely at this point, and I hope to be forever.

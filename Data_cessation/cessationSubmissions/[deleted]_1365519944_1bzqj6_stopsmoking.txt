Struggling to find a job has me convinced that I should start smoking again. These cravings are so pathetic.

I can't believe I've gone 112 days, and only now do I want to light up.

Seriously folks, the associations we make between stress relief and nicotine are nasty.  I think I'll be able to survive without caving, but just wanted to share a cautionary tale (and make myself feel slightly more responsible for my actions).

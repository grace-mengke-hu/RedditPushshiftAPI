Desire after 15 days

Hello guys, 

 This is my best time stopping smoke, I went 25 days easily without any desire (I got drunk and people were smoking in this period many times).

 Yesterday I was with some friends and they were smoking, when I smelled the smoke, I wanted it so bad, the desire was killing me, but I didnt smoke.

My question: Why did it only happen after 25 days? Any advice to suppress it again?

Thanks guys, keep strong!

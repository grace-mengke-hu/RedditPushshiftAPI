From involuntary break to QUITTING

I went 36 hours without a smoke. First time that's happened in months. I knew today I'd be able to buy more tobacco, but I had spent much of the past 36 hours reading posts on r/stopsmoking, and so today I have decided not to buy tobacco.

For the longest time, every pack I buy is "the last", and I inevitably buy another after. **I make the choice** every single time to continue smoking. Now after lurking around on this subreddit for a couple days, seeing so many of you make the better choice, the only sane choice, it has inspired me to join yous. 

So here I am on day 2. If I start smoking again, it will be my choice. And it's one of the dumbest choices a person can make, to smoke.

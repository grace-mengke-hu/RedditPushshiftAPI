Got a new phone

So I upgraded to a new phone yesterday, and it meant that I had to redownload my Quit app. I went to download it and realized I wasn't even sure what my quit date was. Decided not to bother.

It's been two and a half years, I think it's time to duck out of the app and this sub! It's been a great support for me over the years. Good luck to everyone! It gets easier.

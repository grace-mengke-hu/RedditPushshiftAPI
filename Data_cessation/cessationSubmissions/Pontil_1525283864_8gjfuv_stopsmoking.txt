Warning: YOu're never safe!

I am two days into my quit. I'm psyched to be giving it another go but if I had been stronger 20 months ago this never would have happened. 
I quit in 2009, cold turkey, after a pack a day habit for 20 years. I went seven years without so much as one drag until October 2016, when wife and I went to England and then Italy. In Brighton England one night I got hammered and decided I really, really wanted a smoke. Just one. That was all I smoked on that trip but when I got back home, I had another at a Halloween party a few weeks later. From then on, my resolve broke and I was soon back to the old habit. Twenty months later, and here I am. Crazy.
Let my failure be a warning: Even if you have years in, you have to remain vigilant! For people like me, who cannot just casually smoke, feeling like we've beaten cigarettes and can have "just one"  is a dangerous lie.

Good luck all!

The past 36 hours have been hell...

So, I'm just a week into quitting. Before Friday night, everything was going pretty great. I'm using a patch, and other than eating a lot more because of an oral fixation, things have been manageable. Cravings have been about 5 minutes long, a couple of times a day.  
  
On Friday, I had a relatively stressful night. Nothing major, just some financial complications. Since then, instead of brief, intense cravings, I have had a constant craving for a cigarette.  
  
No matter what I'm doing, in the back of my mind there is a lingering ^^^smokesmokesmokesmokesmokesmokesmokesmokesmokesmokesmoke track running. I can't seem to make it go away, and it's getting worse. I've been going through altoids and sunflower seeds to the point that my mouth is raw, and can't seem to get it off my mind.  
  
Accompanying this craving is a sense of panic, both that I won't be able to quit (I posted a screenshot of my quit app on facebook, so failure means ridicule from all sides), and that I won't be able to smoke again. The only things that have kept me from lighting up so far have been fear of ridicule and lack of access to cigarettes. I had to leave for work 2 hours early this morning to get out of the apartment and away from the pack my roommate keeps stashed in his desk.
  
What can I do?

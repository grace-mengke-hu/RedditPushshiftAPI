Smoking brings me out of the present moment.

When I was younger, I wish someone told me how much smoking takes you out of the present moment. I feel like i would have understood better if someone had told me
"Smoking will make you want anything but what you currently have".
Instead I was bombarded with images and ideas of the future, a concept so hard to grasp. In fact, all the ideas that smoking would be bad for my future health are what kept me smoking in the present moment. 
Now, 11 days smoke free, I feel present. I am not wanting something imaginary. I am no longer unfulfilled, seeking fulfillment through external means.

Good luck to you all, I hope you witness some enlightening changes.

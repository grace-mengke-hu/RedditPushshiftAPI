3 weeks

I have hit the 3 weeks, next thing I know I will have my month!

yesterday was interesting as I went for a tattoo appointment. My artist is a smoker and we used to take breaks every hour during my appointments. 

So yesterday I went over and we still did the smoke breaks. But I had no urge to smoke with him, I enjoyed just going outside and breathing and the break from the pain. 

So there is another trigger/regular smoking activity I can now get through no problem!

I keep feeling better everyday! And I love being able to come post here and chat with people going through the same stuff. This has really helped! Everyone in this subreddit is awesome!

Chantix scares me

So, I'm 31. Been smoking since I was 18 (stupidest decision I've ever made). I fluctuate between half and 3/4 pack a day, sometimes a full if I'm out drinking or its a really stressful day at work.  Tried quitting a handful of times before with varied success. Went in for a physical this past week and talked with the doc about quitting smoking. Got a prescription for chantix filled with instructions to ramp down my habit to 1/2 pack a day, then start the pills. 

In the past, I've had some issues with depression. Nothing major like suicide attempts or staying in bed for days, but just a general "meh" feeling towards life. It hasn't effected my day to day life in a while, but doing research online, it seems like Chantix could mess you up something fierce. 

I've got the script filled, but am scared to start taking it because I'm worried about violent mood swings, suicide attempts, and the like. How common are they? Do I just ask my friends/family to check in on me daily?

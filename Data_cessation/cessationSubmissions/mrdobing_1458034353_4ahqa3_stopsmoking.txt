How ridiculous is smoking?

Shivering out in the rain, clutching onto a soggy smelly glued together plant. Inhaling that toxic smoke into your lungs to feel 'good'.  

Just how stupid is smoking when you take a min to actually look at it. I mean why are we humans - intelligent, superior and evolved beings, exchanging hours of our working life for tools that give you even less hours in your life?  

And no, I'm not high! Haha. Didn't want to sound high and mighty but just a showerthought.

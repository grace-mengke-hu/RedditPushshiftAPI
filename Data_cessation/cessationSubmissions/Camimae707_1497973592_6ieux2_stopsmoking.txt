21st birthday exception?

TL;DR Should I let my boyfriend smoke on his 21st birthday as a "21st experience" exception?

My boyfriend has been smoking since he was 10, and has tried to quit for me on and off since we met when we were 15. I've only been around for a couple weeks-couple days at a time so he never stopped for longer than that and would smoke again when I left again. Now we're officially dating and we both turn 21 in July. I probably won't drink for my 21st because I come from a family of alcoholics and I already went through my party stage, and he told me that before we started officially dating recently that he was dependent on alcohol, so he probably won't drink much aside from his 21st birthday. It's already a big step for me to be ok with him getting drunk, and he knows that. He asked how I would feel if he smoked on his 21st too so he could have the whole 21st birthday experience, and I don't know what to say.

I feel like if you quit, you quit. No exceptions. If you make an exception, it's easier to make other exceptions and keep smoking. BUT it's his birthday, and the first birthday we'll be spending together since we've been 15 AND the first birthday he'll have a girlfriend to celebrate with. I want it to be perfect for him.

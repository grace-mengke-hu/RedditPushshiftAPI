Quit smoking on October 28 2015 at exactly 5:32pm.

This is my first real attempt at quitting after a miserable 10 years. I was young and stupid and after hearing my 2 children beg me to stop, yesterday was the tipping point when my daughter told me her friends at school tell her she smells. I feel like such a piece of shit for every cigarette I ever lit in the house with my kids around, I almost broke down and cried when she told me what happened. 

Ironically I had just purchased a pack before deciding to change my life and proceeded to throw them into the trash can. I'm 27 and I'm seriously worried that father time is going to catch up to me, or that I'll be outside having a smoke break for a big moment in one of my children's lives...

I'm finally willing to put forth the effort to end this habit and I'm fortunate I found a place like this to see that others are in the same boat as me. Stay strong people, and thank you for taking the time to read this.

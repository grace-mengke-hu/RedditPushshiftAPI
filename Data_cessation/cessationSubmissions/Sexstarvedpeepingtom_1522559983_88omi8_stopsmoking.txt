Really bad but of chest pain scared me straight, quitting smoking for good

Im 29, been smoking daily since 13. The past 3 months, I've felt my BP rise when I'd smoke, and afterwards I'd have palpitations and bad chest pain. I really didn't put much thought into it. Well, tonight it was worse. I had my previous bed cig, was laying down drifting off and woke up in EXTREME chest pain. My heart beat felt irregular, i felt nauseum and light headed, and I had extreme pain In the middle of my chest. It lasted maybe 30 seconds, but i spent the past 20 mins breathing slowly and trying to calm my pulse.

I've been wanting to quit for years. Tired of it basically. Just every time I talked myself out of it (just smoke 10 today. Oh hell 11 won't hurt etc.) I can finally say I'm done. I smoked heavily. Anywhere from 20 to 40 a day. Every half hour I'd light up. Tonight that all stops. I threw away what I had, my ashtrays, my backup tunes and tobacco, all of it besides my lighters (I'm a medical weedsmoker, legal)

So it's now midnight, (i know what day it is, but this ain't no April fools), and I'm doing my best to try and go back to sleep as I do have to pull a 12 hour shift tomarrow. I'll fill you in on this post after work to let you know how I'm doing. They say the first three days is the worst. But I stopped shooting meth cold turkey, I can do this

Edit: I didn't wanna ask this to not make the post super long, but I do have a couple of questions.

1: what helped you until the physical withdrawls stopped? Would you say the physical withdraws was the worst or the mental cravings? 

2: obviously if it's cancer or heart disease or something like that, the body can clean and heal itself. How long does it take until your breathing goes back to normal and you can cough all the crap out?

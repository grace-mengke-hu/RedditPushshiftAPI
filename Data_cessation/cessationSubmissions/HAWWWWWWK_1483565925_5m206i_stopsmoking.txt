Issues with coughing more now that you have quit?

I haven't hit the two week mark quiet yet, but yesterday and today I have been almost nonstop coughing. I don't feel sick in anyway, other this annoying dry cough. I was wondering if anyone else had something similar, and how long did you have to deal with it?

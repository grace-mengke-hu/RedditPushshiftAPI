It took a lot to get hear, and I have had a twinge or two. But here is what is making it worth while. My wife, whom still smokes lost her pack and I saw that panicked look in her eye. I thought to my self oh my god, I remember that feeling. Thank god I don't have to go through that anymore. I even found those smokes later for her and got to be her...hero? But that's what's waiting for those of you with less time in. Those sweet little moments that remind you, you can be free.

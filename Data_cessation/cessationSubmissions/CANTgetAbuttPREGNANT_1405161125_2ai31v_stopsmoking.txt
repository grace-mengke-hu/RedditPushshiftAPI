How I quit

 I came down with a freak medical problem that required emergency surgery, and I was literally stuck in bed and not supposed to get out for minimum of 3 weeks.  I used this time to reflect on my life, and what I wanted to get out of it.  I also thought how terrible it was being stuck in bed, and how if I kept smoking then this was going to be my future at some point or another.  All thanks to this unrelated medical problem, I found the mental power to quit once and for all. I'm now 6 weeks off the sticks, and I'm finally over the urges and the cravings.  I can even hang around my smoker friends and not have the urge to take it up again.  The first 3 weeks were the worst, but it gets easier.  I'm proud of my accomplishment, and I hope you all find the motivator that does it for you.  I've tried to quit many times without making it more than 2 weeks.  Finally I have the determination to stay healthy.  Best of willpower and self discovery to you all.

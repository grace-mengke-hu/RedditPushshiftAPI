Almost 48 hours in and craving bad.

I didn't quit out of a desire too but the necessity that is a wicked throat infection that I don't want to get worse and it hurts so bad anyways a cig would be miserable. I'm getting cravings now and don't know how to handle them. I've been thinking about quitting for a while now and know that I might as well do it now. After a few days of not being able to anyways. Any tips?

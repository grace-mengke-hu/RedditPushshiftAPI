Feeling sick after 60 days no smoking

Today is my 60th day not smoking after 5 years at half a pack a day sometimes more. Anyways I've had a TERRIBLE sore throat coming up on almost two days. So much phlem, I'll wake up and I can feel it just sitting in my throat ready to be horked out. I'm really starting to worry about my throat, did i really do some terrible damage or am i just sick? Not sure what to do or how long to wait until I see a doctor.

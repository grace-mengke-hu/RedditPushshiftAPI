Day 11, woke up and the thought of smoking disgusted me!

HOLY POOP I AM SO EXCITED.

I woke up this morning in a haze of antihistamines (yay allergy season), desiring my Dunkin Donuts iced coffee to wake me up. Usually a thought of a cigarette floats into my mind, but this morning when I thought about it, I was actually repulsed! That hasn't happened since before I started smoking, back when I couldn't understand why anyone would want to smoke. 

I feel like I'm making great progress. The cravings are almost gone, and I hope I can continue to condition myself to find smoking repulsive!

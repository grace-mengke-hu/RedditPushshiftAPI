Left side of face and tongue numb after cigarette, normal?

Hello people. So, I quit smoking about 5 years ago, after about a pack a day habit for 20 years. I've had a couple here and there when drinking over the years, but maybe a total of a pack or so in that 5 years. 

This last week was one of those times when I indulged (embarassingly) in a few.  


Today, I had a couple shots of whiskey and went out on my balcony for a couple puffs off the end of a cigarette I found from the other day (I had poured water over the rest of my pack and threw it away, but found this one less-than-half a smoke stashed away), and almost immediately upon smoking it, I felt the entire left half of my face go slightly numb, and the left half of my tongue went almost entirely numb. It scared the shit out of me, but it went away within a few minutes.   


I remember when I was a kid and had just started smoking, I used to have to regularly lay down for a moment afterwards because I would feel dizzy and slightly numb. I am 40 years old now, and I think this has scared me enough to make it something I really don't want to do again.   


I guess I'm just curious as to whether or not anybody else here has ever had anything like this happen, and/or if you think I am in any real immediate danger; or is this par for the course when you're not used to smoking?   


I realize the best thing to do is ask a doctor, but it's been over an hour since the 'episode' and I feel completely fine now, but I'm still curious as to what some of you here might have to say about your own experiences/ideas/advice?   


Thanks! :)

There are many places very close to you.  I quit smoking on October 13th, 2013.  My father was off of nicotine soon after, after a collapsed lung, which gave doctors time to notice beginning stages of lung cancer, which they were able to treat.  He was in the hospital when the shit finally had hit the fan.  His only daughter's marriage took place at that time and we had to manage two ceremonies just so he could walk her down the aisle... with a tube in his chest and a nurse behind his back, in a "religious ceremony area" on the first floor of the hospital.  He was unable to give her the father-daughter dance she deserved until he made it out.  My sister's husband is now nicotine free thanks to this *miracle treatment*.  I just took my aunt, one of the most stubborn women you could ever meet.  I took her.  I took her because I could not sit with the secret in my lap, knowing that she too could miss her daughter's big day.  

"That is interesting!"  "I just wish I would have done this sooner"  "I knew that there had to be something to this with how you talked about it" "I feel very good...that's so strange"

It's real.  They all say the same thing.  Get treated.  You *feel* true results before you go out the door.

Takes thirty minutes.  Cost me $100 dollars.

I paid for my aunt's treatment with a BIG smile on my face.

I'm not a salesmen.  I typed this up because there's a chance that just one of you still looking to break through will try it.  I promise you it works.  If a million of you try it and fail, PM me.  I will not register another Reddit account and Reddit is my only addiction now.

Cold turkey, I'm gonna come back to the post again tomorrow the day after and the day after(3 days).

This post is a hinge for me, to hold myself accountable. Playing football(no the american version) has never been hard except now after not playing it during the summer break. and its been really hard the last few days in training. I cant read through books on quitting or watch videos but going to stop right now. If I fail I don't know what Im gonna do but hopefully I dont. 

See ya tomorrow guys.

I can smell cigarette smoke from easily 100ft now.

It's like I'm a fucking shark and there's blood in the water.

I can't believe I couldn't smell it before. 9 days. Going strong. Don't want to smoke. I'm down to like, one nicotine lozenge a day now.

My eye infections cleared up, and my lungs are done spewing out tar. Still got a bit of a cough, but it's tapering off.

So desperate to quit. (Asthma)

I've been smoking an average of a pack a day for about 4 years. I'm 22 years old, and I have asthma. The past few months my asthma has gotten very extreme on two different occasions. Both times, I quit smoking for a few days and was completely dependent on an emergency inhaler and a nebulizer. I said I would never smoke again. Then I have one... and all of the sudden I'm back to a pack a day.




My asthma is so bad I have trouble sleeping at night. I can't run around and play with my puppy. I'm a normal weight, but I can't get in shape. 




What's really motivating this post... I nearly had an asthma attack during sex last night. Let me reiterate, I'm 22 years old.




I've quit hard drugs and have nearly 8 months clean from everything between heroin and weed. So I know how I quit addictive substances... motivation, sincerity, honesty and support. 




It's really hard. Every single one of my friends smoke. My boyfriend smokes too. He actually started again when I moved in with him 6 months ago after having 3 months without nicotine. He's much older than I am and I'm afraid if he keeps smoking, he won't be able to watch our children grow up.




I'm afraid I'm going to have an asthma attack and die... last night was so terrifying. 




On top of all that... I spend like $180 on cigarettes a month.... and I'm too poor to even buy food. 






I really need support. I have 11 hours.

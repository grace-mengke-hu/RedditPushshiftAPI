Too soon for a party tonight?

* I'm on hour 22 of a cold turkey quit (i.e. no nicotine whatsoever).
* Around hour 28 I have the option of going to a house party. Fairly chill folks in their late 20s.
* There will be alcohol but no active smokers that I am aware of.
* However, I will be arriving and leaving with someone who vapes. He knows not to allow me to borrow it and might be open to leaving the vape at home.

So:

1. Should I go in the first place?

2. Should I try some exposure therapy and drink a beer or two (to make sociability easier) but refrain to touch any nicotine?

3. Should I go with the expectation that I will not use nicotine or alcohol?


Thoughts?

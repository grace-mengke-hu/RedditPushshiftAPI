I'm a drunk smoker.

This has been the pattern for the past 10 years. I'm out with my friends/ colleagues, I'm at a birthday party, bar or club and I'm pretty drunk. Although I have a great time when I'm drunk, I feel like I loose my ability to act sensibly and I let go of my responsibilities. I think "ah, screw it, I'm gonna have a cigarette". 

When I wake up the next morning I feel AWFUL about what I did, I'm back to 'day 1 of quitting' again and I just want to go back in time and tell myself not to do it. I never really have a craving to smoke when I'm sober. Only when I've had 5 or more beers.

Does anyone have any tips? I enjoy drinking and it allows me to 'come out of my shell' a bit and have an enjoyable night with friends and colleagues. I don't really want to cut down or stop drinking, its quite seldom I do it. Should I write a note to my drunk self and keep it in my pocket? Should I train my mind to simply say 'no'? I wish I could speak to my drunk self and say "look, you can have a good night without that", "enjoy the company of your friends".

There is no such thing as 'just one cigarette', I want to be free I want to NOT want one when I'm out. I don't want to smell of smoke and wake up with a mouth like an ashtray. If anyone else was a 'social/ drinking smoker' Let me know what you did to avoid smoking when drinking.

I Made 100 Days

Just a quick post... I don't post that much. I wanted to let this community know how I feel 100 days out. My blood pressure is in the normal range, and I feel generally better. I am so glad that I quit smoking. I realize that from time to time, triggers will happen, and I will have to live with this for the rest of my life. But those urges will get weaker and weaker with time. I like my new normal.

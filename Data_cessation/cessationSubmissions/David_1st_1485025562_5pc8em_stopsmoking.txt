some people are belittling my quit attempt.

I love this community, I have never written on this blog, but I often come here to read words of encouragement and apply them to myself, so thought I would share today's struggle. 

I use the 'smoke free' app, today's goal (day 29) was to text your most supportive friend and thank them. 

Unfortunately I found it tough to think of anyone. I have many dear friends, all wonderful people. Does anyone else find that people can be unknowingly inconsiderate or blinded when it comes to ex-smokers? I have tried and failed to quit many times before, but this time is different, yet I keep hearing... 'Oh, this again', or getting a few jabs and jokes. I have friends that have never smoked; who are glad to hear I quit, but are by no means impressed. Then I have people who I quit with, who have started again, and have encouraged me to smoke when we are drunk as a joke. Then after I refuse, they really flirt with their cigarette to make me jealous. 

Don't get me wrong, I have a sense of humour, and I give as much as I take so I am not criticising my friends.

It is just difficult to be incredibly proud of it and for no one to recognise it as an achievement.

Rant over, just curious to see if anyone has shared my experiences. I don't want to end this post on a bad not... So, regardless of the nay Sayers, I will stick to this! I am doing this 100% for me and I don't need anyone else to be proud of me cause I am damn proud of myself. :-)

One year

Feels awesome to be honest. Smoked from 18-21 pretty regularly then was occasional. I vaped for the first week or two. My run times and cardio are muchhh better now and I saved a ton of money not smoking those rudeboys all the time. Just wanted to make a post for myself and encourage everyone else to stay strong, yo!

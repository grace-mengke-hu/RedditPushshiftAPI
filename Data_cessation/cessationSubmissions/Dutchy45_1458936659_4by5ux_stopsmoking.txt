No more Champix

So I decided to stop taking Champix yesterday. 3 weeks should be enough. It's probably my addicted brain but I've felt a mild sort of craving today. I'm curious how i'll be feeling tomorrow. If I have serious cravings I won't hesitate to go back to using Champix. Still, so far so good. I want this to work and end my addiction. Good luck to all you quitters out there.

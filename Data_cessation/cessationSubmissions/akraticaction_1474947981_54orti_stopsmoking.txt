Looking for advice on quitting smoking before I start

Hey Reddit, first time poster here,

I began smoking casually around 7-8 months ago when I arrived in a foreign country for an exchange. At first it was strictly a habit that I indulged in when I was drinking with my friends, some of which are full time smokers. I enjoy the social aspect of getting away from a party to have a smoke and conversation with my friends or as a way to get to know new people. Then I began smoking when I was smoking weed with my friends, which is probably 3-5 times per week, as a way to increase the high. Now I find myself craving a cigarette in the evenings and have been smoking 1-2 cigarettes alone on nights where I am not doing anything else. I do not crave cigarettes when I am otherwise distracted with classes or another activities, and do not smoke in front of others except in the contexts I mentioned above. While I do not yet consider myself a full time smoker, I realize I am in real danger of starting on a more frequent basis. I’m a bad procrastinator, which shows that I have self-control problems in other parts of my life which I am afraid could translate into having a real hard time quitting if I get too far down this rabbit hole. I already told myself I was going to go back to only smoking while drinking, but found myself having another cigarette tonight. 

I’m really worried about this turning into a full time habit, and could use some advice. What are some strategies I can use to quit before this gets bad? Do I need to just grow a pair, or are there any things I can do to make it easier? As you can see I spend a lot of time with people who smoke, and I often tell myself it can’t hurt to just have a couple. I can feel the nicotine beginning to have a hold on me. Any tips or advice are greatly appreciated.

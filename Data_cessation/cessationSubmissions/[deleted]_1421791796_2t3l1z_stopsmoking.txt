I hate making up titles!

^I really do. 

This was my day. Sleep, watch TV, sleep, long soak in the tub. Went to the store, was happy that I didn't have to stand in line at the customer service desk to buy a pack. Went to get my kid from school. And now I am on here, typing away another craving. Day 1ish....I think going good so far. Drinking a lot of water (which is awesome because I hate water). So, during your first few days did you want to sleep a lot?

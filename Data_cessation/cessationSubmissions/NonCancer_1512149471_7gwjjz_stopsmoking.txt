Helpful trick to help with nicotine cravings.

Cravings are psychological.  So what better way to battle them than with a psychological trick. I was a smoker nearly 20 years and this helped alot along with the three Nicotine Patch steps. 

When you want/crave a cigarette, close your eyes and pretend (it helps to envision in your imagination) to shake salt from a shaker onto your tongue. The visual stimulation can make you actually taste salt due to the memory of its distinctive 'flavour' on your palette while also stimulating Nicotine receptors in the brain. 


This 'trick' can work anywhere, from at home to at work in a crowded office.  The key is strong visual imaginative thinking.  For whatever reason, women seem to respond more.  A good tip I was taught is to try humming softly to drown out nearby noise (ie on a crowded bus). 

That's it!  Hope it helps you all as much as it helped me!

Reminder to self: your still in control

Still haven't smoked and finding I'm still having to use a lot of will power. It's cold here in London and I seem to see everyone with a cigarette in their hands. I feel like I'm being stalked by cigarettes everywhere I go and it's driving me mad! I have given myself a pat on the back though. Been out drinking and socialising and still haven't smoked even though I have been around smokers and feeling stressed recently.

I can't go back. I have to keep marching forward. I am an addict and I choose no longer to be.

T-Minus 1.

longtime lurker. quit day is tomorrow (July 5) for my wife and I. We've quit for several months a couple of times before and nearly killed each other in the process. 

nothing compares to two addicts feeding off of each others failures. I'm concerned that since she's no longer working, and spends pretty much all day around the house that she'll just be hiding it from me, which knowing myself, I'll quickly figure out, and then find those secret smokes.

any advice on tricks to motivate one another would be awesome. either way, wish us luck.

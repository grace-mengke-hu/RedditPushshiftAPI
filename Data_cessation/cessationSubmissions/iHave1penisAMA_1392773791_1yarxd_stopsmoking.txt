Okay so this is advice that won't help you quit cold turkey but helped me go from a pack a day to 4 a day!

Hello smokers of Reddit. I know quitting is muy dicifil and I wish you all the best. Anyway, this is something I started doing last year and it has helped me go from smoking a pack a day to 4 now. (Sometimes when I'm out drinking I'll snag an extra or two but it is typically 4 a day). Anyway what I did was I saved an empty pack. Then when I went out and bought my next pack I took the empty pack and I put 8 cigarettes in it. Then when I went out that day I left the pack with 12 at home in a dresser drawer where (with pure will power) I promised myself I would not open that drawer until tomorrow. Now I have a pack with 8 and I must force myself to only have 8 because well...I only have 8 in my pack!  Next day I'd wake up and put another 8 in that empty pack and again leave the house with only those 8. (Even if you're not "leaving" the house you can still put the remaining ciggs in the drawer and promise yourself to not open it. ANYWAY, I did this and after a few weeks went to 6 in that pack. Now at 4 for the last year and it has helped tremendously. So again, save an empty pack, Put 4 from a new pack into the empty one, go out with the pack that has 4, and you have now limited yourself to those 4. I hope this helps someone! Good luck, guys.

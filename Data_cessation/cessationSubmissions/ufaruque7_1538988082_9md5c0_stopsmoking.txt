Nicotine free days! 2 months &amp; counting

Been over a little over 2 months that I quit. Am not using any apps to track my status as I found that too distracting. Instead, it's a normal mark on a calendar. I just mark the same day on the following month to signify that I am nicotine free for a month...ðŸ˜€

It really feels great. To everyone else, who is trying to quit or may have relapsed once or twice, do remember, it happens with almost a lot of us, but you just gotta keep strong. If you fail once, don't give up. Just reset your non-smoking clock to day zero and start again. 
It has happened to me as well... But trust me, everytime, you make a new resolve and start over, you go just that little further. So don't give up...And yeah, been saving  quite the pretty penny for kicking the habit.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

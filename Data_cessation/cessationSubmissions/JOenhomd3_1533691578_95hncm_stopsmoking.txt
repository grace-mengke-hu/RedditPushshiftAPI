Cigs make me feel like poo now and I love it.

I was a daily smoker for years and finally quit for a month, then decided to start back up and I can no longer smoke a Cig without feeling like str8 up poo physically all day when I smoke them now, which makes it 100x easier to not want to smoke.

Only reason I'd smoke a cig now would be if I was extremely bored, but I am trying to overcome that by doing pushups whenever I urge for 1 and something changes in my brain when I do pushups where I don't care about them either.

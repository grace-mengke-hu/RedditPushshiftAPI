Want to quit smoking - some questions

Hi,

I want to quit smoking. Over the past year I started smoking more and more heavily, now a pack a day. I like to do it on my balcony with music when I'm bored. When I quit for a day, the cravings become really intense and I really wonder if they ever stop, even if you're clean for like a week/month. Any tips/reads on how the mind works with this? How would I view smoking after a month? Does it still urge me so much then? A problem is that I don't know how to entertain myself now that I've stopped gaming.

Tips much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

You don't know what you had until it's gone...

I had a cigarette today, and it tasted like shit. I felt like shit after it, and not out of guilt either. Could barely walk up that hill, and I only made it halfway through

I know what I had, it's a ball and chain.

I'm not counting the smoke I had today, if anything it's reinforced my choice not to 'drop the habit', not to 'quit', cause what am I quitting? Today I realised, I made the decision to not be a smoker. I just don't smoke.

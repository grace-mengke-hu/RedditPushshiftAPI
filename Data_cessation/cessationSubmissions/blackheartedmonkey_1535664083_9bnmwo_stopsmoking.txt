Smokes went upto almost $8/pack, I’m starting a new job, it’s time to change my life.

I went through a pretty rough patch in my life, the last 3 years have been hell. And although money has been a huge issue due to job instability, I always had my trusty musty dirty little friend with me.

I mean really thinking about it....I spend almost 200/month on cigarettes now.

Now they went up to almost $8 and some places over $8.

That means if I continued to smoke my pack a day. I’ll be spending over $240 or more a month! 

Well things are slowly but surely looking up! Life is getting better and I’m over cigarettes stealing my very hard earned money away from me.

I’m starting a new job in a few weeks and I don’t wanna go in smelling like an ashtray, looking like crap, feeling like crap. And yes I’ve already read the book. It’s time give up this habit. As of 7:30 tomorrow morning I’m waking up a non smoker and not looking back!

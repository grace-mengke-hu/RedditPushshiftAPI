Day 6 is awful!

Hello everyone,
I am pack a day from the last 8years. Quit cold turkey 6days back, no NRT, no gums, no eating junk. I'm only doing 2 things, drinking water all day and beer in the night. And ofcourse a lot of deep breathing.

After 3days, this was supposed to get better. It's becoming worse for me. I doubt I would be able to last very long if this gets worse. The cravings were manageable in the first 3days. Now they are pretty intense like my mind is trying to convince me to just say "what the hell", let's buy a pack and stop this nonsense.

I am not able to find good reasons to quit. I feel like I have justification for everything now. Maybe I need to read "Easyway" once again to come back in the right frame of mind. Also, I'm scared about the holiday with friends this weekend where everyone else is going to smoke/roll and whatnot.

2 weeks today having hard time when i first wake up

39 yo been smoking for almost 20 years. Today makes it 14 days since my last one. I do have the cravings from time to time. The cravings are reducing in the amount of times i get them. However they seem to last longer now and are more intense. My main problem is when i wake up. The cravings or the mental aspect of it, is still hard. In fact ive been waking up later just to delay the thought of dealing "with the monster".
PS..Yes still drinking my coffee.

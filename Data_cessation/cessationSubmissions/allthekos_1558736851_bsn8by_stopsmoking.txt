For the first time in 20 years.... I went 10 hours without smoking!

I know it's not much of an achievement by a lot of standards on here...but in 20 years I have never gone that long. It felt good. My lungs don't hurt as much. I'm not coughing as much...dare I say..I could get addicted to breathing!

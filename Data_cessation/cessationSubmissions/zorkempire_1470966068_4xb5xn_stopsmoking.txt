Review of the Allen Carr Easyway webinar. (So far so good.)

I quit a few years ago with the help of the book The EasyWay to Stop Smoking. A few months ago, I fell off the wagon and picked up the habit again. I've known all along that I would quit, that I HAD to quit, but it wasn't until recently that I finally did something about it.

I bought another copy of the book, but then found that I was a little annoyed by how much of it is an advertisement for itself. The book helped me tremendously the first time, so I know it would have been worth it to plow through it a second time, but I thought maybe a different approach would be better for me this time.

So I decided to do the webcast. [Here's a link](https://www.theeasywaytostopsmoking.com/Online/View-Webcast). 

It cost $150, which ain't cheap, particularly when you compare it to a used copy of the book. But it also only takes 3.5 hours, and I think (though I can't find it right now) it has a money back guarantee.

I wouldn't call the webcast "enthralling," but it's definitely interesting, and I think it really did help change my perspective on smoking. 

I finished the videos, had my last smoke, and haven't had one in five days. Cravings have been mild and completely manageable.

I'd recommend the course to anyone who wants to do something about their habit quickly and easily. For me, it was worth the money to get the course in such a compressed way.

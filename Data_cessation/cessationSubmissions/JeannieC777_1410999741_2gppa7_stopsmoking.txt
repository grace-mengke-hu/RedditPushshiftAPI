Day 9..... Having a hard time...

My husband never smoked - he doesn't understand how hard this process is. His lack of understanding makes me stress out more, which... yEP!!! Makes me want to smoke ten at a time. Ugh... Anxiety is high as heck too. I don't want to give up but it's taking a lot out of me

How many people here used wellbutrin/bupropion to help quit?

I found it really helped. About 5 days in I realized I wasn't getting the reward from cigs. It almost seemed like I got the worst withdrawal symptoms out of the way while I was still smoking. From there its just a matter of overcoming the psychological habit.

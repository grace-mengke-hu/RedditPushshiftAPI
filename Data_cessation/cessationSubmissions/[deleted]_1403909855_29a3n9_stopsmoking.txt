Day 6

I have smoked for over half my life, which at 26 is just embarrassing!! I was admitted to hospital twice yesterday after having quit... Sweet irony!  Asthma, which I've had all my life. 
I started smoking never expecting to continue with it, just to experience it... 15 years later don't I feel the fool!
This time it's for realzs... I refuse to be controlled by a stupid stick which adds nothing to my life and has the potential to take away EVERYTHING!

Feeling alright today.

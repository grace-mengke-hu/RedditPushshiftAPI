Day 13

I'm 13 days in and doing good so far. The last several days were intense because I was genuinely angry about things. Every time in the past as soon as I got pissed, I grabbed a smoke. I thought about it, but I managed to resist the urge so far. I'm using Chantix and these were the first real intense urges to smoke. So I'll pat myself on the back and look forward to day 14. Lol

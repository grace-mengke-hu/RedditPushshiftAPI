Just ordered an e-cigarette online, and I'm finally ready to actually try. Any advice on preparation?

I've been a regular half-pack-a-day smoker for 10 years and never *really* tried to quit, but I've been wanting to for about 2 years and I've been lurking here for about 6 months. 

On a recent short road trip with friends, I was loaned one of their E-go cigarettes (they no longer smoked in the car) and found it really helpful.  They didn't have enough oil for me to use it all day, but I went longer than usual between cigarettes.  

Mine should be here in a few days.  Any advice on preparing myself for the transition over the next few days?  I can't decide if I should start cutting back before it even gets here, or to just stop thinking about it and let it naturally take over (if that makes sense).

Loss of motivation tips

Hey guys I’ve tried quitting multiple times now and am trying again this weekend. From previous quit attempts I’ve noticed that my point of failure is an instant loss of motivation after a relapse. I build up all the reason I’m quitting prior to the quit date but then when I relapse all that goes out the door and I’m back at it. Any tips for staying motivated and how to recover from a relapse successfully? Thanks in advance

My non-smoker stats

The other day I had reason to look up the current price of a pouch of tobacco so I thought "while I'm here, I might see what the price is for the smokes I used to get". Wowzers! I'm in Australia where cigarettes are heavily taxed but I still couldn't believe the increase in a couple of years. I used to pay $16.50 a pack and they are now over $21. For 25 stupid little cigarettes, it's insane. Almost a dollar a smoke. So here are my stats, I'd love to see other people's.

Days as a non-smoker: 912

Amount I used to smoke a day: 10

Number of cigarettes not smoked: 9120

(Assuming an average price per packet of $18.50) Amount saved: $6750. 

Also to consider is the fact that I don't pay higher premiums for my health insurance as I can happily check the "non smoker" box so I've saved a couple of grand there already.

These are the stats that mean more to me than my lifetime risk of cancer/heart attack/stroke etc. I'm still in my 30s so I just don't consider the health risks that smoking comes with, but the financial aspect is applicable to me no matter my age. I'm pretty proud of myself right now.

Cravings out of nowhere

Hey people, I ve been smoke free for 3 and half months now and since the end of month 1 nic free. For the last 2 months I didnt get a lot of cravings but For the last couple of days I get them almost as If I was a smoker and didnt smoke for a day. Is this even possible? Do I get them every now and then or do they stop completely at some point?

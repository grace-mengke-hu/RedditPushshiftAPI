Do not use Chantix

I don't smoke nor have I ever but I would like to issue a warning about the medication, Chantix, used to stop smoking. 


Two weeks ago, my loving, funny, charismatic aunt killed herself while on Chantix. She got up in the middle of the night looking for her son, my cousin (who was on vacation away at the time.) She was completely illucid, and drove to the emergency room at the nearby hospital, she went to the counter and asked if he was there, they said no, so she walked outside and went the wrong way to the car. She took a left onto the bridge nearby which she then proceeded to jump off of and die on impact.


There were many signs that she was not conscious when she did this including still having her purse on her when she jumped. But take this as a lesson and avoid using Chantix in the future. I've met other people who said that it gave them weird thoughts and stranger dreams, my aunt wasn't one of the lucky ones.

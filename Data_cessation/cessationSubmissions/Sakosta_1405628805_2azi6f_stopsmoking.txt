Trying again

I've tried to quit smoking a few times before. Once I even quit for a whole year, but I keep getting dragged back in. I guess I'm weak. I always used stress as an excuse to start up again. I hope this time is different. After the worst year of my life, that mirrored an old country song, it's finally starting to look better. I haven't smoked a cigarette in 6 days, and I hope I can stay strong this time. I've been using an e cigarette from greensmartliving to take a few puffs here and there, but my goal is to quit nicotine. Wish me luck... I'm gonna need it.

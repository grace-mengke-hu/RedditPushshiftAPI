I got past one week and holy shit do I feel better.

I feel much less nervous and in general I am happier. I already don't have the need to smoke anymore.
Today I noticed that I could smell my friends after they had smoked, which is something that I hardly noticed anymore; also the smell was just really bad.
The first few days were a bit hard, but somehow I managed to resist.
I still miss smoking sometimes but I don't feel like it is something that I have to do.
I didn't feel obliged to do it nor I had any particular need to stop. I'm just 18 and I knew that at some point I would have to give and end. I just decided to do it and it worked. So happy!

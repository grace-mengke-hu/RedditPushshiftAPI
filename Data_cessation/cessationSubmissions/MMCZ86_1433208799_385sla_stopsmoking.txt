Dealing with stress!

After smoking for over ten years I quit last January and really haven't had many cravings or issues since February.  I think a big reason for this is because I cut back on my drinking and rarely see my friends that still smoke.  

Now I am getting in to the busiest time of year for my job and have been working 60 or more hours a week.  I will probably be working even more starting this week and my stress level is already VERY high.  

I've started having some pretty severe cravings in the last couple weeks but I haven't considered smoking at all.  I'm just worried that I'll break down after a particularly bad day and throw away all the progress I've made.

Any tips on dealing with stress related cravings?

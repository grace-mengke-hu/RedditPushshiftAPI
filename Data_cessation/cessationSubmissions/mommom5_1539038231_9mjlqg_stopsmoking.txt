Entering Month 2

I am in the process of becoming a non-smoker.  Maybe I’m already a non-smoker to some but I read an article where someone wrote you’re not truly a non-smoker until you go 365 days without a single puff... so, I remembered that.  Anyways, as happy as I am over my quit so far, I get sad over it too, and I know it’s stupid.  Sometimes I just miss it.  Sometimes I’m envious of other smokers but I talk myself thru why I’m quitting and why I’m sticking with it.  So far, success.   

I had someone talk to me who is suffering from effects from smoking and it scared me.  It’s the push I needed I think to actually do it, to quit and commit to it.  Smoking my last cigarette, I knew that was it, that would be my last cigarette.  I don’t think I ever once thought that before in any of my other quit attempts.  To be honest, I think all other quit attempts I more or less thought, until we meet again while smoking my so called last cigarette. It’s as if I knew I’d find that reason to smoke again.  This time though, there’s no going back.  

I quit and I refuse to have regrets bc I kept smoking.  I think it’s why I’m envious and sad and feeling the break up.  It’s real this time.  

This is my story... I’ve smoked 29 years, a pack a day from when I first started smoking at 16 until the day I quit 28 days ago.  

28 days smoke free and still going strong!

4 months smoke free - Do the cravings ever stop?

I was a smoker for ~15 years and I quit smoking 4 months ago, cold turkey (no medication or e-cig etc.)

I definitely feel **much** healthier; awake, in better shape, less lazy, able to climb stairs, able to appreciate food and drinks more and most of all, happy to not have to hunt for a pack of cigs anymore.

I also feel glad whenever someone smokes next to me or near me, it smells so bad and I can't believe I used to smell like that.

However, I still get the cravings sometimes, especially after a good meal or while watching a good movie, god are those annoying... I also tend to avoid alcohol because I know it would probably tempt me to smoke again.

So I wanted to ask to you long time quitters, do the cravings ever disappear completely? Also, good luck to anyone thinking about quitting!

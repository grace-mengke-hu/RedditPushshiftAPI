Relationships with friends who still smoke.

Allen Carr says that one of the biggest causes of failure are other smokers.  I was wondering how other people handled their relationships with friends who smoke?

My friends haven't been bothered at all that I've stopped smoking, in fact I've been quite shocked at the negativity and passive-aggressiveness they've shown about it.  This makes me sound like an attention-seeking brat, however all I mean is that it's such a huge deal to me so I thought that my happiness might rub off a little bit.

Some of them have even gone so far as to make jibes about me stopping smoking.  It's a really strange situation.  

Any of you guys experienced this?

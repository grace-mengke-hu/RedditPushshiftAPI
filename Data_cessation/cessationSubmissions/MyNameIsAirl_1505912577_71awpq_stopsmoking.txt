Forced to quit

So I was out drinking with some friends last weekend and I said something about hating that I smoke so my bud decided he was gonna make me quit. So when I was lighting up the last one in my pack he chased me around the fire and took the cut from me and threw it in the fire. He then told me to message him if I was going to smoke so that he could beat my ass. Haven't smoked a cig since but I have smoked a few packs of cigars.

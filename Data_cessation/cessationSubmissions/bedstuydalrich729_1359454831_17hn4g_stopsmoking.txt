Day two

I started with the help of /r/stopsmoking back in the fall. Managed to get through a month cig free. But then I went home for the holidays, had a massive falling out with my father, and saw old friends in situations that involved alcohol. Since then I've been smoking 1-4 cigs a day. But today marks my second day smoke free on my second try. Wish me luck!

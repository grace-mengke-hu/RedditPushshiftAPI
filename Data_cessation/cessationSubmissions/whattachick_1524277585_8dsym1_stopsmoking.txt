Third time is a charm?

So this is the third time I have tried to quit over the last few years. I'm using Chantix as well as occasionally nicotine gum. 2 mg when I feel like I'm going to flip out. I feel different this time in comparison to the other two times. Like I can really quit and stay quit. Anyone else feel this way?

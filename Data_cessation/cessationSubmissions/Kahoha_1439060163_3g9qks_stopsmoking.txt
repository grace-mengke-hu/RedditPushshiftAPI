Day 3, I feel so terrible

Well, I have to admit that right now I'm crying so hard because my body is really, REALLY craving a cigarette. Trying so hard to resist though.. trying so fucking hard. 

I guess I just feel a bit embarassed that I'm not able to handle quitting as well as others do. I'm kinda embarassed that I'm actually sitting here, crying, because I can't smoke a cigarette. And finally I'm embarassed that I let myself get addicted to that shitty nicotine that I feel like I need to sit here crying because I can't get a fix. 

I must not. Really. I just needed to rant since this feels like the worst day yet in the whole quitting process. 
I need to stay strong.

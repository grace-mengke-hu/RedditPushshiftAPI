Today I realized that this persistent cough in the morning is smoker's cough. Don't think I've ever been so serious about quitting. Some questions inside.

I've been smoking for about 2.5 years, with roughly 10-12 cigarettes daily (sometimes more, sometimes less.) I've had a pretty bad cough in the morning for the past couple of weeks, and upon doing some research it appears that smoker's cough is the most likely explanation. I suppose I'm "lucky" in the sense that my mucus still appears clear, rather than brownish.

I've tried quitting a couple of times before, but always half-assed. I'm one of those people who are really good at telling themselves that "it won't happen to me", and who unfortunately grew up with the notion that smoking is in some way a "cool, adult thing to do."

Now, there's a few things I'm worried about.

* Roughly how long does the smoker's cough stay after I quit? At what point do I have to be (even more) worried? I realize that this will most likely differ from person to person.  
* What do I do while waiting for the bus? Smoking aways gave me something to do, and for some reason I felt more confident while doing so. Going to the bus stop and waiting will easily be my biggest "trigger".  
* Just how am I supposed to socialise? I'm not a very social person in the first place and suffer from social anxiety. Smoking gave me the opportunity to talk to people, hang out with the smokers during breaks.. Just sticking to the non-smokers is not an option, as an estimated 99% of the people I'm surrounded with at work are smokers. Will just standing there impact my regeneration by any meaningful amount at all? (Other than potential cravings, of course.)  
* And finally.. Is it too late? Have I permanently fucked up my lungs for good yet? I already know the answer to that one: No. However, a tiny and illogical voice inside my head is pretty panicky, and I'm hoping that outside confirmation will shut it up.

Fuck smoking. Cheers.

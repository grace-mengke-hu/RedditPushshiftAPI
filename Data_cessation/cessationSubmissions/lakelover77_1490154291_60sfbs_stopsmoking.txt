I've never made it past three days quit

Hi! I am just finishing up 2 days smoke free. I feel good knowing that smoking isn't an option anymore and that I won't ever smoke again. I'm just feeling really crazy right now. I haven't moved much other than insane little spurts or at work. My eyes feel heavy and I almost feel high. 
I just want to sleep. And eat. I'm trying really hard to be patient and strong. This will all pass. Right? 
And trying to be easy with myself. 

I can't really remember a time when I haven't smoked. My single mother chain smoked around me. Then I started at 13. Been smoking ever since. 1/3 of a pack a day. Mostly a shameful, closet smoker. I'm 39 years old now. 

Anyways, I just read that having accountability helps with quitting. I'm going to make it past tomorrow and let you all know ok? 

Sorry if this post seems strange. I'm feeling strange. I lost my hat today and forgot my wallet at home. I said "you're welcome" when I should have said "thank you". Mega weirdo day. 

Thanks for being here :)

Funny how every quit is different...

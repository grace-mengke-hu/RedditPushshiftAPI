Need help with quiting

So I've been a pack a day smoker for about 5 years now. I know I need to stop but every time I try and quit I end up buying a pack later that day. The longest I ever made it was 2 months, but I just replaced the habit with an e-cig. It's honestly starting to scare me that I can't quit or be strong enough to quit. Any advice would be appreciated, anything that helped you guys quit for good or that you would tell anyone trying to quit.

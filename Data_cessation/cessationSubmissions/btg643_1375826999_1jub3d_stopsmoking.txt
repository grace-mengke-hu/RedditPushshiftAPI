I want to quit...just not today. How to I change my mind!?

I know this might get some eyeballs rolling with this, so I am sorry.

I have been smoking for about 10 years, and I know I need to quit.  But how does one turn their mind around.  I have a big problem with that.  Last time I tried to quit I got a very nasty lung infection a few weeks later...I use that as a reason to keep on smoking.  It's ludicrous I know...I am just being honest.  

Do you guys have any tricks, or words of inspiration...that kind of thing.  I duno, I am pretty sure I am wasting everyone's time because it's up to me.  I would like to think that maybe, just maybe this thread could kick my mind into the right gear.  I am almost 30, I don't want to be smoking for much longer.

Thank you patches!

About six months ago I caught the flu and decided to quit. Spent five days in bed so they were easy. I kept it up for about ten more days, going to school, doing normal stuff. Being a bit cranky and a bit of a pain in the ass to people around me but feeling proud I came that far. 

Then it hit me. We were having dinner with some friends, but I couldn't have a good time. I hated them, couldn't stand to look at them, my best friends. I ended up breaking down completely, sobbing my eyes out and smoking about half a pack which was awful. Just the withdrawal was bad enough but the sense of failure really got to me and I felt awful for days. 

Roll time forward to about about ten days ago I realized I had a problem and really needed help. That was probably my biggest step, admitting to myself that I couldn't manage quitting without help. So I got some patches, and oh my fuck are they great! 

It feels like I've totally defeated my everyday need for a cig and it's wonderful. 

I realize I have a long way to go and I'm still on nicotine but it feels like I've beaten the cig-routine and it feels great to me. I'm going to do this, nice and slow and steady as she goes, follow a winding down schedule and get this done. 

Hopefully reading this will help someone quit, in which case I'm very happy.

Post-Wisdom Teeth Agonies!

It has been about 80 hours since I got my 4 wisdom teeth removed.
I really want to take this opportunity to quit smoking for a multitude of reasons but I'm finding it quite insufferable at the moment. 
I'm on day 4 and only slipped up yesterday. I had a minor anxiety attack and found myself sitting on my roof with my ipod like I usually do. I lit a cigarette but I barely inhaled it (since I couldn't really move my mouth) but just the routine of it was comforting. I refrained from doing the same today but it has been quite difficult. I've had a seemingly constant headache (despite the ibuprofen/codeine prescribed) and this overwhelming excess of nervous energy. I've been on the verge of tears most of the day and even got quite snappish with my family :( 
This is the first time i've tried to quit. I'm 25 and i've been smoking for about 4-5 years. 
I think the hardest thing is keeping myself busy. I feel completely incapacitated at the moment. I usually love reading but I can't seem to relax or concentrate at all. I've just been lying in bed staring at the ceiling which is definitely not the best pastime. I do feel that exercise could help but sadly my jaw is still quite sore even when i move around the house. 
I should also note that I was feeling quite depressed before going into the surgery. I recently broke up with my boyfriend and consequently decided to move back home to the other side of the world. It has been quite tough but I really don't want to use that as an excuse to relapse as I will probably feel even worse!

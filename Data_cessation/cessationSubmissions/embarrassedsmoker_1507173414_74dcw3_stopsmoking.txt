After a few months of cold turkey...

Just wanted to give a small update and say that I'm glad this community exists.  I posted before about being a 2 pack a day smoker who became unexpectedly pregnant while on the pill.  

I did it and I've stuck with it! The first week really sucked, I won't lie.  And the fact that my significant other has continued to smoke doesn't help either but hey I'm doing it.  Since I quit during the first trimester, my daughter is looking super healthy, on the bigger side with her weight and I only have a couple months left to go before she's born.

Is the damage permanent?

I am actually curious(and lil worried),regarding the reverisibility or not of the damage smoking does especially on the arteries,brain and lungs.

The brief reserach i did on the internet did not yield any solid result,nor did i find a solid study.I am kind of hypohondriac about artery health and brain function and very very curious.

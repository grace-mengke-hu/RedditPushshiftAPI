Two days in

I'm 31 and have smoked for 12 years. This is why I've decided to quit. 

I went to the doctor for an unrelated problem that required a chest X ray. The nurse called me back the next day and said they needed me to come back in for a CT scan -- they had discovered a small white spot on my lung. 

The moments of panic I felt were enough. It doesn't matter that I was told it's probably nothing to concern myself about. It doesn't matter that it's probably nothing. If I keep smoking, in a few decades or even less, I may very well get a call telling me that it *is* something.

I've had a taste of the fear of bad news from a doctor. Because of me. I knew immediately that it was *my fault*. I can't dismiss a medical test with a joke or a smartass comment. One day that spot on an X ray will be cancer, and no one will be able to feel too badly for me for putting it there.

I'm smarter than that. 

So it's been two days. I'm at work and stressed beyond belief, and I want one very badly. But I don't have any, and I'm not getting any. I want one, but not enough to kill myself over it. 

I hope I can say the same thing in a few years.

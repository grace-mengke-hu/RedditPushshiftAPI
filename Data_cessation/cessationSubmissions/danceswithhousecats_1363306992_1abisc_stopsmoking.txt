So I stopped smoking 3 weeks ago and today I bought a pack of smokes. Didn't even noticed until I lit one up.

I started smoking when I was 13(now 29). When I was 16 I gave it up. At 18 I foolishly started again and haven't been able to kick the habit. I've tried everything to stop and the only thing that has worked so far is cold turkey.






I could really use some words of encouragement guys.

Smoking Cessation and Intestinal Flora

Hey guys,

Been a smoker for 7 years, finally looking to stop, but I'm still making excuses for myself; the biggest of these being the change in intestinal flora and the associated weight gain. I've generally been on the leaner side of things, and to be honest, I'm scared of that changing. What can I do?

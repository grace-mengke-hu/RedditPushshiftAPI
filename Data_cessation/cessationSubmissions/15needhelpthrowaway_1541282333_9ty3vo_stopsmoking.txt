This serious. I'm 15 and have gotten addicted to smoking. I need advice.

Obviously, this is a throwaway account.

I'm 15, and went through a rough patch in my life earlier this year, and have been smoking since. I can already tell it is stunting my growth and draining my pockets. I really have no idea what to do, but I don't want to get my parents involved as they have enough to worry about as it is.

If you have any advice, please reply to this post or PM me. Thank you in advance.

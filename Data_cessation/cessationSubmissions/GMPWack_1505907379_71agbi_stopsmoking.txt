Day 1.....again

I'm sick as a dog, I ran out of smokes last night and will not be buying more ever again. If you haven't noticed, this isn't my first time quitting, but I want it to be my last time quitting. Usually, this is how my quit goes: 

Day 1: YAY!! I'm free!! No more smoking!!
Day 2: I feel fucking great and no urges!
Day 3: I have some cravings, but they're manageable and I feel great!!
Day 4: goddamn the cravings..... but I got this!
Day 5: IFIDONTGETAFUCKINGCIGARETTENOWIMGONNAKILLEVERYFUCKINGBODY!!!!

And thats how I end up back at day 1 over and over again. Well, let me get over this head cold and let's go from there!

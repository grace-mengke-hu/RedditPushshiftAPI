51 Days, really can't believe I have lasted this long! - Here's some tips.

Thanks for all of your support, this Subreddit really is great! I'm not going to rant on about tactics that worked for me or write loads of crap that no one wants to hear. Instead, I am just going to add a few small tips, motivation for people wanting to quit.

- If you really think "this is the time to quit, I can do it this time" then it probably is. Don't stop thinking this when you do actually stop.

- It gets a lot easier after around 15/16 days, so keep pushing on through, I kept thinking, " if I smoke now, I have to reset my badge to 0"

- Don't think "one won't hurt" it will hurt and you will be smoking again in no time, I have seen numerous posts like this on this subreddit.

- Don't try and quit if you don't want to, you have to really want to stop in order to be committed.

- Put Â£50 a week (or however much you are saving from not smoking) in a pot or jar, you will soon see how much you were wasting on them horrible things.

- Go for long walks or runs to see the improvement in your health, it's quite amazing actually.

- Speak to some people who smoke and just see how bad they actually smell of stale smoke. Imagine smelling like that again.

- My taste and smell greatly improved even within the first 10 days, you can enjoy meals and common smells once again.

- Have support. Even if the only support network you have in your life is /r/stopsmoking , latch on to this. You're far more likely to succeed than if you try to go at it alone. (1) The support is inherently helpful (2) Pride -- when you don't tell anyone, it's easier to justify going back on your decision without losing face.

- Something I have noticed is going out drinking now results in me getting way more drunk than usual. Probably because I am not going out constantly and smoking. So one small tip, just watch the amount you are drinking.

- Don't rip on friends who don't give up smoking, it isn't fair. Let them quit in their own time.

If anyone else can think of any others to add to this, possibly we can make a big thread for people who are new to stopping.

Making the decision to quit

Title says it all, I'm making the decision to better myself. I've been smoking for two years and while it's not a lot of time, I want to stop now before it gets out of hand. I tried the cold turkey thing before and that didn't really help. So far I've gone from half a pack a day to 2 a day the least with like 4-5 the most. One to go with my morning coffee (which is definitely gonna be hard to get rid of since that's usually my daily routine) and another at night before I sleep. Throughout the day I try to convince myself not to do it and it works sometimes whereas other times it doesn't. On the plus side I haven't smoked in two days so it's a start but as I said already, I can't do the cold turkey thing. I'm really dedicated on staying on this decision to quit. I give myself a month to stop and I'm feeling confident that I'll be able to kick it by then. Any other tips would be appreciated. I was told that vaping works but I'm not sure where to start on that so if anyone would be generous as to help with that, I'd greatly appreciate it. And here's to hoping to kick it.

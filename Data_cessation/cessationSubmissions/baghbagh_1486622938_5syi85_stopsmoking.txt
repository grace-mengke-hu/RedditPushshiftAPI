day 5. going out tonight with friends. there will be alcohol and i am afraid

Alcohol and cig are like bread and butter. I dont remember last time I had a glass of wine not accompanied or followed by cig. I was a pack smoker and stopped 5 days ago. I actually feel amazed that I have made it so far. The best is the feeling on top of my toungue... it is like it is breathing fresh air (that is the best I can describe it). So tonight is the first time i am going out with friends since I quit. There will be alcohol and I am scared it will demand its "best friend".   Please let me know if you have any tips...

Do the cravings ever go away?

I am now 11 days without a cigarette and having cravings worse than ever. I realize I am still early in, but I keep seeing people say after years of quitting, that they still want a cigarette everyday.. is this true? because I don't think I can feel this way forever. I don't want to be a slave to this the rest of my life. I need some reassurance that things will at least get better.

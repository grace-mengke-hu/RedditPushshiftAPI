50 days into the 2nd quit of my life

Started in my early teens, became a regular smoker as soon as I could legally buy them, and I kept it up for over a decade. Quit in my late 20s, then casually started again a year ago. That was stupid.

Weaned myself down to a pack a week over a month, then quit in January. Physically, not too bad but kicking the habit is a test of willpower. Quit drinking about the same time, too, with (mostly) success. Drunk me smoked a ton of cigarettes! Getting rid of her helped improve a lot of things, and no smoking was a big one!

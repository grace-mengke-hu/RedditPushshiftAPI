30 days smokefree - now to quit vaping!

Hi guys, I'm on day 30 of not smoking cigarettes. (NZ time)

For the first 30days my Ritalin was making me sedated when I took it, I finally (with docs advice) doubled the dose and now I'm clearer (it does make me crave worse) but still get anxious / panic attacks.

I started having panic attacks once I quit, and it took me awhile to figure out it was coming from when I vaped! I moved down from 18mg, to 12mg to 6mg.

Now it's time to stop vaping. I'm terrified as that's what's kept me from smoking this last month. Any ideas or tips to quit vaping?

I'd rather be medicated for adhd than vape.

Thanks

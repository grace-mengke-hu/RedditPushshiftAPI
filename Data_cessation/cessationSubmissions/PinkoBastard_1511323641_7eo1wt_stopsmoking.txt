Going a step further

Hey guys, I hope this is the right place for me. I've managed to quit smoking with snus, but I'm too broke to buy more now. It's been about a week, and boy have I been feeling the lack of nicotine. Since I'm already going through withdrawals, I'm considering using this as an opportunity to quit. It's gonna be tough, though, and I feel I may need some support or atleast resources to keep me on track. Any advice, words of encouragement, resources on the benefits of not using nicotine (I know why smoking was awful for me, but couldn't find much risk in snus/just nicotine), etc would be much appreciated. 

Many thanks, and congrats to everyone on avoiding the ol' lung cancer!

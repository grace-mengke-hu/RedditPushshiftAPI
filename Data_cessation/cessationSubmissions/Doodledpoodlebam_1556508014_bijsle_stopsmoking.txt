Longenzes/tooth extraction

I have to go and have 3 teeth pulled on Tuesday. I have awful anxiety and am freaked out about it anyway, but am terrified of the nicotine withdrawal.

I’m 32 and have smoked for about 15 years, a pack a day.
I’m going to take this opportunity to quit for good.

I was going to use the patch but I keep reading about the vivid dreams and that freaks me out, so I figured I’d try lozenges.
If I just let them dissolve rather than suck them, should I be ok as far as dry socket goes?

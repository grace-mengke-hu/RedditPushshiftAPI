Is there any way to stop this empty feeling?

I stopped smoking exactly 20 hours ago,i have been smoking for only three years/10 cigs a day.I read the book easyway to quit in one session and it gave me so much self confidence in my decision never to touch one ever again.I really dont want to light up a cigarrete but how do i get rid of this empty feeling in my stomach-im not hungry its like my stomach has a big hole in it(never experienced that).Any suggestions?

I waited for 2 hours in a cardiologists office this afternoon.

I waited for more than 2 hours waiting to see my cardiologist about some chest pain I've been having. I'm somewhat young and healthy, and I've been sure that its just stress, but thats not something to fuck around with. I have HBP also. One of the reasons I quit.

I saw no less than 4 men and women in their late 60's/70s, get up and go smoke a cigarette while waiting. Two, more than once. 3 of them had canes/walkers and the one who didnt needed one. All of them came back reeking of smoke with shame in their eyes.

These are elderly people who are likely sick with some type of cardiac issue, and they are smoking themselves to death - knowing what they are doing but feeling powerless to beat their addiction.. As a smoker I never would have noticed the smell. 

It was one of the saddest things I've seen in a long time. Its something I'll keep in mind when a craving hits.

My ticker is good to go, by the way. Got a high 5 from the doc for quitting smoking.

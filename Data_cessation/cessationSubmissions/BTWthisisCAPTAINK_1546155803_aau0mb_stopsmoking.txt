smoker's flu

hey,

so i've ""quit"" like three or four times in the past month lol. each time i have been stuck with smoker's flu/withdrawals/wahtever for about a week and a half after my last cigarette. i made it to one month before deciding on a whim to start smoking again, and i was fine  


now i'm smoking about a pack per day and i'm wondering -- is there any way to eliminate smoker's flu? is it just tapering properly? i haven't found it hard to stop cold turkey but tapering sounds really difficult  


thank you

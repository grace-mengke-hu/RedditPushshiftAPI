Need Vape recommendations?

Back story 
I am 32, been smoking since I was 16... I hate it. I love it, yet hate it. I smoke a pack a day
I live on the east coast and my old smoking shack I used during the winter is gone, and I can’t fathom smoking in the subzero temps, nor can I bring it inside.  
I think I would prefer something that you felt in your lungs (which does sound counterproductive since my lungs do feel horrid most days) 
I don’t care if it feels in my hand like a cigarette, the mouth the lung sensation is more of my fixation... 
I would want something I can easily and quickly get online... 
any recommendations would be so awesome! I hope to use this to wean myself off regular cigarettes and then hopefully just stop the vape. :) Tia!

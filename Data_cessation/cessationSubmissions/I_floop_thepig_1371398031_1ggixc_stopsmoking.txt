I'm starting the journey of quitting cigarettes.

As a young smoker who got hooked from an early age (early teens), how to kick this nasty habit? Any tips for a newbie? I've tried gum, I've tried e-cigs, but I haven't really been committing to using them to quit entirely. I think that quitting cold turkey would be too difficult. How do I get the mentality? How did you quit?

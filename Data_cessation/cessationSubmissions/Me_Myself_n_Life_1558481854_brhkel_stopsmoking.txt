Hav i really got this !?!?

Iv been on here a hundreds times and tried helping people with what has worked for me. .. IV been telling everyone that willpower works like a muscle so the more we use it the stronger it gets ... Then someone told me yesterday that willpower can get tired if overworked ... This is the worst day Iv had in 1 month and 8 days now ! I woke up crying in still crying 2 hrs later but I cannot smoke or I will die ! I dont know why im so devistated ! Maybe cos that's the one thing that gave me hope Iv never had willpower and all my strength has been in my head ! Now im worried that the rest of my quit (right up to my operation) is going to b so hard !!! I have to keep telling myself that Willpower still works like a muscle cos it does but I can't use it every five mins when I think of a smoke !! I appreciate the person giving me other facts but I dont even know what the point of this post is ! Maybe im pissing people off with my comments I don't know ... So im sorry I told people that the more we use it the stronger it gets ... (Which is still true) We just can't use it all day every day cos it will fatigue lol I thought we were all in this together but some people don't appreciate my "it's all in our mind" point of view so have shot my down ! I hope I can get back up and believe the bullshit IV been telling myself on my journey ! Whatever

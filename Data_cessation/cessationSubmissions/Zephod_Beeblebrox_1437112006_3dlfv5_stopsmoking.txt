Quit hard drugs easier...Using Chantix trying to finally quit? Anyone have any experience?

Finally made a reddit account at the suggestion of my dr for this topic. I'm 29 and have smoked regularly since I was 12 and started at 9. I've tried quitting a few times before and always went back after a few days. In my younger teen years I was heavy into some hard drugs and I dont remember it being as hard as this. I was prescribed Chantix and I think it's working? But just wondering if it's in my head and will wear off or if I have hope this time?

I'm quitting using the patch; should I expect anything?

I'm using the 14 mg patches.  I find it easier than cold turkey, but I'm a grump.  While I've seen online articles that state what happens to your body when you quit, I'm unsure what happens to my body when I use the patch.  

Also, side question, should I follow the instructions on the box?  It says to use 14mg for 1-6 weeks.  I'm unsure if I'm being cynical in thinking they just want me to use the patch for six weeks to increase their revenues.  

I'm hoping someone with experience using the patch can give me some thoughts and guidelines.

Thank you.

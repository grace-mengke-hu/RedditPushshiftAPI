I've decided that today is my last day as a smoker

I smoked for the last 3 years and I'm done with it, I can't afford to throw away money for this and I have been feeling the effects in my body recently so I decided that the sooner I quit the better so im gonna smoke till I'm disgusted and wake tomorrow as an non-smoker. I take concerta for my ADD wich causes me to smoke a ton so that is going to make it a little more difficult but as a last resort maybe I could buy nicotine patches. 
Thank y'all for this subreddit and make me do something about it and sorry if a have a grammatical error, I'm not a native speaker.

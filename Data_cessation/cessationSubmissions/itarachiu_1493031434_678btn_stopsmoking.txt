Why I am thinking to start smoking again?

I quit smoking almost 6 months ago because of health issues. Start smoking at 12, quit at 26, now I am 27. I enjoy very much to smoke but I have to quit because I start to spit blood from my throat. When I start to spit blood I said, Ok, this is bad, I have to quit, my throat was irritated, my tissue was damaged, but now I am fine. After I quit, my throat start to regen and now is complety fine, no pain, no dry mouth, no lump in neck, nothing. In my last 3-4 days I am thinking to start smoking again without stopping, I know if I will light a cigs I will feel like an idiot for the rest of my life, I know I will become addicted again. I don't have any hard time or something... I am fine. I just dont get it.

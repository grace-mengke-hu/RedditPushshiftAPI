The excuses stop now.

After 7 years I've decided that I'm done. No more wasted money, no more only being able to be on top for 10 minutes, no more feeling like a pariah when I'm the only smoker around, no more being stinky, no more cigarettes! I read Allen Carr's book and saw every excuse I've ever used to keep smoking debunked. It's almost as if a switch flipped and I no longer fear being without cigarettes. I am feeling incredibly encouraged. I've also been subbed to r/stopsmoking for a couple months now and reading about others' successes has been a great motivator. For now I'm using the patch, and so far today have had no cravings and haven't felt the least bit distressed about throwing my last pack away. Here's to keeping up the momentum!

Well Day 1 is today

I start a new job tomorrow. I am in IT and my last job all the sysadmins and developers smoked - so it was easy to go outside with them after lunch and on breaks. My new job is a step up (sitting on a floor with people in suits on mahogany desks  heh), so I hope the change in my driving route and not wanting to be the new guy who takes smoke breaks helps. I've heard a change in routine really helps. Here is to hope. I want to do it for my son too. I told my wife I'd quit after he was born and here he is at 7 years old. I have to do this. I have the will. Thanks /r/stopsmoking you've inspired me.

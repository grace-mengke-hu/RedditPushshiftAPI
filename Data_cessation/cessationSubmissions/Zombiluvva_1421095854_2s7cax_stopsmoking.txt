My first post ever :)

Hi lovelies.
 I have commented a couple of times but this is my first post on reddit. I am 7 days nicotine free - I used Allan Carr's Easy Way- and I'm surviving. This year I would have been smoking for 20 years. And at a pack a day I knew it was time to quit. So here I am. I have a little badge and I covet a star shaped one. I go to bed incredibly early because I find the days so long and usually I read every thread in this reddit sub - it's my new hobby. Id love to stop thinking about cigarettes all the time and all I can keep thinking is that this will get easier. It will right? What scares me are the posts from year plus quitters who are still craving. Don't know if I have the strength for that. Thank you all for your posts. You're making this journey much easier :)

Crushin' it.

Cravings are way down. I'm under a freaking lot of stress but the idea of pumping poison into my lungs is the last thing on my mind. 
My wife is 2.5 months pregnant and her energy level is Zero, Just got two more puppies at home that have been neglected, we are looking to buy ANOTHER restaurant, and our 2 year old is starting to develop a bit of an attitude. I don't have any fucking idea how I would have handled this while smoking, but I know I can now. I am so glad I quit when I did. Thank you all!

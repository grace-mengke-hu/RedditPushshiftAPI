Quitting right now

Hi everyone, i've been a smoker for 9 years (almost half my life), and decided to stop right now. I'm writing this as a proof of my commitment because i don't want to tell anyone until they don't notice themselves.
I always think about quitting and i've tried countless times, and this is gonna be the last one. I've decided to quit right now because i feel guilty everytime i light a cigarette, it's too expensive and the effects on my health are starting to become really visible. I'm kinda fit and used to walking a lot, but now i run out of breath really quickly and it's frightening me. Another reason are the effects on my voice, i love singing and smoking is destroying it.
I'm really focused on succeding this time and i could use some advice.

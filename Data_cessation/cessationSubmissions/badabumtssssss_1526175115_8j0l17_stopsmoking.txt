500hrs smoke-free down, a lifetime to go!

Just wanted to share that I’m halfway through the first milestone I’ve set (1,000hrs). Not a heavy smoker (2-3 packs per week, been smoking for 6yrs) 

Here are some things I did to get by:
- I exaggerate to myself the hassle I have to go through just to reach the designated smoking areas (long walk, hot weather, very time consuming)
- I associated smoking to other things I want to “quit” e.g I used to smoke with this person I want to forget about now, I tell myself that if I want to move on completely, I have to let go of smoking, too
- I’m persistent with high rewards. Now, 21 days doesn’t sound rewarding enough, but 500+ hrs does. Haha So I set my milestones in such a way that it gives me a sense of greater achievements
- I still accompany some friends when they smoke. But I just try to refocus myself. If I’m there to socialize, then just socialize, no need to smoke
- I’ve also had an annoying case of nasal drip. It lasted for months. I might have developed an allergy to smoke lol. And now it’s gone. So I just remind myself about it whenever I get the urge.

I hope this helps!

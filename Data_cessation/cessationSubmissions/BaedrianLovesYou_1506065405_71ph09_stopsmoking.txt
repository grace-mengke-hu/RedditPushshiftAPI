Quitting cold turkey

My girlfriend is deciding to quit cold turkey and is getting mad withdrawals in her first day, I hear its normal but what I'm more worried is she doesn't believe in herself, despite the support of myself and her friends. Did anyone else have the feeling that they just could not quit cold turkey, but were able to pull through?

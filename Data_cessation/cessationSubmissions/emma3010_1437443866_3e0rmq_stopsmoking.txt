I'm still alive AND smoke free!

Not been here in a while but 24 days in and still smoke free and contrary to what I thought the world didn't stop turning and I'm 4 days away from a month! It's been hard the worst has been the tightness in my chest but yesterday as I walked my dogs I didn't wheeze and it may sound silly but I felt like I was alive really alive not just exisiting!!! Cravings peaked again at 21 days but I'm still going strong! This site has been one of my saviours!

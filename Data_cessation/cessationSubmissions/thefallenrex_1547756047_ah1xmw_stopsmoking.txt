3 months in, I got chubby as heck!

Well, got into the gym for the first time in probably 6 months today.. after I ran 3 miles on the treadmill I decided to weigh myself! 208....aint been that heavy since high school!  I usually bounced around 185-190., depending on whether I was working out/smoking...  I'm 6"3 dude for a better picture, and quite lanky.  I guess hindsight is semi-irrelevant since I was just wanting to quit the cigs as objective number one.. but for all you fellow quitters out there, be aware of how much the cigs curb your appetite!  Back to  the gym tomorrow, got old records to crush!!

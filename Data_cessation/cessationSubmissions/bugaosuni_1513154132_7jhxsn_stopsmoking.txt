Two of the reasons I quit:

1) There were times I didn't even want to smoke, but I did anyway. 2) There were times I felt I *needed* to smoke.

Neither one of those seemed right to me.  If this resonates with anyone and helps them with the addiction then I'm glad.

There are so so so *so* many other benefits in quitting.  But those were the two things that really got to me.

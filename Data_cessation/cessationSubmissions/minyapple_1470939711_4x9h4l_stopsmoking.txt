Chantix to quit?

I have been smoking for about 10 years. I know it's not that long but it's almost half my life. My grandmother died from lung cancer three years ago and I promised myself that I would quit that year. Since then, every New Years, I make the same resolution- to quit smoking. I have tried cold turkey, cutting back, e-cigs, and NRT but I keep ending up starting up again. I want to quit for good but I feel so defeated.  I'm curious if anyone here has tried Chantix to help them quit. If you have, what did you think of it? Did you start smoking again? Did it give you crazy nightmares? Any sort of insight is greatly appreciated!

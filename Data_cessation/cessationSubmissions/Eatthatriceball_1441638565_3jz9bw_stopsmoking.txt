34 days, and my money jar is stuffed.

There is currently 200 dollars in my money jar right now, with only fifty dollars left to go to finally buy myself a citizen bike! 
Guys, not to long ago I posted how I felt about being 17 days free- and now I'm back to give you guys some motivation.
I have currently lost a total of fifteen pounds, because I quit smoking, I have been able to run 3 to 5 miles a day (depends on air quality). I go to the gym four times a week, and cardio is nothing to me anymore! I use to get so winded it was embarrassing! 
Barely even think about smokes anymore, and my cravings are like nonexistent- I do sometimes struggle on nights out with friends, but I always remind myself how much effort and time I have dedicated to my health and well-being! 
Don't give in, cravings don't last forever! Do some jumping jacks, chew gum, chew straws, call a friend, scream, punch pillows, take a hot shower, maybe even a cold one! 
Go outside, take a deep breath, exhale. You'll love it.

Last time an emergency happened, now attempting again!

Last time I did pretty good staying super hydrated, drinking excessive water because the local water here is super clean and tasty. But, the toilet flooded to the living room and I woke up to the apartment maintenance man walking in telling me the downstairs apartment had damage. Thinking about paying the bill and the repairs, I was like FUCK IT lol.

Hopefully it works, wish me luck. I went a day without nicotine until the toilet problem. Well, I just had five glasses of water in like thirty minutes, feels good. I'm going to attempt quitting caffeine too, coffee was a staple in my parents life and my sister and I are big into stopping by Starbucks when we're spending time together. Looking forward to quitting both, that's a big trigger for me to get some nicotine.

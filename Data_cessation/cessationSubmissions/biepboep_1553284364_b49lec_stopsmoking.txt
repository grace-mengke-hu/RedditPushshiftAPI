2 weeks in. I have 4 important exams coming up and my concentration is shit. Help!

4 very important exams coming up (I'm failing and need to pass this) and my mind is craving cigarettes all the time. It's really dry law stuff so hard to get through, and I feel like just postponing the battle and getting a pack might help me get through it. I really don't want to though, but I can stop after and I can only fail uni once. 
Help me

Just spontaneously quit.

So this is the first time I've ever tried to quit smoking (and hopefully the last). I saw an antismoking ad this morning about living long enough to see your children grow up. Usually advertising doesn't get to me but that one really hit home. Ive never tried to quit before, mostly because I don't like trying and failing. But right now I feel confident (if a little grouchy). I've beat heroin addiction before and I can beat this too.

Breathing exercises.

Does anyone know of any breathing exercises I can do to improve my lung capacity after quitting smoking. It has been about a week but I still feel really short of breath and I have to make a conscious effort to get a full deep breath. I also get so short of breath after short bouts of physical activity, like running up/down the none flight of stairs at work, that my apple watch considers it heavy exercising:/
So yeah, basically anything that will help me get back to breathing easier/better/deeper.

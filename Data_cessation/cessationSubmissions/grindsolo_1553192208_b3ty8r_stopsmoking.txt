How to stop smoking when my social life surrounded by smoking?

Hi, so ive been trying to quit smoking (I smoke hookah which is as dangerous as cigarettes if not more and contains nicotine) .
So i go to hookah bars every single night because all my friends go and i dont know where else to go if i dont go there? Ive been sitting home but overtime thats gets quite boring.

This is not a rant but im hoping if you guys can give me ideas and ways to create a different social life and find new friends who dont smoke? Im a socialable person as much as i know but cant think of a way to find friends who dont do hookah. Id appreciate any tips and thank you for putting the time to read this.

Day one with patches for the first time.

I've tried to quit before with the allen carr book and relapsed a week in after coming back home from uni at the time. I'm trying patches this time simply because my dad is also using them and I figured the nicotine would make me less prone to having a panic attack over quitting. I put the first one on last night and ended up having a really intensely vivid dream that i got fired from work (apparently crazy dreams isn't uncommon on patches) but woke up feeling really positive about quitting. I'm hoping this carries on for the rest of today.

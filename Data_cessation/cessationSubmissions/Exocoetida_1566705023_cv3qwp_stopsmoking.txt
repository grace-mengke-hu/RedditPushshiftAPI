One month down

I’m about a month into the quitting process, and while I haven’t had any trouble breathing or wheezing up to this point, tonight it feels like I can’t get a full breath in. I keep dry coughing until my lungs are irritated. Is this to be expected as the lungs start to clean themselves again?

Don't bother with CVS brand patches

I smoke more than a pack a day and I've quit before for extended periods using Nicoderm and it was great. Nice and easy. My quit date was supposed to be yesterday. I ran out of cigs and slapped on a patch. In 3 hours I wanted to kill someone. It didn't work at all. The Nicoderm patches would make my skin super itchy and make my joints hurt (signs they're actually working) and these just sat there like big stupid bandaids.

They're round and brown. They're blatantly obvious. They peel off so easy. They're like big round bandaids except the pad is socked in nicotine, whereas the brand name ones are just a clear plastic sticker and they stay on all day. 

Anyways, after like 6 hours I ripped off the patch and went to sleep. Woke up, put a new one on, and it fell off in an hour. So I said fuck it and bought a pack. I'll try again next week :/

In my experience, the patches work. Just stray away from the cheap ones if you can. You'll just waste your money.

Made it past three weeks! Feeling really good.

I posted at week one an a half because I was struggling and not seeing any pay off. It was really hard during the first two weeks to keep going, the cravings were quite strong, but now its gotten much much easier and I feel really good about myself to have gotten to this point. And I feel really thankful to my boyfriend for pushing me and helping me quit.

I know that emotionally stressful times will come and that I will want to smoke again, but my plan is just to take it one day at a time. :)

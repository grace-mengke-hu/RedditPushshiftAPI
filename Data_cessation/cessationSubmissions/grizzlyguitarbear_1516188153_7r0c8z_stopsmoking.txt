My First attempt and 7 days in!

Hi Everyone! I'm relatively new to Reddit; in fact its my first ever post.

It's been great reading your stories since I found this sub a couple of days ago. 
I have stopped for 7 days now with the help of an e-cigarette after smoking for 8 years and it feels great!!! I look forward to reading your stories to help keep me inspired on my now cigarette free journey.

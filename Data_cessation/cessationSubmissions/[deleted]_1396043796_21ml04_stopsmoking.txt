I've only been smoking for a few months, but I can feel myself beginning to get addicted and would like to stop. That having been said, one I my favorite things about cigarettes is the ability to jump outside with someone and have a smoke and a chat. Are there any other ways to reliably have one-on-one private time with people in an informal setting without cigarettes? I would suggest coffee or booze, but both require more time and money. Thanks all!

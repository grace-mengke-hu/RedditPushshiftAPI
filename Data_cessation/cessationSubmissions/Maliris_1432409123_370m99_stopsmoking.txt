45 days and feeling great!

It's been quite a road. Quitting smoking has been incredibly easy and incredibly hard for me at the same time. The mental struggle is real and it's been quite a fight, but on the other hand, all it takes is just to not do something. My cravings are getting weaker every day and I'm feeling carefully victorious! I think the most important thing in quitting is to remember that the cravings will pass and they are the product of your addiction so you have to treat them as such. 

Being mindful about cravings has made quitting so much easier than I imagined. The basic principle for me is to acknowledge that I am having a craving, accepting it and then letting it go. I must admit that I've been really lazy in my meditation practice though. However I did drop acid on day 2 of my quitting process and it really smoothed things out and gave me that mindful perspective I needed. I'm not advocating drug use, but I think LSD has been very useful tool in my quitting process. :)

Hang in there my fellow quitters! It gets better.

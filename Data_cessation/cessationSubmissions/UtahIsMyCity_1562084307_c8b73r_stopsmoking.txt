Chantix headaches

Is there any way to deal with them? I'm not a smoker, I dip. But I figured it was appropriate to post here as I've had success with this drug. But the headaches were too much for me. I desperately want to stop but I can't handle the pain. It's disorienting to say the least. 

I have a doctors appointment, I'm going to ask him but I feel like he'll just say either don't take it or deal with it.

Seven months in, battling anxiety

I quit a little over seven months ago, and it’s been easier than I thought. I did and still do use NRT, lowest percent lozenges about two half lozenges per day. I haven’t seen any big downsides with doing that because I’m still patting myself on the back from not being addicted to a pack of cigarettes per day. 
Anyway, lately I’ve developed really bad anxiety that is messing with my day to day life. I’m scared to quit NRT now because what if that makes it worse, but I’m also scared to continue because what if that’s one of the reasons I have anxiety? Anyone with any experience or insights?

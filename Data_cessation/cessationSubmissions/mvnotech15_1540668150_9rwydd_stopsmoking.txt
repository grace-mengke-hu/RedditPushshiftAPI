stopped smoking and drinking

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

This week i've quit smoking and drinking. Im craving a cigarette like crazy.

ive read allan carr;s book and i understood his point of view regarding nicotine free and nicotine products

Can i smoke an electronic nicotine free cigarette or am i just fooling myself?

&amp;#x200B;

for me, quitting smoking is 10x worse than alcohol.

massive amounts of (nervous) energy?

hey all, 

so smoking makes you pretty lethargic and lazy, but i've been cig/nicotine free for a day now and i suddenly want to run 5 miles. 
i've tried just going and walking around, but i have this itch to just expend a lot of perhaps nervous energy. anyone else feel this?

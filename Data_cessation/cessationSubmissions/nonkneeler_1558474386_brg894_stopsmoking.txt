Day two without smoking

Hi, I’m currently 24 years old and had been smoking since I was 18. Throughout this time I had found it extremely difficult to quit smoking, however on Sunday I decided that I needed to think about my long term health and my bank account. I had never gone a full 24 hours without a cigarette before, so Monday was easily one of the hardest days of my life. I find it troubling to fall asleep as it is, however now that I’ve decided to quit, I am struggling even more. I have also been suffering from sharp headaches and my mood switches more abruptly. I feel like I need another habit to replace smoking, but can’t quite find the right substitute. I’m not willing to take nicotine gum, or start vaping, as I have been constantly told that cold turkey is the best way to quit. I would like some advice on what I could try to keep me from smoking, and how best to handle my health.

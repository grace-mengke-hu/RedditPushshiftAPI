Quitter's flu?!

Okay r/stopsmoking, nobody told me this was a thing. I'm on 120 hours smoke-free, and last night started feeling like I was coming down with a cold or strep throat - headache, hurts to swallow, congested, head feels like a bowling ball. Still felt miserable when I woke up, but I have no fever. So on a whim I did some googling thinking it might have something to do with quitting, and lo and behold I find out about so-called [quitter's flu](http://www.whitecloudelectroniccigarettes.com/blog/quitting-tobacco-smokers-flu/)...

I definitely don't want to smoke because my throat hurts so bad, but this sucks! Wtf body, I'm doing something nice for you for a change and you do this to me?! 

Did anyone else experience this? How long did it last? I've been drinking lots of water and tea, but any recommendations on how to ease this?

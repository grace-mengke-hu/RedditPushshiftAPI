31 Days...

Truly didn't think this day would come.

In 31 days I haven't had so much of 1 puff of a cigarette. I still have the "urge" to smoke but it's not strong and it's easy to reroute my thinking.

I'm pretty fucking proud of myself. Almost 500 cigarettes avoided and (according to the app I use) 7 days I've gotten "back".

I hope everyone has a great, smoke free weekend. It's totally possible.

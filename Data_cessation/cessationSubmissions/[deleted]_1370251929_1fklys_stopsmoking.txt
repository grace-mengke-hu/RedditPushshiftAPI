Today is going to be the hard one...

I'm dreading today. 
It's day 2 for me, and I feel it's going to be the worst. I woke up at 5am this morning. I was instantly craving a cigarette. I slept like crap last night. I've already drank 2 cups of coffee. 

What's going to be hard about today is I have to go to my sisters and brother in laws for a bit to help out with some crap. They are both chain smokers. They smoke every 30 minutes. Also, I have an appointment and the car ride is 45 minutes one way... doing that without a smoke is going to be hard. 

Shit, I hate today! 

I can't cave though! I MUST... REMAIN... STRONG.

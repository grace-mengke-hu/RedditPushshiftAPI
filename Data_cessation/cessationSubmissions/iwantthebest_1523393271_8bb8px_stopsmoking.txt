Does using nicotine gum affect your sense of smell.

I’m trying to quit cigarettes by using the nicotine gum. I’m ready to quit this stuff for good, but going cold turkey is really hard.  I read that your sense of smell will return after a few days of not smoking, so will it still improve even if I use the gum?  Or is it the nicotine in general that causes the reduced sense?

I understand all the other benefits of quitting, but this one really stood out to me.

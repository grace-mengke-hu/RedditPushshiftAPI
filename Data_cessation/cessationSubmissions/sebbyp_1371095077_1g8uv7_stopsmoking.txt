Allen Carr is the reason I'm now a non-smoker.

I'm new to reddit, but stumbled across this page, and a fellow redditor suggested Allen Carr's book "How to Stop Smoking". Safe to say, I'm four days in, and have never felt better! No longer feeling the cravings from "that little monster", and I really believe that book is a godsend to anyone trying to quit. 
A+ would recommend to everyone.

1 Month 21 Days

It sucked...I hated all of it ..cried more than I ever have...got angry at everyone from my daughter to the neighbourhood cat...but I am still cig free.

I did have a breakdown around week 3...so I bought a vape with no nicotine...it felt so good to just inhale something....anything...and the flavours taste nice by themselves.

I only vaped for about 2 weeks but mostly bc I broke it. Still, a puff now and then off a vape with no nictotine in it made me less homicidal.

I think I will actually quit this time (this is attempt number 3).

Hang in there!! 6 months from now we are all going to feel GREAT!

Day 25 ups and downs

Well it's day 25 of no smoking for me and I felt like I wanted to share some thoughts with you fellow quitters since I have read many encouraging posts on here. The biggest help I have had so far is openly admitting I was a nicotine addict. There is no point in referring to smoking as a habit. It's not.
Once I was able to admit that and explain to others that's why I have stopped a weight was lifted. I even saw some shock in people's faces using those words which actually reinforced the seriousness of smoking. Since I have stopped I have coughed up heaps of tar which has slightly freaked me out but also encouraged me not to smoke. I have taken the view to make a few other changes while stopping smoking as well which have helped greatly. For the first 3 weeks of my quit I stopped drinking because it was a big trigger for me. Then I made an effort to eat lots of good food, plenty of vegetables and salad. Also I have taken to having a sleep in the afternoon after a hot bath. With the money I have saved so far I went for a full body massage. I would encourage anyone with cravings to do the activities you enjoy and spend the money, because you'd only be spending that and more on cigarettes in the long run. Good luck everyone and well done so far. Thanks for all your help.

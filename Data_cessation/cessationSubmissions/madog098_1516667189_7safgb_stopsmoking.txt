15 days after quitting hookah and the cravings are building

I've been smoking hookah for 10 years now, and recently it got up to smoking for almost 4 hours a day.   Took a 12 day cruise and went cold turkey, now that I'm back home the cravings are much worse.   I just hope I can make it through the week :(

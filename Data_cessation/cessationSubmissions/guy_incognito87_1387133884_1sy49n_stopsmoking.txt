How do I prevent gaining weight after quitting?

So my biggest fear is the weight gain that comes from quitting, I've been watching what I eat very closely for the past few days (I've probably been eating less than I did before). I have been told the weight gain is associated with a change in the immune system, rather than just trying to replace an oral fixation. Is gaining weight an inevitable side effect?

I want to quit chewing 

I've been chewing for about two years now. I moved up to Canada to play hockey, and its about $20 per tin. It's too expensive of a disgusting habit to sustain. I feel bad after doing it each time, but it's such a part of my routine it feels like i need to do it. It's part of my daily routine, and part of my pre-game routine. Any tips for me on how to ween off, and then quit completely? I'm thinking about just doing it on game days to help slow down, and then completely cut off. 
I really do want to quit, and any suggestions are more than helpful!

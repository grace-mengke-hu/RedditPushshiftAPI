It's like what all of you say, you're getting rid of a friend.

It's almost as if I feel bad for giving them up. I've tried quitting before, cold turkey, and weening off, but I wasn't thinking of myself as a non smoker. After reading pages of entries in this sub, I've seen how much happier I could be not smoking. I had to make myself hate cigs even more to give me that push I need. 
No more "oh I've already had one today, so I'll start tomorrow" bullshit. I'm a non smoker from here on in.

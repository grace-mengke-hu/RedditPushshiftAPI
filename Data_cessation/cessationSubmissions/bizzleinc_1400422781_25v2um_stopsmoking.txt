First smoke-free week in 7 years (21 year old)

I started smoking when I was 14 and I've been smoking ever since. I tried quitting many times but it was of no use I would always relapse into this dreadful addiction usually in first 3-6 hours, after a few more attempts I lasted a day or two. The longest I ever went without smoking was 10 days and that was because of a very serious cough that made me cough out blood and big globs of black mucus. This scared me but the stress made me start smoking again. 

My current attempt is probably my 16th or 17th and I can honestly say  even though this time the withdrawal symptoms were pretty heavy (I spent almost 60% the first 3 days in my bed). Everything worked out perfectly and I never craved a single puff, even now as I write this message I feel so amazing its like a cloud has been lifted off my brain. Everything seems so clear. I'm not anvious at all, not nervous talking to people. As a smoker I would always be so fidgety and wouldnt be able to sit still. Smoking is a curse money-hungry corporations have put on us and we need to stop. We are humans and we don't need a cancer-stick to help us feel good, what we need is a nice deep breathing exercise or a walk in nature. Something that'll make you feel good and live longer, instead of killing your body slowly and causing all types of damage to your vital organs.

Never give up on quitting smoking because you never know your next try might be the one.

I for one will never go back to this filthy habit, even though all my friends are smokers. I love judging these guys now every time they're fiending a smoke. I can't believe I was like that.

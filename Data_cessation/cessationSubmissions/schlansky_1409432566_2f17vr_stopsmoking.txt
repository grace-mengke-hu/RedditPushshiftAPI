Now I finally understand why my previous attempts of quitting never worked.

I subconsciously believed, that a cigarette would be missing if I had a perfect moment - like watching a sunset, being in a great place, feeling happy etc. What an illusion.

Had an awesome camping trip from Slovenia to Italy. My friends and I drank and talked quite a lot, enjoyed the nature, jumped in rivers and swam in the ocean. 

Smoking crossed my mind once - on the first evening of our trip.
I sat in a valley watching the stars for the first time in my life without any light pollution. I was stunned and genuinely impressed by the beauty of the sky.

And then a friend interrupted this moment and asked if anyone had a cigarette left, because he lost his pack. Another friend replied, that he only had 5 left, and would need them in order to enjoy the rest of the evening. Another one answered, that he knew a place where they could buy cigarettes. So they went to buy some and returned 45 minutes later. The sky by then was cloudy. They missed true beauty that night.

Cigarettes dontÂ´t enhance perfect moments - they destroy them. 

**tldr** Went camping for a week - many beers and zero cigarettes.

Worse than the cravings

Ever since the first day, I've had a lot more trouble with mood swings, anxiety, and mild panic attacks than I have with actual cravings. Trying to just keep focused on some objective sense of reality, but the emotional whiplash is wearing on me. 

As a side note, this is my first post on this sub. You've all been *extremely* helpful during these last few days. Thanks!

day 21 of no nicotine of any sorts...

I started with champix but the side affects are so nasty i dropped it about a week ago. still pretty grumpy, terse but feeling a little better every day. even today i still feel withdrawal. i think because i am not coughing i have been swallowing all that shit in my lungs and it has been making me sick. its all good though because it is just pissing me off and making my resolve more.. this is year 25 for me smoking.

21 days - at least $462 saving (just under 2 packs a day, gum, mouthwash etc to hide that i smoke)

Today I just don’t feel like it.

I just don’t want to stay quit. 

Alittle background. I’ve been quit for 9 days. I’m 27 years old. I started when I was 13. I smoked a pack every 5 days. So being a “lighter” smoker I keep convincing myself that it won’t catch up to me. But it has. I mean is been 14 years I’m still smoking. If I don’t quit now in 14 more years ill still be smoking and then what I’ll have kids and it will miraculously make me be super ready and over cigarettes entirely?

While the smoker in me wants to believe it. The non smoker knows better. I’ll just smoke more because real life will actually be happening and if I can’t deal with my 27 year old life when real issues arrive later.. you can bet I’ll leave on smoking. 

So I’m not happy and I don’t feel better but I won’t let myself walk to the store and buy a pack of cigarettes. Because while I want and crave one now having that pack will do more damage.

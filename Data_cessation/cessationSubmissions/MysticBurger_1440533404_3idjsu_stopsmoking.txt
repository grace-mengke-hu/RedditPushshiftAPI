Quit smoking, now my skin looks terrible, what gives?

I have scars from acne and they seem like they have gotten worse since I've quit. I know circulation is affected by smoking, but I guess it has to get worse before it gets better.

Have any of you experienced this? If so what can I do about it besides wait?

How do you stay on track after quitting smoking?

I haven't smoked since a week now. But I've been down this road quite a lot before and the longest Period I was smoke free was 3-4 weeks. I have these small urges when I'm out drinking or when I'm going back home after a long day at the office. How do I fight these urges? What did you do to fight these urges? Any help would be appreciated.

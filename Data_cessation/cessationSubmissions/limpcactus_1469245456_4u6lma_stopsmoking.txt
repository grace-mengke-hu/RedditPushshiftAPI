Smoked a few today. I always slip up around this one person and it's starting to frustrate me.

I've been doing pretty solid by quitting via e-cigarettes....except when I have a shift scheduled with my boss. Every time I'm scheduled with her, I end up bumming a cigarette. I can go days otherwise without caving in.

I'm not sure what it is exactly. my guess is that it's the social aspect of it. She steps outside, it feels awkward to follow her out there and only vape. That, plus on days I work with her she schedules this particularly annoying and incompetent employee with us. Every weekend. Smoking on these shifts was a relief because I could escape the stupidity of this employee. 

I caved, bought a pack. It was extremely unsatisfying. Does anyone have advice on how to deal with smoking as a means to socialize and how to avoid that trap? Right now it's the only thing messing with my quitting.

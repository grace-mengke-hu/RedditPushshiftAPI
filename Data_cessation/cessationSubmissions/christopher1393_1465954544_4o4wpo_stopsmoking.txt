Help with smokers flu, 2 weeks into quiting

Hey guys, I need some help with smokers flu. I quit smoking 2 weeks ago and I feel proud of myself. Last week I found half a box of rolling tobacco and a molboro cigeratte in my suit jacket (from the last night I smoked) and as difficult as it was I decided not to smoke them. I still havent thrown them out because I know from experience of failed attempts of quitting that if I am really craving a cigarette and there is none near me, I will find myself buying a box but whenever there is some near I can talk myself out of it. I plan to bin them at the end of the month.

I smoked on and off for my four years in college and in my final year which just ended I found myself smoking more then I ever have thanks to stress.

I do feel good about quitting for what I hope is for good. Cravings arent a huge issue, they are very infrequent and usually very mild, its the smokers flu thats getting me.

Luckily the chest tightness is going away, havent felt it in about 3 days and when last I did it was a lot milder then it was before. Headaches are subsiding and I feel myself breathing easier (I swear to god I am breathing comfortably through my nose for what feel like the first time in 4 years haha)

All thats left is the sore throat that started up when I quit and hasnt really gotten any better. I know its my body detoxing but this sore throat is driving me crazy. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle it? 2 weeks of a sore throat is honestly pissing me off way more than not smoking. 

Anyone else who was in a similar situation can you offer me some advice? What can I do for my throat to help ease it and make it heal faster?
Thanks :)

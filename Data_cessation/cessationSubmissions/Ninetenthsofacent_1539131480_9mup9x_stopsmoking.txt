Going from smoke free to vape free to patch... any advice? Worried about nicotine levels and depression

So... I went from a pack a day of Marlboros to a 1.8% e-cigarette (nothing fancy) but I did do a lot of it.  I'm assuming too much.  I'm wondering if there is anyone here that can speak to stepping off using e-cigarettes quite a bit and going to a patch and or cold turkey, as I'll just be going from nicotine to nicotine, but I'm thinking that it could still cause issues somehow, and I'm wondering what I might expect.  Thank you for your support, only one more step...

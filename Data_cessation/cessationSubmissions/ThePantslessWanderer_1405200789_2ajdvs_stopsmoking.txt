People who used to use smoking as a coping mechanism, what did you replace it with?

For the past few years I've been using cigarettes to deal with stress or anxiety. Stressed about an exam? Step outside the library, have a cigarette, feel the tightness that was taking over my chest subside, go back into the library. Crying? Suck on a cigarette like a baby would a pacifier and all would be well.

Well, now I've been trying to quit for the past few months but I realized that I have no coping mechanisms for stress or anxiety other than smoking. It's pretty hard to quit when my choice is to have an emotion breakdown or just smoke a cigarette.

So, for those of you who used smoking as a coping mechanism, what did you replace it with?

EDIT: thanks guys! knowing that my stress levels will go way down is really motivating me to quit and hopefully i get there soon

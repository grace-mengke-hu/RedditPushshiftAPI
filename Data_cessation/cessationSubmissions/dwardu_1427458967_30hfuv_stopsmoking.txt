Started again in October 2013 so i gave up on this. but I decided to cut it again, been 6 days so far.

On the bright side smoking helped me lose a well deserved 24kg a year ago. I was thinking whether i should slow it down for example take 1 or 2 during the weekends just to slowly forget it and not go cold turkey on myself because since i've stopped ive been extremely twitchy and nervous. This should also stop me from over eating.

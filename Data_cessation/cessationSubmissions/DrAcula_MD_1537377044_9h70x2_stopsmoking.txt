I need help quitting

So I have been smoking for about 3 years and my wife has begged me to stop multiple times and I have quit for a day or two multiple times but always go back to it. I am 26 with a stressful job, a wife, a 2.5yr old son, and all the headaches that come with it. I don't drink because I dont like the taste or feeling but I smoke weed every night. I feel like I need something to deal with the stress because Everytime I say it's my last one, something crazy happens at work or at home and I just NEED that cigarette to calm my nerves. I want to quit but I also am scared to quit. Without this vice to help me get through the day I am worried I may have a nervous breakdown or anxiety attack. I am a very habitual person who has been dealing with ADHD for my entire life. I don't know if it's the nicotine or the ritual of the whole process but it calms me down and let's me clear my head to think clearer. I really want to quit for my family but I'm not sure I want to do it for myself which scares me more. Cold turkey is not working, so please if there is any advice that can help me I would love to hear it.

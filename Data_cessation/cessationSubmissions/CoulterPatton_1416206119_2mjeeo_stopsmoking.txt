Dealing With The Smoking Lifestyle While Quitting?

Howdy ya'll,

I'm 35 going on 36 next month. I told myself last year that I didn't want to be a smoker by the time my next birthday came around and I've been trying in the recent months to quit. 

I've managed to go a week or so, but I always cave because my social life tends to revolve around going to bars â€“ specifically bars that have smoking patios. It's not my choice to do so, but I don't have a car so I'm often at the mercy of what my friends want to do. And they always want to go to places where they can smoke.

I don't want to be rude and tell them I can't hang out for some indefinite period of time while I deal with quitting, but I also find it VERY difficult to spend an entire evening on a smoking patio surrounded by other smokers. I know because I've tried in the past and I always wind up going nuts. It's not fun for me.

Part of me wants to just stay home, but I don't think isolation is a healthy answer either.

Basically I feel stuck between spending my nights being tortured by the desire to smoke or spending my nights alone with no social life.

Any tips on dealing with situations like these?

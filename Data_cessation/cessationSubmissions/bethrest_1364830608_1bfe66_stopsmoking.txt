I'm on my 9th day without cigarettes, never thought I'd be able to do this.

I know 9 days doesn't seem like much... but I've tried to quit countless times and I always gave in the moment it became a struggle.

Now that I'm over a week into this, it's so much easier than I thought it could be.

I just want to thank all of you guys, this is such an excellent support system and I don't think I'd have had as much success without you.

THANK YOU /r/stopsmoking !!!! Keep on rockin' in the free world.

Proud of myself

I have been a smoker for 3 years. So far I have been one day cigarette free, I have been using an ecigarette to counteract the withdrawal. Tomorrow I will be going on a hike and to the gym. I know it's only been one day but it's one day without a cigarette. I am proud of myself. It only gets easier, I hope. This is my first attempt to truly quit. I keep telling myself the mantra NOT ONE MORE PUFF or whatever it is. I am going to keep my mind active. Anything else I should do? I have thrown out all my lighters and downloaded the Smoke Free app.  I truly believe in myself this time and need all the support I can get.

4 days, 100 cigarettes not smoked

I'm on day 4 - first work day without cigarettes. I've been using the vape all weekend and the first couple of days were a BREEZE - like, super easy. Today is... really hard. My brain was screaming at me to smoke this morning so much I started crying. After some vaping, I felt better but still uneasy. 

It's around the time I have my first smoke at work. I'm going to go for a vape. I'm sweaty and I can't concentrate. I feel almost like an anxiety attack is coming. And I'm not even going through nicotine withdrawal. The urge to smoke is SO STRONG right now.

Please, I need some words of encouragement. Tell me it will get better. I'm going to read my "reasons to quit" now.

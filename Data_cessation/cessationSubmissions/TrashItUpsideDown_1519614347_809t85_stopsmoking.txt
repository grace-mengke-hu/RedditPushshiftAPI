Favorite thing so far.

So even though I've been craving a cig for 4 days now, I haven't given in. And the most noticeable thing for me, other than the 15-20 bucks I've saved, is my tongue. Man my tongue used feel like it was burnt to a crisp sometimes. I've still got a little bit on a weird sensation there still but way better than it was. Food is just starting to taste better and I can't wait for it to get even better. Thinking about that makes it easier to get through those cravings.

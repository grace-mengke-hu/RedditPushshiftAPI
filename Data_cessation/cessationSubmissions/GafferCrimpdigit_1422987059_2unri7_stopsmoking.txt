I'm in trouble

I just need to get this off my chest. I "quit" yesterday by starting the day with 2 cigarettes in the morning, then no more for the rest of the day. This morning I had 1 and a dirty leftover stub. I'm home from work now and I'm in trouble, I'm losing the battle of wills with my mind and I'm slowly convincing myself to just try again tomorrow and start over again. I've been saying this for weeks now. I don't feel like I'm a non-smoker at the moment and it's stupid, I know I'm going to cave but I know I shouldn't. Help :(

What a shitty day

Woke up feeling like I really wanted to start smoking again. Got ridiculously angry at my dog for bringing a shoe outside. Went to work and thought about smoking all day. Came home and got angry again cause no one else cleans up . Held one of my hubby's cigarettes in my hand. Sniffed it. Fought with the part of my brain screaming for a puff. Started bawling my eyes out. Put the cigarette away. Made a cup of tea and am now laying here hugging my dogs and feeling calmer. Thanks for listening.  I just needed to get it off my chest with people who understand.  Who's not smoking with me todayâœŒ

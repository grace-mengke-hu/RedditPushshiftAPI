So Today is my 7th day soon in 5 hrs my 8th day.... It seems easy now. But...

So now i am so close to 8 complete days of being smoke free and i feed amazing. Ive noticed all those good changes of my car smelling better, my clothes not smelling like smoke, easier to so up stairs and go around, thats just about it i think... but i am on this spray stuff. 

The nicorrett spray nicotine something ... I have been resisting to take it but there are those times when all i can think about are smoking and i just want to make the cravings go away and i spray some into my mouth and soon it just isnt there anymore.

I dont think this is too bad. i think.... For me it cuts the edge down and stops me from further cycling of thoughts and just gives me enough to stop myself from going insane. But as ive said ive been resisting to take it as others say it is bad containing nicotine and its hard to stop.

So all weekend i didnt take anything and here i am still strong without any help from the spray (which i bought a lot of from costco thinking i wouldnt be able to do it alone) and i feel stronger then ever.

Ive just kept reading the stories here and talking to people who seem in my similar situation. And i think the dieting seems to be helping doing it simotaniously with quitting smoking. I dont know how or how to explain but it does. with me at least.

The fidgetting seems to of gone down... a little... Im very proud of myself for getting this far and do intend to continue down this path feeling so much better then i did before i made the best decision (tough one) but best one ive made health wise.

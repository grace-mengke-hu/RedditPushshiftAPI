Trying

So, I've just smoked the last cig in my pack and in my mind, I'm telling myself that this is it and I'm quitting, I have the whole week off and there's no better time. Although, I've done this before and I never get past the first urge really. I just give in. I really hope that I can stay strong this time. I have very little faith in my self after trying to do this 15+ times now.

Stopped smoking nearly 8 months ago.

Hello dear redditors. I stopped smoking 7 months and 24 days ago (on new year holidays) , for which I am very grateful to my girlfriend,she always supported me and this support helped me to quit cold turkey. But then several weeks after quitting I started to experience bowel symptoms,and eventually was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. This is constant torture. Now I use nicotine patch that helps to alleviate symptoms of UC. I was initially prescribed with budesonide capsules , but they caused side effects,and eventually I found doctor who prescribed me nicotine patches. Sorry, this is probably of no interest to anyone, but I caution everyone who has a family history of ulcerative colitis from quitting smoking cold turkey. This could almost double your suffering. Sorry everyone,I just lost hope, it's just a cry of the soul, I will not wish this to anyone (even the worst enemy).

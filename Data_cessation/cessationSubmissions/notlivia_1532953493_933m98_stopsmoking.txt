rhinitis seems to be getting worse after stopping

so it's been almost a week since I last smoked (yay me) and my rhinitis is bothering me a lot. when i used to smoke it would get really bad if i smoked a pack in a day or something like that, but it would pass the next day if i smoked again. now it's been coming and going for the past week and my nose is irritated from all the tissues. 
did anyone else have this? has it gotten better aftet u quit? god this is so hard

3 years and staying strong! You can do it too. Thanks /r/stopsmoking

After 3 years I really really know I won't smoke again. 

I saved over 4000â‚¬ on this journey. I can run faster, I breathe way better, and most important of all I feel fucking proud about myself. 

I know you can do it too! Here are my progress posts, for encouragement and inspo:

* [1st month post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/30xl4b/the_8_day_seaside_trek_that_helped_me_while/) when everything started, with pics of my 8 day solo trek that helped me quit.
* [1 year post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/48h09g/it_had_one_more_day_than_usual_but_one_year/ ) When I share all the amazing things I made with the money I saved: 

* [2 year post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/5x260x/two_years_i_decided_to_make_a_bbq_for_my_friends/) When I invite my friends to a BBQ with the money I saved.

If you read until this point, and you are still a smoker... what are you waiting for! I know you can do it!

If you read all this and you also quitted: I AM FUCKING PROUD OF YOU.

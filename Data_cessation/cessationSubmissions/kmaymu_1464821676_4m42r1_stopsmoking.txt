Day 12

Ok..... So day 12 is looming...... When will it feel any better? Smoking seems to be on my mind constantly. I dream of smoking lol. I try to watch a film......some rotter is on my tv smoking. Ahhhhhh!!!!!! 😖😖😖 I've got the NRT stuff, got the app....... Which tells me I'm at 11 days, 52 minutes smoke free 👍...... But when I read it my brain is still saying....Hey, just go get a fag 😫😫😫😫

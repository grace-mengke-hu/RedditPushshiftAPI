We just got done watching John Oliver bash the hell oit of the tobacco industry and my husband still won't quit.

It won't stop me from quitting, but I'm scared for him.   I've thought about coming off my medications until he does, to force him to do it, but that won't work and will do a lot more harm than good.  I'm only treating my illness because he aked me too, he doesn't want to lose me, but he won't quit smoking!  I can't make him.  I know he has to want to.  Im just so frustrated and scared.

This subreddit gives me hope and terrifies me at the same time

On one hand, the advice to the guys who have stopped for a short while is very helpful, but on the other hand, the posts about people who have gone 5 years relapsing or the battle never ending make me more anxious than ever. Feels to me like everyone believes the idea: "once a smoker, always a smoker." and my whole life will be a battle of will even if I quit. Just a little rant to keep me sane.

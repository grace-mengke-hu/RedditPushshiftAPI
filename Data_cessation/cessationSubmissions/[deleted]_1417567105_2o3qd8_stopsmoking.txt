7 months

7 months of fighting cravings. 7 months of saying no. 7 months of fresh smells and easy breathing. 7 months of young, beautiful, and healthy skin. 7 months of no coughing (besides when I had my cold last week). 7 months of not sneaking around or making excuses. I'm a quitter. I'm strong. I'm a non-smoker.

5 months done!

I'm a few days late though.

I'd like to thank everyone on this sub - those of you who have succeeded and those of who posted when you guys fell off the wagon.

I read these posts when I start thinking over why I quit, and believe me I haven't picked up a lit cigarette (I like to fuck around with friends who smoke, and because of that one guy managed to quit too).

If you're one of those who have failed in an attempt and posted your experience, I really appreciate your input, and I hope you guys manage to quit completely!

**Good Luck!**

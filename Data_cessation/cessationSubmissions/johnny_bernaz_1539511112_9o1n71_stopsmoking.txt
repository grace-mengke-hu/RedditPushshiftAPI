Trying to quit, need help!

So i've been wanting to quit for quite a while now, i just couldnt find the right moment. The last 6 months were very stressful since all i did for 12 hours was study and i always needed a break then.

Before that i tried quitting alot of times but i couldnt even get trough for 1 day.

But now that has passed, i feel like this is a good time to quit. I've tried alot of methods (trying vaping, chewing gum, sunflower seeds, etc) but nothing has worked until now. I've read Allen Carr's book but it hasnt helped me. The thing is that book didnt contain anything i didnt know about smoking. I know all the downsides of it, but i cant stop.

Right now im really trying to quit, started going to the gym, but i still smoke.

Any tips?

Starting my path to a cigarette free life today!!! Need ideas for an alternative for the first few days.

ive had enough.  I started smoking habitually 3 years ago and ive stopped for a month on 3 separate occasions but i keep letting myself get dragged back into it.  I cant let it happen again!!!!  I try to stay active and live a healthy lifestyle but i cant be a healthy person if i am a smoker.  The first few days are always the hardest, so if anyone has suggestions for a substitute that i can turn to when I feel a jones coming on please let me know!

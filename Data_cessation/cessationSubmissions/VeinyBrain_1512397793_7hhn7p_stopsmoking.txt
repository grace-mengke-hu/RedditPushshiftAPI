I’m a very light smoker and still have problems quitting

I’ve never smoked a lot, but quitting is hard. I’ve had 1 or 2 cigarettes a day for the whole time i have smoked (4 years). I’ve smoked maybe 10 at parties when drunk but that doesn’t happen all too often.
Now, I want to quit for good. Thing is, I smoke so little that I always convince myself that 1 or 2 a day (I really maintain those numbers easily) is not so bad. I enjoy them for real, I have one in the morning while sitting in the sun with my coffee and then one on the afternoon with a coke. Still, it’s just not right to smoke. I want to quit those. 

Help? Advice?

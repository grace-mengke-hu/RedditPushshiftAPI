It's been 627 days since I had my last smoke and I have finally convinced my subconscious that this is for real!

Dreamed that I was offered a smoke by a friend who got more and more insistent. In my dream I was shouting at him

"I DON'T SMOKE!!!"

This guy has given me smokes in my dreams before. I usually take them and wake up feeling awful. This time was different :)

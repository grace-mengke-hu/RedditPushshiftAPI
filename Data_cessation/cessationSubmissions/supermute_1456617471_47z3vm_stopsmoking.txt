I don't want to do this anymore

I planned my quit for today, and here I am smoking a cigarette. So I decided to change it to tomorrow, and then earlier today I decided to change it to the day after. This is getting old. I'm never going to quit until I stop putting this off. I popped into this sub right now and saw my badge for 317 days. That's how long I would have been a non-smoker if I had succeeded the last time I tried to quit. I could have done a lot with the $1850 I spent on cigarettes since then. I'm not sure why I just gave up and continued smoking for 317 days. 

Anyway, tonight is the night. Tomorrow I will wake up a non-smoker, and hopefully for good. This time, if I for some reason end up smoking again, I'm just going to quit again immediately after, and again, and again, and again, until it finally sticks. I can do this. This cannot be as hard as I'm making it. I don't even like the damn things.

Once more into the battle!

Hey guys! Just discovered this sub on my first day of quitting(today incidentally) and thought I would briefly share my story.

I quit a few years back and lasted a whole year without nicotine, and then stupidly accepted a cig whilst out having a drink thinking "I'm well past it, one won't hurt." I can see you all face palming right now. :P

But yeah, I quit weed last week, and have been doing great without that. Plus, I've been using an ecig for the last two months, which I recommend to anyone who wants to stop using tobacco, quit altogether etc. But last night, it broke on me. Now, I don't believe in god, or fate or anything like that, but it just felt like right time to say goodbye to nicotine again.

So yeah, day one again! I know what to look forward to over the next couple of weeks but, frankly, it can kiss my arse! I'm done with the stuff and just want to feel as healthy as I did during that year without.

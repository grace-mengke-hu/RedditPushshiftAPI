16 days smoke free. Want to share my story and learn about this sub

First day here but I like this sub already! I haven't replied to any comments here as of yet (really resisting that urge) because Im not sure how this sub feels about the EASYWAY. Just figured Id share my story and go from there.

I was offered a copy of the EASYWAY to stop smoking by a friend who had quit and was instantly drawn in after the first chapter. I followed all the directions but thought I could still vape and obviously failed miserably. I also use other drugs so I thought I could just vape when intoxicated and then be straight when at work, sober etc. After a year and a half of smoking and getting increasingly fed up with the addiction I decided it was time to try the EASYWAY again as I had stopped for 5 days the last time around before relapsing. This last time has been veeeery different.

I read the book for the second time and followed another friends' advice and set a solid date and vowed to finish the book again the night before (you're supposed to smoke throughout reading the book and dont quit until you finish it). This time around I really thought about the concepts in the books and really bought in and surrendered to the principles of the book as they really resonate with me and its really astounding how easy the whole process has been. Once you can truly convince yourself that smoking does nothing for you, and that you will be better off without cigs and that you arent depriving yourself of anything, its seriously like deciding to stop smashing your hand with a hammer. Its hard to explain but one of the reasons I quit was because my girlfriend was starting to smoke more when I was around and I felt responsible. I quit and she has honestly had a harder time giving it up then I have ( I smoked for 12 years)and I really think the book was the difference.  She has continued to smoke because she still thinks she is depriving herself of something.  She doesnt think she will ever be able to enjoy drinking as much without it when thats just not the case. I havent had a cigarette in 16 days and Allen Carr's method has been the only method that worked for me I tried everything from willpower to vaping to Snus to cigars. I think that this method has worked so well for me was because I was  able to look at smoking through a different lens and really evaluate myself in a way I never had. There are some things in the book I obviously disagree with and I know for sure the author uses some logical fallicies but I felt like in this case it didnt matter when the end goal was helping me quit ingesting poison. it was sort of like suspending disbelief in a way

What do ya'll thing about Allen Carr's book? I know me and 2 others who have quit using this book and we all agree that it was confusingly easy going this route. What issues did you encounter going this route? I know the minor identity crisis and feeling of something missing was the only real drawback I experienced. I would love to hear from other Easyway quitters as well.

Wh does this sub feel about this method and should I even try helping people here with what I learned? I am really excited about what Ive found but dont want to put anyone off.

Working out has been the best thing to do while quitting

I’m 4 months in and it’s been great. My heart rate has lowered significantly. I’m down almost 40 pounds. I’m feeling the best I have in forever. 

I started working out and dieting because I was over weight and wanted to be healthy but I knew so many people gained weight when they quit and I did not want that to be me. So, with the money I’ve saved with quitting, I got a gym membership and I hit the gym. I’m a noob and have stuck to cardio. I love the stationary bike. Smoking is a coping mechanism. We suppress *so* many emotions smoking, and we don’t even realize it. So, when I had a craving or a shit day and really wanted to smoke, I hit the gym. Or, I’d jump in my pool and swim for an hour. It helped curb the cravings and in turn, I’m helping my cardiovascular system &amp; body by getting healthy. 

Has this worked for anyone else? Hopefully this can help someone struggling to find ways to curb the cravings and triggers and find a healthier outlet. :)

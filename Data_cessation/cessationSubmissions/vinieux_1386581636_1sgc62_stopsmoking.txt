352 days, a slip up (not quite), guilt and a learning

Since stopping almost a year ago, I've had many dreams about smoking, sometimes waking up with guilt, sometimes waking up in relief. 

Last night, after 350 odd days, I had another dream, proving that this shit really sticks with you.

However, I had an epiphany about the guilt / relief one has when waking up from such a dream. 

I realised that if I dream I am smoking (like I used to) and wake up  to realise it was just a dream, then what I feel is relief. But, if I dream I'm smoking and realise that I've given in to temptation within the dream itself, then when I wake up I feel more guilt than relief. 

Anybody else who has experienced this?

Could use a little advice

I'm about to hit 24 hours with no smokes. It's pretty clear cravings aren't going to be a problem, they've been mild at worst compared to previous attempts. The only issue I'm having is the insomnia. 


I work nights and my girlfriend works days so I already have to work a little magic to keep up with sleep and still do the things I want but I've reached a point where I can flip my sleep schedule completely around in a day. 


Until now. I guess my main question is: **How long will the insomnia last?**

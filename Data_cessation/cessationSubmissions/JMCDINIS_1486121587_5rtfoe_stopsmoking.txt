First steps today

I decided to quit yesterday, but I was at home. Even having smoked in the afternoon I wanted one again so bad.

But today is the real day. It will be harder because yesterday I couldn't smoke at all. Today I'll have the chance, but I'll have to make myself say no. Today is my first day, wish me luck.

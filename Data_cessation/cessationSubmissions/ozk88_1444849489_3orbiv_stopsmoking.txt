2 and a half week smoke free

Whose your daddy nicotine?  I own you.  Not the other way around.

That in a nutshell is why I quit smoking.  I didn't like the fact that it had power over me.  It's liberating to dictate every move of the day without having to take a smoke break which just halts momentum.  No more energy killers.

Staying quit is the hard part.  I'm aware, but let's do this everyone.  I believe in you all!

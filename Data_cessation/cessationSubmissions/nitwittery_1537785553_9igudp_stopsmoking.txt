Swapped the cigs for a vape (6mg) one week ago. Forgot the vape at home today!

I'm going to try and do this! Currently experiencing pretty strong cravings and anxiety/nervous energy (plus a tiny bit of mild nausea). I have some nicotine gum just in case it gets totally unbearable, but I really want to try and get through today cold turkey so could use as much support as people are willing to give! Any tips on how to stop myself crawling out of my skin would also be very helpful, but on the whole, I'm feeling pretty positive!

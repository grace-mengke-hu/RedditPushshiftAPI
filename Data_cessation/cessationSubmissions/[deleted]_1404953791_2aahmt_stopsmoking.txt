A GOOD morning

Hello fellow non-smokers! This is my first ever time starting a thread so I might have to do some editing, please bear with me.

Anyway, today is my quit day, I've been reading this subreddit for a couple of days now after some pretty poor attempts to quit in the last month or so and have been really impressed with the feeling of support for members. 

I tried quitting in sections of my day, mornings at work, then mornings and afternoons at work, building up the length each day but then I realised that I was smoking almost as much during the times I "permitted" myself to smoke as I did previously when I just smoked whenever I wanted to. I relapsed after that for several weeks coming up with the usual excuses for not quitting that day.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2a4le4/im_not_quitting/) thread really helped me, I *am* a non-smoker and I will continue to be.

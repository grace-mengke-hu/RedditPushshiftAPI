Relapse after almost 3 month

Hey guys,

I stopped smoking in May and tonight I relapsed. I’ve been feeling super stressed lately and I had a cigarette. 

Do guys know if this will have an effect on my withdrawal. Does it cancel all my efforts?
I’m feeling so bad right now for having failed. I can’t say « I stopped smoking more than two months ago » now. That’s something that actually made me proud and now I feel like it’s just gone.

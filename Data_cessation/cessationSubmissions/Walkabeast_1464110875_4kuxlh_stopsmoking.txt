Memorial day music fest

I bought these tickets when I was still smoking, and I hadn't planned on quitting, but here I am at 21 days and this weekend I'm going to a music fest, which is the biggest chain smoking event one can go to. All the triggers, beer, music, a lot of down time, drugs. Anyone have experience with going into these kind of situations? Or have I just put myself in a pretty much no-win situation of temptation?

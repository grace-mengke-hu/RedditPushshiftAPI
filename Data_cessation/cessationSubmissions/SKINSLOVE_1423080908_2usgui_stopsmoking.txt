Easy way Cliffs notes?

Hello friends, I'm looking for a kind of bulleted check list of points made in the book easyway. Ive listened to the audio, and am now reading it for further comprehension. Lately I've had some pretty heavy cravings and I'm looking for a reference to get my mind to reflect on the book during. Thanks everyone for all the support during my first week!

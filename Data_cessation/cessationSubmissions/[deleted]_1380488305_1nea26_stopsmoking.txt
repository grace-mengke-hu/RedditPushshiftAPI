September 29th it is.

Recently joined your amazing subreddit and finally decided to throw away the last pack. I read Easyway a year ago but unfortunately failed after 4 months of freedom. Today I was browsing reddit and /r/stopsmoking  and finally realised that I forgot about basic rules of Easyway. So today I looked at the book again and finally can say proudly - I'm a happy non-smoker!! Thank you reddit.

Is there any supplements or foods to eat that can reverse the damage done to our DNA?

I’m at that age where I’m starting to think more seriously about my mortality and health. I’ve not smoked for 2 weeks now but I am concerned about the permanent damage done to my DNA and body in general from smoking for 10 years.

I’m probably having wishful thinking here, but have there been any breakthroughs or progress made in the field of DNA repair? I’ve read a few studies about something called NAD and NMN. I’ve also heard good things about sulforaphane.

I’ve also read that Metformin has been shown to deliver increased oxygen to cells. My mom also says I should start eating fresh vegetables sourced from my local farmers market.

Unexpected bonuses

I love all of the side benefits that come along with being a non-smoker. Today I am appreciating that I can often get away with wearing outfits a second time since now they donâ€™t smell like smoke. Yay, less laundry!! Anyone have any other extra plusses that they have noticed since quitting? Thinking about all of the positives really helps me stay quit!

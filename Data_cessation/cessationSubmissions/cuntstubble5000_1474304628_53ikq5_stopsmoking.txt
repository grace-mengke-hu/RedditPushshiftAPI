I'm really disappointed in myself for ever starting this horrible habit

What a stupid kid I was.  Following the crowd.  Thinking I was cool.  Getting addicted.  And jeopardising my health.

I've gone about a week without cigarettes now, been vaping instead but intending to give that up too fairly soon.

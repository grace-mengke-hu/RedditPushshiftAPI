I've now been smoking for 20 years and I just can't seem to quit.  Need some advice from other long term smokers.

I turned 38 years old this past December and realized that I have been smoking for 20 years.  I have now been smoking for longer than I haven't been smoking.  It was really damn depressing.  The weird thing is is that I have been making attempts at quitting smoking since I was 21!  

Here's the thing, I want to quit.  I really do.  But I turn in to a righteous fucking prick every time I do.  Everyone I know demands that I smoke for their own reprieve.  I take it out on my wife, my kids and sometimes my co-workers.  

I've managed to quit for several months on Chantix to only seemingly force myself to start again later.  I have tried probably every method under the sun at least once except for hypnotism (of which I don't really believe it could work).  

Here's the thing, smoking is something I have done for so long, I don't know how I can live without it.  One of the doctor's I work with said that a lot of her patients don't quit until a heart attack or cancer of some sort.  I'd rather not wait that long.  I need some advice from some of you that have at least 15+ years of smoking of how you dealt with the anxiety of getting rid of something you did for over half your life.

Thanks in advance.

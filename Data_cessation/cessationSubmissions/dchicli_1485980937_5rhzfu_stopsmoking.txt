After a month smoke-free, this is my favorite oft-overlooked benefit of quitting: extra pocket space in my jeans!

It is so nice to have an entire pocket at my full disposal again. Even having it just being completely empty feels fantastic.

Also, another aspect I'm stoked about: as a frequent business traveler, when going through TSA, not having to fumble around to pull out a pack of smokes and a lighter and stuff them in my backpack is all just so relieving. I know it's minor and may seem dumb to some, but to me it's incredible. I've also survived multiple flight delays and cancellations, starting around day 3 of my quit, which left me stuck in Atlanta for hours, all without venturing outside or into the smoking rooms even once. What a waste of time and energy!

Happy quitting everybody! I wish you much success.

folded again...

Getting quite pathetic, but it's my foul mood that i can't deal with again. My girlfriend has said. "i'm not putting up with you again, like he last time you quit" so thats made me feel loads more confident (hint: it hasn't) so, fellow smokers/ex-smokers, best stategy for mood swings? I know i went 84 days, but right now, it just seems impossible and it's like I've forgotten what quitting felt like and all that's going through me now is nerves, apprehension, fear and worry. This sucks. Why did i fucking smoke again!?!

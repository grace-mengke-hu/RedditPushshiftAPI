I'm almost 3 months in... (Somewhat long post warning)

My badge is a little misleading because I've relapsed a couple times but I'm officially almost 3 months without a cigarette!! I've hit my buddies vape a few times here and there when drinking so I'm not 100% nicotine free (I never really had an issue with nicotine anyway) but I'm so happy to have made it this far without smoking the little death sticks!! :)

I wanted to share this because last night after two rather large long island iced teas I got blindsided by a super intense craving that lasted almost an hour. It was brutal! I've had a lot of stress lately and started a new sales job where I swear everyone smokes but I have not caved once, not even vaping, never really crosses my mind when I'm sober. So in my slightly inebriated state I was really scared it was going to kill my progress, so much so that I called of the festivities early and went to bed to prevent myself from smoking. Sure it wasn't ideal, but it was for the best.

The moral of the story is I see a lot of posts on here about "when will it get better?", "does it get better?", etc. from new forlorn non smokers and the truth is, it really does, but nicotine addiction is powerful and lifelong so you must realize that you can never let your guard down ever! Being smoke free is so worth it, having to carry around a little mental guard all the time is so worth it to keep you healthy and happy, and it does get easier I promise.

Cheers to 3 months folks! NOT ONE PUFF EVER! Thanks for being an awesome, supportive community.

Almost at day 100!

I recently lost some important possessions of mine; my watch, glasses, and new phone. I was quite sad about the phone since I finally got to upgrade from my old phone to the iphone 5 but all I know is that I managed to not crumble under the lost of such petty things and not smoke a single cigarette.

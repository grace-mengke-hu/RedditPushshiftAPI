Why does my entire body fucking itch?

I feel like tearing my skin off and getting a new one. Going cold turkey, been 48 hours. It is fucking torture, how this is going to improve my life when I can't fucking think straight while playing video games let alone work or have a god damn normal human conversation.

I have been smoking since I was 11, 20 years, if I knew I would suffer this fucking much I would not even have tried quieting. sigh...

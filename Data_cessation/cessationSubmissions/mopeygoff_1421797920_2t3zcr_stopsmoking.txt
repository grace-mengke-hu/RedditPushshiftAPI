No patches, no problem!

So today I decided to try to see how far I could get without a nicotine patch, especially considering my dismay with how the off-brand patches "worked" (or, in fact, didn't). I've been up for approximately 12 hours and have not had a single nicotine craving. Not one! 

I have the patch in my coat pocket "just in case"  but I'm thinking I don't need it.

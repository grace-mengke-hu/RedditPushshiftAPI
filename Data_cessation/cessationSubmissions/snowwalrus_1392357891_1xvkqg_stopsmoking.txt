Anyone know anyone who has quit smoking easily?

I knew a 55 year old carpenter I worked with who smoked two packs of Marlboro reds a day.  One day at work I asked to bum a smoke off him and he said "I quit."

"Really?  When?"

"This morning."  So I figured we'd be smoking together by lunchtime.  But it didn't happen.  I worked with him for five more years and never saw him smoke another cigarette.  I asked him about it, and he said, "I just got sick of it,"  and shrugged.  And I asked him if he found it hard to quit, and he said the same thing everyone else I know in real life who has successfully quit says.  "Not if you put your mind to it."

The reason I bring this up is because, looking at this subreddit, I get the impression that quitting is the most awful experience, a constant struggle.  It's important remember that this is a support site...that by its very nature, it's only going to attract people who are having trouble.  I also worry that some of the stories of misery are going to scare off, or delay, potential quitters.

So let's hear some stories of people who didn't find it hard.  There have to be some.  

(I'm only on day 2, but so far, I've just been amazed at how easy it has been.)

50 Days!

As I just started I was so excited to eventually hit one month, not to speak 50 days of not smoking.

Finally after 50 days into me quitting smoking cigarettes I can finally say that there isn´t much of a struggle to abstain from smoking anymore while at the same time the positive health effects become more and more obvious.

I don´t get cramps in my legs anymore, can ride my bike for almost as long as I want to and before I quitted I could do hardly 30min without sweating like crazy and getting out of breath.

This makes doing sport much more enjoyable again and I plan on getting more into it now and realize that I really missed it.

And besides some cravings per day that are subsiding quickly there is not much more going on and if I stay convinced that I don´t want to smoke there is not much I have to fight against at this point and even after about 3 weeks in it tended to be like that but it is getting easier and easier as times moves on.  
Those cravings can still be intense though if they happen, but they are shortlived and after and before them I don´t think about smoking at all.

Once again I want to encourage anyone who is doubting if they can make it to give it a try and though the first hard days out, because just 1-2 weeks in it will already become less difficult.

My father, who I told much about me trying and succeeding to quit smoking has now started to stop smoking cigarettes as well and he is 4 days in. He even does it Cold Turkey, while I couldn´t do it without NRT, but the only thing that is important is to get rid of this nasty habit.

Hope you are doing fine and are making the right decisions.

Wish you well.

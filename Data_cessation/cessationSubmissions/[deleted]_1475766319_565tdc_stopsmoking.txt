Very strong cravings after a meal? Any advice?

Hey guys so I was doing well until I ate lunch, and my mind convinced me to have a smoke which I am smoking as I am writing this. I don't want this to be a habit where I smoke after every meal and cave in after every meal. 
Do any experienced quitters have any advice? 
I would very much appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.

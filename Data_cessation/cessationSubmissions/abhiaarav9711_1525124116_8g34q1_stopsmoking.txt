A life without cigarettes

I am 25 year old male. I smoked my first cig in class 9th. Which in India means that you are 12 or 13 years old. But until i was 17 i was not addictd to it. It was more like once in while kind of thing. Just to look cool as most teenagers start. In my engineering 2nd years i was going through rough time and i leaned at cig and i started it as a routine thing. I did not even realised when i got addicted to it. By the time i realised it has already become a habbit and suddenly i was smoking 20 cigg per day.
Its been 8 years. My stamina has lost gradually and now i virtually had no stamina at all. At least if i compare it to my previous self. 
1 month ago i was going through some problem healthwise and doctor wrote some tests. I went for it and i was shitting bricks thinking what if my ill deeds has caught up to me. During those 2 days i got my test results back i was horrified not for me but for my family. Constantly thinking about how devestated would they be? I have tried to quit in past too. Failed miserably of course. But this time i have not tried instead i decided to quit. Its been 26 days and counting. I am taking gums. But this time i know that i am not going back to that horrible thing because everytime i crave i think about those 2 days and how horrible it was. 
This group has helped me alot and i can proudly call myself as a non smoker. I am sure of it. I have joined gym and can do double the excercise than i used to. Above all i feel happy when i think of myself as a non smoker.
Thanks everyone. I will keep posting.

Stop Juuling (vaping): Nicotine Gum or Patches

Hey all,

Been looking to quit Juuling for quite some time now but have been very lost. Someone suggested either gum or patches and was like duh, obviously give that a shot.

I've seen both gum and patches on Amazon but all with a max of 4/5 star reviews; does anyone here have a preference for which has helped them the most?

I vape about one Juul pod a day (they say it's about a pack of cigarettes) and I'm thinking I'd do either 4mg nicotine gum or Step 1 patches.


Any input would be great, thank you!

Is this a good idea?

Hi everybody. 30 year smoker here, just under a pack a day. In about two weeks I am going on a cruise with the family and I am thinking the change of scenery and routine would be a good time to quit. Of course I know the pros, but are there any cons to quitting on a vacation? Will adapting to my normal routine be difficult when I get back?

For anyone who is having trouble with their nose/smoker's rhinitis after quitting, it can get better!

For months leading up to my quit day my nose was fucked. Blocked all the time, I'd go through 20 tissues at work, and my nose was so dry that my mucous was like crystals when I woke up (siff, I know!). A month after quitting, it was the same.

I have read that some people's noses never recover. I don't know if this is true. I had accepted my fate anyway but now I feel like I may have turned a corner. I can breathe better, I don't have to blow my nose 20 times in 6 hours and my mucous seems normal (yes, siff I know).

When I go to the grocery store, I am overwhelmed because I can smell every item on the shelves (no lie, it's actually becoming a bit of a burden :P).

You can try a humidifier as well. Good luck!

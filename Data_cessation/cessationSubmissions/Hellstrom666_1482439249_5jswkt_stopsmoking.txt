What to do at work?

I work as a barback at a bar/nightclub in Vancouver and every hour or so I would go out back for a smoke in the alley. It was a nice way to take a few minutes to myself and get refreshed. I work tonight for the first time since I quit and I'm wondering what people did to get past this?

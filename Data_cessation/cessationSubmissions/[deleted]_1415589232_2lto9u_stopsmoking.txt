Today I am done.

I was walking my boyfriend to his car this morning and he asked me when I was going to stop smoking. I tried three times before his birthday, it was going to be his present but I failed each time. He's been so supportive about it, not pressuring me too much and relating his experience quitting and how much better he feels now that its just the cape for him.

I was just listening and that's when I decided I was done. I won't do this anymore. I want to feel safe on my birth control, I want to do it for him, but most of all I want to be healthy again and not be tied down by this anymore. I just finished my last pack a minute ago and I want so badly to stick to this.

So here goes everything.

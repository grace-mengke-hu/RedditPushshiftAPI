Something I was taught during an earlier attempt of stopping, now that I really want to stop it definitely helps

If I get a craving I repeat this as needed, (you can do it out loud or in your head)

I hate 'em, I quit, I know I quit, I'm done, I'm free and I'm happy. 

See someone smoking and it makes you want one? Don't look at them as if they're the "lucky" one because they're smoking, pity them and think "you poor bastard" you're the lucky one, you're breaking free of an expensive, dirty, disgusting habbit. 

Stay strong everyone!

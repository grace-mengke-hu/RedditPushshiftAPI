Painful Gas

Is there a way around that?  I read around a bit, and understood that nicotine screws up the digestive system, and terrible, foul smelling gas in inevitable.  My concern here is the painful kind of gas.  I lift 6x a week and my diet is pretty much in check.  

Anyone else facing a similar problem?

HA.L.T. - A Helpful Tool

Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These are "trigger" states for many people and are NOT a good reason to smoke. My toddler kept me up half the night and I found myself craving for the first time in months. Acknowledging and accepting that I was really just tired and did not really want to smoke snapped me out of it pretty quick. 

So glad to finally feel like it is a CHOICE to smoke or not smoke!

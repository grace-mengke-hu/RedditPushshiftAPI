I started again looked at my badge and it said 444days and my heart sank.

Can't have one socially, can't have one every so often, and poisoning myself has reintroduced poor habits.  No gym, more drinking, and sneaking more cigarettes then I lead on like I'm a child to my girlfriend.  Just so disappointed right now.

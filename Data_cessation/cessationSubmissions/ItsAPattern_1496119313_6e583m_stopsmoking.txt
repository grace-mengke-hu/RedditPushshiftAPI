Here we go again

Trying again. I've been back on the cigarettes now for just under 2 years after being quit almost 5. I lost my mom very recently so it got even worse. But I'm not young and my body can't afford to handle this anymore. 

I did cold turkey with the easy way book last time, I've come around to vaping since then so will likely vape for a bit. I've been wanting and trying to quit for a while now, but hearing my mom's breathing in her final days was pretty shocking. 

Pray for me famðŸ˜‚

Unintentionally "quit", at crossroads, need kind words.

Hi everyone I'm new to this community and this site so if there's abbreviations and stuff I should know - sorry! 

I had surgery on Monday and since then haven't had a cigarette. I'm 22 and I've been smoking roughly 20 a day since I was 14. I enjoy smoking, I don't drink or do other harmful drugs but I know it's also been very detrimental to my health and finances.
I was planning on quitting soon. I have tried before (made it 6 weeks) and I know the steps I would've needed to take to get through the first few days. 
I was supposed to be going in for a day admission and a one week recovery, there seemed to be no reason why I couldn't continue my habit when I got home Monday. 
What instead happened was: complications, an overnight stay and I've spent the last week completely out of it. I woke up today ready to open my cigarette packet and realised it's now been 5 full days, the nicotine would be gone and my teeth feel so nice and clean, I want to keep going but I'm upset I didn't get a "last smoke". The mental side of quitting has always been the hardest for me, I also suffer anxiety and borderline personality disorder so I use to combat stress which in turn leads to more stress :/ 

Kind words to keep me going would be appreciated! 
If those made no sense I'm so sorry, I'm still pretty dosed up haha.

Edit: Would it be wise to start sticking on patches throughout the days? Any other quit advice you have?

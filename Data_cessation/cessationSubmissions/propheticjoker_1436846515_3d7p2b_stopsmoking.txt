I can sing again.

When I was a kid, I was heavily involved in musical theater, did church and community choir, also had a little acoustic folk band. I've never been the best singer but I enjoy it.

For  while now, I've noticed how bad smoking has hindered that ability. I couldn't hit high notes without coughing or cracking, couldn't hold notes for long and just generally didn't have the range I used to have. Thats already going away. Feels good to have one of the things I used to love back...

Wow... I can't believe its been over 100 days since stopping. Two things which ACTUALLY helped me.

I haven't told anyone except you guys that it's been over 100 days. Nobody knows and I feel like I want someone to give me a pat on the back. I stopped telling my friends about my anniversaries (1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months 100 days etc) because they assume (wrongly) that I'm "counting the days" because i'm desperate for a cigarette. So YAY to me!!!! I feel great!!!

On a side note: The two things which helped me deal with the bad days in the beginning where 1) Actually believing that things will improve tomorrow. When I went through days where I couldn't believe how shitty and depressing life would be without cigarettes I just told myself, tomorrow WILL be better. And you know what? Tomorrow was ALWAYS better. This made me realize what addiction is. Addiction is the mind telling you "Hey, life is SHIT without nicotine, go smoke now". When the addiction subsided i saw the lie and i saw the truth! I guess this is what they mean when they say addiction is "mental illness".
2) Going to the gym. No matter how bad i felt, how drained i felt, how tired i felt, how bored and depressed i felt I always had an ace up my sleeve, the gym. If life was a video game then a 45 minute gym visit would give me +75% natural high, -80% depression, -95% cravings, -85% thoughts of smoking, +100 energy, +75% confidence boost, +1 all day smile, -2 days off my readjustment period, +1 day of feeling almost like a non smoker. 

Thanks guys for all your help!!!!!!!!!!!

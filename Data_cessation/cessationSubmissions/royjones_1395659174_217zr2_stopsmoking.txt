1,000 days quit (crosspost from r/stopdipping)

There are no magic secrets that will make you quit. It is entirely up to you. It is a moment's decision, and it is followed up by another. Once you've made the initial decision, you are quit. It's staying quit that people struggle with.

Do not fall for the shape shifting forms this drug takes. I've been where you are, and I know what it's like to work my way up to a quit. Much of my life was defined by using, and it's not easy to walk away from the drug completely (It is well worth it however).

You can do this. I did this with an online support program (there are numerous...killthecan.org, quitsmokesless.org, etc.) that don't ask for a single penny. They exist only to keep us quit. 

Stop flailing. Start quitting.

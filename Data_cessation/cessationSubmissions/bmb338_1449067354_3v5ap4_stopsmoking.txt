Got myself some theater tickets

So my little sister is a theater major who loves Broadway musicals, but not living in New York doesn't get to see them that much. She's visiting me this December and for her present I decided to splurge and get us tickets to The Book of Mormon. I don't know much about it except that it's by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and that she loves the soundtrack and that tickets have been IMPOSSIBLE to get for years... but I guess now that Hamilton is the new "it" show it's a little easier...

Still the tickets were $170 each. I'm young and I've never even considered paying full price for a show like that, but I figured that with my job this year I can sort-of afford it so fuck it, she's my sister and she'll love it. Still after hitting "purchase tickets" my wallet was hurting the rest of the day...

Forward to the evening. I've been putting money in my quit jar, but I had forgotten to for a while and needed to catch up. I use the Smoke Free app to keep track of how much I've saved and had to check.

You guessed it... $170 yesterday.

I was practically whistling. Instead of smoking last month, I just got my sister a gift she'll remember for years. Fuck yeah. Who knew this shit was so expensive???

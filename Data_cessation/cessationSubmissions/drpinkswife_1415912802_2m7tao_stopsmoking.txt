Just Checking In...

Still don't smoke. Still have anxiety, but I had it before I quit. Feeling fat, so I'm back on the carrots as of tonight. Trying to rehab my back...still. 

Part of me really wants that crutch. But a bigger part of me knows that smoking won't make it any better. So, I'll keep on with the quit. 

Started a new job so haven't been around much. I'm good at it and I make more money, which for me means I can work fewer hours. So many changes since I quit smoking. I'm hoping that when I get settled in, and my back is better...this whole quit will seem worth it. 

I don't want to bring anyone else down, my quit it just that, mine, but I really want to feel good. Keep putting one foot in front of the other. That's the plan.

Hope everyone else's quits are going well. :)

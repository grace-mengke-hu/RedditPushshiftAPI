Lungs, Smokes, and the Gym.

TL;DR How are your lungs feeling over time after quitting smoking?



End of day 10 and I feel so much less anxiety and all withdrawal symptoms have disappeared. I originally quit because it hit me walking up the stairs that everyday when I left the subway I was more short of breathe than I should be. 


Since I've realized many things, including how addition was guiding me on a completely separate path than I really wanted to be on. So I gave myself some time to settle and dry out of nicotine before heading back to the Gym. 


I Hadn't been there in almost a month because one morning I had an anxiety attack at the gym when I felt my heart flutter during some elliptical time. Probably unrelated, but it was enough to scare the shit out of me. (Cardiologist checked me out and i'm fine). 


My reason for posting today though, was to ask how many of you have increased endurance post quitting smoking (shortly after), but still feel short of breathe? I had my best workout in a while tonight and broke all my previous records on the elliptical. But still, I feel short of breathe. Will this pass? I'm 29 and was a 5-7 cigg a day smoker for about 11 years.  








P.S. Mods, I messaged about flair the other day and asked if you could help me add it to my username. I don't have the (edit) thingy next to my name on the sidebar... Thanks!

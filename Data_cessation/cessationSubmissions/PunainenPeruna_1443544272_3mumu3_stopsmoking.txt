7weeks

7 weeks from I quit smoking . 
I rarely think about cigarettes anymore
But I lost my social life . Nobody is asking me out after I quit smoking (they smoke) is it probably because they are jealous I succeeded or ...? 
Not sure but whatever I have more time to be more creative at home and work out and stuff .. 
I have issues with myself and my weight and I gained 5kg after I quit and that made me really sad but it was worth it . I'm eating healthy and working out to loose weight again . 
But yeah 7 weeks for me .

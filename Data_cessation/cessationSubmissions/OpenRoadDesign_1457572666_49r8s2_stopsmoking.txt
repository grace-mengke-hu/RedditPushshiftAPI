Frustrated and could use some advice!

I've smoked for about 12 years. I'm 32. Half pack a day about. I'm officially sick of smoking. I quit recently for 45 days and then re-started over the past couple of weeks. Only a pack a week though. 
I'm in this routine of not smoking for 2 days, giving in and buying a pack. Smoking for a few days then quitting for another 2 days and then smoking for a few. It's driving me nuts!! I just want to quit and be done with it. I'm not sure how to stop the cycle. Any advice would be amazing! Thanks in advance!

Do gums work?

Hi, I am finding it hard to quit. This is the the 4th time in Las couple of months bthat I cannot go beyond day 3. I smoke 12-15 cigs (small 65mm size) a day. I am thinking of switching to herbal cigs and nicotine gum. When I am on herbal(no Tobacco) cigs I don't have more than 3-4 a day and I can do with even less . I am thinking of using Nicotine gum for a few days while I wean myself off the cancer stick. 
Can this work? Should I try this or would you suggest something else?

Day 10 and false sense of security

Hey everyone

It's been 10 days since I last smoked a cigarette and day 5 since my last nicotine fix. I've just been struggling today because all I can think about it is: "You did it, you no longer need a smoke, so why not light up and prove it to yourself"

Also I've been telling myself that if I can last today without a smoke, I'll smoke tomorrow, I've been doing this for 3 days xD

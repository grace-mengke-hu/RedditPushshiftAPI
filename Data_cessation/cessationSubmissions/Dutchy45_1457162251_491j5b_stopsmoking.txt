New quitter (hopefully)

2 days ago I smoked my last cigarette (so far) Been smoking for nearly 30 years. 6 months ago my mother died before her time because she was a smoker. My dokter prescribed me Champix. I've been taking it for about 10 days psyching myself up to quit. It takes the cravings away and makes the cigs taste far less. To everybody I wish a lot of strenght with your personal battle

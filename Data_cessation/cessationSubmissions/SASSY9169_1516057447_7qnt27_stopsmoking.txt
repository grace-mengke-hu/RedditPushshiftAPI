one rule that works for me

Hi there,
I have stopped smoking so often that I don’t have any excuse left anymore :-)
Though, one rule I want to share with you which made stopping never that easy;
Don’t follow your thoughts re willing to smoke/ feelin sad for not smoking/ this situation would feel so much better with cigarette/ etc etc all other excuses your mind is making up. You have a choise of following these thoughts. You don’t have to. If any of a millimeter of one of these related thoughts come up, quit them immediately. Im-me-di-at-ly. The shorter you can quit them the easier it is. You can just go on with what you were doing. The longer you follow this thought, the bigger the chance will be that you will feel sad or longing or... Just don’t go there!

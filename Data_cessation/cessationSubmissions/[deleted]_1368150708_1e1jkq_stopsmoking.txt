As of tonight I will do my damndest to quit.

I've been a pretty light smoker up until recently where I started smoking upwards to a pack a day. But...I met a new girl. She's pretty awesome. And she has given me a little more motivation and incentive to want to quit. Simple things that she would say is all. And...I don't want to be the smoker (and feel like a weak link) in any possible future relationships.

I guess I just wanted to throw out my situation and see what other ex-smokers did when they just impulsively decided to quit one evening.

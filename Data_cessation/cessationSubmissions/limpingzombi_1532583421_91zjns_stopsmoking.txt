39, unemployed, mental health issues, just quit my heavy drinking last week. Am I setting myself up to fail if I try to quit smoking right now?

I'm really worried about my health, even though my doctor said things are good, other than my weight. I was drinking too much (*at least* 10+ drinks a night, mostly hard liquor), so I gave that up last week. When I drink, I smoke a lot, and I have been smoking for 20 years. I need to be healthier and lose weight. I don't exercise, and being unemployed leaves me with too much free time to think. I don't have hobbies or interests, really. 

It's part of my GAD, I think, because I spiral badly when I think about my health; every little twinge or ache and I go right to or "I'm going to be dead in a few years, because this is cancer or signs of heart problems" (there is zero history of heart problems in my family).

I'm just in a really bad mental state, but luckily, the suicidal ideations have subsided a bit. I want to try live and be happy, but I'm quite frankly lazy and unmotivated.

Maybe e cigs/vaping? I've tried some, but I find them so heavy and the amount of vapor is choking. I smoke Marlboro menthol ultra lights, if anyone knows of an equivalent to that, please let me know.

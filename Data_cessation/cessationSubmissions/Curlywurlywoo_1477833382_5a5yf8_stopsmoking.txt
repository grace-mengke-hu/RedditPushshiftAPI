Ready to quit smoking

I'm ready to quit smoking this week. I don't know my exact start date but it's not today and not tomorrow. My original plan was November 1st, so maybe I will go with that. I don't know yet. I don't want to jinx it with a start date... 

I am 29 years old and I have been smoking since I was 13. I smoked on and off as a teen but started smoking full time/daily once I turned 19/20. I have quit numerous times in the past. My most successful quit was a 14 month stretch. I quit using nicotine replacement that time and after 3-4 months of Nicorette, I was off all nicotine. But I started smoking again last August and I've been smoking daily again for over a year. 

I think this year I'm going to quit using e-cigs. I might buy Nicorette too. I'm not sure. I have never been successful at cold turkey and the thought of cold turkey fills me with panic.

Wish me luck!

I am on my 3rd day of quitting cigarettes, will the withdrawal symptoms get worse?

as mentioned in the title, this is my 3rd day and technically around 60 hours of not smoking. I've been coughing out mucus and finding it harder to sleep, i thought quitting would be much harder than this but it seems like i can cope with this. I also THINK my nicotine cravings are gone, it's just the physical symptoms that feel uncomfortable. 

I am surprised at how easy this process is to the point where i'm a little worried that i am not really experiencing the actual withdrawal symptoms which people describe it to be extremely difficult.

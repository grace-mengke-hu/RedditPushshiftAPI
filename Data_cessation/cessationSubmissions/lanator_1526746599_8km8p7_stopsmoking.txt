I hit the 3 month mark today, but I need some support

I hit the 3 month mark today, but instead of feeling joy, I am just feeling terror. Terror that I am now on the 90th floor and the fall is so fucking long. I'm 24 and picked up smoking at 13. I was a "real" smoker until now. I quit smoking once for 2 months in 2015 but fell back in.

To be honest, NOT smoking has been fairly easy for me. The hard part is the absolute TERROR I feel of falling back into addiction, not that it has even come close to happen, but I am scared that it will and smoking (and other factors in my life) has left me with a **lot** of self-doubt in my own abilities,

I try really hard to count my (many) victories, because obviously, they matter, but I have a hard time FEELING them.

When I quit smoking, I didn't really tell anyone. Now my circle of friends and family knows, but I try to not make a big deal of it or talk about it really when people ask. I'm certain this has a lot to do with the fact that I don't do well under pressure in some aspects of life, so I try not to jinx myself.

Today I really wanted to share my story with a bigger audience on social media, but I felt this terror that people knowing will add a pressure to me or make me afraid or more likely to pick the habbit back up.

Addiction, man... :(

Could use a little insight and support

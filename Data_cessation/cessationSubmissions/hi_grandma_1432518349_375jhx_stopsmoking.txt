Is not going cold-turkey useless?

Hi guys,

So I am a young guy, 21. I began smoking senior year of high school and i am going to be a senior in college making it my 4th year of smoking. While there are times that I smoke a lot (social influence, drinking, exams) weeks that I am not stressed or going out I find myself barely smoking. 

These days I am going through 1 pack a week at most (2-4 cigs a day) and I'm wondering if this is really still bad for me if I want to quit later down the road? Im thinking that it is easier for me to quit compared to someone smoking 2 packs a week / pack a day. is this the wrong idea? I am afraid at the thought that I will forever be dependent on this. I want to believe that it's just a phase.

100 days. And I remember being in your position, wanting to stop smoking and wondering how the hell I could get to 100 days.

The trick is that you take it one day at a time. 

I'd recommend Allen Carr's Easyway Book as well, but whatever works for you works. Whether it's NRT or cold turkey or vaping or whatever. The main thing is just to do anything you can not to smoke.

And I've never felt better. Got some cravings back that I blame on the haze here in Singapore but no matter what I'm not gonna have one puff.

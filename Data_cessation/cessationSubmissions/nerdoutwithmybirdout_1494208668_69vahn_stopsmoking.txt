Continue with pot?

Hey all.
I stopped smoking cigarettes 40 days ago. Since then, I did smoke a few once (it was my father's funeral) and didn't touch them since.
What I do still smoke is Marijuana.
So I was wondering, how many people have quit cigarettes here, but still do pot?
I mostly smoke due to chronic pain, but I think my daily joint has been helping me quit cigarettes too, because my body still got its "fix" when it cale to nicotine because of the small amount of tobacco I add.

Any thoughts?

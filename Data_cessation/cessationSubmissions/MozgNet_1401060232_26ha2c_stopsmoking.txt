I just celebrated my 100 days

...with a cigarette. Just a reminder that you can always relapse even though I hadn't had any cravings for 2 months. I got blackout drunk after no alcohol for 75 days and just barely remember smoking 2 or 3 ciggs. Somehow I don't feel so bad about it because I still have no cravings today. anyways, im off to restart my badge

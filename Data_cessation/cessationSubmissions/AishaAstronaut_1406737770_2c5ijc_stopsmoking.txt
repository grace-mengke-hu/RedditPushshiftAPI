This thread saved me from giving in!!

I'm at a week today and I am bored, staying with my grandparents, being criticised and irritated, constantly hungry, constantly missing my ex for no reason cos she was awful and I was over it ages ago, emotional and my resolve was really weakening. I haven't really wanted to smoke at all until now and now I'm desperate.
I posted a screen shot from my stop smoking app on Facebook with a "bleh" kind of message about how I really want to smoke in the hopes that someone will talk me out of it and then came to browse here.
First post I saw was someone saying that they'd given in at 5 days and felt gutted because it doesn't even feel good or do anything after the nicotine is out of your system. That really helped me. It's remembering that it's gonna be horrible and seeing the regret I'll feel if I cave, so I won't :) I'm gonna stuff the cravings down with food and deal with the food issue once I'm past the smoking issue haha,
Thanks guys, reddit saved me :) xx

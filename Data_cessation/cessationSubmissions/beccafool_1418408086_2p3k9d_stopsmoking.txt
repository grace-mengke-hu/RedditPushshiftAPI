Is there a video to explain the neurological addiction to cigarettes?

I'm two days smoke-free. Yeah... I need to update my flair. Still dying for a cigarette, and I really want to learn the neurochemistry behind my addiction to cigarettes. 

I'm looking for a video that explains the brain chemistry behind my addiction, not an explanation that I'm going to get lung cancer and emphysema and age quickly and stink. I need to understand how I am able to rationalize this and still want a cancer / aging stick.

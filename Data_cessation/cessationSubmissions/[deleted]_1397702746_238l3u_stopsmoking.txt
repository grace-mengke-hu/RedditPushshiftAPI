This is it.

For the past 2 years I have been off and on smoking. Last year I went 8 months without a cigarette, only to have an off night and fall back into old habits hard. I quit again in January and have started living a way healthier lifestyle, but I've still sneaked a smoke or two while I'm out drinking the past few weekends. I won't be a slave to this addiction for another minute.

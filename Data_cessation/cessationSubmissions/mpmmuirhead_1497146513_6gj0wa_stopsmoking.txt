Coming on Five months and I have some questions

I keep reading people that say they smell and taste things better now that they quit smoking. I smell cigarettes after people smoke and I find people stink. But otherwise I don't find that my sense of taste or smell is much different than before. Is this normal?

My quitting smoking app says that at this point my coughing and wheezing should be identical to that of a non smoker. I'm not sure if that's fully true. I know that certainly it's a lot better than it was before, but I'm not sure what normal is like exactly anymore.

While I do find that my physical health has improved significantly, I find that my mental health improvements has been the most significant of any other singular benefit. Does anyone else feel this way?

I used a vape to quit, how did you quit?

And as a final thank you to all of you, this subreddit was the singularly most helpful thing in quitting. About a month before I actually quit I subbed here and I would see a success story every day in my news feed. You guys really changed my attitude about quitting for the better. Thank you all of you!

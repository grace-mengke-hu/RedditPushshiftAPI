Not easy but hanging in there

I'm on day 7.  That would make this my third-longest in 20 years (#2 is 2 weeks).  For some reason I feel like this attempt is more unremittingly unpleasant than previous attempts, although that could be a memory bias on my part.  I can't trust my mind when it comes to this.  

Rather than discrete incidents of craving, I am experiencing a constant tension which is instead punctuated by brief discrete incidents of calm.  Nothing I can't handle but it is tiring and unpleasant to have my resolve under constant attack for so long.  Writing this out feels helpful but I can still feel the tension in my chest and, oddly enough, in my teeth.

All that is tolerable, but I'm having difficulty being productive at work with the constant distraction.  The worry about falling behind is one of my addiction's favorite attack vectors.  "I have to smoke, people are counting on me", etc.  

I work all alone in a windowless laboratory under flickering fluorescent lights but despite the abject silence and stillness I can't even manage to remain seated for a full hour much less concentrate on my work.

I feel a little better writing this out.  This evening I'll try to relax and cultivate a more positive mindset, and reinforce my resolve.  This can't last forever, right?

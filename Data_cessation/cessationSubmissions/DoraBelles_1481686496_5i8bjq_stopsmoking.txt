Anything for Cravings..

Just signed up today for this group.. My cravings are brutal nowadays and looking for ways to lessen it... I just read here www.tribeofhabits.com that some foods will make the cigarettes taste really horrible... Is this true?
 
Does anyone here have tips to effectively manage cravings to smoke?
 
I'm just having a hard time dealing cravings especially when I'm in social gatherings :(

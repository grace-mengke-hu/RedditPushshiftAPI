Why and how I quit smoking

Why is because of pure necessity for preventing almost certain brain damage, I was a heavy chain smoker and then I contracted encephalitis from one of my patients(yes, I was doctor who smoked..despicable,I know) and after nearly 2 months in a coma and on a ventilator, I got back up and started having non classical seizures which put me in a state where I had to take medications to prevent seizures from occurring, I could barely work but as soon as I could, I automatically started smoking..and the seizures followed. A single seizure is like a natural defibrillator shot for your brain, it resets the whole brain when a single part of it starts acting a little out of place. What smoking does is that it makes the chances of the area under recovery after an infection go haywire go through the roof. So that's what happened to me. Trust me folks, smoking the way I did before I got the infection from the blood spill, is probably because smoking decreased my immunity so low you could compare working in a hospital at that time to jumping in a pit full of thumbtacks. It's not worth it and I really applaud the people who have the mental strength to stay away from those little demons after quitting.

I feel like I "need" something in my mouth and hands.

I'm having a rough time lately, but  - "when you're going thru hell, keep going!" (I think it was churchill).

However, I do feel the constant need to "have" something in my mouth and hands. I try to ease it with chewing sugar free gum and holding a pencil, but it doesn't cut it. does it make any sense that i'm still feeling the need for a phantom cigarette? any tips?

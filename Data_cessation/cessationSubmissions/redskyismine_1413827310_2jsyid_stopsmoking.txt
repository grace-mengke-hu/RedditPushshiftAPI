Back on the wagon

Back to getting this shit over with. Last quit attempt I managed to go around 4 months until finally caving and thinking I could manage the odd cigarette here and there and we all know how that goes. I'm kind of in a rough spot in life right now just getting by financially, in the midst of trying to obtain another job since my current one is making my life a living hell and not paying enough, and trying to get over a girl as well. I'm just going to keep pushing and try to be the best me I can be and getting rid of the biggest curse of my life. About to smoke my last cigarette, I hope I can do this. 

Edit: I forgot to mention I am 23 and had came to the realization that I've been smoking (including the few times I've quit for weeks or months) for 8 years. 1/3 of my existence I've been a slave to these damned things.

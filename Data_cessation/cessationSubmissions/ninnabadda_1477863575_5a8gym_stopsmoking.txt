Sense of freedom when un-quitting?

Hi All,

So I've had a few weekends over the last couple of months where I bought cigarettes and then quit again a day or two later.  I've been "mostly" quit for ~2 years, but it seems like these weekends are picking up in frequency.  I'm currently in the middle of one now.

One thing I've noticed is that when I do decide to buy cigarettes and I start smoking, there is a sense of relief and relaxation that comes with it, a sense of freedom or independence that comes with not having to fight the addiction anymore and it feels REALLY good.  I think that I also tend back towards smoking when I am lonely, so it's possible that the cigarettes are being surrogate friends or a surrogate S.O. 

I have read Allan Carr's book and I know what he says about cigarettes being a false friend, but I also feel that his situation was different from mine because when he quit, he had a family around him to support him, but I haven't started a family so I don't really have that super-integrated support structure.

I am pretty bad at untangling the addiction's rationalizations.  Has anyone experienced this sense of freedom or independence that I'm talking about?  What is your perspective on it?  Obviously, a sense of independence is the exact opposite of what I should be feeling when I smoke since smoking is a literal dependence, so I don't know why I have such a hard time thinking around it.

I hope this makes sense.

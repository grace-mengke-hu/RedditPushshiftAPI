So you think stress is a relapse trigger? Well it doesn't have to be, here's my story 1 year later!

Before making the decision to attempt to quit [again] last year, I had always worried that I would crumble in weakness when faced with stressful situations.  I mistakenly believed that smoking provided me some type of relief - on the contrary, I now see that it only made my stress worse.

I experienced the following stressors last year, without lighting-up.  Not. Even. Once.

•	Was laid-off from my job of 10+ years.

•	Was diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was later ruled-out to be extreme Hydrocephalus.

•	Totaled my car, and was sued for subrogation (my insurance carrier had cancelled my insurance policy unbeknownst to me - the week before my accident).

•	Had brain surgery (had a Ventricular-Peritoneal shunt inserted into my brain & abdomen).

368 days later I'm living a **healthier**, smoke-free life.  I’m engaged to the woman of my dreams, have a new truck [that doesn't reek of smoke], and working an awesome job.  Quitting is absolutely doable, just remember that it's always a choice.  A choice to be strong in the face of temptation, or a choice to be weak and controlled by smoking.  Fuck you cigarettes!

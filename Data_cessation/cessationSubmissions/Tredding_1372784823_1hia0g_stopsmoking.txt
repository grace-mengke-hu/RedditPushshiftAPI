I've been subscribed for a week and realized it's my turn. Day 1 :-)

I have had the worst year of my life and therefore my nasty habit got really bad, and I'm only 18. I've been recently prescribed a medication for minor anxiety and the doc claims i should help with the quitting process.

Did I mention I'm diabetic? Yeah, so I really need to quit.

I've got plenty of support between my friends, family, and you guys, so I know I CAN DO IT!

It has officially been over 3 months since I've had any nicotine

I say nicotine cause I had quit cigarettes for over a year after smoking for 10 years. Wow, that seems like a long time and I'm not even 30 yet lol. But, I replaced it with vaping which was just feeding my addiction. So really.. what was the point in not smoking if I was going to feed my addiction? So I quit. And sometimes like right now, I get really bad cravings but barely. I haven't really had any until recently. I think maybe it has to do with the warmer weather and cigarettes being the only thing that got me to be routinely outside. Idk. I didn't think I'd notice having more money really since I was "only spending around $30 a month" on juice. But I now use that money for a gym membership (because I was scared of getting fat from quitting cause I've witnessed that happening to other people) which I've been going to regularly. I quit my addiction, started working out and eating cleaner and I'm SO MUCH HAPPY. Yes, so much happy. Not the correct way of saying it but it seems more appropriate to my spirit lifting feeling of being free.

Is it normal to experience pain in the liver area?

My liver hurts almost constantly. Is this normal? I drink beer everyday throughout the day, but never get even buzzed from it. Besides, I have been doing it for a very long time. So, I don't think that's the problem. On the other hand, the pain started about a week into quitting. I don't think it's getting better. Should I be worried?

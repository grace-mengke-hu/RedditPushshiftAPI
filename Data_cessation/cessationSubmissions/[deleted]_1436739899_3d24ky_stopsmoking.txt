What are your favorite Vape flavors?

I've recently gotten into vaping, I'm loving it but I'm a little overwhelmed picking out flavors. I go to this great little shop and they have quite a selection of premium liquids. Trickz is my current favorite, it tastes just like Trix cereal! They carry stuff like Charlie Noble, Beard, milk man... Just to name a few. I was not a fan of Cuttwood Boss Reserve, it tastes too much like a cigar IMO. Just wanted some input from the community! Thanks!

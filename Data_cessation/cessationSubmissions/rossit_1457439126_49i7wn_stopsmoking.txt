Decided to quit.

Hey, as the tite says I decided to quit after around 6months of smoking 4-5 cigarettes a day. My biggest concern is how quitting will impact my metabolism since im in the middle of losing weight (lost around 50 pounds already) Im 26yo male. 

I've read a lot posts over the net people saying they gain a lot of weight after quitting.

So as a light smoker is there anything to worry regarding weight gain?

Btw. I'm not a native speaker so if I made any grammar errors/mistakes just dont pay attention to them :P

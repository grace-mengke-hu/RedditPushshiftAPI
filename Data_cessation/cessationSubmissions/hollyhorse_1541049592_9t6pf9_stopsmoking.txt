Day 5

Its the start of day 5 for me,  I actually slept for 6 hours last night only waking up twice so that is a massive improvement already.

I still have a long way to go but being on holiday and a change from everyday life and all my habitual routine is keeping my mind focused.

It's getting easier and I'm fighting the cravings.

My only regret is not doing this a long time ago because i was scared.  

If this is possible for me after 23 years there is hope for everyone out there, you just got to want it and believe in yourself.

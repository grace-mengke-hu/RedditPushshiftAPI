19 days free

I have come here because I am using the smoke free app, which is really helping me. Today is about listing all the things that have helped me get this far.
Meditating every morning
Going for long walks
Eating healthy food
Getting things done around the house
Feeling so very proud at bedtime that I have been smoke free for another day
Seeing smoking for what it truly is
Realising that I can truly do this
I have been smoking for 41 years and was a proper fag ash lil, I have tried many times before, but always went back to smoking and still feel that I could now, but I know it won’t make anything better. I would rather spend the rest of my days having cravings for the odd cigarette than giving into the cravings and doing something that I don’t actually want to do...
I AM A HAPPY NON SMOKER ❤️

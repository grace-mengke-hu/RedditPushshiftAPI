Being On The Side of Goodness.

I can't help but be extremely observant of my own psycho-emotional landscape, Being that one of the main sources of satisfaction in this Quit was in watching myself writhe in contradiction. So while craving for something that I know destroys me, I was able to experience a kind of duality. The craving, and then also my masochistic and humorous take on the fact that I was not in control of myself.

Just realizing that from day one, not some cliched jargon about being a slave or anything. Something far more REAL. Just knowing my overall existence, whoever or whatever that ego, that diatribe against stone and frozen things or whatever you want to call the dominating patterns of our lives. That in my smoking I was nothing more or less then the tide, or leaves blowing helplessly in the wind, or water turning to steam. In my submission to tobacco I became one with that terrible force of unconscious happening that is antithetical to what it means to be alive.

I remember lifting my arm like some robotic automated crane, under nauseous yellow lights, my ash flicked and falling to the ground like snowflakes around some terrible gigantic sleeping monolith. I remember the tight corset tobacco made me wear, and grey demure she painted on my face, a tribute to stone. That bitch. 

I'm Free NOW!

Free of the stressful static cloud that pricked my capillaries, and yoked the air from my body. A physical and mental taxation with false return. 

Goodbye and hello to goodness. To that calm anticlimax.

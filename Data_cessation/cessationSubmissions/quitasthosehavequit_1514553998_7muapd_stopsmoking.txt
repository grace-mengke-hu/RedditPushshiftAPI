Day 0

So smoking has been a very important part of my daily routine for the past 10 years. To a point where my day revolves not around work and things I need to get done but the other way around. Wake-up - smoke , coffee- smoke , meals - smoke , exercise- smoke, bathe - smoke and so on. 

The past year being a perticularly rough year my smoke count went the highest it's ever gone. Last few months I've been averaging almost 2 packs a day , I've felt the need to stop on several occasions, but each time I've tried I haven't gotten past a few hours, weak will power yea I know .

A few days back I started doing some digging into I'll effects of smoking tobacco and nicotine on the body watched a ton of material , and strangely that night I dreamt that I was on my first day of not smoking and was sailing through like a champ. That feeling has stuck to me , and I feel this subconscious urge to give up this habit.

Tomorrow is my first day ( another few hours till tomorrow) . Thanks for listening.

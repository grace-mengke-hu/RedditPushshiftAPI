How did you quit smoking?

13 days cold turkey quit. 

I got really sick and used the opportunity to quit. I took three days off from work, two days on a weekend, for a total of five days off.

I couldn't tell the difference between feeling like crap from the flu or feeling like crap from withdrawal symptoms.

How did you quit?

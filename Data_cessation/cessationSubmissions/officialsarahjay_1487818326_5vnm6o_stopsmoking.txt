I passed my first big milestone tonight

So I'm a little over 24 hours and I passed my first big milestone. I didn't know where to vent so I chose to vent here if that's ok. 

I went out for dinner with my partner and had a couple of beers. While we headed to the car I smelled the smell of cigarette smoke and thought oh my god, how wonderful. I asked my partner if he had smokes and he said he did...at home. 

I don't smoke at home. I don't smoke outside my home. I smoke far, far away from my home so immediately I had a big hissy nicfit. I logged my craving in Smoke Free and it had a tip: give it fifteen minutes and the craving will pass. 

I am so glad I let that craving pass. I think they're worse because I was drinking tonight and I drink and smoke at the same time all social like. But I feel proud of myself for my small win. I can beat this. I just need to remember why I'm quitting and stay strong.

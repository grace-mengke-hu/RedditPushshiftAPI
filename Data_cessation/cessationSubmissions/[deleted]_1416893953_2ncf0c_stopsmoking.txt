After a year of "trying," I'm ready to do it. Impressively more daunting challenges have been achieved.

Hi there folks.  I was subbed here about a year ago and gave many half-hearted attempts to kick before simply kidding myself became too much and I unsubbed.  Nine months ago, my wife became pregnant and quit smoking immediately.  Today, she birthed a 10 lbs 5 oz beast of a baby boy.  In the weeks leading up to this glorious event, I determined that the birthday would be my quit date.  So here we go!  Going cold turkey with the support of my family and hopefully some random internets people.

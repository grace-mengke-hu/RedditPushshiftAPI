Slipped up last night

No secret to all of you guys that it's the routine smokes that are toughest to give up. In my case, I'm used to having one after my coffee in the morning, after a big meal and especially as I walk home after the gym.
As I was getting changed last night after finishing my workout, I just got the most intense craving. It's a 6 minute walk from the gym to my apartment, and there are literally 3 convenience stores (deps to my fellow Quebecers) on the route. 

I cracked. Walked into one and bought a pack. Had one on the way home, and another a few hours later when I took out the trash.

I don't feel ashamed, though. That pack is staring me right in the face, and while I cracked again this morning after my coffee (see?), I haven't had another all day. Have barely wanted one.
Three cigarettes in a 24 hour span is a big improvement for me, but it's still three too many. I can do this.
Thanks to all of you for reading and the support. Really glad I found this sub.

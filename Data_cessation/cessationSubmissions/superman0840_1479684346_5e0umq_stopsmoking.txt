i need advice on quitting after ten years.

i've tried the patches but they never stay on, i think due to how much i sweat at my job. the mints and gum only work for a little bit, but after a while they don't stop the cravings. i've tried a few vapors but haven't found one i like. i've read about chantix but thats still a bit expensive. and life is progressively getting more stressful making it hard to go cold turkey. i smoke about a pack and a half a day. i feel like if i don't quit now i never will. i realize i've touched most bases as far as quitting goes, but i'm wondering if anyone has an option that i haven't listed, or any advice as to how i can make one of the options i've already tried a little more successful. many thanks in advance.

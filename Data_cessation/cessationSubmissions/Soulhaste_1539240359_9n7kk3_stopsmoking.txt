It's time to move on

Hello people! I just subbed to this today because I wish to share my story with you all. I have recently quit smoking after four years of doing it continuously. I am twenty years old and I used to smoke about half a pack a day, if not even more. Three days ago, I went outside and smoked what I never thought would be my last cigarette. Once finished, I started to experience heavy chest pain. It felt as if it was completely swollen, and that really freaked me out. Turns out that I got bronchitis out of a sudden. I am still having difficulties properly breathing when I go to sleep.

Sometimes, it's best to experience something scary in order for you to be able to let go of your strongest vice. I am in luck that I'm sick as of now, since my body never craves cigarettes while it's under the effect of any type of cold.

It's been three days, and many more to come. Stop smoking before the situation worsens!

I wish you all the best!

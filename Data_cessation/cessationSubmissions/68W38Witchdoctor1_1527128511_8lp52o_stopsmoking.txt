I need serious help.

I have been on Chantix 3x. I have been through smoking cessation therapy and groups. Tried Zyban. Tried patches and gum. I smoke anywhere between 3-5 packs a day and it is utterly ruining my life. The problem is, when I don't smoke, I am cripplingly ill and can barely get out of bed. Nothing seems to help, but I am 32yrs old and don't want to die before 40 because of a stupid habit. I am honestly scared, as smoking is costing my career of 15yrs (Military) and will cost my life. I am reaching out to someone who might have a technique that will actually work for me and save my life.

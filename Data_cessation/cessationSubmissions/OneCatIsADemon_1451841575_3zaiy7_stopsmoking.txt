Weird problem - accidentally stopped smoking 4 days ago

Hey r/stopsmoking,

I guess I really had to vent and it got way too long, my apologies. There's a TL;DR at the bottom. Also, English isn't my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.

I smoked for 18 years (roughly one pack per day) and didn't really enjoy it anymore throughout the last year. I began to think more and more that it was disgusting and filthy, it made my throat and chest hurt if I smoke too much, my breath got shorter, I was (and still am) terribly afraid of lung cancer, it was expensive and I downright hated it to smoke when alone and outside (at work as the only smoker, for example). Still, I clung to it. I thought I still enjoy cigarettes with a drink. Too be honest, I also didn't, I smoke waaaaay too much when tipsy or drunk and already in the night before, I was dreading the remorse and chest pain waiting for me the next morning (which led to 1 or 2 days of non-smoking after an evening of heavy smoking). Too add to this, my SO (who also smokes) and me are planning to move to another country this year where cigarettes are simply too expensive to still afford 2 packs/day (one for each of us). And yeah, it's bad for your health. So.. last year, we decided to quit in 2016. I always thought I could only stop smoking when I have had enough of it, not when I have to (pregnancy aside). I guess I actually am at this point in my life.

Around Christmas, we met a friend. We were standing outside and smoking with him together and told him that we planned to quit. We were discussing several "plans" like using an e-cig etc., he asked us if we knew if we were highly addicted to nicotine or not and told us about his several unsuccessful approaches to quit. Throughout the whole discussion (while smoking!), I was .. not afraid, not sad, not devastated. I was thrilled. Finally, the fear, the remorse, the self loathing would come to an end! We didn't set a date though and I thought the latest time point would be when boarding the plane to finally move.

Fast forward to last weekend. We were talking about our plans for NYE, and the thought "Crap, another night of heavy smoking is coming for you. Well, at least it will end next year." popped up in my head. Didn't think too much of it.
So.. it's the day before NYE, and I wake up with a tonsillitis with 39°C (102°F) and I feel so sick and tired, I sleep all day. I never actually smoked when I was sick (and it never bothered me), so I don't even think about it. Yesterday, as I was feeling finally better, it dawned on me.. I haven't smoked for more than 3 days. Why not quit for real right now? I don't actually want to smoke again. Cravings are rare I guess (about 5 times a day), last for about 5 minutes and are simple to overcome. Just browsing reddit for these 5 minutes usually helps (and this with my SO still smoking in our apartment). Yesterday, I read some Allen Carr stuff and watched one of his videos and it almost exactly matched what I already  thought before - I am free, I am relieved, I don't have to bother with this crap ever again.

**So what's my fucking problem?** I never actually smoked this "last cigarette". This is the only thing that bugs me. I don't crave any other cigarette, I just wish I smoked a last cigarette with the thought in my mind that this will be my last. Kind of saying goodbye, smoking has been a part of me for all of my adult life (started with 14). It is a weird "problem" and I am fully aware that it is a really minor one compared to those of other people who just quit a couple of days ago. Still, I wish I had a real ending.
I know from the times I stopped smoking before for a couple of days (either because I smoked too much when drunk or because I was sick), that the first cigarette would be really disgusting and I wouldn't even finish it. But like a clockwork, about 30 minutes later I would smoke the second one which would be less disgusting.. And so on and so forth and the next day I would be smoking my regular pack of cigarettes again. I don't want to start this cycle again, and I don't want to force myself to smoke this first disgusting cigarette, just to become a smoker again and than quit a second time. Haha it sounds so silly when written down! Also, I actually remember the last two cigarettes I smoked before I got sick - I didn't like the taste at all and my throat hurt when smoking them (I guess because the tonsillitis had already begun), so I didn't even finish them.

**TL;DR:** Thought smoking was disgusting in almost all of 2015 (despite still smoking a pack per day), planned to quit sometime in 2016 anyway (after 18 years). Got sick on the day before NYE, haven't smoked since. Cravings are rare, I am relieved and happy to see a smoke-free future. Still missing the "conscious last cigarette to say goodbye". Am I crazy? How to overcome these thoughts?

6 months in, cold Turkey and I Just got prescribed Chantix to help with the pain

I've been having terrible withdrawals. My weight gain has been plus 20lbs and it's getting to the point where I went to the doctor because I'm considering smoking again to lose the weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

She prescribed me Chantix and I'm on day one. So far, so good. I told her I'd give it not just the 30 days but 90 days to see how I react to it.   


But hey, I'm 6 months in ;) No nicotine! I'm gonna keep going!

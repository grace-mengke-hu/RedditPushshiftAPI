Quitting again

I’ve started up again this last month. Resetting my counter to hold myself accountable. 

I’m actually excited to quit again. Even though this relapse was a shorter one than in the past, any relapse is long enough for me to recognize that a smokers life is not the life I want to live. 

Good luck to all of you out there who are on this journey.

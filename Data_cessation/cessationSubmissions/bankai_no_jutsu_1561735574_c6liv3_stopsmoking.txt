A slip happened, but it's not over!

Sadly i craved hard after almost 3 months of quitting, had just one, and it was absolutely disgusting. Feeling dizzy wow!

Lack of sleep made me do that shit, don't make the same mistake, stay strong.

If however it would happen, start quitting again. A slip is not a relapse. It's really not worth smoking!

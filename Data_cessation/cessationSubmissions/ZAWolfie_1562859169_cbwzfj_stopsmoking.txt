Day 4- what started your addiction and what stopped it?

Well in 4 hours it’ll be 4 days no smoking. I’ve been addicted 11 years. 

My first cigarette was during my first ever party. I’d just gotten to college, out of mom and dad’s place, and I went a little wild night 1. I was always very sheltered as a kid due to a religious background. 

So first night in college I went to a house party and got drunk (also a first that night). Someone was smoking a cigarette and I drunkenly decided that I’d look SOOOOOOO cool with a ciggy hanging out of the lips. 

From that night I was hooked. I only smoked 1-2 every few days. Then I went through my first real and big break up. I bought a pack and smoked it in half a day. That’s when I knew I was in trouble. 

Fast forward 11 years. My wife of (almost) 3 years asked me to quit because we want to start having kids in the next 2-3 years. She gave me my reason to quit. She didn’t want our kids growing up with a dad that smokes, and she didn’t want me to die an early death because of such a dumb habit. She explained to me that she wanted a long life with me, and wanted me to experience life fully when I get older. 

It may sound sentimental, but damn did it work. 

So day 4. Where are you on your journey? What got you started? What made you quit?

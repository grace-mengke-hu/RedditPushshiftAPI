I didn't tell any of my friends, I didn't tell any of my family. I didn't ask for help because this time I quit for me. I know it's only 4 months, but it's my 4 months. I needed to tell someone just how excited I am that I'm actually quitting for myself this time and after 9 years I feel like if I tell someone I'm quitting I can actually mean it.

Difficulty Getting Out of Bed Each Morning

I'm currently 3 weeks as a non-smoker (would have been 5 weeks without a relapse I had in September).  The first few weeks were tough on my sleep, I would wake up almost hourly thinking it was the morning or wake up and not be able to fall back asleep for hours. This has, for the most part, evened itself out but every morning I find myself not able to get out of bed and hitting snooze until the point where I'm going to be late for work if I press it one more time. 

I feel that previously as a smoker I would always get up right away to have my morning cigarette and by the time that was over I was already awake and able to start my day. Has anyone else experienced this and have any tips for altering your morning routine as a non-smoker?

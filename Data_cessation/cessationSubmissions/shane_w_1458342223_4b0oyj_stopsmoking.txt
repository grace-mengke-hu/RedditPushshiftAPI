Day five after going cold turkey..

So Sunday last week I decided fuck it and smoked my last cigarette Sunday night (3/13/16). I started smoking about 14 years ago, I'm almost 29 now for reference. I've never quit before and right now am doing surprisingly well I think. I've had a couple of cravings, but nothing out of control. I have also been trying to stay away from booze for the first few weeks as I know that that will totally make me smoke. Just wanted to post, I read your guys stuff sometimes and it feels good to be working on living a little bit healthier. Best of luck to all of you.

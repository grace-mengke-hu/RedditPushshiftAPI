Ugh I smoked 1/3 of a cigarette. Here's what I learned from it, for your benefit.

At new year's I got a cigarette from the boyfriend of my sister, so that I could light the fireworks. I took a few puffs from it "to keep it on". I smoked about 1/3 of it or so.

I hate it that I did this and I am really surprised that this happened. I mean I thought I had zero desire to smoke, as I have had as close to zero temptation in the last month as you can imagine.

Will not put my counter to zero, I know that strictly speaking I should but I find that too harsh and demoralizing.

I will however vow to never even touch a cigarette again, for no reason (only if I have to save someone's life with it but I find it hard to even imagine scenario's where that's the case ;P). This incident reminded me of how sneaky an addiction can be, even after you think you've eliminated it there are still occasions where it can dominate you if you don't watch out.

Another thing that I noticed is that my sister's boyfriend seems to like to tempt people. He knew that I quit smoking and gave me the cigarette anyways, and he also knew that I quit drinking and he offered me beer all night. I fucking hated that. I stayed friendly with him, but you know what I will tell him what I think of it. Not to start a fight with him, but I should let him know that this kind of behavior is not ok.

Hope to post that as a reminder to you. Don't be as naive as me and give up everything you've worked towards, and beware of people who want to see you fail.

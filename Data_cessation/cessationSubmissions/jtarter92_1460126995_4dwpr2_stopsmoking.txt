On the fifth day of my first (hopefully only) quit.

I have been smoking for almost five years and have never attempted to quit before. I have done a lot of research on the withdrawal symptoms but wasn't expecting them to be this acute. Yesterday I didn't feel the motivation to do anything and the things I forced myself to get up and do I felt very anxious about. I know these feelings are only temporary but it's tough to see that in the moment of a craving. I began using the app SmokeFree on the first day of my quit and the mission it provided today was to make a stop here and be in the presence of other quitters. 

I love the app but sometimes I find catch myself using it too often which makes me think of smoking even more. My question to you guys is do you think apps like these are helpful? What other tools have you guys used to quit? I have read a few posts here about a book by Allen Carr and I think I will go ahead and purchase it. Also what do you guys think of a physical calendar to keep track of the days of your quit? That way I won't be carrying around this app that consistently reminds me how tough my quit is.

Help..I am beyond incredibly bored.

So I have been smoking since December-ish.  Heres the bad part. I smoked it out of a bong. Every. Time.  I got hooked on it from my old roommates who would smoke weed/tobacco combo bowls and ended up continuing to do it as it helped me concentration and reduced anxiety.

Now I just tried to quit cold turkey.  My last cigarette was yesterday at about 9am, so about 36-ish hours ago.  Since then I didn't get to sleep until 6am this morning.  I've had anxiety all day and MASSIVE boredom.  I cannot do ANYTHING that gives me any sort of relaxation, sense of having fun, reduces anxiety, really anything.  I'm just trying to fill my day with anything and absolutely NONE of it is giving me any enjoyment whatsoever.

I don't know what to do to be honest.  Smoking weed and tobacco helped me relax (I have an anxiety disorder and chose weed over medication), reduce anxiety, and have fun/concentrate on whatever I wanted.  

Help..?

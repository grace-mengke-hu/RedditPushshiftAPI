Been about a week and a half...

I went on an all day trip with my dad, he hates smoking so I didn't, and the next day went and got a vape. I haven't had a cough, surprisingly, I quit because I was sick like two months ago and had a cough once I got better, so I'm not sure if it's because before was cold turkey and now I'm using a vape? 

Anyone who has used a vape, how was it for you quitting? Have you tried to quit with and without a vape, what were your results each time in terms of what happened with your body? 


Also, sometimes when I'm sleeping I'll wake up and feel like I need to breathe more, I've heard that's normal because your body is getting used to not being in a state of hypoxia, truth? I don't feel very different, could it be because I have underlying problems due to smoking I don't know about, and did anyone find out they had something after quitting? 

I know this is a lot of questions, sorry! Just curious if anyone can give me some insight. Also I am 20/f and have been smoking about a pack every 1 & 1/2 days to 3 days, depends, for about 6/7 years.  I was smoking the turquoise pack of American Spirits which are supposed to be more "organic" and the tobacco is supposed to be grown with less additives and such. That's what I was smoking the last month and a half/2 months, before I was smoking the light blue A.S's, don't know if "better" cigarettes are the reason I don't have a cough right now.

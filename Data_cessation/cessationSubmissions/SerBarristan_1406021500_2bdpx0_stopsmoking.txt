42 days... only

Hi, 
A brief text about my experience.
I've decided to quit on the 1st may this year (for sport, for health, for everything I may do without smoking). And I've done it. 
WIthout nothing else than apples, some alcool from time to time to calm down, and a lot of sport and yoga. And friends.
Everything was doing well, then because of a love affair, I had to move to another country to change my mind. Even when she broke my heart, I didn't want a smoke. 
Even when I had quite a bunch of problem with US boarders, flight company I didn't break my oath : no more smoking. Then I moved in Turkey. Strange place. And I bought a pack. Bad Bad Bad idea. Since I'm back home, I'm now back as a smoker.
I haven't decided yet for another date to stop. 
This short story to tell you that quiting without other help that your friends and a lot of apples is something you can do. 
We keep in touch.

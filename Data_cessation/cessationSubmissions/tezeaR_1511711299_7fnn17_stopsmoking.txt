Had a week long relapse after 2 years completely nicotine free. Day one.

Last Saturday, I had my first smoke after wanting and wishing for it for many months. I never stopped missing smoking, but I always declined when I was offered one. It started with half of one, then another half, then at the end of the relatively short night, I'd bummed a little less than ten smokes. I also got the rest of my friends pack which contained four cigs. 

Then, the next day, I hung out with that same friend and I was bumming off of her when we met a friend of mine that sells cartons - and suddenly I had half a carton of cigs. 

I went from not touching nicotine to smoking between 7-15 a day. My health is already declining after a week. I'm coughing, there's mucus, I can't breathe as easily, and I have to hide it. I work with kids and I have to sneak off so they don't see me. It's just stressful and unnecessary and I want to stop. I haven't had a smoke since 2am last night, and I'm not gonna have one today. The cravings aren't TOO bad, but my lungs are really hurting and I feel tense. But I won't smoke today. I've quit before, I can do it again. Wish me luck bois.

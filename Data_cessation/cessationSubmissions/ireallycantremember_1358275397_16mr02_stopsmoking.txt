99 days - Cha Cha Cha

For anyone who wants to quit, just do it. If I had known it was going to be this easy and awesome, I would have done it a long time ago. Really. I smoked for 19 years and never thought I could quit. I did without any nicotine replacement, placebos, etc. And as Allan Car says, it was really easy.   Okay, okay, I read Easy Way multiple times and continued to smoke. One day my husband just said "no more smoking" and we quit. Well, I quit. He still smokes a little bit, and I have zero desire to join him. 

If you are struggling, know that smoking doesn't solve anything. I think it gets easier, and eventually you forget you even smoked. The bad habits die fast.

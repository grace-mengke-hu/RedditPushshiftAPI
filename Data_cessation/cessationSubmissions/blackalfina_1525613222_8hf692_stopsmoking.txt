what if everyone who smokes cigarettes got cancer tomorrow morning?

would that be funny to you? or is it to much to ask for?

let me take a step back, what if suddenly everyone who works at philip morris got cancer? would that be better?

we blame companies for abusing people, but we forget that people want to die in the first place.

humans are like a child who eats to much ice cream, despite remembering what it did to him last time. yet the moron keeps eating it, and we as a race to the same thing to ourselves daily. by killing each other, destroying the environment we live in and the animal life around us.

I can't blame any company for trying to milk human health for money. that's why Philip Morris exist in the first place. it's why we don't have a cancer cure, and it's why marijuana is illegal.

humanity worships the one true god, and his name is money. 

so your friend is addicted to drugs, meanwhile my brother is addicted to buying a new phone. despite him knowing that they make these phones last only 3 years, and slow them downs with updates to make sure you buy a new one.

so should I blame the phone companies, or my my stupid brother?

my entire point is that we can keep hating on companies that sell us poison, but it won't change a thing. alcohol kills more people than cigarettes ever will, yet it's a part of what makes us human. and if you try to remove it half of the world population will go ape shit. and people would be drinking worse shit to get by.

that's who we are as a society and I am ashamed to call myself a part of the human race.

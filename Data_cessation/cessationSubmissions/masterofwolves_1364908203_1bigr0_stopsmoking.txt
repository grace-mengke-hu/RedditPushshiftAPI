You hear about cancer, but not about stomach problems.

I just wanted to post this here in case anyone else was going through what I went through. I started smoking in college and continued for about a year and a half until I (recently) stopped (its been over two months and I have only had four or five cigarettes/due to stress).

About a year in, I started having stomach problems. At first I thought it was the flu but it was way too persistent. My stomach was always upset. I thought I was going to throw up constantly. To be accurate, it literally felt like shit was building up in my stomach, and I wasn't going to the bathroom much so that made sense. It was persisting so much that I was constantly calling off work and laying I'm bed sick to my stomach.

I changed my diet but it didn't solve all problems. Although it solved most my stomach still felt like it was acidic and I still had random bowel movements. I thought maybe it was possibly IBS.

I finally decided to quit smoking and found that as time went on and I wasn't smoking my stomach felt better. Eventually its gotten to the point where it feels perfectly normal. Now I have had a couple cigarettes due to stress recently and each time my stomach trends to feel slightly unsettled, but I will never go back to my habitual smoking like I used too.

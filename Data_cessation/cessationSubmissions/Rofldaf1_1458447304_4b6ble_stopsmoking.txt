Relapsed while out drinking.

Hi guys. Im 22 years old and been smoke free for 3 weeks and never felt better and last night I smoked 2 fags while drinking. I got really drunk and thought why not, I feel like it was a big mistake and I feel terrible. I almost feel like my lungs are worse off for it and I might have messed with my brain chemistry and all Ive achieved in 3 weeks. Pretty certain they will definitely be my last fags now.

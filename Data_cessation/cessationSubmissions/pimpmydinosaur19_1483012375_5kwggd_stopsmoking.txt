How long have you been a smoker? Or alternatively how long did you smoke for?

I am 22 years old and have smoked for the best part of 5 years, probably 10-15 a day and am currently 3 days smoke free. 

I have attempted to quit previously but convinced myself I would do so when I encountered health issues. I am chewing gum (sugar-free) like there is no tomorrow and I am hoping for the sake of my health and my amazing girlfriend of 3 years that I can beat this addiction. 

My question is this - how much damage have I done to myself?
Is 5 years enough to make me seriously ill in the future? 

I appreciate all responses!

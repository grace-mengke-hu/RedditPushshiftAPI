things that got me through the first 4 weeks

After 15 years of heavy smoking (25 a day) I quit cold turkey after reading an article about quitting apps and installing one of them just4fun. 

**Smoke Free App**
This little and not very sophisticated app helped me like nothing ever helped before. The counting of hours, days and not smoked cigs but also the health benefit charts changing for the better after minutes were really important. In the first few days I looked at the numbers every couple of minutes (mental, I know). It stopped me from the 24h relapse I usually had when quitting before. 

**Sunflower Seeds (unpeeled)**
I still do eat a small bowl of these in the evenings, but I don't need them in the morning or the whole weekend anymore as I did during the first week. But they helped to sit through conversations, meeting with friends, or reading on the sofa. 

**Replacing coffee with tea in the mornings**
This can be important for the people who are as crazy as I were to smoke first thing in the morning with a cup of coffee. Apart from being a disuisting and destructing habit it was also one of the strongest triggers for me. Tea never had that effect so I'm feeling no urge to smoke in the morning anymore and can start the day like a normal human being instead of a zombie (thats what it really felt for many years)

**Drinking coffee as a special treat**
I drink coffee around ten and one more after lunch as a mixture of reason for a break, a real enjoyment and a concentration boost. This stopped me from smoking many times as needing a break or after lunch were heavy trigger situations. This should work with tea, hot chocolate or what ever you prefer.

**Reading a lot about quitting on the internet**
I'm so thankful for this subreddid as well as for the many other webpages, forums and videos out there. Reading about other peoples quitting process really helped me not only with motivation and strategies for dealing with carvings or trigger situations but also as a coping mechanism. Like checking the app I come here when the urge to smoke is getting intense and read about all the happy quitters and the sadness of the ones who relapsed and feel stronger. Thank you all for sharing. 

**Sleeping more and going to bed earlier**
I slept through most of the terrible first three or four evenings so that the concious torture of the first days is shorter. It stayed with me so I have a much healthier sleeping pattern as a bonus of quitting

**Stay busy**
I tidied up, cleaned, planned, sorted  and got a lot of things done just because I needed some distraction. I also love to knit and do that when sitting around in the evening.

**Breathing through carvings**
Having used this simple trick already for coping with panic attacs I never tried this before for quitting. It helped in many situations, just concentration on the breathing combined with inducing and releasing tension with hands&arms and legs&feet

**Exercise, walking, cycling etc.**
For coping with carvings, to avoid trigger situations (bike to work instad of waiting for the bus -> trigger). 

**Drinking cold water during carvings**
Also in emergency situations I use cheweing gums, dark chocolate and actually whatever helps (including one shameful binge candy eating).

**Stay in places where you would not smoke anyway**
Eat inside the restaurant, don't drink coffee outside, libraries are great as well as my bed :)

**Tell everyone you quit (but be prepared for harmful comments)**
I had a lot of support (mostly from family and ex-smokers), some jealousy and some outright harmful comments. The best was my partner who gave up 3 days after I did and stayed withme until this day. The worst were some (never smoking) colleagues who told me that I gained a lot of weight (actually like 2-3 lbs and already losing again) and maybe shoud start smoking again. They honestly could not understand how awful smoking is and how difficult it was to quit. But I motivated three other people to give quitting a try so I won't let them down by relapsing. 

Smoking is not something I'm quitting lightly, I have a very strong addiction. The first days were just awful, I had  just terrible withdrawal symptoms (including headaches, anxiety, depression, anger and all the rest) BUT it really got easier after 3-6 days and easer again after 2 weeks and now I'm looking back in horror, feeling like staying alive after a big fight i didn't expect to survive. So if you are in any way like me, maybe the things I did to get through these first exhausting weeks will help you as well. I wish you all the best.

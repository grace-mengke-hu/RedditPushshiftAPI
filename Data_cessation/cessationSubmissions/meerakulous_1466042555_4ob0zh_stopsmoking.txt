Day 5 going strong but sleep cycle disrupted

Hey folks,

So I'm on my fifth day of quitting smoking and it's going quite well. The awful brain fog and lack of focus of day 1 is gone, cravings still come and go but I've gotten through dinner and a couple of nights out with friends without succumbing.

My question is whether any of you have had major sleep disruptions as a consequence of smoking, why it happens and if it gets better. On top of waking up a lot earlier than usual every day (between 5 and 6) I repeatedly find myself waking up at odd hours like or 2 or 4 am and having trouble falling back asleep. 

Any pointers or advice would be much appreciated.

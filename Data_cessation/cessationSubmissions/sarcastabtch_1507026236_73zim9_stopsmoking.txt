How to I stop being a bitter ex-smoker and become a non-smoker?

It's been 2.5 weeks since I've quit this time. This is the fourth time I've quit for any length of time; I've been a smoker for 20 years. I quit when I was pregnant with my children but always started again. After ten months of not smoking. 

I guess the problem for me is that I still miss it. And history dictates that in nine months, I will miss it then too. I enjoy smoking. The only reason I'm quitting is for money and because my kids are bugging me to quit. I know it's the right thing to do. 

I still can't hang out with smokers. I dream of smoking. I just feel like I'm always going to be a smoker who doesn't smoke.

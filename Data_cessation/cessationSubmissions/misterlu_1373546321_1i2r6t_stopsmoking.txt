Never fully quit, trying for real ?

Since I've never fully quit, I think I can say that I've smoked on and off since I was 14, and I am 20 now. I've stopped in the past for a max of about 4 months, and I feel that I use that gap to justify smoking whenever I do; as if I've "done it before, and it's okay". (I hope this makes sense). At this point, I don't smoke everyday, but, it seems I smoke a few times a week, and I'm bothered by it. I stumbled upon this subreddit on accident today, and I am inspired to see that this community is so large. I want to quit entirely, forever. Does /r/stopsmoking have any advice or similar experiences? I could really use an extra boost of motivation. Also, I think it should be mentioned that I don't buy cigarettes, I just have a lot of friends that are really ok with giving me cigarettes. I'm sure that a good deal of my smoking is for trying to quell anxiety and/or because it's sorta social. 

TL;DR - still smoke a little, I don't want to smoke at all. Need some motivation to begin.

Quit smoking on a backpacking trip, and a week later the cravings are kicking in!!

Like the title says I quit smoking on a one week backpacking trip.  The good thing was that I was so busy and working so hard that I didn't notice the withdrawals.  Now the down side is I am back home and to my normal routine and the cravings are killing me.  Any advice other than stay busy?

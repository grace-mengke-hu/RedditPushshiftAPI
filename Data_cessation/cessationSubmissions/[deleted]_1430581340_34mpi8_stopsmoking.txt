I have a small confession to make.

Actually a few small confessions. The first confession is that I sometimes enjoy recreational drugs. I smoke weed. I've done Ecstasy at raves. I drop acid once every 3-4 months. I've been known on very rare occasions to accept a bump of cocaine. I'm very careful with the choices I make regarding, and while on, these drugs.

Last weekend I did some acid and went to a show with some friends, after the show we walked back to my friends apartment and hung out for the rest of the night. It was really good acid, and I was flying. A few of my buddies are smokers, and at one point in the night I took a few drags off of one of their cigs. 

Before I go any further I'll explain that one of the best things about tripping acid is the synesthesia. It crosses wires in your head and you can hear feelings, taste colors, and feel sounds. If you've done it you know how delightfully (or horribly) twisted things can get.

I never enjoyed smoking while tripping, but I used to do it because I was compelled to. I remember it really felt awful, made my stomach hurt, burned my throat, and tasted and smelled terrible. But again, I was high, and in search of interesting sensations. I was also in search of affirmation. Have I done a good job? Was it worth the trouble making it this far? Yes. I have and it was. Those two drags were even more terrible than any cig I've had before. It burned like my first smoke all over again, and my throat hurt for the rest of the night. My commitment to quitting was re-affirmed in a huge way. I'm happy I've made it this far and have no desire to pick up another cig any time soon, which is why I've kept my flair. 

However, if this group, which has helped me reach this point, says I need to reset my flair as a point of honor, I will gladly do it. I'll be at 7 days and will have no problems whatsoever getting that other 290 back.

Progress update! - Now completely nicotine free.

It's been a while since I posted on here.

I've now been cigarette free for 6 months. I set myself a target of quitting vaping after that 6 months, and I'm happy to say I have been completely NICOTINE FREE for 2 weeks. No vaping, nothing. 

Vaping was actually not that hard to quit, it was more the habit of wanting to stand outside and breath something in that was hard to not think about. I replaced my vape with a tower of snus (lip tobacco, popular in Scandanavia). After the snus ran out, I had no real cravings for anything, and the habit of vaping was completely gone.

I threw my vape in the bin. I'm completely clean. Next step for me is to start doing some exercise, and continue to not eat too unhealthy. Hope you are all doing amazing! Don't give up, you can all do it!

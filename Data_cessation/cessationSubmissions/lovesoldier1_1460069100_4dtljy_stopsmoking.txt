Today is my 4th day

And it just ended (it's past midnight here)! I haven't got any cravings  even tho first three days are when you're still physically addicted to nicotine. 

And this was eighth time I stopped but this time I wasn't even giving t a thought, I just trashed rest of the pack and never smoked again. 

I hope I can make it guys! Stay strong, i know i will try to!

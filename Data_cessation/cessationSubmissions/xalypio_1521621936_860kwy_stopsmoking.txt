I feel soooo stupid sometimes

When I started Crossfit in November I didn't smoke for 3 weeks and was really, really proud of myself. Then I slipped and since then I just couldn't get into the right mindset to start another quit. The whole time doing crossfit (three times a week), which I absolutely love, I felt so stupid because i just can't breathe properly but I smoked anyway. About 10 cigs a day. Probably a few more on some days. I often wondered how these two things even could be combined?!

I tried stopping last week but my whole body felt kind of anxious/nervous and because of my story with anxiety and a panic attacks this feeling is not that nice. I know it's a combination of physical and psychological elements and that I need some quiet time to not lose myself in it. 

So... since my birthday comes up next week and I set that as my latest quit date I want to use this friday/saturday/sunday to get rid of the nicotine in my body. Friday is homeoffice so it's the first day I won't have the normal at-work-triggers plus I can just stay at home and try to relax... 

I hate this damn addiction and what it does to my body. I hate what it does to my mind even more. I want to be free and I honestly wish everyone that feels the same way to get over it too!

Well, see you on the other side soon... wish me luck or better yet willpower and patience.

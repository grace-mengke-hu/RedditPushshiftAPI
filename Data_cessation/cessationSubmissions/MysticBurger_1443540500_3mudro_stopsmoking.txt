Anger issues?

So I am actually despite my badge over three months in to quitting (I am terrible with dates)

I am a little hormonal right now but I still get irrationally angry at things and then immediately crave a cigarette. Is anger a common thing? I find myself wanting yell at inanimate objects and I scream at other cars. Not so they can hear me, but I still do it and I don't like it.

Any advice on this? How do you cope with this?

Edit: Added a thing.

How to reduce anxiety?

So after I quit smoking about a month and a week ago, I felt fine, I didn't think I was having ANY withdrawals at all, then I quit vaping which still had nicotine in it about a week or two ago and now everything is so incredibly hard, I'm so tired all the time, Headaches nearly all day, and the anxiety kicks in and I start shaking, sweaty palms, dizzy, it's such a fucking chore I don't want to give it up, but I need some help with the anxiety, at first I thought I was having low blood sugar problems, which I think I still could be, however I think the anxiety is making me think that along with slight hypocondria so I am in a vicious cycle of worrying myself to death... Need some advice peeps. @_@

(Also doesn't help I'm constantly googling symptoms of withdrawal even though I've already seen all of them...)

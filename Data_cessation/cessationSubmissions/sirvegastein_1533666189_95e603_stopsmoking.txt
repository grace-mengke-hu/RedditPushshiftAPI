I started reading during my work breaks to kill my urges

I had the habit to smoke a couple sticks during my work breaks. Like clockwork, whenever break/lunch time rolled and became a habitual thing. This became so habitual that when i decided to quit, this was one of my biggest triggers i had to overcome. At the time, I also wanted to do more reading and i had a couple books in my own library that that I've been meaning to tackle. Well i thought i would take advantage of the 10-15 minute breaks to sneak in some reading and replace my habit for something more productive. it's now become my favorite thing to do during my breaks. Instead of going outside for a smoke, i stay in the break room and get lose myself in a good book. My urges died down significantly after starting and whenever i feel an urge coming,  i just pick up my book and read where i left off.

Ps, am on mobile do i apologize for any grammer and spelling mistakes

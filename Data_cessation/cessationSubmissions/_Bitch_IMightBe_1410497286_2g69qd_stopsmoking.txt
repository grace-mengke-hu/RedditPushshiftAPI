D20 has been my down fall.

I've been smoke free for a month. as of tonight it is back to level 1.

I play DND every Thursday, and the guys that I have play with have stop smoking as well. but we use to have this ritual that every hour or so we would go outside and have a smoke and talk about our characters and such. Now, we still have these breaks, but they're sucking down these e cigs hoping to get that buzz they used to get. every Thursday we're always looking for that one guy that's going to give in and then be able to provide us with the cigarettes that we can also give in to.

And tonight, one guy did. I was mad at first, because we had all come a long way, and at a drop of a hat every other person was asking for a bum. 

I succumbed because deep down i really wanted one, and was happy my environment allowed it. ( also being inebriated helped)

I'm mad at myself, and hope others here can prove it's possible too over come these triggers. I guess I'm not strong enough. :/ 

Just wanted to be honest with someone about  this.

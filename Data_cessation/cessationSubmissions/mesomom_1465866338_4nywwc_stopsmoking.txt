40 yr smoker MOUTH AND TASTE ISSUES AFTER QUITTING

Hi everyone. I am 7 weeks into quitting cold turkey. I am having a lot of issues with my mouth: dry, tingling, burning, sore and food all tastes wrong (worse with hot than cold). I've tried rinsing with peroxide, baking soda, mouthwash; I scrape my tongue and brush a lot. Dentist says mouth looks fine. I have a few white blister type sores, like when you bite your cheek. It's really making me miserable. I am also using more salt because nothing tastes good and as a result I am swollen and bloated. I am a 57 yo female and I smoked for over 40 years The last several years I was under a 1/2 pack a day.

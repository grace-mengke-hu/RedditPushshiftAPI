Feeling like I might give in to one today

Good morning, all!

So, on my way to work today, I was hit with the overwhelming urge to have a smoke today. It's all I've thought about today so far. My brain is trying to convince me that having one is no big deal. Honestly, I need to figure out my headspace because ever since I quit, I feel like I'm a second away from having one. I need to somehow get my brain wrapped around how bad they are for me.

I guess I just wanted to talk about it. Thanks for reading!

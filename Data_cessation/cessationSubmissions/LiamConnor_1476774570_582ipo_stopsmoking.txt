Pack a day smoker for 7 years. Started champix 2 weeks ago.

My fiancé and I are taking champix, and the week leading up to my quit date I was scared that it wasn't working. I found myself smoking the same pack a day right up to the day before. I got an e-cig(with no nicotine) to help with the oral fixation. The first three days were still very difficult. And there have been some side effects (nausea, vivid dreams) but I have been smoke free for 14 days now and am still going strong. Don't give into urges to just have a drag it takes 3 days for all the nicotine to leave your system and you don't want to restart that process. I barely use the e-cig but when I get an intense craving it helps having a surrogate. My fiancé has been experiencing some more severe side effects such as negative thoughts, extreme irritability. She has reduced her dose in half but is also 14 days smoke free and I'm really proud of us!

Nicotine replacement

First off... I've never smoked. I've been addicted to lozenges and gum for 2 years though :/ , trying to quit it all. I can do without the drug nicotine as long as I have something else to fixate on in my mouth that tingles and is "spicy" like a mint or gum. I'm looking for something that doesn't have sugar in it though, so I don't want to use those options. Also, I don't think the spiciness lasts as long as Nici.  Someone recommended cinnamon and eucalyptus oil. Curious to know if you guys have any other recommendations for new healthy vices to ween off with.

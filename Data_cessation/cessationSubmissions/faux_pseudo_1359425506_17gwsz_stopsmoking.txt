Hit random for first time in a long time. Brought me here.  Been smoke free for 365 days.

Smoked for 16 years.  Had failed quitting three times before for as long as 6 weeks.  A year ago to the day I went to the doc with a cold.   Decided that it was time to quit or spend too much time with doctors in the future. 

Got an e-cig on the way home.  Smoked it as normal for a week.  Realised it just wasn't cutting it and gave up in it.  But in giving up on them I didn't go back to smoking.  

Total chance that on this day I hit the random subreddit buttton. Then on the first hit I ended up here. happy birthday to my quitting birthday. 

Good willpower to all of you trying to quit now.

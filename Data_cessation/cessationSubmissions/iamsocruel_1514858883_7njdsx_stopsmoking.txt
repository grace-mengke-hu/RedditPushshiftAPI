What mg patch should I start with?

I have smoked for 25 years and I quit for 2 years.  I fell off the wagon and have been smoking again for at least 6 years. I smoke about 12-14 cigarettes a day. Last time I quit smoking I used nicoderm 21 mg patch and it helped a lot at first. No cravings at all. However after the second week I woke up one morning and started violently throwing up. Iâ€™m talking projectile across the room puking. It was completely clear like water but so bad I thought I was gonna die. I went down to the 14 mg patch the next day and I was fine after that. I want to try the patch again but not sure if I should take the method advised on the box, or just start at step 2?  Has this happened to anyone else? Have you had success starting on step 2 right away?

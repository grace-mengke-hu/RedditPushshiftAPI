I can't figure out how to quit.

I wanna quit smoking. I quit once six years ago and didn't touch a sig in three months. I was "free", but then one Saturday night i sucked up 40 of those suckers in 8-12 hours. Even though my lungs felt horrible the sunday after, I bought a new pack and here I am now, smoking 20 on a good day, 40 on a bad day.

Last time I read Allan Carrs Easy way, and It worked. I have now over the last three months read it 4 times. Does not work. I have "quited" smoking 6-8 times while reading the book. Throwing out whole packs of smokes out the car window, crushing them, flushing them, dunking the whole pack in gasoline and set it on fire.  The urge to smoke the plant are unfathomable great. I am lost.

I really want to quit. I like smoking, but it is way to expensive. I spend about 20% on my income on tobacco. That is more than I spend on living quarters! My second reason to wanting to stop smoking is that it is killing me. Literally. And my third reason is that I would like to have better lung capacity. 

So, even though Mr Carr tells me that there is no "willpower" involved in quitting smoking, there is. But my addiction to nicotine is greater than my willpower.

Any help and suggestions is greatly appreciated!

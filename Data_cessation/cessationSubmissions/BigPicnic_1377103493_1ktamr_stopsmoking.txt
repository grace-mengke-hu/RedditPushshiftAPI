What should i expect moving forward?

So, today is my fourth day as a non-smoker, and i am feeling pretty awesome!  I still have the urge to smoke once in a while (based mainly on old routines and boredom) but do not feel like i *need* to smoke anymore.  My question for you all is, what are the ups and downs i should expect moving forward?  Is the worst over?  I've read that after 3 days you are over the *physical* addiction to nicotine, is this true?

Anyways, any advice on what to expect would be helpful.

PS.  I have honestly never been as proud of myself for anything i have ever done.  Quitting smoking has been the greatest self-esteem builder in my life.  I truly feel like I can do anything now.

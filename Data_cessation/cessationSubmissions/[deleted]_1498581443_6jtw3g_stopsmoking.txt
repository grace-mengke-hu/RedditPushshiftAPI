Felt proud today!

I was in a shit project last year that basically escalated and cemented my smoking from a fun thing to a dangerous addiction and dependency.

This year I have fought it with all my life and the result is tremendous.  Such freedom from the dire slavery and misery smoking enforces upon us. 

I have left the project two months back and got into another one after long fight with HR team. However got to train some of my juniors into that shit hole of a project.

I met one such dude morning today. He was coming down the building which he usually does not. He said he was tensed as the task handed to him was not in his scope and there were nobody to help him out. I felt bad for him but also suspected if he came down to smoke. 

We bid farewell as I was getting late for my meeting. But I felt amazed and proud of my own words to the bloke. 

Here were my literal words, 
"You have not started smoking , Have you? Please don't brother. I beg of you! ". 
He nodded he will not smilingly. 
That made my day today!
Thought this should be on here. :)

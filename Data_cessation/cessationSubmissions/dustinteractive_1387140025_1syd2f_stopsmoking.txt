I'm making an app to help people quit smoking, but I need your guys' help!

This subreddit has served as an inspiring reference point for me during the development of my app QuitCharge. 

QuitCharge was designed for smokers who are wishing to kick the habit "cold turkey" style. You can track cravings, win trophies and get encouragement along the way. It was designed to be simple, beautiful and informative.

The app has served its original intended purpose. I have been smoke free for over a year now. It was through the testing of the beta where I first began my journey. 

QuitCharge has been very successful in the app store and I owe it to you guys. It was the spirit of this subreddit that inspired me to quit and build it and now I need your guys help to take it to the next level.

We are building the 2.0 now and would like to include more features. I want QuitCharge to be a powerhouse tool that has everything any smoker would ever need to make it through a craving. 

Besides tracking cravings what other features would you guys find helpful?

We are thinking of including a social feature where you can post a craving to Facebook and have your friends support you through it. Would that be something you'd be willing to put out there for people to see?

Any ideas would be much appreciated. Keep up the good work everyone. You guys inspire me.

That old smoker who never gets sick

I think most of us know one, that long time smoker, usually a person 50+ years old who seemed to defy all odds, and remained "healthy for a smoker". Many smokers use that person as example to tell themselves that "it's alright, people are scaremongering, it's not that bad", "maybe I'll be like that one old smoker and live long", "maybe I won't die of cancer". 


When I smoked I had such persons in my life, one of them an elderly aunt, a retired nurse. For the past few years she had been suffering of "random pains", attributed to anything else except smoking - never smoking. Last week she had to be rushed to a hospital, for severe abdominal pain, they thought it was IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), and then an obstruction, but eventually they found a tumor in her colon. She has cancer, and it's spread to affect several organs. We don't know if she's going to make it, the odds are against her. Her "random pains" were linked to this, and for all we know the pain was hardcore, she just pretended it wasn't so bad.


Sure, we all are going to die one day. But such a painful condition over sucking on those cancer-sticks is just absolutely unnecessary.


I just felt like sharing, I've had this in my mind all week since I was told about my aunt. 


I just made it 8 months, I'm never going back.

Is this a viable substitute.

I'm 2 days in, and crave them at random points throughout the day. I have a Black N' Mild that I've been smoking to try to slowly get rid of the need to smoke. Is that an okay temporary substitute or will it lead me right back to cigarettes. In the past two days I've been smoking the saem B+M taking about 3 puffs then putting it out. What do you think?

It's been one year since I smoked my last cigarette.

I smoked about a pack a day for close to 20 years.  Every time I tried to quit I'd fall off within a day or two and I honestly didn't think I'd ever be able to quit for good.  

In the last year I've taken the money I would have spent on smokes and I've gone on vacation to Central America for 2 weeks, I've bought a guitar and started teaching myself to play, and I've purchased a bunch of tools to build out a workshop in my garage.  Feels pretty damned good, man.

I always used to say cigarettes were the most faithful lover I'd ever had.  I loved smoking, but I had to kick that bitch to the curb.  I'm so glad I did and I'm never looking back.  If I can do it you can too.  One day at a time; hell, sometimes it was 5 minutes at a time.  Eventually all those minutes add up and you realize you've done what you once thought was impossible.

edit: Thank you kind stranger for the gold, and thank you to everyone else for your kind words.

Please help.

So about 5years ago I started smoking, I smoked for a year before I quit because of my parents. I didn't really want to quit at that time. Fast forward a  few weeks then months I had no trouble or any withdrawal symptoms. 2years after I was nicotine free came College. I was planning on finally smoking as much as I wanted because my parents were no longer around, and deep down I still loved it. I smoked for another year before starting to really feel my lungs deteriorating. That's when I genuinely started to think about stoping fast forward a few months later I'm back with my parents and tried to avoid smoking to respect them. I didn't smoke for just over month then I went back to the city I used to study in amongst my smoker friends and for the first time I felt really anxiety. Fear of death, fear of everything around me, over thinking every single thing, I couldn't take it anymore, the loneliness, the fear, so I relapsed and promised my self that as soon as my mother comes back home I would quit. And I did my last cigarette was roughly 3 to 4months ago. But I did replace it by vaping on a 12mg e-liquid for a couple months and then finally decided to switch to a non nicotine e-liquid. I carried on for a few days before I decided to completely stop even the vaping. Now after roughly 4 to 5weeks I don't have a single craving, in fact I hate the smell, but the anxiety is kicking back in. And I read on websites that only occurs in the first few days and can go up to a few weeks, but for me it only starts a few weeks after I'm nicotine free which is making me more anxious. Please if this happened to you let me know the fear is unbearable sometimes.

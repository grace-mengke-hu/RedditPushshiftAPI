Saw my gums...

So I've been smoking for a year and a half now, casual smoker before, but I never really saw the effects of smoking on myself, but I was just brushing my teeth and noticed that my gums had blackened. I felt so terrible and said to myself fuck that. I really don't want smoking to impact my appearance, and I've been wanting to quit for a while now, and this gave me the real incentive. This happened only about half an hour ago so I just hope I can really stop smoking.

One week and its been easy!

I finished Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking last Thursday.  Friday was the worst day I had.  I woke up craving a cigarette and couldn't get into that positive thinking.  I took my daughter to a movie that afternoon and it took my mind off smoking.  Ever since it has been really easy.  I really think the difference was in what I learned.  My daughter bet me $5 I would smoke in a week.  Happy to say she is paying me today!

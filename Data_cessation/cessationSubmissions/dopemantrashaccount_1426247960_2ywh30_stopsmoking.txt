no mo smokes, no mo heroins

So my last shot of some heroin was on Monday and my last ciggy was on Tuesday.  Starting to feel better.  I can tell the anxiety from quitting smoking can be more intense than that from quitting dope.  Getting the clammy crawly skin from the opiate withdrawals (not a lot of fun), but sometimes opiate withdrawals make me trip out like I'm on acid, and I just had this image of what I was doing to my body, and the symptoms have been been more tolerable since then.  Got a lot going for me right now, making it through.
Going mostly cold turkey, I do have ibuprofen, cranberry juice, and immodium for the poops.  Did use some ecig, couple puffs two or three times a day, felt it helped keep me from going out and getting a pack.
Woo, we can do it!

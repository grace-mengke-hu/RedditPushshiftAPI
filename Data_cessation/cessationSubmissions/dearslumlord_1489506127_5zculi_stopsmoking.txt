Quit smoking, just now exercised and my lungs hurt???

Alright, I don't know if this normal or not, but I've recently quit smoking and decided to go on the treadmill for a bit. Did it for about 10 minutes, pretty fast. After I finished my throat burned really badly, so did my lungs. I actually coughed up some gunk (probably still in my body too), now I feel better. 

I'm worried though. I've only smoked for not even a year, and I'm 21. I'm about 130 pounds, and to be honest, this is the first time I have actually exercised in probably years. 

Is this just body clearing itself out? Or is this something more serious?

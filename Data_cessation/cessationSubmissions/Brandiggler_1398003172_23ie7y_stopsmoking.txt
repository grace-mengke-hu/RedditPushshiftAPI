Starting again...again.

At this point I'm pretty ashamed of my lack of willpower with this awful habit. Here I am, Easter morning thinking about how crappy I feel from lasts nights drinking and smoking. I don't understand how on Mondays I feel so passionate about quitting and then by Friday I'm ready to light up. Maybe I need more reminders around me about quitting, I tend to go in a hopeless "Who cares, you're single, nobody gives a shit anyway even if they say you should quit. At the end of the day they could care less" mode. I get very philosophically negative and apathetic. I really hate this habit, good luck to you all working on your quit. I'm gonna give this another shot.

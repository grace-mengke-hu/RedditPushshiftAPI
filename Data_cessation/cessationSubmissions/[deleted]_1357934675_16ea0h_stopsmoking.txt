11 Days in and Going Strong But...

I am just mentally not in the best place, I have no intent of starting again, in fact my cravings have decreased considerably since the first several days, but I am feeling much more anxious and depressed than I usually ever do.

Yesterday I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was being way too easily irritated, not all that social, and just generally bummed out. I assume this is just the withdrawal and will eventually go away, but can anyone share some anecdotal advice?

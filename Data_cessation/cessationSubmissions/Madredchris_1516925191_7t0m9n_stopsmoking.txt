6 months+ . Forgot to bragpost :(

So yeah, here it is. Kind of forgot about smoking in general, Only when im grabbing some beers with friends I have a rough time, with, i have to admit, some weak moments where I gave but most of the times, when my friends tell me; You quit, don't grab another when you're drunk. I have a moment of clarity and toss the portable cancer.

So im confident to say; I quit! 

*PS The returning smell isnt always as good as it seems.*

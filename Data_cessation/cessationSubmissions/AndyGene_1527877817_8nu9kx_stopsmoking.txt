Several years ago I never went more than two hours without nicotine.

As of today I have gone 8760 consecutive hours without any!  Today marks one year since the end of my nicotine replacement therapy.  and around 1.2 years since my last smoke.

This community helps me a lot now.  When I get a craving, I come here and read until my craving subsides.  That's why I seem so angry sometimes.  i will be toasting tonight to a lifetime of nicotine sobriety, for my health, my family and myself.  I will never touch nicotine again.

When do the cravings stop???

I'm on my 7th day, and everyday it kind of feels like I'm on my first or second day without smoking. I was on chantix, which I've taken before, so I thought my withdrawals would be less severe. I was smoking almost a pack a day for about 8 years. When will I feel normal again? It's hard to stay motivated with this constant shit feeling when I know smoking is the only thing that makes me feel normal again. :(

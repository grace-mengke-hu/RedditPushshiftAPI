Smoked for 17 years...

I smoked for 17 years. I quit several times, now I'm on Chantix and I'm 6 days smoke free. I recently found out that I have a 3mm nodule on the lower lobe of my right lung and I'm terrified that I've quit too late. I'm scared my children are going to grow up fatherless like I did (for a different reason altogether).

Making another go at it. 4 hours in and feeling good.

Haven't had a smoke in 4 hours now, which is a very long time for me (if I've smoked already that day, which I have. If not I can usually go about 4 hours before withdrawal starts getting hard to deal with), and I feel really good. Quitting was a spur of the moment decision, I downloaded Get rich or die smoking, and set that all up, now I'm sitting here watching some football, and I'm doing pretty well. I've got a bit of a headache and I feel a little stiff, but I'm doing well, at least by comparison to last time.
Wish me luck!

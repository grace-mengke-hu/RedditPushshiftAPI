10 years of smoking as an asthmatic and I've finally quit!

Hello, I'm a 25 yr old social work student from America living in the UK.

I've been asthmatic since I started smoking at age 15.  I smoked every day approx. 15-20 cigarettes/day from age 16-21.  I quit smoking daily at age 21, but continue smoking at the pub.  This is a big achievement for me at the time.  But I go to the pub quite regularly and binge-smoke, or at least drink a beer or two at home and allow myself to smoke then, so I average about 10 cigarettes/day still.

I continue to not need a cigarette unless I have a drink for approx. 4 years.  I occasionally try to quit but fail.

Finally, last week (age 25), I gave it a go and am doing better than I have ever done in previous attempts.  I've been to the pub and with friends many times and have not smoked.  I use nicotine gum whenever I fancy a cigarette.

I know there is still a ways to go, but I feel this is the best I've done in a long time.  Thanks for the support!

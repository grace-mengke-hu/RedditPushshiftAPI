Nearing end of week two

It's been 12 days. I am infamous for writing too much, but it's hard to abbreviate sometimes. I can't believe how powerful the drug nicotine is. I thought the reports that it would take 3 to 4 weeks to go through withdrawal were exaggerated, or "for those other types". 

No... That's pretty damn accurate. I can see how it might even be 2 months before I feel human again.

I can not focus, and I am highly aware of this because my work is purely mental. I do freelance work mostly in web dev. I've done this stuff for over a decade, I only need to sit down and do it... but sitting down to focus on something is a challenge, and where did my energy go? 

How many years of my life were "dependent" upon the morning coffee and smoke to give me a kickstart? And all the smoke breaks in between accomplishments to make the day go easier.

But now, I feel absolutely no cravings at all. No urges, no fits, nothing. Because the more I come to realize how dependent I was upon the drug, the more I want out of it. I'm not angry, I'm not hateful, I just want out.

I've gone out to drink twice and had a few beers without smoking. I wasn't tempted at all. Other people were smoking around me once or twice. Good for them, but just not for me. So I guess I am incredibly lucky for that part. I had cravings the first week, but somehow I just worked them out by realizing "the habit" when it came, and thinking about my motivators. And taking a breath or two of fresh air.

I'm not claiming there is absolutely zero temptation, it's always there. But I think I kind of "made friends" with it. The temptation itself ignites my motivation to be smoke free.

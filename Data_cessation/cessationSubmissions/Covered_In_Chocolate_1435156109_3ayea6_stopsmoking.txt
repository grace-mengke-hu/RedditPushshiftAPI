Any advice from experienced quitters to someone just starting?

This is my first time posting here. I've been smoking for the past year since I started college and I think now it's the time to stop. I was recently diagnosed with depression and with the stress of classes (I'm taking summer classes) and new anti-depressants I just keep finding excuses for myself to smoke. I'll get really angry and think "a cigarette will help me calm down" or when I don't want to study "just one and then I will be able to work out these problems." Essentially I just want to stop using excuses and quit all together for a healthier me. Does any one have any advice from when they first started out?

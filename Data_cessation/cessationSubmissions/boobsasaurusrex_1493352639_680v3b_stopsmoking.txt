Struggling today....

I quit smoking 4/4 with the help of nicotine patches. On Tuesday, 4/25 I stepped down from 21mg patches to 14mg patches and it is far harder than I ever thought it would be. The cravings to smoke a cigarette today are out of this world. I've stayed strong so far and know that if it gets too bad I can go back to a 21mg patch before going back to cigs. 
Another thing I'm struggling with is fear of weight gain. Today I've had more craving to eat/over eat than I ever have. I assume it's because of stepping down on the patch, but I'm terrified of gaining weight. I'm already a big girl and the last thing I need to do is replace nicotine with food. I've been very hyper-aware of what I'm eating so far, but today I gave in. I also can't gain any weight because I'm getting married in November and have a dress to fit into. Does anyone have an tips or tricks on the eating/over eating part of this journey? Or any tips on transferring my will power from not smoking to not gaining weight or even weight loss? Any help is very appreciated.

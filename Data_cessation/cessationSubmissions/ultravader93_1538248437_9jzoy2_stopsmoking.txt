2 months and 18 days smoke free but everyday reminded why i even started

I decided that this summer I should stop smoking and I have successfully but the only problem is it's hard in my shoes..... Smoking made me feel free made me feel like I was never alone. Got me more friends and not to worry about a single thing in the world cuz I knew I will be dying sooner than everybody. The stress on by back just gets too heavy it's like I'm carrying a world on my back. The stuff I've seen and been through.... Nobody should experience such a childhood and life. I feel like I'm about to enter into breaking point and get my life into shit by turning into my addictions again.... Just because it felt comfortable...just because it felt great! I feel like I'm going to be driven insane with the people I'm with but can't do shit except wait a year to see them all go. I just need a hint of motivation. I come from a family of chimneys and it never ends out well for any of them it reminds me why I stopped by why I started. I keep getting shivers and shaking like crazy since I stopped, but I've felt more energetic. What do I even do? Im really tempted to take a smoke and the craving is just killing me

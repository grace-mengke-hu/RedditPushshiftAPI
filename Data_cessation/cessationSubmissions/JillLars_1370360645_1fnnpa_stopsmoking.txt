Coming up on a month, cravings...

I'm rapidly approaching 1 month smoke free.  For the most part I've felt fine the last 3 weeks, but cravings have been sneaking back in over the last couple days and I'm really not sure why.  I feel like there are times when I expect to have cravings (i.e. out drinking, or hanging out with other smokers, etc.) but these seem to come from out of nowhere.

Has anyone else experienced this?  How do you deal with unexpected cravings?

Today is day one!

I had previously quit for a year and half (pregnancy and what not), but life stress got to me and I fell off the bandwagon, HARD. I was back up to a pack a day within like 5 days. So I’ve been smoking again for around 2 months. Last night I woke up to a vicious cough attack and said this is enough, this has to stop. I don’t ever want my children to see me smoke. So first thing this morning I put on a patch, and I’m feeling pretty good. Let me know what your favorite smoking cessation app for iOS is!

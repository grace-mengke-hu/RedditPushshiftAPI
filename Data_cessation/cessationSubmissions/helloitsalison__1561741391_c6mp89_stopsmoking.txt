3.5 days in and my brain feels like it’s going to melt out of my ears.

The headaches! Actually just the one headache, that has been kicking around for 24+ hrs. 

Did y’all go through this? My whole head and neck and face are in so much pain. Advil and caffeine and lots of water — my normal cures — don’t seem to be helping. What will make this thing go away?!

Silver Lining: my head hurts so much even the idea of smoking make me nauseous. 🤷🏼‍♀️

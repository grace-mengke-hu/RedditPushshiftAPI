Emotional Effects of Nicotine Withdrawl

Hello all. I’m happy I found this sub. 

I’ve been almost 2 weeks since I last smoked.

I’m having some of the typical symptoms I’ve had in the past when I’ve tried to quit - trouble sleeping, anxiety, depression - but to be honest have never made it past the 2-3 week mark.

The past few days the low feelings have been quite intense and I’m struggling quite a bit. 

I’m committed to quitting completely this time but was curious if anyone who has experience staying off cigarettes longer than me can share their experience as encouragement. 

Did anyone else experience depression or emotional symptoms? How long did they last? Any tips to help?

Thank you!

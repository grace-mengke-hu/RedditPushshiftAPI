A fortnight and better teeth!

So here I am, a fortnight through my quitting phase (that would be about 2 weeks for my fellow yanks. =P), and I've noticed that my teeth are beginning to lose their previous staining tremendously. I use to abhor giving a smile, let alone my breath come out, but now that I've been free of the cancer sticks for a little bit, I can already see not only my lungs are getting healthier, but so too is my mouth!




So to all the other newquitters and the quitters coming to be, here's just another tidbit of a reward you may make should you continue on with your journey! Chewing on gum to bypass the oral fixation also helps wonders for both your addiction and your breath!

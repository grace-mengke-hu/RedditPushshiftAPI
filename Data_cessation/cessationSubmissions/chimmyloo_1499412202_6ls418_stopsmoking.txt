It's officially been two days.

This is my second cold turkey approach, the first time I only got halfway through day 2 before breaking down for a smoke. My "Smoke Free" app says the nicotine is officially out of my body, so I guess that just means my want for a cigarette is all mental at this point? I'm pretty proud of myself, I even went out to a bar earlier! I mean, I still reallllly wanted to smoke, but I didn't!

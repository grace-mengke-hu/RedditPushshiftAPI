Fuck. Can someone just talk to me? Struggling.

I've been trying to quit since two Sundays ago (Mother's Day). I smoked half a cigarette that morning (split the last one in the house with my friend), and bought an electronic cigarette. I was a 5-7 cigarette a day smoker (during the week), but I'd have closer to half a pack on the weekends, or a pack or two a day depending on what substance I was using. 

I went 6 days without a cigarette. I could smell again. I could smell how awful smokers smelled. I wanted cigarettes, but I didn't give in. Saturday, before work, my e-cig battery died. My buddy, who I hadn't seen in six months, picked me up from work. He was a smoker, and I was craving. I ended up having three that day, before I got my e-cig charged, and got back on that. 

Sunday night, my cartomizer stopped working. My battery is fine, as far as I can tell, but I haven't had it since then. 

I had a pack of Black clove cigars, and I've been having 1 - 1.5 of those each day. I don't feel like I NEED them, but I just want them. I just smoked one. 

I can't get to the smoke shop to replace my cartomizer until Friday, after community service, where I'd chainsmoke like a champ (Fridays I'd generally go through a pack a day), because it was one of the only ways that I could get a break from the drudgery.

I'm fighting the urge to buy a pack, partly because I know its not worth it,  but at the same time it just feels so worth it.

I miss fucking cigarettes, and I'm having trouble convincing myself that this one pack is going to ruin me. I think part of the problem is that I didn't actually WANT to quit - I quit because I knew that it was the right thing. I just...fuck I don't know, it was just so easy to quit with the e-cig, and I know that I can do it again once I fix it. I feel like I already have my mind made up, and at the same time I know I don't because I'm spending the time to type this out.

Words of advice? Thanks for reading :)

Attempt nr. 11 or 12. Any tips?

So I'm trying to stop for the god knows what time. Trying some of the replacement stuff this time (those bandaid things. No idea if they have any special name). Tried vaping before but that only worked for like 2 days so probably wont do that again.  
I think the biggest issue is that i mostly smoke when i'm stressed or bored (sadly the stress part is barely avoidable).

Honestly not sure if my body is even ready to quit since even writing this meaningless post is somewhat hard for me. (Or maybe i just suck with words.)

Sorry if this is all over the place.  
Hope you all have a nice day

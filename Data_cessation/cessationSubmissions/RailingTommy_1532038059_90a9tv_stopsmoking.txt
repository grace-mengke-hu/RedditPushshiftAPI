Need help quitting!

Hey guys,
I have been smoking 8 years and I need to stop. I tried almost everything, from nicotine chewing gums(which Iâ€™m allergic) to cold turkey. But I always go back to cigarettes, longest was 4 months before I ended up smoking again due to stress. If anyone has any advice please tell me. Thanks in advance

Just learned a lesson about breakfast

You may have read that your body processes blood sugar differently when you stop nicotine. 

Well, I tried to go to work with just my normal coffee breakfast. I felt like I was going to pass out from dizziness the whole time I was driving, like a 30 minute long panic attack. Managed to grab an apple from my bag and eat it 2/3 of the way there and starting to feel a little better now. 

This is my first night back at work after quitting. I managed to swing 5 days off and spent the worst of it at home. I feel so weird. My eyes are crossing, things look surreal. 

I never thought I'd think this, but I really don't want to smoke. The cigarette itself is not attractive. The hand to mouth motion, the inhalation/exhalation? None of it seems like fun. 

I just want my brain back to normal. It feels like it is full of cotton and confusion and tension.

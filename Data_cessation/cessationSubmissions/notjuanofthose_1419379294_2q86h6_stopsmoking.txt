I didn't smoke last week

So I haven't smoked in over a year but I saw several people struggling during the first stages of quitting and I wanted to share how easy last week was to offer some perspective. On Monday 15th some friends came to my place for dinner and after they left I found a pack of cigarettes with 3 cigs left. 

If this had happened the first month or two after I quit I would have either given in to the temptation or thrown them away to avoid it. 

But it happened last week, more than a year after I quit. What I did was just set them aside. I didn't even think about them during the week. Last night some friends came over to my place again and someone got some free cigs, that was the end of it.

I used to smoke more than a pack a day, now I barely think about smoking even when there are cigarettes right there in front of me (and nobody around to judge me if I cave). 

I just wanted to let you know that it does get better. I literally cried on the 4th. day I didn't smoke, but eventually it became easier. I had a rough time around the 100th. day, it was a hard week, but I didn't smoke. By the time I got to one year smoke free it seemed smoking was so behind me that I didn't even post here.

If you are struggling during the first stages of quitting remember that a day will come when you no longer think about smoking. That day is closer than you think, all you have to do is not smoke. Everybody can do that. 

Keep strong.

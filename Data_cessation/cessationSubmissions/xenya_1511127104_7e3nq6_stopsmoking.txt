Got stressed and bought cigs

I asked for my badge to be removed because it's not updating right, but I probably am supposed to remove it because I smoked. I quit on Tuesday and was counting last night as day 4. Cravings were the worst they have been since I quit and I was feeling awful. My SO got mad about something and started yelling, which set me off and I went and bought cigarettes. I cried too. I smoked one last night and put them in the freezer. I smoked one this morning. 
I'm trying to get my mindset right again but it hasn't clicked yet. I only smoked one instead of starting back up again but I still lapsed. Does that mean I have to start all over again with the withdrawals just as bad as the first time? Ugh.

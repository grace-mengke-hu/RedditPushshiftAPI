Planning my quit.

Last year I quit.  I got a vaporizer, tapered down an then stopped the vaporizer and had 4 months of no smoke, no vape, no nicotine.  Physical withdrawal, foggy head, all that I can handle.  However, my mental health deteriorated slowly over the first 3 months and after several visits to therapy and the doctor and three different prescriptions, I started the vaporizer again and have been normal mentally ever since. 

 If I try this again, I don't know how I can deal with this, as it was almost like I was a different person in a bad way, and that's coming from others, not me.  I know I was a mess, and I did some real damage both my personal and professional lives.  

I spoke with my doctor and they just said we can try some other drugs, and I have someone who can spot the symptoms, I don't want to be cycling drugs again hoping one helps, that is not really a plan, that is throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.  Can anyone offer any advice for me?  My doctor believes that I am self medicating,  I agree.  And even if I successfully transition from nicotine, I very well may be permanently medicated, which beyond the physical side effects,  I feel like I'll be trading one for the other,  and am not convinced I will come out ahead.

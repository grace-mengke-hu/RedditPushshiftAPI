Competitive way to start your ever-lasting battle with quitting

Hi everyone, 
We all know how difficult is to make a decision to ''stop smoking'' when you have in your mind that you are doing it ''once and for all" and that cigarette you are holding is supposed to be the last one ever. 
The infinity in that idea is killing every one of us and we are discouraged to even start or think about it.

Me and my friend accidentally found a way to start the struggle easier. One day (before either of us lighted the first cigarette for that day) we started provoking each other who is a bigger pussy, weaker person, has weaker power of will and no balls and such other childish stuff, and who will start smoking first. 
Because we invested so much in our verbal battle in a group chat on Viber with another friend, the battle started to be pretty serious, who will succumb first? 

After 5 days straight both without a single cigarette smoked, I lost at the sixth day evening (Saturday night out for a beer with friends, it was very difficult). 

But we did it for five days! 
It was so much easier not to smoke, when both of us knew that we will righteously have our cigarette once the other guy lose it, and that the struggle is not only ours.
We are starting new round on Monday, and we've got some house rules made on the way:
1. It is forbidden to smoke.
2. Honour is at stake.
3. IQOS and other cigarette substitutes are forbidden.
4. There are absolutely no exceptions where you can light a smoke, whatever the situation.
5. Who lights the fire first, must send the other guy the short viber clip of himself smoking, so that other guy can relieve his pain and smoke his winning cigarette (without the doubt that the other guy is bluffing and teasing him to lose unfairly)
6. Hookah (Nargila) or weed is allowed to be smoked two times a month. If someone smoke something of this the third time automatically lose the challenge.

What do you think about it? :)

Two weeks smoke-free: What changed

After smoking for almost 6 years on off, finally quit two weeks back. What helped me:  
1.Allen Carr - Made me realize I don't like smoking  
2.Smoke free app - Love seeing my health meters go up  
3.This sub - Thanks all the mods for sticking around even after quitting.  

Compared to two weeks back, now I have  
1.More energy  
2.A delicious feeling of calmness  
3.Appetite, Enjoying food once more  
4.Being able to smell (Although I caught cold few days back, so there's that).  
5.Better sleep  

I tried many times before, but always grudgingly. This time it's for real, because I now know I hate smoking. Just the calm feeling all the time is worth it. If you want to quit I can't recommend Allen Carr enough. As per the program,you have to continue smoking until you have finished the book, so there's nothing to lose.  Good Luck !!

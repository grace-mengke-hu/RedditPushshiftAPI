Day Two

I've been smoking 2-3 packs a week for about 8 years now, and I finally decided I'm done with this shit. I've always said I'd quit when I want to quit, but I didn't realize until the other day that I have been wanting to quit, but I've just been submitting to my urges, so I decided I have to control myself. Quitting smoking is essentially my act of self-discipline, since I enjoy the act quite a bit but know I really can't be doing this forever.

Anyway, day one yesterday went by really easily because I had this sense of pride in quitting and it gave me strength. Today I've been thinking about smoking a lot. Now It's 10 o'clock at night and I've had a couple beers I'm contemplating ONE smoke just so I can get the damn thing off my mind. But I'm afraid this is going to be some downward spiral or I'll be cheating my integrity. Can I still quit if I have one when I drink sometimes? I honestly can't tell if I'm just rationalizing but the cravings have been strong and persistent all day. 

Any advice?

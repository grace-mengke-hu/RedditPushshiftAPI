Quit Smoking Hypnosis app

I have nothing to do with this app except that I discovered it last night and I love it! I had low expectations, but I listened to the first recording and I feel like it really helped me let go of some stuff. 

Nine days and going strong! Not nearly as cranky as I was a few days ago either. ;)

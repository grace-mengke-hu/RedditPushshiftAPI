Addicted to the habit not the nicotine?

Does anyone else feel like their addicted to the habits surrounding smoking more than the actual nicotine?
I can quit for weeks and feel a lot better physically but mentally I can't get rid of the feeling that my life somehow is better as a smoker. Even though I know I get horrible side effects from smoking, and I'm only going to get more health problems the more I smoke, I always pick it up again.
I've tried vaping instead but even if I smoke it for 10 minutes non stop I still crave a cigarette.

I've smoked for about 5 years and I'm 21 and every time I quit I get this feeling that I've smoked too much and my brain can't get rewired to believe it's a non smoker.
Anyone else who relates that have found ways to overcome this mentality?

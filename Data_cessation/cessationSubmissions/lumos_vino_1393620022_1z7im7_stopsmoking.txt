how much weight did everyone gain (if any) when they quit?

i know weight gain is a big concern for people when it comes to quitting, so i am interested in how much people really do gain. or if people have quit and not gained a lb. also whether its from eating more, or having a slower metabolism, ect. Trying to put into perspective for myself that a little weight gain is way better than all the side effects of smoking! also if you gained weight, have you lost it?

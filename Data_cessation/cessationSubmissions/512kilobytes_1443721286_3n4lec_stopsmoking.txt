Very depressed after I quit

Been smoke free for about 6 months, I do suffer with depression that I take tablets for but just the last few days I've felt really bad like there's no point in life been drinking a lot to block out the feelings and spending loads of time in bed not going out, it's doing my head in, I was doing really well a few weeks ago I joined the gym, did loads of walking and read loads, but I'm just not interested anymore in anything

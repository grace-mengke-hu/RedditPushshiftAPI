Relapsed :(

Hi guys I only just found this sub, I have being smoking for nearly 10 years, I downloaded the quit smoking app and quit immediately and didn't have a single one for 6 days it was going good until today I relapsed after being stressed out going through a break up and have had fucking 7 since, I feel like shit and am extremely disappointed in myself telling myself  that I've already crossed a line so to speak and ill just finish this packet and then stop, should I just get rid of the smokes does that thought process ever work? I dont even know what im asking for i guess I'm just venting.

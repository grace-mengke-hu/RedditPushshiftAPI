26, smoker for 8 years , how do you do it

Hey all ,  I have been smoking for 8 years, currently im smoking almost 2 packs a day , I tried quitting before never lasted a day , never lasted 12 hours , I found my self reaching for my pockets when I wasnt even thinking about smoking , which led me to realise that smoking is linked to almost anything I do , eating , driving , watching a movie , before gooing to sleep , first thing I do in the morning. 

I wanna quit because its a disgusting havit even though I love it, its draining my health and my money. How do you do it ?!

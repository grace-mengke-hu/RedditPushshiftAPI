Day 2/Night 3 - Craving badly

Oh wow so this is what it feels like, okay just listen I'm typing this so I can keep my mind off the cigarettes. But holy shit I can't tell you how badly I want a cigarette right now. I have a fairly addictive personality, and I believe I might even have some form of OCD, just an addictive personality in general. Going without nicotine really drives you to the edge, it's a mild, lingering anxiety that can last to hours on end and you really cant handle it, or control it. I've just now realized the gravity of the situation, this is an intense addiction. I never thought I'd be addicted to something this much in my life, [[Possible Trigger Warning]: oh man I can just imagine it now, me inhaling all that nice smoke while I close my eyes and feel the wind, while I have that one song playing.] 
 Holy fucking shit, like if someone said to me "Hey, type down "I need a cigarette" 100 times, I'll give you one" I would probably do it. Or maybe I wouldn't, I don't know. Sorry again for just rambling, and I go to sleep at 5AM, SO I HAVE TO ENDURE 6 MORE HOURS OF THIS, SHIT. It's such a shitty, and awful feeling, only those who have attempted to quit cigarettes know what it feels like, its a mix of rage, anxiety, and desperation. I just need to keep writing, okay I think I'm a little more calm now. Will keep you posted. I'm trying as hard as I fucking can. This post will probably make a little more sense if you check my previous one. 
Anyone else going through exactly what im feeling right now? Wew lad, oh boy, oh man, feels fucking great, wow, 10/10

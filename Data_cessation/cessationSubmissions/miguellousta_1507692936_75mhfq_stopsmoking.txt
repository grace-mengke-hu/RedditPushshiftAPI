Why do nicotine patched should be used for 8-10 weeks?

I'm currently using nicotine patches and they work amazing because I haven't had any withdrawals which can interfere with my school performance. But why should I use the first stage for 6 weeks and then reducing for another 4 weeks? Can I reduce the strength gradually in a month?  Where I live they are really expensive.

I'm going to quit soon so I'd appreciate some tips! :)

I went to a lung doctor today and he prescribed [Chantix](http://www.chantix.com/). I work with craft beer and have a big event this weekend (involves eating good food and drinking good beer so I'll face it as my farewell to tobacco) so I'll start the treatment on Monday. 

After that I'm supposed to keep smoking for a week while taking the pills and stop smoking cold turkey on the beginning of week two. Success rates are supposed to be high (up to 55% success rate) and my government pays for half of the cost so I figured I could take all the help I could get! 

Anyway, like I said I'm going to start the treatment on Monday and I'll stop on the 21st. Do you guys have any tips for me to increase my chances? I've downloaded an app ([Smoke Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.portablepixels.smokefree&hl=pt_PT)) to make a log and help me keep focused on my goal and progress, I also taped my pack of cigarettes so I remember to wait 10min before smoking when I get a craving (only for the next week of course).


Aside from that can you share your experiences, tips and tricks? I really want to quit and I'm confident on myself this time! It's "for real", **FOR REAL**! But I also am aware of the challenge it will be so any help is really appreciated! I'm trying to do my homework as best as possible so when the date comes I can have a solid chance of success! :) 

Also, don't worry! I am aware that nothing but my willpower will make me stop smoking. This medication is just an extra help and I've been properly informed about the possible side effects by my doctor! :)

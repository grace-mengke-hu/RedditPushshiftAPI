Had my last cigarette yesterday morning.

I have been smoking 10 a day (more if I was drinking) for 5 years now (since I was 16) but yesterday after realizing I was bored of smoking I decided to quit. It's been 30 hours since my last cigarette and I haven't really craved it, I am not one to complain about not feeling awful but is this normal? should it be this easy?

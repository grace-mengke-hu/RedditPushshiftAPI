20k subscribers, almost 4 years, and one great community later...

Hey all we just wanted to take this moment to thank you for being such a wonderful, supportive community and to pat you on the back for committing to something that we all know is incredibly hard for even the strongest amongst us.  
We're extremely proud this community has steadily grown to over 20k subscribers and I am personally in awe at the strength of character you all show every day in quitting smoking.

Here's some fun stuff for you all from our history:

And.... just for a bit of bragging on my part, here are some of my personal stats:

41,632.07 cigarettes not smoked  
$12,489.62 saved (Holy crap, right?!)  
3 years, 9 months, and 2 weeks as a non-smoker (quit date Nov. 6^th, 2009)

Now, how about all of you? How long have you been quit? What has surprised you the most about quitting? What is the best change in your life as a result?

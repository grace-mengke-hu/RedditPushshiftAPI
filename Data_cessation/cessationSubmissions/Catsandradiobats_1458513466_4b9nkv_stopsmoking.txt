I don't smoke anymore, it was actually kind of easy, so here's my story...

Hey guys,

I'm not smoking anymore and it was kinda easy. I'll try to explain how it went down and hopefully something in these words may help someone. I'ts longer than I thought, but I don't want to skip some info, that might be of use.

I'm 29 years old and I quit smoking like a month ago, or more, maybe six weeks, I don't know, don't really care. I have been smoking since I was 11 (yep, I know....) and since I was like 13-14 I was smoking about a pack a day. That's just so you know that I was really a smoker, not someone, who just 'has a one here and there'.
 I would sport and do other stuff, but the pauses for refreshment would be filled with a cigarette. Later I would smoke at work (a lot) and even at home like every 30 mins. Just your average 'pack a day' smoker.

Few weeks ago (after night of drinking) I wasn't really feeling like having a cigarette. That was actually pretty common even for my friends, the day after night of drinking is kinda the day I craved cigarettes the least. So I thought, 'let's just quit'. And I did.

The first day was easy, I was hangover a little and there was no crave to do anything, even food wasn't very interesting. The second day was a nightmare, same for the third day.

But, by the day 4 I didn't really give a shit about cigarettes that much anymore. **There were cravings only if I pictured how 'good it feels and smells' to have a cigarette.** And I very much think, that that's the absolute main thing, that helped me overcome the cravings so easily. To prevent myself from picturing myself having a cigarette.


I would be doing something on my computer for example (at home/ work, doesn't matter) and I would (like every 5 minutes) start picturing myself smoking and trying to smell the smoke, or picturing the way it feels when you get that 'kick' the moment you inhale it. 

Very soon (the second day) I realized, that these daydreams will be my worst enemy. So I did the most obvious and probably effective thing I could: I forbid (forbade?) myself even thinking about it. And it was kind of easy. 







**This is how it worked** (and works, thought I picture myself smoking like once a few days now and these imaginations aren't very vidid anymore even though I live with smokers): 

I would be doing something and I would suddenly start to think about smoking. At that moment, I would have this brief conversation with myself:

*-'This is exactly the thing you don't wanna do anymore, so stop thinking about it, it doesn't make sense. You don't wanna smoke anymore right?'*

*-'Yep'...*

*-'Then stop it'.*

I know it seems simple, but it worked. By the way, I would have these conversations with myself like hundred times a day. The point of this (I think), was to in a very quick manner remind myself, that doing this (picturing myself smoking) is counterproductive, therefore stupid. 
 It was like a quick slap, something like 'wake up, you're doing it wrong' and I would immediately stop thinking about it and I would distract myself with something else.

And yes, this works for like 5 minutes, then you have to have this short conversation again. But doing so ('getting slapped back to reality' by the conversation) and distracting myself into doing something (clean for a while, look something up on the internet, just doing something that takes time) would slowly take you away from the cigarettes.

This I think, is the rare occasion, where speeding up time (like in a movie 'Click') would come in handy, because the longer you don't smoke, the easier it gets.




**And one other thing** that may have been pretty huge for me too actually (ye I'm sure this is important too):

 I decided  to get in shape (don't really know why, hehe). It's going slowly (I'm lazy shit), but I started running (it's easy, just get an ipod and walk/run/walk/run, then just go home), bought a yoga mat for stretching and in a few months I would like to try Freeletics (15 weeks workout, where in the end you emerge pretty ripped).

Because of that, I can kind of recall, that quitting smoking maybe wasn't 'the main thing' for me. It was just obstruction in the way, not the ultimate enemy and because of that, I might have disregarded the severity (or difficulty) of quitting smoking and actually focused on thing to come (getting in shape). I really can't tell wheter I decided to quit smoking or get in shape first (though the synergy between these two goals is obvious).

I recall my first days of non-smoking reading a lot about healthy diet. It's pretty fascinating actually, easy to implement and cheap too. So instead of smoking, I was munching on rice cakes and educating myself about healthy food and other shit. Oh, and I taught myself to drink only water and tea (the main thing is that I don't put sugary things into my water anymore).

It's fun (you feel efficient and doing a good thing), it's good for me and it kept me occupied while I was quitting smoking. 

* **TLDR**: Prevent yourself from thinking about smoking (it gets much better after about three days) and set yourself a goal or a challenge (new hobby, something...), where smoking is an obstruction (but 'just' an obstruction, nothing more), so you think about smoking only like 'ye, I don't care about that, there are things that will be more difficult, so let's just take care of this stupid little thing fast'.
If you don't get the TLDR, read above.



One more thing:

Isn't instead of keeping a track of how long I am cigarette free better, to just stop giving a shit about it altogether? I mean for me it would work like I'm patting myself on a back and thinking 'hey, I've been good for so long, I should be rewarded, maybe with a cigarette?' 
There is a reason for this I'm sure (probably to encourage the individual by looking back, showing that it can be done and also lot of work would go to waste) , but for me, it would definitely be damaging and it would just make me think about cigarettes more (and that was the real struggle for me). 
What I'm saying, is that for me (for me), is keeping track of how long I've been 'clean' something, that just makes me think about it. So if you're easily tempted and swayed like me, maybe just walk away and try to forget, that you we're even smoking.


Well, hopefully something little in there might be of some help to someone, I'm sorry, it's longer that I would like, but I just wanted to describe what was happening in my life (and in my head), that made me quit so easily without assaulting someone, even though I smoked a lot from very early age.

Anyway, good luck and, ye, quit smoking, you'll feel like a douche a little (because you start to think how better than other people you are now that you have achieved something, hehe), but it is worth it.

Good luck guys


EDIT: sorry for the massive wall of text, it won't let me even put more spaces between the paragraphs, I don't know how to work with it.

One week !

I've been smoking for three years, and quit one week ago with my partner, who had five years behind her. We've had troubles finding sleep the first two days, but now, everything is quiet again. What questions me is that we don't feel like smoking anymore, like, hanging out with smokers isn't a problem, drinking a beer doesn't call for a cigarette, and we don't recall myself smoking. It has like disappeared from my memories, as if every cigarette I remember was a moment from the life of someone else that I'd watch on TV.

Is that normal/okay? We try to support each other, but it feels like it's too easy, as if someone was quietly preparing to throw us a brick in the face.

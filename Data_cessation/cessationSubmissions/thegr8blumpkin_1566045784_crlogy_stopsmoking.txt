First post here. 24 hours cold turkey. So many more triggers than I ever thought possible.

So I am a full 24 hours in to this and obviously struggling. Can't remember the last time I went 24 hours without any sort of nicotine. The thing I have come to realize already is just how many triggers in my daily routine cause me to want a cigarette. Everything from waking up, to drinking coffee, after a meal, straight up boredom, when I am drinking, after sex, in between tasks at work, when I'm driving. How can I escape it and when does it end?! I (28M) have been smoking since my sophomore year of high school. In college it increased more frequently. I told myself after college I would quit, but naturally found reasons to push it off along the way. Now the stresses of adulthood is my excuse but I am almost 30 and I want to be free. 

My sister is a nurse in a cardiac unit and is always reminding me how soon I can end up like some of her patients if I don't stop. My girlfriend for the most part doesn't harass me about it, but I know she wants me to stop. May be sooner than later when she becomes fed up with it. And my mother worries constantly, almost pleads for me to quit. She wants me to see a hypnotherapist to help me. I know nothing about it, but people swear by it. May give it a shot, I have nothing to lose right?

Anyway I have always really wanted to quit for all these people in my life who are close to me, but I never fully wanted to for myself which is where I think my problems with quitting begin. Now I feel like I am lying to myself every time I come up with an excuse to put off quitting. I can no longer live in denial about this, and I want to be free. But I know its going to be so hard. Every...single...thing in my day to day life triggers a craving. 24 hours and all I can think about are cigarettes. What do I do?

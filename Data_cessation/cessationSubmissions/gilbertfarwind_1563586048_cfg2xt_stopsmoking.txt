About to quit vaping - what is that book every ex-smoker always recommends? should i read it during my quitting process?

I quit smoking years ago but i picked up the habit of vaping which i think, personally, is healthier.. but that doesn't mean it's less addictive. I would actually argue that in some ways its more addictive because I get anxiety when it's not in my hand and it's always a reach away and I chain vape like a mofo. I just switched to zero mg nicotine and I'm going to put on the patch and for a few days i'll get the satisfaction of puffing on a vape without getting the nicotine and I'm hoping that i'll eventually get bored of it. 

I keep hearing there's like  a book that everyone reads. I tried searching it but i got directed to a bunch of different books.. but I want the one that i'm always hearing about.. i just forget the title.

Day 9 Cold Turkey

After smoking about a pack a day for almost 30 years (I'm 47), and numerous attempts to "cut down and quit," I just went cold turkey 9 days ago.  It was only after stopping did I discover this group, and find out about Alan Carr's Easy Way.  Even though I did not smoke while reading it, I feel that it helped when I had a weak moment.  Currently, my wife is still smoking, but to be honest, I haven't had massive cravings.   I truly want this and believe that this is the beginning for me being smoke free for the rest of my life.

Thank you all for this subreddit.  It's inspirational.

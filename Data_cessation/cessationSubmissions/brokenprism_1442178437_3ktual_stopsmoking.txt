it's been 75 days!

I found myself last night, struggling hard to complete a challenge in a video game (destiny-xbox-one)  and when the going would get tough, i would step out to smoke between rounds. 

no longer... Instead I doubled down, white-knuckled and dug in. Then whooped the game boss (skolas) in one attempt.

Huge accomplishment in life, coupled with huge accomplishment in game. This whole thing is starting to make sense to me.

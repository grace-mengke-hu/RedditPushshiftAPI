Do I have to reset my days free? [relapse question]

As you can see by my flair, I am 605 days free from cigarettes... except for the two I had a couple of weeks ago. Gosh, it almost seems like it didn't happen looking back. The long and short is I have some issues that I'm definitely getting help with and I've gone through stress in the last (almost) 2 years - EDIT: but I've never caved before; this time was different...


I was really giving up. So, I opened up a pack of cigarettes that I bought about a year or so ago (I know, right) and smoked one... I'm not going to lie, the initial feeling was a bit euphoric, but that could have also been because I was so terribly emotional (going through a bad night). Then, **immediately** after I was sick to my stomach and didn't smoke again. The next day I felt horrible and had another bad day so I decided I'd smoke another one. This time the euphoria was replaced with an even sicker feeling.


The long and short - I had two cigarettes after almost 2 years free and that was two weeks ago and have had no cravings since. My question: Do I have to reset my counting meter? It's shameful and I've not told a whole lot of people (except my fiance).


Thoughts? Experience? Thanks, in advance.

First day as nonsmoker

I had my last smoke at 11pm last night.  The plan was to use the patch to help with this journey. That got scratched after it irritated my skin, so now I am doing this cold turkey. Its been a rough morning but I have managed to keep myself busy by doing house work and a little reading.  I hope that my set back doesn't affect my success.

Are the benefits of quitting lessened by using NRT?

Hi! Today is day 2! I guess this question is geared towards individuals who quit using NRT. I have had no cigarettes, but I have been using an e cig. My question is, all of the benefits that are discussed through quitting smoking such as sense of smell, taste, more energy, less coughing and congestion, will that still be there even if I am vaping? Or would that require a cold turkey approach?  Thank you! I am just curious if it will differ for me as I do plan on vaping and lowering nic dosage weekly.

Question about vaping

8 days smoke free by quitting cold turkey. Super proud of myself but I'm still have some cravings and and was considering a vape. I was thinking about tobacco flavored e juice with no nicotine. My hesitation is that I don't want to replace one habit with another. Your thoughts on this? Anyone who vapes 0% nicotine feel like they have urges or craving to vape?

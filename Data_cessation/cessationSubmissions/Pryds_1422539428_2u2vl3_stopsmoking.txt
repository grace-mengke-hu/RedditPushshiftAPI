43 days without smoking. I need to keep strong.

43 days without smoking any cig. I'm feeling way better than I tought I would. Everything tastes a little better. 

I managed to stop by decreasing how many cigars I used to smoke per day. 
Started with a limit: 

8 cigs/day

1 month later: 5/day

1 month later: 3/day

2 month later: 2/day

1 week later: 1/day

1 week later: 0. 

Present: still 0.

The best thing is: I dont smell like shit, my hair dont smell like shit and I don't leave more traces of stinky smell everywhere I go.

Oh, I still smoke pot, and it smell like savana, i love it.

EDIT: I don't mix tobacco with pot.

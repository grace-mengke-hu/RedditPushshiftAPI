48 hours in...this is rough.

I have gum and the doc said i can use it up to 9 times a day, I have only used it three times in 2 days...Cravings are not what i thought they were going to be, They arnt...sudden and sharp, Im constantly wanting to go out and light up all the time but Its like...a back of the mind feeling and its slowly chipping away at me But im trying to stay strong. My GrandDads been a smoker his whole life, he is 67 and cant get off the chair, Oxygen therapy is failing him and has to be on a BI-pap machine for 12 out of 24 hours. Im 21, And have a five year old son, he already understands, comes up to me and cries when i smoke, "Daddy I want you to Have Air forever"...And Im just sick and tired of smoking in general, But today has been hard and im a nervious wreck as for tommorow, I know day three is one of the hardest days. Anyone got any tips, Advice? Im drinking lots of orange juice and peanuts and i have access to the gum.

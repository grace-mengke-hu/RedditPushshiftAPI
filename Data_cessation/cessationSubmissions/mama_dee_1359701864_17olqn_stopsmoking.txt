Resetting my badge - February 1st is my day!

This sub has been an incredible help to me in the past for quitting, and even though I haven't been able to make it stick yet, I'm going to keep trying!  Tomorrow is my quit date, hopefully the very last one ever :)

Thanks in advance for all of the support.  You're all bitchin!

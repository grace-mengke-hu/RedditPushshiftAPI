Just stubbed out the last ciggarette

I named a pack of cigarettes my last, and now it is finished. So here goes. I have been thinking of quitting for a couple of months now, with the enjoyment received from cigarettes diminishing with every subsequent smoke.

I've seen so many supportive posts here and thought it would be a community I'd like to be a part of. Everyone needs support, and when a decent majority of your friends smoke it can be difficult telling them you're struggling.

I've requested a badge, and I hope I don't have to request too many more!

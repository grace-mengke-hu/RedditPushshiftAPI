3 days down, cold turkey the worst is over?

I keep getting mixed messages... I've heard that if you can make it 3 days all of the nicotine is out of your system and the rest is just psychological. I  have also read that the 3 day-1 month period is the worst because your body is now has no nicotine so withdrawal symptoms are stronger. any thoughts?

 I am at day three. Feeling ok, still some strong cravings but I have resisted (even when my SO went out to smoke multiple times last night!)

Also have signed up for a bootcamp class 3 days a week. Have gone twice, but yesterday was a lot of running and I felt so shitty for letting my lungs/body get so out of shape (plus I guess emotionally scrambled from withdrawal) that I was literally holding back tears the entire hour. It was terrible, but can only get better right????

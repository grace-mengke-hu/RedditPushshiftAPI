10 days has felt like much longer

Today is 10 days since I quit and it feels like it's been much longer. Not necessarily in a I'm-fiending-for-a-smoke kind of way. More of a wow-it's-only-been-10-days kind of way. I'm starting to smell smokers now and man do those things stink. Also, I coughed this morning (fighting a bit of a cold) and my mucus came out more mucus-ey looking rather than the black stuff I had been coughing up. All in all, feeling pretty good. I'm not even having the cravings for them as hard anymore.

well, day one begins, i suppose

tw: self harm

hiya. my name is Blake and i figure i'll need the support. i'm smoking my last one now, and i'm REALLY really terrified. i started smoking about 2 years ago to quit self harming, and i've been clean for over a year. it's kind of been my alternative. so now that i'm giving it up, it's kind of scary. i'm really not sure what i'm gonna do. does anyone know anything that would be a good alternative for this?

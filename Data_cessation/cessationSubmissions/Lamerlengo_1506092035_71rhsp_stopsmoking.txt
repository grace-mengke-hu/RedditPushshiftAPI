Some advice on social situations

Some years ago I stopped smoking cold turkey and, 8 months later, I started again for personal reasons I do not want to explain, sorry.


I remember it was pretty simple when I was at home or working, but the real challenge was when I was out with friends for beers or at the club...what are your suggestions for these particular situation?

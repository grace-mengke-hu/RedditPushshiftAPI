Just had my first using dream. Thank god it wasn't real!

Woke up this morning convinced I had smoked and felt so much shame.   The feeling of opening a new pack and lighting up was visceral.  I couldn't believe I had thrown all that time away for almost a full minute before I realized it wasn't real.  I'm so glad I'm a non smoker now and I know I'll never be able to smoke just one.

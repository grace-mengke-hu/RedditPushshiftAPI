Today's the day!

I had my last cigarette about seven hours ago. It was the last one in the pack. I'm 23 years old and have been smoking since about 17. I've never really given quitting my all even though I've wanted to. I just feel it's time to grow up and stop blowing money on it. I smoke about a pack every 5-7 days, so it's not as bad as it could be. I just finished the spring semester in college and have a few weeks before I start my summer job around coworkers who are chain smokers, so I want to have a few weeks of no smoking under my belt before I go back to that environment. 

It's the car, guys. What can I do in the car to break the need to light up? Aside from drinking, which I rarely ever do, driving is my biggest trigger and I need to break that somehow. Any advice would be appreciated.

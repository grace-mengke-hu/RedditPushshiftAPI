I’m a horrible horrible person!

I quit smoking a week today, after maybe ten years and 15+ a day. 

Yesterday was my hardest day, I broke down in the morning as I couldn’t find the dogs lead. I went back to bed and cried and cried, I stayed there until 6.30 this morning. 

My biggest worry is that I’m being horrible to everybody! I feel like I’m not quite myself at work, I’m snapping at my parter over the smallest things and I even managed to push my mum away.

I’m finding it particularly hard as my partner (fed up of seeing me in tears) has now told me he just wants me to be happy, so maybe I should just smoke! He is the one that has pushed me to quit for the past two years.

So I feel really conflicted. My skin is dreadful, I’m tired and really miserable. 

How long will it take until I become me again? Or at least start noticing some benefits? 
 
I’m really sorry for moaning :’(

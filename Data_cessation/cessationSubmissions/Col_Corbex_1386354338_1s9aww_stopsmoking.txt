Its that time

Well guys, this morning at 8am EST marked 36 hours off the sticks for me.  In my personal experience from having quite before(4 times... -_- ), making it through the first couple mornings was always the hardest. No smoke with the morning coffee to get the bowels moving, but I have made it. The morning cravings were nowhere near as bad as I remember them being so thats a good sign. 

My last fall off the wagon started about 20 months ago and I was averaging ~1 pack a day. Since I quit I have only had 2 pinches of Copenhagen dip, which is rather nasty and I dont see anymore pinches coming. So I'm going to proceed on this journey with no aids or crutches, cold turkey the rest of the way out!  Thank you all for creating and maintaining a good supportive community! I'll check back in with regular updates

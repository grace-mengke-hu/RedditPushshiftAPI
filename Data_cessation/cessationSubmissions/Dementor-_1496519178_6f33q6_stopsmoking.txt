Feeling like a girl on her period

It's been 2 days and I'm feeling like I'm on my period, for example I was listening to music, in the same minute I cried and after I was laughing.. The reason is that the song was in Spanish, I cried because I missed Spain, and I laughed because I was happy that I speak Spanish.. Really scumbag brain, wtf?

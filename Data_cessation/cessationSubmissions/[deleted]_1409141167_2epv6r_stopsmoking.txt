How did you guys break the association between drinking and smoking?

Lets face it, sober quitting is a cakewalk, you just have to navigate through a few cravings, distract yourself, wait a few weeks and you're basically free. Drinking tho is a different demon, most of us don't want to stop doing it. Personally the best times I've had with alcohol was before I started smoking, but after a while it becomes weird to not be a smoker, namely because in bars and clubs the smoke area is the perfect place to relax and make new friends/partners. How many of us went a week or two without smoking then became open to smoking 'weekends only' then it slowly got back into our lives?

 Then you have the chemical thing where it lowers neurochemicals and makes you crave rewards more. Sober quitting sucks sometimes, but when you're drunk you can literally sit there and every second will feel like an hour. How did you guys overcome this issue? Is it a lifelong issue?

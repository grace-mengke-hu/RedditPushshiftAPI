Should I quit smoking with vaping?

Hi,

Friend of mine smoked for around 10 years and with ecig he managed to quit it. Im wondering, is it really so that you can easily quit smoking with ecig? 
On Google I found a topic how to quit smoking with vaping http://ecigopedia.com/vaping-to-quit-smoking/ but there is nothing mentioned about what is in ejuice and how unhealthy or healthy it is. Also, it's not clear if eventually I will not start to vape as a chimney and that after some time I will even start to smoke more than before. 

Can you please help? Maybe I should go for patches? Can you share your experience so far?

First day back at work (17 days)

I used to smoke only Monday - Friday between 9AM and 6PM e.g. during work breaks. Since that was odd enough (and also because my wife gave me a lot of crap and because [I had this weird thing happen to me](https://medium.com/@derbenjamin/the-day-i-bummed-a-cigarette-off-anthony-kiedis-8cd503ea9776#.9mdewgll5)), I decided to read ["easyway"](https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483988318&sr=8-1&keywords=easyway) and quick on my last day of work before the xmas break (Dec 23rd 2016).  
Today (Jan 9th) is my first day back at work and even though the routine makes me think about going for a smoke, my mind has been re-wired since reading the book and I actually find it quite enjoyable not to be slave to this habit anymore. Happy Days!

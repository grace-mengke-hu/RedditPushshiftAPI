for my fellow friends who have quit

I'd like to take a brief moment to acknowledge all my fellow gentle friends on /quitsmoking who have infact, as the title implies, quit smoking.
Devastating it was, however now it will always remain as a faint memory in our minds, while our heart and lungs replenish themselves and return us back humbly our youth. Make yourselves a good meal, spend quality time with your family.. go for a walk and enjoy natures beauty.
Because all these beautiful activities are things you've won back. And by quitting smoking, years and years and years extra you've gained to enjoy these things more.
Oh and what a lady she is, this Nature.
Her course of action can kill me quick.
But anticipating her can make her my vangough.

Early-stage mood swings

Hello, dear friends

I'm here to share a little about my quit. I started smoking about 10 years ago, and for the last 8 I've smoked at least a pack a day. This is the third time I try. Last time I was 5 months through, I was on the clear, all the shitty part from the beggining was gone, so I thought it'd be ok to have one... Now 8 months later I'm going through this again

I'm on bupropion (zyban) this time. I was a bit reluctant to take it, but well, it's helping me, so I guess it was for the best

Now, what I really mean to talk about are the mood swings i've been having. They were coming like crazy from day 3 until day 10. Really serious mood swings. I'm no supermacho or anything, but I hardly ever cry or even get sad for more than a few hours, but I've experienced bursts of unmotivated crying, a deep sense of despair and desolation, dwelling on things from the past. No will to do anything. I pushed myself out of the house to take a walk (fresh air, feel better) only to break down in tears and pain as soon as I walked in again.

I've felt bad sometimes in life, but looking from this perspective, nothing seems to have been so bad.

Then I read someone here talking about the hypoglicemic periods and the mood swings, and I realized I was eating nearly nothing. I mean, some days I would go by with a small bowl of whole grains and yogurt, nothing else. This is in no way normal in my case.

Now I was determined to put no weight on the quit, but I think the bupropion was completely killing my appetite (it does that). So now I'm eating very small portions of food every 3-4 hours, and the mood swings are completely gone.

Not that this is a cure, I assume it can come back at any time, but I just thought I'd share. Especially since most of us experienced an increased appetite as a "rule", maybe this info could help someone else

Just started to crave cigarettes, didn't think it would happen, and now I want it to stop.

It started out that i'd only have a cigarette when I was drinking with my friends or smoking weed with them, but I just had my first actual craving of a cigarette.

I want to quit because I don't like hiding it from my girlfriend and last time her and I were hanging out she asked about me being addicted and I assured her that I wasn't.

I wasn't feeling physical withdrawal or anything and it had been a few days but this morning I went out and smoked one simply because I wanted to.

I don't even really know the questions to ask, I want to eliminate them from my life entirely, but I smoked a few recently when the rest of my friends were smoking weed because I couldn't smoke with them since I am in the process of searching for a new job and now I feel like it's becoming a habit. 

My family doesn't know I do it at all, but I feel like if it becomes a habit they'll find out, and my girlfriend thinks I only do it every now and again, and that's how I want to keep it. 

EDIT: Another factor is that I have ADD and when I smoke a cigarette is really helps relieve some of the feelings of non-productiveness that I feel when I am not on my meds. I stopped taking my meds in high school, and never smoked. I felt very sluggish and lazy all the time. When I smoke a cigarette I don't feel that way, and it helps me focus on things. Obviously that's not a healthy solution, but the pills that I had for my ADD made me feel extremely depressed. I don't know what to do :/ 

EDIT2: I just broke all that I had, and flushed them down the toilet after grinding them up as best as I could. Hopefully having to go out of my way to buy more (13 dollars a pack) will stop be from desiring them again.

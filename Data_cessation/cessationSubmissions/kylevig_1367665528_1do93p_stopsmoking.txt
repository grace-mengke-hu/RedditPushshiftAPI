About to meet some friends and I could use your help :)

Hey everyone.  1st off thanks for always posting things and being awesome and keeping me motivated - on day 6 right now.  Anyway, my strategy up until now has been to avoid all situations where I know I will be super tempted to smoke.  It has been effective, but its proving to be kind of impractical/boring.  Anyway, I'm about to meet a big group of friends, half of whom smoke.  We will eat a huge meal and drink a lot in a place where you can smoke inside, then go to a big electro party that will last until dawn.  If you feel like it, please tell me how disapointed you will be in me if I smoke so I can check this thread on my phone when shit gets tempting....  Thanks!

Body aches and Extreme Irritability

Heya, so I am trying to stop smoking, today was the first day and I used gum.

I went six hours from waking until I broke. I was so tense that my entire body feels like it did when I was in an 60mph roll over car wreck(No serious injury, thanks Saab!). Just sore everywhere. Like I fell down a mountain.

And my mood... I'll give one anecdote of several from those six hours. My neighbor, who lives a quarter mile away has a giant beast 70s GMC V8 sierra hes restoring. He needs to pump the gas to keep it running, leading to a low rum rum ruuuum rum reaching to my bedroom.

So uh, I walked over there and started screaming until I had actual foam at the corner of my mouth and then walked away. I bet he wont be watering my plants any time soon.

The gum is 4mg, I started with one piece, then two then three and I went through 8 pieces before I finally had a cigarette.

Uhh, clearly this isnt sustainable. I have a life that needs living and I definitely couldnt behave that way at work.

Any advice? Patches and lozenges make me sick, I smoke a pack of light 100s(down from reds) a day and have done so for 15 years.

Help!

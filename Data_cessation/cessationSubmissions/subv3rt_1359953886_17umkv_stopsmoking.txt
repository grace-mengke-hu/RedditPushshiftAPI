I can tell I'm getting better. I've stopped checking /r/stopsmoking.

I just noticed today that I'm finally getting on with my life and not dwelling on "quitting." I have been checking into this sub probably upwards of a couple dozen times a day for the last month that I've quit--reading stories, looking at my badge as a reminder... This weekend, I nearly forgot about it altogether, except that a post happened to make it to my main feed.

Here's to healing and overcoming. Stay strong and never stop trying.

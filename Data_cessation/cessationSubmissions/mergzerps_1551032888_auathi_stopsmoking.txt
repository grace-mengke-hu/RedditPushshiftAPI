Today is day 1

Itâ€™s been 13 hours since I had my last cigarette. Iâ€™ve smoked consistently since I was 15 years old (13 years now), a pack a day + smoker, and even (super ashamed to admit this) but smoked throughout my pregnancy (albeit nowhere near a pack a day but at least 5 a day). This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever tried quitting truly since I bought my first pack in high school. 

I feel like Iâ€™m in a daze currently. I have to go into work in a little while and if I can make it through a Sunday night shift at the restaurant without smoking, Iâ€™ll be okay I think. Super anxious, not focused, unmotivated ... but determined. 

Day one is for my son ðŸš­

My quit day is today at 6pm CST

I'm nervous. Been smoking daily for 15+ years and I've never made it past day 2. I know what's coming but I'm not afraid, not this time. I picked up and payed for the smoke free app. Their mantra is "not another puff, no matter what." I've been training myself the past few days to think about that when I get a craving. I'm really hopeful this time, still nervous but eh. I know I can get through this. I'll let this app and this thread coach me through it then I'll finally have something real to be proud of. My life starts in 6 hours. I won't break because there is no room for it in my life anymore. Not one more drag, no matter how bad it gets. Thanks for reading.

Cravings! Why now???

In my quitting career cravings were always present in the beginning of the ordeal. First week was always the worst.   I had to fight toot and nail for every smoke free day. Second week was much easier and with every passing day I felt less and less tempted. My overconfidence that I was free and could handle occasional smoke was the reason for my first relapse... and the second, third and... you get the picture.   
But I digress.   
I decided to quit smoking as a birthday gift to myself. So when I finished smoking my last cigarette I was prepared and ready to face the "first week" nightmare.  Only nothing happened! No cravings!   Not the first day nor second. For the first 11 days there was no pull no desire, cravings. All the typical withdrawal symptoms absent. Like I've never smoked.   Till today!  Don't understand that delayed reaction.   BRAIN! WE.ARE.NOT.AMUSED! so cut it out!

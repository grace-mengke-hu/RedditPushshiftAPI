8 months and change - grateful!

I had tried to quit, off and on, through 35 years of smoking at least 2 packs /day. I had tried hypnosis, acupuncture, meditation, patch, gum, cold turkey, apps, Nicotine Anonymous, reddit, and exercise. I'm grateful for the support I found along the way in this forum (different usernames through the years). And grateful that this time has stuck. Finally, it was like a light switch in my head (soul?) turned to "non-smoker." 

What worked for me: The SmokeFree app helped a lot (and it encourages participation in reddit). I also used the patch for about 3 months -- a little longer at each level than what they say to do. And I do at least 30 min of cardio (and weights), at least 5x / week, plus yoga twice a week, plus at breathing exercises. I also used Alan Carr's book (though he shuns patch use), because it helped me cast the change as GAINING something, rather than QUITTING it. 

My first trip to pulmonologist was after I stopped smoking, and it was not great news: Severe emphysema. Which was surprising, because I exercised a fair amount, It's not possible to reverse emphysema. But I can make more efficient use of what's left of my lungs and surrounding muscles: My breathing has improved through physical therapy and that cardio exercise (and breathing exercises). Two months ago, I also agreed to a once-daily inhaler because it makes bicycling, hiking, rollerblading a lot more pleasant.  

I had just about given up, after so many failed attempts. I feel sooooo much better because I did not give up. And, like I said, grateful that I finally am a non-smoker!

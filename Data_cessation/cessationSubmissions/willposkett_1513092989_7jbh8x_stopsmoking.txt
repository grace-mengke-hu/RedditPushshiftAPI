Lost/ need help - Hope for an Allen Carr failure?

I don't know where to start really.

Started smoking when i was 19 and am 34 today. Thats 15 years of doing this stupid thing.

 Ive tried willpower. 

I tried the Allen Carr method three times (1 x book, 2 x course). However it feels like diminishing returns. The method worked initially and i gave up for 10 months, but i feel off the wagon after a stupid drunken night out. I then got to three months and then one month and now back to square one. I am now in a stupid cycle of giving up Sat &amp; Sun but smoking Mon-Fri. I know i can do it but i get lazy or lapse for some reasons. 

I really don't want to do this any more. My breath smells, my skin is pasty and i feel like shit. But i feel like a failure for messing up the Allen Carr method.

Any advice for someone who failed with Allen Carr, but eventually turned it around? Anyone do it?

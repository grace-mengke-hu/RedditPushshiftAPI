Almost done a week cold turkey! Am I over the worst?

I can not believe I've did this cold turkey. In the past I've always used nicotine replacement. Not this time. I've not had any desire to smoke a cigarette. I hope it remains that way.

For me, the good parts so far:

* Exercise recovery rate has improved significantly
* Lower heart rate and blood pressure. According to the NHS my heart rate is now "excellent" with an average heartrate of 61bpm
* Things taste and smell so much better

And the bad bits:

* Anger, frustration and agitation (that's no longer a problem, but it was)
* Trouble sleeping. Nightmares. Night terrors (waking up unable to move or breath in complete terror. Happens every time I quit)
* Fatigue that wipes me out at random points in the day
* Always hungry, mostly for sugar
* Low moods, lack of motivation at times

Am I over the worst now?

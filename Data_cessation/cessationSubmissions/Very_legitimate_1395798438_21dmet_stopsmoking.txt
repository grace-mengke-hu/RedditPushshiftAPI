Been trying to quit and now I'm using ecigs...

And I've read a lot of negative posts about them here. I know a lot of you here who don't like them have probably already had more than a few discussions about them, but I still want to ask, why all the hate? Why do people see them as inferior to just quitting cold turkey or using products such as gum/patches?

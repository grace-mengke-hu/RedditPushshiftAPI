Two days since my last cigarette and my throat hurts. Is this normal or should I be concerned?

I've been casually smoking for about a year, but trying to quit. I didn't smoke at all this summer, but being back at college, I smoked a couple of times socially. The last time, I smoked one and my throat hurt the entire time. I knew then that I want to quit for good. It's been two days and my throat is still killing me. Should I be worried by this and go to the doctor? This has never happened to me before and it's making me very paranoid :(

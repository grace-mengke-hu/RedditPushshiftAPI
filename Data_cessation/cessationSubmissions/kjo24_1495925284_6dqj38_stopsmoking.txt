Insomnia and Quitting Smoking

Help!! I'm just looking for some advice from fellow "quitters". I quit smoking for about a year about 3 years ago, but picked it back up after a long distance move and then losing the job I moved for. No self control. I've never been a "heavy" smoker, about 5-10 cigarettes a day, some days less, some more (usually aided by drinking), but any cigarettes are bad, right? 

Anyway, I want to quit again, for real this time. But I'm hesitant, because my last attempt at quitting, I suffered with some pretty terrible insomnia for the first 2 months after quitting. Has anyone else suffered with this? How did you deal? The thought of losing sleep makes me anxious as hell. 


Give me some advice fellow quitters!

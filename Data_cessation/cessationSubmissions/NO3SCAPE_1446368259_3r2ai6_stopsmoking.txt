Have officially gone over a year since I quit!

Its been 1 year and 5 days since I've quit and I've never felt better!

I remember the days and nights where I used to have bad coughing fits, blocked noses and the addictive feeling of wanting to smoke and it's turned me off for life. 😁

Trust me guys if you just started do not give up and keep trucking! It's 100% worth it! 👍👍👍

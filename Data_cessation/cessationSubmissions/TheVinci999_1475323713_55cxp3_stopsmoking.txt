PSA: Don't have a cigar.

I figured cigars were fine because we don't really inhale them.

Last week I took a few drags off of a friends cigar, I felt this warmth spread all over my body, my body relaxed and could feel the nicotine hit the spot. That's the good part. 

All was fine that day, next day the cravings started, wasn't that bad but there was a nagging sensation at the back of my mind for a smoke, not a cigar but for a cigarette. It was partly mental and partly physical, got some headaches. 

It was like I was in the ending stage of week 1. It just took me by surprise to have these unexpected cravings. 

Was soooo close in picking up a pack of smokes, stopped at the store and before picking up a pack, sent my wife a message telling her I couldn't do it anymore. She sent me back a reply reminding me on why I quit. That made me power through. 

It's been a week and the cravings are more of less dormant. 

Good luck and just avoid the cigar too.

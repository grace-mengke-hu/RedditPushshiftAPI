Day 3 of no smoking, with a vape it is no problem at all.

When I still smoked, my addicted mind told me I didn't want to vape, it wasn't the same.

3 nights ago in my drunken stooper not wanting to buy cigarettes I was smoking my half butts, as I stumbled past the vape shop I thought fuck it man this is gross as fuck and bought a cheap vape for 35$ (Including juice), in the three days I've saved 26$ on cigarettes so I am only out 9$, as of tomorrow I will have saved 4$!

It's amazing, I don't smell gross, I don't need to go outside every half hour, my room smells better and I FEEL better.

Good luck to all of you too, I am proud of what you're all doing!

Coming up on 48 hours.

27 years old and have been smoking around a pack a day for ten years. Been really thinking a lot about my health lately. Decided to quit smoking and hopefully add a few years onto my life that smokes would likely have taken away.

I'm a very impulsive smoker so I'm downing nicorette mints like crazy. I'm trying to break the love for the physical act of smoking. Once I don't miss *smoking* I'm going to try to wean myself off of nicotine altogether.

Wish me luck! It's good to read other peoples success stories on here.

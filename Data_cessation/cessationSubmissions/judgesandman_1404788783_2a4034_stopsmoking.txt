5 Days in and Struggling

Went on a family vacation for 5 days and have been chewing nicotine gum like a mad man since. Most of them left today and I slipped, bought a pack, took two puffs, found it nasty, and threw the pack and cig away.

Now, I'm in a bar, waiting for a delayed flight to Seattle where I'll be for 1 week. There will be partying and while I'm going to try and be light about it, I'm nervous that I'm going to slip. I have supportive friends who hate smoking, but I'm really feeling the "breaking the habit" part right now which seems to be much worse than the nicotine cravings. I've been on and off for a while now and I want this to be it, but I feel so fragile. On the plus side, I've been significantly more productive without the sticks :D

Any tips for coping in these situations?

I’m tempted to have just one

I’m so tired of being alone. I need to make some friends. I just don’t know where to begin. The friends I do have never seem to have time for me. I feel as though I do what they want just to have company. Or I pay for everything when we ho out . I deserve better. This past weekend was horrible. I got off of work at noon on Friday &amp; its now Sunday afternoon &amp; I’m still in the same pj’s I put on at 1PM Friday. I texted, called &amp; fb messaged everyone I knew &amp; no one had time for me. 
Loneliness sucks.

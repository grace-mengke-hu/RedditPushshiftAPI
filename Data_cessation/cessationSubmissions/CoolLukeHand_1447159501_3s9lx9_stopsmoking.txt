The cravings are sneeky...

The cravings are sneeky... I can go for hours and then whamo I'm sitting down watching TV or walking into the office early in the morning and all of a sudden I think "hmmm a smoke would be very nice now.." and have to consiously stop myself and say NO, it will hurt my throat and make me cough and will not fix anything or make me feel any better.. this craving is going to be over in a couple of minutes as long as I don't smoke... then I make myself get excited because I am no longer a smoker and will reap countless benefits from this forevermore!!!! and that makes me happy and feel a whole lot better than any stupid smoke is going to...

Question: About to quit smoking...

How did you folks decide which day was going to be The day you stopped ? 

I've been thinking and talking about quitting for a while now, but can't seem to actually get there. Did you just finish your last pack? Did you pick a day and get rid of whatever you had left?

Thanks for any tips you may have for me!

Caved in. Smoked 3. Felt horrible but I'm not resetting my badge.

There I was. Outback of the house I grew up in, where I was when I started smoking almost 20 years ago. I had a pack of Parliament (a brand I haven't smoked in quite some time) with me and I smoked three of them. God, did it taste horrible. I felt so guilty and disgusted with myself. It made me and my clothes smell awful just like it had for so many years.  You know the smell. Made even worse because I was smoking in the rain. I couldn't belive I was smoking again. I was hiding it from someone but I don't know who it was because before they found me in my misery and embarrassment I woke up!  It was all a dream!  It never happened!  I don't have to reset my badge because I'm a non-smoker!

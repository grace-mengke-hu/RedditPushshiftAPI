Has anyone had relapses in dreams?

I know it sounds crazy, but I've been having some strong cravings lately after going three-odd years without a smoke.

I just realised that I've had recurring dreams where I've had a few smokes, but justified it by thinking (in dream) that "She's apples.  I will just smoke sometimes".

It's obviously not the only reason I've been having cravings, but I've got to think it's part of it.

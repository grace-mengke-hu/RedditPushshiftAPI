Day 4 , ct.

days 1 - 3 weren't bad. Day 4 started early and kicked my ass, and still I feel the tug in my head. that familiar sting in the sides of the brain. wanting a cigarette.. just one. . but why. . . it was going well until now. I haven't given in and I don't plan to go out tonight. Still: I thought it kept getting easier.

Day 4 has been the hardest in my opinion. .

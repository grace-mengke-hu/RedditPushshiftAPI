[Discussion]Nausea when using Champix

I have used champix in the past which I did stop smoking but did not stick with it long term.  I am using it again for the third time in hopes that I will defeat this terrible habit this time around.  Thing is that I am getting really bad nausea, much much worse than I remember and its getting hard to keep using it as I am basically useless at home cuz I feel so terrible.  I'm so close to the quit date I set but dont know if I should keep using it as it seems to be affecting my work and home life as I'm really gloomy cuz I feel horrible.  Any suggestions would be great.

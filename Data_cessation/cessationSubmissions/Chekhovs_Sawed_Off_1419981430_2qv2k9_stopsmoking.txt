All right, square one.

All right everyone,

I'm starting at square one again. I made it 48 hours and then found myself buying a pack when I was filling my tank. Clearly, that wasn't the most brilliant choice I've ever made, but hey, we've all done worse. For example starting with these Anti-Christ hell sticks to begin with. 

At this particular moment, I'm warding off the self loathing and trying to muster up the courage to pitch the rest of my eight dollars in the trash. It blows. Still, I have to let go of this illusion that these things are actually helping me cope, be creative, or enjoy a moment. All they are is an addiction. And the only thing they help to give me is a sore throat and an aching chest. 

Smoking one of these damn things doesn't cure my craving, but rather, it creates another one later. And most of those cravings have to be satisfied aside from those who I love and care about. They don't want to see it, and I can't blame them. It's idiotic to spend my time sweating between cigarettes and smoke them aside, like I'm mainlining junk. 

There is nothing of value in the romantic or artistic fantasy many of us have seen in smoking. Quitting is not going to stop me from being who I am. Continuing is going to stop me from having the chance to. 

Fuck it, I'm done.

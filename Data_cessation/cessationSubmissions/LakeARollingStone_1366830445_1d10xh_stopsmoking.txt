Starting on ecig?

So I quit 6 days ago (cold turkey), so I haven't had any nicotine in that time. 
But tonight I'm meant to be going out for a friend's birthday and the prospect of drinking without a cigarette seems horrible. Would it be a terrible idea to use an ecig tonight? Will that make this quitting attempt even more difficult? Or is it actually a decent idea?

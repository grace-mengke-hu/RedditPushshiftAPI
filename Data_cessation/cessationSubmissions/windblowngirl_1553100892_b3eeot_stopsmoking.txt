Quitting cigarettes ruining my relationship

I quit just a few days ago and I'm doing ok in that aspect but the dreams. I'm having vivid dreams every night of my boyfriend killing me in different ways. It's made it awfully hard to wake up to him in the morning. Somedays I'm so depressed I can't get out of bed. I don't know what to do anymore.

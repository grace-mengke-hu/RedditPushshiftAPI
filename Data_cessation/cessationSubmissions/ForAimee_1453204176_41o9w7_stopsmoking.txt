Chest pain?

I'm a new years quitter and up until today, I really haven't had any physical symptoms.  Light brain fog and fatigue mostly, nothing that really has held me back.  This morning however, I woke up with awful chest pain.  It's mostly on the left side, feels like my heart and lungs, as well as my shoulder/back.  The deeper I inhale, the more it hurts.  I'm attributing it to quitting, but damn, this far in, I thought physical symptoms would be gone, not getting worse...

TL;DR:  No chest pain early on, chest/lung pain almost 3 weeks in...WtF D:

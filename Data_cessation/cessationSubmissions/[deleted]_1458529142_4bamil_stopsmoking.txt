2 Stick left in this pack. No more after. It begins~

My company offers medivac as one of its core services and that leads to what happened today. We were low on staff through the weekends and I decided to fill in the empty slot today. As we were transporting a patient from his home over to his facility of choice, he brought up about how he regretted smoking. I then went on being a hypocrite about how smoking is bad and all that it can cause whilst administering relief. He called me out on how my breath and hair smells like cigarette smoke (not my hands because sanitized). I then said I was trying to quit and all went quiet for a good long while. We stayed back awaiting confirmation for movement and he was to be warded instead. Before we left he said, you'd love to be in my shoes but don't worry you'll get here some day. Decided to quit because #f***that.

This is gonna be "fun" 13 years 10 of which was heavy smoking. 16-19-29. Figured it'd be easier if I talk about it and have somewhere to rant until Day 3 and onwards to Month 2. Attempting to go without patches or e-cigarettes. 

Thanks for having me and I apologize beforehand if I start being obnoxious or downright stupid. Cheers!

**Edit:** : [My Last Smoke](http://imgur.com/gallery/qt73I) Thought that symbolizing it with something would help boost the effort for the coming weeks and months. This was where my dad used to have his smoke breaks way before I was born. The conditions and weather was perfect. No second thoughts :D

Fell off after 10 days in..ashamed of myself and feel like a hypocrite

10 days into quitting..I had "ONE" and then all down hill from there. Smoke two packs over the last week and lied to myself that each one of those would be my last one. Feel like a big hypocrite for posting others to not pander to just the one smoke and look what I did. Did not have the nerve to post back here and felt ashamed. Well lesson alert and hopefully I can stay stronger this time.

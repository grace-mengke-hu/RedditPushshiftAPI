I bought a pack today for the first time in 4 months.

I was doing so well. But over the last 4 months, I’ve gained 42 pounds as a result of quitting. Before I quit, everyone was telling me I needed to quit for the sake of my health. So I did. Now everyone is telling me I need to lose weight. Since I gave up, I’ve been on the bicycle for 30 minutes every day. Exercising properly for the first time in years. I haven’t changed my eating habits. 

I’m still gaining. Today I hit 294 pounds and I’m not happy about it. I was unhappy at 250. It seems like no matter what I do, there’s a constant battle for my health. 

I don’t know gang. Half of me just wants to say ‘fuck it’ and take up smoking again in the hopes that I’ll lose this weight. The other half of me knows that that’s an irrational reaction.

A while ago, a friend of mine sent me a photo from the day of his wedding where I had the privilege of doing a reading during the ceremony. I saw the photo and cried because I’m so unhappy with how I look.

I really need some pep talking gang. I’m not feeling confident in myself at all at the moment.

Relapsed..... after 2 months

Starting now, Stopping again, bought 2 packs over two days.... my god how I hate smoking, I can't believe I fell for this again. 

I feel like complete shit, not just mentally, but it's like my body is screaming for me to stop again. This is it, Never again!

I can't wait for the 3 days to be over, and my body to feel good again.

Badge resets are the worst

After eight months, I smoked two cigarettes and I feel gross and disappointed in myself. I wasn't even "craving" a cigarette per se. I was at a concert in a different city with a group of friends I hadn't seen in a long time, all of whom smoke. They didn't know I had quit and when it came time for a drunken smoke break, I just didn't even try to say no. Complete drunken letting down of my guard.

I had been looking forward to celebrating my one year quitiversary in the fall, now I'm back to being a whole year away. I definitely had a moment afterward of thinking to myself: maybe I'll just pretend that never happened, get right back on the band wagon, and not reset my badge. In the end though, I decided that would just take all of the power out of the "don't break the streak" effect the badge system has. It was dumb, there's no legitimate excuse, I didn't even enjoy them, and I hope that this will be the last time I need to remind myself of this after the fact.

So, here I am on my new Day 1. I'm reaffirming my goal (so simple in theory: do not smoke, no matter the circumstances) and thinking up some new strategies to not make the same mistake again. I'm thinking the next time I'm know I'm putting myself in the position of travelling, drinking, and being with a group of smokers, I'll do things differently ahead of time. I could tell the group of people that I quit smoking, I could pace my drinking, I could take a moment before going out to remember that my most important goal is not smoking and that nothing my addiction triggered mind can manipulate me into thinking can change the fact that I do not want to smoke. I could use the moment when I catch myself thinking about accepting a cigarette from someone as an alarm sign that its time to go home. And, of course, I'll remember how it feels to have to reset my badge.

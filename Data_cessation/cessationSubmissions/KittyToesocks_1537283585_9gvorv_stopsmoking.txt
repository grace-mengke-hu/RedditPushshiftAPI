I made it through (what I think) is the hardest part.

This isn't my first rodeo. I quit smoking once before, and stayed that way for 2.5 years, so I know where my pitfalls are. 

So I knew that the first three days at the hardest for me. I have a bad oral fixation and I'm fidgety with my hands, so I've been constantly reaching for a cigarette where I normally keep them, and constantly being reminded that oh yeah, I'm quitting. And when I say constantly, I mean every couple of minutes. For the past two days, I haven't not had a craving. I've given up tracking my cravings on the app because the entire day was just a constant crave. 

Last night was a fucking nightmare. Panic attacks. Hyperventilating on all fours in my hallway. My eyes are puffy from crying today. I'm having to lie at work and tell people I'm having allergies. I'm glad I have a sweet boyfriend who understands and listened to me weep. He even gave me a pass. Said I didn't have to quit. That I should go get some cigarettes to stop this madness. 

I said no. I said I was quitting because smoking is stupid, and I sure as hell wasn't stopping this madness now just to go through it again next week when I try to quit again.

So I knocked myself out with my heart medicine. I'm aware I shouldn't do that, but I take a *very* low dose. Half of the smallest dose they make. I figured taking a full pill wouldn't kill me. It didn't, and I got some sleep. 

Today... I'm good. I hardly craved my first smoke of the day. Its halfway through my day and I haven't even had a craving worth logging in the app. I'm not even chewing any gum (although I should because I am clenching my teeth). And today is my first reward day! I told myself if I made it 3 days, then I'd spend that $15 on a new vibrator. 

Now to convince myself to actually walk into a sex shop and shop for vibrators like I'm choosing light bulbs at the grocery store. Today will apparently contain two victories.

I forgot...

I had to login to this sub to realize I am working on 3 years without a cig.  I have, in all seriousness, forgotten how long ago it was that I quit.  Not that, that makes me awesome or better, just that I have done everything I can do to keep myself occupied with anything other than cigarettes. 

Good luck to those who wish to start the new year tobacco free.  Keep your mind focused and you too will be able to overcome.

Even if you can cut down to one a day, smoking still isn't worth it

I've smoke on and off for 15 years. At my worst I was smoking 2 packs a day (in my early 20s). I've quit dozens (probably hundreds) of times over the years, with periods of abstinence as long as two years.

In the last few years I've "successfully" had periods of smoking one a day (or less than one a day, as in smoking once a week, or once a month, or once every few months). 

And it's not as if the other 23 hours I'm dying for a smoke. I just get the occasional urge, and go out and buy a single cigarette from a vendor. So it's not even a financial burden or overly guilt-inducing, as buying an entire pack of cigarettes can make you feel

Some heavy smokers may think that sounds awesome. I assure you, it's not. 

I still feel like a social outcast when I do it. It still makes my clothes and breath smell like smoke. I'm still putting myself back in the chemical and psychological addiction cycle, and I know I'm playing with fire with nicotine addiction. I still feel like I "have the monkey on my back" and have to go back to square one. 

I always wind up feeling unsatisfied. I never reach the smoker's nirvana of "controlling my addiction" and getting what I want from nicotine without the negative aspects of the habit. This happens 100% of the time, yet somehow, many, many times, I have given in to the urge and fooled myself.

So, I'm back at square one. No cigarette is worth smoking.

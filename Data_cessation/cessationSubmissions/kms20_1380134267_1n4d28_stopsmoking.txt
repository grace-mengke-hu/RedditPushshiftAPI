This Really Sucks

So I've been smoke-free for about 5 days now.. What a horrible experience. I wish this would just cycle through my system and be over with already so I can move on with my life.

Every day, even at work while I'm busy, cigs are always on my mind. Constantly. Plus, ive been feeling just generally drowsy and lethargic. I just don't feel like myself, and it really really sucks. 

I've tried ecigs, but they really did not help me whatsoever. Nothing I try seems to work. I've never wanted to light up a marlboro so bad in my life. I just want this all to stop. 

But, I'm gonna power through it anyways. I just figured I'd stop and share my misery with anybody who thinks they are alone in all of this. I'm really glad this sub exists, and I hope you all are having a better experience than I am!

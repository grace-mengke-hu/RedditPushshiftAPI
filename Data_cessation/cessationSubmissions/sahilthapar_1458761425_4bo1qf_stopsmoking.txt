Tomorrow is the day

Hi guys, Tomorrow is the big day. I'm a regular smoker and I go through a pack a day (20 cigs). I'm planning to quit from tomorrow morning. I've been following this subreddit for about a week now and I feel it is helping me prepare already. I feel a little under pressure now that the date I set for quitting is here. I did reduce my consumption over the last month but over the last three days, with the quit date approaching I am back to a pack a day.
Also my biggest worry is I live with a couple of guys who are heavy smokers as well and It is not possible for me to move out right now. Any tips for handling the smell and cravings when I'm around them.
Thanks for the help

ECig Suggestions?

Husband & I are ready to quit smoking--I know many hesitate recommending the use of ecigs as they are not a healthy alternative or not always a beneficial step in quitting-however we were able to quite with the use of ecigs for over a year awhile ago & wish to try it again.
Where we went wrong was the brand/make/model of the ecig-they broke, leaked & did not work.
Suggestions on durable and somewhat pleasant ecigs available online? Thanks!

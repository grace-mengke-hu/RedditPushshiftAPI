Help distract me during my breaks from work tonight!

Really, something to read, something to respond to, literally anything that can turn my mind away from my cravings tonight.  I've tried quitting three times so far this year, and each time, my breaks from work were where I eventually broke down and bummed one.   So please help either distract me from cravings, or keep me focused on the quit tonight!

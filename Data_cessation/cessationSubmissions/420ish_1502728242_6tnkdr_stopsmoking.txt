Laser therapy/hypnotherapy 5-day follow up.

Last Wed I went to a "Laser solutions" stop smoking therapy, cessation treatment and I'm currently 5 days nicotine free.  

It wasn't hypnotherapy like I first thought but it was very relaxing.  I sat in an oversized, really comfortable chair with dark sunglasses on.   The lady had me hold a metal tube attached to wires and took another metal tube and moved it around my ears, face and hands and wrists.  

I sent a text out to my bro Wed night that said, "I just paid 250$ for electro stimulation to quit smoking. I don't know if it's working because it works or i want it to work so I won't feel like I got robbed" 

The first night (wed) was actually pretty easy for nicotine withdrawal.  Thursday was mild nicotine witgdrawl, And on Friday morning I left for a canoe trip with some friends. 
The weekend was filled with booze and a few people smoked cigs, but not many.  Kept a bowl on me and whenever I felt like having a smoke, I just smoked more weed.  I smoked a lot of weed over the weekend but never had a smoke and I made it aware to all my friends I wasn't smoking, so don't give me one! 

So I guess, whatever works for you do it.  It's working for me.

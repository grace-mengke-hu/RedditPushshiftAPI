kinda embarassing... bad gas?

so... throughout my life, I've only had smelly farts when I had to poo.  Outside of times when I have to poo, my farts were very mild.  I never had a problem farting around people or my gf's in a closed room and car.  I just held them when I was nearing my poo time...

Ever since quitting.  I have been constipated.  I have difficulty pooing every day.  I used to poo twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.  They were always wonderful poos that were quick and gratifyingly emptying.  Now my poos don't feel complete, and each turd feels like a mission squeezing out.

Has anyone else dealt with this?  All of my farts stink to high hell.  It's at the point that I keep my window open all day now and I flap my bedsheets to avoid dutch ovening myself.  

I feel ridiculous saying this lol.

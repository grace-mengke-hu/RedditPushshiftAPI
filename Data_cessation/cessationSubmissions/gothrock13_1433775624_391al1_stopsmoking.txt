I'm 23, been smoking for 6 years now. I am 25 Kg's overweight. I want OUT.

I used to have asthma. Got myself into this habit. Now I want out. Today I woke up with a very high shortness in my breathing. I crawled my body to a doctor. And then signed myself to a gym. Gym starts 6:30 Am tomorrow. I just flushed all my cigarettes. But I know I won't quit that easy. Hopefully My trainer's gonna whoop my ass into it. Wish me luck.

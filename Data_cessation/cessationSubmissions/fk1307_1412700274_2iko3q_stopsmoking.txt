Day 4, I think I'm gonna scream

These cravings are unreal and everyone is so annoying and not understanding. My friends dont seem to support me. I have terrible moodswings and whenever I have them, my asshole friends say "oh just start smoking again. You are way more fun when you smoke." Its so hard right now.  Wtf is my body doing?

I want to punch someone in the face. Why did I ever start smoking?

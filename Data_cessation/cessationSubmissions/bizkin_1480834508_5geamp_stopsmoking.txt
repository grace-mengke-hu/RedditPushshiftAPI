#1 Tip I can give for you guys

Do not count the days!
Every time you mark an X on the calendar that you smoke free, just making it worst. You feel like you can control it and relapse from time to time, and if not you just craving.

Set a quit day. 4th Dec 2016, write down in your diary/calendar/notebook on phone and just move on with your life. You'll be amazed how time travels and before you know it if you really deep inside want stop to smoke, you never had to lit that cig again. But if you continue to run in circles around hoa much days your free, your mind isn't free.

If yoy just move on, you'll get the craving, but they will be meaningless because you decided to become non-smoker, and the the beautiful thing about non-smoker that they don't give a shit about cigarettes, so do you!
 
 Tl;dr
1)set quit day
2) don't count days
3)never look back

I kind of did it without realizing?

My SO at the time pushed me to quit (thanks for that btw) so I tried, and I failed in a big way. I just *needed* that smoke. I bought an electronic cigarette, and that helped me not die when I had a craving, and little by little I slowly phased out the nicotine in the juice. Then I sort of stopped bothering to buy the juice, and other stuff going on in my life made me fail to realize.... I quit with no pain, no discomfort, and probably less than $150 invested. 

I'm not sure if you're supposed to give concrete advice here, but seriously consider e-cigs as a way to quit.

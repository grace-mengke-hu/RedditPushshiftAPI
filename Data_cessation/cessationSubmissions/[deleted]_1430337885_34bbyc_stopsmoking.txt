4-day bike tour tomorrow. Can't imagine smoking on it. What's your positive vision?

(Adult) kids invited me on the bike tour. It was in fact the spur that got me to quit smoking 10 days ago. I think they knew that. Been struggling a bit with the quit the last couple days, but it is the bike tour that keeps me straight. Can't imagine smoking on it. 

I fancy getting older in a healthy way, doing more outdoor stuff like this. It is a vision of health that keeps me going. And of course the reason for my reddit name (this time). 

Have you crafted a positive happy vision that keeps you going?

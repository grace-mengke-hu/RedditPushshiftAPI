Giving myself a pat on the back.

I'm still fairly new to the whole quitting thing, and it has been difficult(Day 2 currently). I feel like I really accomplished something last night though. My biggest weakness when it comes to smoking is when I'm drunk. I feel compelled to smoke every five minutes whenever I'm in that kind of state. Last night, however, I ended up getting pretty drunk last night, and didn't smoke a single cigarette!  I was surrounded by smokers for most of the night, and I did feel the occasional craving, but I didn't do it, and that's what mattered. I feel like I want it now, and this has me overjoyed. Can't wait to have my sense of smell and taste back!

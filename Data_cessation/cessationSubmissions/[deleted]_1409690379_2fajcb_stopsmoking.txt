Finally done with it and it feels great!

I'm a 25 year old male and I've been a smoker since 18 years old. My father smokes. My mother smokes. My half brother and half sister both smoke. I've grown up with it, and haven't known my family members as non-smokers ever in my life. Naturally, I picked up the habit as well after loathing it growing up.  

I thought it was cool when I started. I liked the little buzz it gave me and everyone around me was doing it. It went from smoking a pack a week to a pack every two days and eventually to a pack every single day.  

About 3 1/2 years ago I attempted to quit. I failed at it because I truly realized I wasn't ready to do it. I was quitting because *someone else* wanted me to quit. I fell right back into smoking after a few days of being smoke free.  

Over the past 3 1/2 years since that failed attempt, I've noticed myself just slowly cutting back -- becoming more and more physically and mentally disgusted by smoking. I went from a pack a day, to a pack every two days, to a pack a week. About a month ago I was down to a couple cigarettes per day.  

My co-worker (a smoker) was telling me horror stories about his wife's mouth (she's a 30 cig/day smoker) and how they are going to have to do a full-mouth tooth extraction and replacement (costing upwards of $30,000 with good insurance... not to mention the immense pain that it would come with). 

My parents both have pretty bad oral health (again, they've been smokers forever) and this is when I realized that I was truly ready to do it for **ME**. I didn't want to end up like my co-worker's wife. I don't want to worry about potentially replacing each and every tooth in my mouth because of doing something throughout my life that is 100% preventable and a conscious choice. I wanted to be able to breathe again. I wanted my sense of smell and taste back. And, maybe most of all, I became tired and annoyed of being the person who smells like an ashtray.  

I just wanted to make this post for people in a position similar to mine where you aren't a slave to nicotine, but you just need that little extra push to finally quit it for good.  

It really is just a disgusting habit that doesn't add anything beneficial to your life. When someone who is smoking, or just finished smoking, walks by me I cringe now. Not at them as a person, I cringe because that it the smell that I carried around with me every single day, and I can't believe I became so oblivious to it -- it became the norm.  

So, after being smoke-free now for a full week, I feel better than I have the past ~7 years. If you are ready to quit, do it. **IMO** Don't use nicotine substitutes because that only leaves the door open for cigarettes to rejoin your life and doesn't truly conquer your addiction.  

Congrats to those who have already embarked on this journey, and good luck to those who are just beginning! I am so excited for a year from now, I can't wait to be 12 months removed from this awful habit that consumed 7 years of my life.  

I know my situation is different than that of heavily addicted smokers who have been at it for more than a decade, I just want you guys to know that there's always hope, and that pure will-power is a hell of a tool when used to its fullest potential. Your body and mind are capable of amazing feats when they are in sync and laser-focused. Cheers.

Fuck me this shit ia hard

I wanna try quit  (for the 3rd time this year), mostly for a girl. But it's fucking hard, every time I try and quit I put on heaps of weight that doesn't come off and I still can't afford to move outta my parents house, which is a big contributing factor to me smoking because my sister has severe mental health issues and will often attack me, I don't know any other ways to deal with the stress besides going for a smoke on the street to leave the stressful situation and don't know how to not put on heaps of weight, hopefully with the money I currently spend on smokes ($60 a week more or less, thanks australian tobacco tax) I can get a gym membership. 
It's a massive mountain ahead of me and I keep putting off starting.

3 months tomorrow.

Wow. I can't believe I've come this far. I don't have much to say, just that it's been a long ride and the journey doesn't end here. I can't say I don't still think about having a smoke every now and then, or stare at cigarette butts, or smell it and remember what it was like to smoke. I always thought some kind of magic key would turn at 3 months and I would never have to think about it again. But nope, the battles just get easier, and I don't have to fight them as often, and I've come to accept that they'll always be there. Thanks to everyone here for all the support.

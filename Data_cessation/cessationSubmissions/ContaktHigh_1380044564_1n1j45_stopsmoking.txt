Trying To Quit, Need Help

Dear Redditors,

Im a 21 Year old and have recently decieded that I no longer want to smoke for various reasons, I had purchased a Carton about two weeks ago and Said when Im finished this I'm quiting. This morning on my Travels to work I finished my last Smoke - Now im running into the problems most people have and Im need of some advice on how to handle situations below.

Smoking and Driving has become less and less of a problem for me so I can kick the habit there. 

I also happen to enjoy a good smoke after having some /r/Trees - How can Im combat this? as I plan to keep smoking Trees as its a preferd medication for myself.

FRIENDS: All of my core group of buddies who I hang out with on a regular basis are smokers - I have advocated to them I am trying to quit and please be supportive. However how do I resist the social temptation of smoking while we do social activities?

Also how do I combat early morning cravings and being a bad news grumps? Im usually a very upbeat and positive person however after I have my morning cig.

All suggestions are welcome!

Thanks in advance.

I keep dreaming that I am smoking again

For the first few times in the dream I actually rejected or even crushed the cigarette that I received. The thing is, in the last couple days, I've been accepting or even buying packs of cigarettes. It's been just over two weeks and I don't want to start smoking again. I hope I don't lose to my subconscious. Cheers

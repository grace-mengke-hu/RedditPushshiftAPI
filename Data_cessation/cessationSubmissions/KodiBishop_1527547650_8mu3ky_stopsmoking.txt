15 months smoke free, passe my first real test this weekend.

I've been smoke-free since February of 2017. I haven't had any cravings since this weekend's when a few buddies of mine came over and we had a barbecue and they started smoking. I don't know what came over me but I was trying to make every justification in the book to myself for having a puff or a whole spliff.

I was up till 3 in the morning holding a cigarette in my ear trying to justify lighting up and I even opened this subreddit and searched for posts of people talking about relapsing to see if I could justify it to myself.

But I overcame the temptation and went to bed and in the morning I woke up and threw the cigarettes away. I definitely feel proud of myself and this is a much better feeling than if I had given in and had the smokes.

It's been over two years and I had a dream I was smoking again.

It's been two years since I quit. Last night I had a dream I was sitting on my front porch smoking.  In my dream in told myself I could quit anytime.  Yet, as I looked down at my full pack of cigarettes, I knew it was a lie.  I felt like I let myself down.  I worked so hard to quit and then started again.

I was so relieved when I woke up.  It reminded me why I quit and how hard it was.  I don't have to go through the withdraws again.  Everytime I feel stressed out, I don't automatically want to smoke.  I got past all of that.  

I felt compelled to post this because I know others have started smoking after quiting and you don't have to.  I am so happy for anyone here who is trying and I believe in all of you. You helped me and I want to return the favor.

One week cold turkey.

One week into quitting after ~9 years smoking on and off. This is the longest I have gone cold turkey without a cigarette, have always used patches in the past.

It's payday tomorrow, and I'm worried that the influx of cash in my account might make it easier to slip into old habits. Anyone got any advice on how to strengthen that willpower?

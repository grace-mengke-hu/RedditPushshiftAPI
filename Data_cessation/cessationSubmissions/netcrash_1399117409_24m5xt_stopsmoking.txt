Problems with sleep after quitting

I've been smoke-free for alread 55 days (I've been smoking for around 8 years). My only concern is that I started to see a lot of dreams and to sleep worse for already a month or so. 
I have a sleep tracking application called Sleep as android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep) which allows to track sleeping cycles. Before quitting deep sleep was around 65-70% , now it is 50% on average. 
Any suggestions?

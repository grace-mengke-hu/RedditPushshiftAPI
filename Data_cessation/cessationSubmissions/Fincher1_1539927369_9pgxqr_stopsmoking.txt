One cigarette a day need help

Been smoking for two years now usually 14 cigarettes a day. I have recently cut down to one cigarette at lunch time. 

I am living in Thailand currently where everyone smokes and am finding it so hard to just have no cigarettes especially towards lunchtime. How do you guys recommend just stopping?

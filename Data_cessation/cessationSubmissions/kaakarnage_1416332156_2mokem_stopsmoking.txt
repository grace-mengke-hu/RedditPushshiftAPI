Trying to quit. I have four cigarettes left.

Hey guys. I posted here a whole back, then a friend of mine quit smoking and suggested I post here again - she said it helped her immensely. 

After being vehemently against smoking, I had my first cigarette back in 2010 working the holiday season at a Radioshack. 

I had dealt with a slew of unpleasant customers and one of the managers offered me a smoke to calm down. After that smoke, on my way home, I bought a pack. 

I had tried a lot of things. People said switch to a brand I hated, so I bought Camels. After the first week or so, I loved Camels. 

I have four cigarettes left. I have, "Stop Smoking the Easy Way," and I can't seem to get through it. 

I've, "quit," before, only to switch to a black n' mild or so a day to get my nicotine fix. I always ended up buying a pack again eventually. 

What are the best suggestions you former smokers have to help me through this tough time? 

To make things worse, I have Black Friday coming up, and that never helps. My money situation is completely messed up, and so the stress levels are off the charts. 

I know the savings involved, and my girlfriend would be over the moon if I quit. 

Thanks in advance guys.

I know I'm responsible for my own actions, but my wife cannot back off for even a couple of days. How do I make her understand?

My wife and I have a pretty tumultuous relationship.  We have been having serious problems, and I smoke weed and cigarettes all day everyday.  I want to quit and have wanted to quit for quite a while.  I have made really strong attempts at quitting, but always end up relapsing due to a fight.  Most of the time, she starts bitching about something that isn't even worth bitching about by day 2.  Sometimes on that Day 2 I just give up and say "fuck it, we're just gonna fight and i'll end up giving in in the future might as well do it now" other times, I make it through that fight and others until I do eventually relapse because I can't handle everything at once.  When I try to tell her this she basically tells me that I myself am the only reason I cannot quit and that she doesn't have control over my actions.  I feel like as long as I am with her, I will never be able to quit, and I want to be with my wife.

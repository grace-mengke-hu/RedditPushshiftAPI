2week. Feel like crying all the time. wtf

I have smoked on and off for about 5years. At my worst was on about 10 a day, make that 20 if alcohol got involved. At my best I only smoked when drunk, but that often lead to chain smoking the entire night out.

roughly 2 week ago for no real reason other than vaguely considered it for a while I said no more.

i have managed a long weekend of partying and only had a couple puffs on an e cig last friday, when drunk and everyone else was smoking - bad but it was better than falling off completely.



I thought 'oh this is going well'

then all today I want a cig so bad I feel like crying, I got mega upset over literally nothing. my bf tried to hug me in bed and I snapped like 'stop grabbing me like you own me' which turned into a massive crying 'do you even like me' weird self indulgent moan even though I wanted the hug and its rare he will be cuddly so ive just shot my chances of him trying again for ages in the foot!
then I got home and my bed was so soft I wanted to cry at how I missed it (for 1 night) then my takeaway was late tonight so I wanted to cry how everything foes wrong. 

Everything makes me want a cig.

This is doing my head in.

Tell me this passes or the crying thing is unrelated? I dunno why I have decided it is related but I really cant think of another reason. 
I'm on the same hormone birth control as always so its not that.

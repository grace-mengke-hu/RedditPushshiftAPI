473

This is my 473rd day of not smoking, I haven't posted on here since about 12 months ago but I check in a couple of days a week just to see how everyone is getting on. If I can stop smoking after 34 years the anyone can, although I would definitely recommend Allen Carr's book to anyone that is in the early stages of stopping, I keep his little book of quitting in my bag.
Keep up the good work everyone, together we can make this world a better place to live (just a little)

Already feeling the urge for this weekend

The wife is away for the weekend which it only time I used to smoke at the house. She hasn't been gone more than half a day since I quit. She's not leaving until tomorrow but I am already getting that feeling in my chest &amp; stomach that I would get after going a couple hours too long without one, and that anxious anticipation that I can smoke again soon. I am starting to dream of sitting outside in a chair doing nothing but smoking. I quit over a year ago &amp; this is been eating me up today. I need serious therapy or something.

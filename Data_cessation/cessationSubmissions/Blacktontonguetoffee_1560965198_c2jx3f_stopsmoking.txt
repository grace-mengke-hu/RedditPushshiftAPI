When will I not be annoyed by being a non smoker?

Like honestly does it ever get better. I miss it but I don’t. I know logically I feel 100% better without smoking. It is more the sensation I suppose of smoking. 

I guess it’s more annoyance that I can’t just have one, once in awhile without it becoming a habit again. 

Does it really get better? Does annoyance go away? 

I’ve gotten to two weeks before and I know cravings go away, but that annoyance was still there even at the 2 week mark for me.

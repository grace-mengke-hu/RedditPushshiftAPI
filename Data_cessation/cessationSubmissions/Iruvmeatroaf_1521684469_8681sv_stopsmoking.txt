Fed up and ready to start for the last time

As i'm sure tons of you will understand, i've "tried" quitting about 100000 times, always saying tomorrow will be different and I'll really mean it. I've read the books, i've just never fully committed. I think that because i've always been a "casual" smoker (often not as casual as i'd pretend) i've been able to trick myself into thinking that it's not a serious problem, but at the same time it causes 90 percent of the mental stress in my life, and is the main destroyer of my self confidence (due to not being able to stick to not smoking) I have lurked here for years and seen all the success and i'm finally ready to just be done forever. I know I hate it, I know it's easy if i simply stick to not putting a cigarette in my mouth, and I know i'm ready to stick to this to make my 30th birthday in 6 months the best year of my life!

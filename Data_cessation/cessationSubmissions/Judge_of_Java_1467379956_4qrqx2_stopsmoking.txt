My Second 13 Days

Roughly 4 weeks ago, I made the decision to quit smoking. 13 days ago, I caved to what I thought was a bad withdrawal and had a couple of smokes after having already gone 14 days smoke-free. They didn't make me feel better. They just tasted like crap, so I threw the pack away right after my third cigarette.

I still don't really feel like having a smoke at all, and I'm not sure what changed this time as opposed to the other times I tried to quit. It's almost like a switch got flipped in my mind and I just decided I didn't care about smoking anymore. I don't need it, it doesn't contribute to my life in any meaningful way, and it makes me smelly.

I'm still using NRT in the form of lozenges right now. But I have a minor surgery coming up in a few weeks where I'll be out of work for about 5 days. I'm thinking that will be the perfect time to stop with the lozenges that I've only been using once a day, if I felt like I needed it. I think I might be able to beat this thing once and for all.

I *never* thought I'd be able to make it this far, let alone be able to look forward to quitting for good. I'm feeling so much better about myself, and I'm already noticing that my senses of smell and taste have begun to improve.

So yeah, just wanted to get my thoughts out there.

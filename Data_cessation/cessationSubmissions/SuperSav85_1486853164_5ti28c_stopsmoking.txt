Day One: Caffeine cravings

Hey guys I'm finally on day one of what I am determined to be the last time I ever have to quit!!

Everything seems normal from the other times I have tried to quit like irritability and fatigue but for some reason I am having a crazy craving for caffeine and I have already downed more coffee and energy drinks than I would normally have in a day, and I just keep wanting more. 

Is this normal?

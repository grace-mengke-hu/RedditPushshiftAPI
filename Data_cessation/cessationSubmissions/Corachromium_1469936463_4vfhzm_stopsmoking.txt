Is anyone from the /r/raisedbynarcisists board on this board as well?

I mostly frequent the RBN boards, and I am also a smoker who is trying to quit smoking cigarettes with the vaping method. I have a 90 dollar vaporizer, and tons of fluid ready to go. I am moving out of my NMom and NStepdads house in a couple weeks...and i have been ready to quit for awhile now. My SO has been a Non Smoker for 13 months using his vaporizer and is weened off of nicotine. It works for him, but didn't work as well with me so far...... cause I've had a lot of NFamily around me giving me free cigarettes. I was at 3 a day, but now I'm at 5-10 a day once I moved back into my NMoms because she gives me free cigarettes. She's been giving me free cigarettes for years since I was 15 years old. I'm now 21 so I've been smoking for 6-7 years. Luckily I'm moving out but I think the stress of moving is going to be tough if if I decide to quit smoking. Is anyone else on the RBN boards trying to quit too?

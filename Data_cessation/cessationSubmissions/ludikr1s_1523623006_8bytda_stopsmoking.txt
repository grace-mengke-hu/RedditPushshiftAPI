I Had My Last Cigarette Today.

I just wanted to introduce my let you all know I started my journey.  I smoked in college until 25.  I quit for 6 years, but started again in the last 2 years.  I was on and off.  I could go months without one, then eventually I was a smoker again.  My addicted brain kept telling me, you can stop anytime.  And it tricked me into smoking again.  

Looking back, I was much happier as a non-smoker.  I wasn’t always thinking of the next one.  I didn’t have to keep a map in my head of where the nearest place I can buy one.  I felt so free.  Now, I only feel shame.  

Cigarettes controlled me.  I planned my days around them.  I hid it from people, because I was ashamed, embarrassed, and guilty.  I couldn’t leave the house without them.  It was dreadful.  

Thank for listening.  I’m glad I found this community and I don’t feel so alone.

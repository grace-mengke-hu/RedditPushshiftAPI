I quit but withdrawal symptoms are killing me - any tips?

So I quit 4 and a half days ago. Honestly I have no urge or craving to smoke a cigarette, which is amazing! But the withdrawal symptoms are driving me nuts.  

I have difficulty sleeping, I've woken up in the middle of the night having an existential panic attacks a couple of days in a row and I've been light headed, almost drunk feeling, for the last 4 days. This sucks.  

Any ideas of how to lessen the side effects?

Chantix == Coffee

Has anyone else found that Chantix works like coffee: it keeps you up all night? I was sick last week and wasn't awake much and so wasn't taking it. For some reason I was only taking it in the mornings when I started back up again this week. Tonight, at about 7pm, I took my first evening dose in a while and here I am still awake the next morning.

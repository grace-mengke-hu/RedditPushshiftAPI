Outburst

I smoked for a year and quit cold turkey about 55 days ago (posting from phone, can't see my flair). I hadn't planned on quitting but decided to when my girlfriend and good friend thought we should make some sort of mutual attempt.

They both smoke one to three a day still but have been smoking for 6ish years. Last night after my friend mentioned something about her bf getting mad at her for smoking still (don't quite remember the exigence-we had all been smoking pot) I started a slow burning tirade about how she isn't actually quitting and blah blah blah. I felt like absolute garbage afterward, was completely embarrassed and looked like a fool. My girlfriend said I came off as preachy and looking back it felt preachy.

I'm angry and it pent up to that moment when I felt like an outcast. I realize now that I quit for myself and no one else. I don't want to be that guy that nags his girlfriend and friends to quit smoking--i hated that guy when I did smoke. I want to be supportive.

I feel confused and mostly like a shithead for bearing down on my friend like that.

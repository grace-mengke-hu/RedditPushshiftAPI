Quitting smoking and panic attacks

Hi guys, 

I'm on day 16 off quitting cigarettes. I have on one patch and have been vaping, but cut down from 18mg to 12mg to 6mg.

I've started having panic attacks since I quit is this part of it? 
Could smoking have been masking them?

I really want to stay quit but these panic attacks are currently keeping me from going to my classes and I don't want to fail!

Thanks
Edit: Forgot to add I take Ritalin for my ADHD, not sure if that's interacting or needs dosage adjusting!

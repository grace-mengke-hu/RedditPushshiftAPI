Does quitting smoking make you gain some weight?

Just curious, I have zero issue with gaining weight as I'm underweight for my age/height right now, I am 21 and have been smoking basically every day since I was 18, if I don't have money I will borrow fags/tobacco and smoke around 5 a day. When I have money, I buy and smoke a ten packet a day, which I suppose isn't as much as some but still not good for my health.

I'm planning on quitting, I have one more fag left in my packet right now... I do want to make this my last one. Maybe the idea of stopping making me gain some weight will give me a little extra motivation to stop.

Counting my 63rd day without smoking today. It's going well, and I have had a few crises along the way, but I've managed to pull through. 

These days, whenever I have a slight urge, I drop by this subreddit and read other people's experiences, and it helps me remember why I quit.

And happy to share that I don't feel any strong cravings anymore, no physical symptoms like coughing, taste, smell or anything that I could attribute to having smoked now or in the past. So it's really beginning to feel like normal. Something I haven't felt for many years.

Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories :-)

First time here - already have a question for you guys

Hey everyone.  I've been smoke free since the 1st.  Decided to go cold-turkey with my girlfriend and so far we've been managing and not cheating at all.  
 At this point, I don't feel like I crave the nicotine anymore but I am craving the habit of smoking. 
I've been thinking more and more about E-cigs (the ones without nicotine) and I was wondering if this would be setting myself back.  I mean, so far I've gone 11 days without anything; would E-cigs just be a bridge back to smoking again?  What are your experiences/advice (I did read the previous post on e-cigs and so far it seems like it might not be that bad of a choice?)

*edit* Thanks for the advice guys- especially exercise; I'm not sure why I didn't think of it

Seriously, what's the point of nictoine free snuff and snus?

Herbal cigarettes I get. It lets people who want to quit smoking exerience a similar ritual to lighting a cig and blowing smoke out. Same for herbal cigars. Hell, even herbal chew I can get behind as it has its own ritual. But herbal snuff? seriously, what's the point of sniffing a powder that does absolutely nothing? or placing a herbal "snus" packet under your lip that again, does nothing? For the life of me I don't understand why these products exist.

Cold Turkey Sandwich

The days after Thanksgiving have always been full of cold turkey sandwiches, which frankly is the highlight of my year food-wise.  Well this year I get cold turkey served twice.  I've gone cold turkey for seven days (again), and its been alright.  I mean, it's hard and has its ups and downs and at times I really want to just give up my cold turkey.  In fact about three days in I bought lozenges--just in case, so I wouldn't buy cigarettes. I've been fatigued, light headaches, achy, congested and have some insomnia.  Even today, at seven days I still feel demotivated and have a headache.  Still I haven't smoked or used a lozenge. I just love my cold turkey and I don't want to give it up!

Well..I managed to be smoke free from Midnight to 7pm...until I was putting clothes in washing machine and found a half pack of cigs in one of my jeans

I'm not going to feel sorry for myself and start self-loathing, but I do feel weak and kinda stupid for not even second thinking about not smoking them and just throwing them away....I just lit one up like the universe had gifted me them to ease my suffering...lol. I went through the whole day really strong and then boom...I'm smoking again. 

Well, it's a few hours to midnight now. My last cigarette will be just before midnight. Read for a while and then sleep. I will wake up in the morning strong like I was this morning and progress forward celebrating each hour I go without cigarettes.  13 year of smoking is enough!

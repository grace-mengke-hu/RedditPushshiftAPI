Day 1: Another new member to this sub

I've been a smoker off and on for over fifteen years.  I've had a strong desire to quit for five of them and never followed through.  But, today, it has to stop.  I've tried the patch, the gum, e-cigs and Wellbutrin.  They didn't work (for me).

So, now I'm going with the hardest method: cold turkey.  I have no doubt that this will be hard.  But I need to do this for myself and my family.  

I know the success rates for cold turkey is small.  But I'm sure there's a success story here on this sub-reddit.  If anyone who has done cold turkey has any coping methods they'd like to share, I'm all ears.

Thanks in advance for this support group.  I hope I may be of service here as I get some weeks and months behind me.

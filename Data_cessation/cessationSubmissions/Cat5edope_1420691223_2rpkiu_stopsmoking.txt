The dreams of a nicotine fiend.

I thought of posting this in /dreams but I think it's more relevant here because I think its a side effect of quitting. If the mods don't agree I will take down.

I rarely remember my dreams, and when I do they are cloudy wisp of a dream. Ever since I quit smoking my dreams have become exponentially more vivid and memorable. Every night they get stranger and more complex. Last night or better yet this morning I dreamed  of swimming through a girls hair. That may not seem the strange for a dream , but with this dream it never changed from that, it was the same girl even if I woke up and went back to sleep. The other night I dreamed about an entire work day of my job (pharmacy intern) sat in a toy store. Now yes it doesn't seem that weird at first, but what was weird about it was unlike regular
Dreams where things jump from place to place or some random shit. This dream was chronological, as in I dreamed of an entire shift at my job from coming I'm filling prescriptions going to lunch etc ext and logically explaining how stupid it was to run a pharmacy out of a toy store. I remember these dreams almost like I actually lived them, something I could never do. What are some of your crazy dreamsÂ¿

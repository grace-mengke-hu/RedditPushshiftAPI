500 days ago I have quit going cold turkey

I am addicted to nicotine in form of cigarrettes and e-cigarrettes (mostly).

I made my quit instantly going cold turkey at 18 March 2017 after 5-6 years of smoking/vaping.
It's possible, just be patient, control yourself and don't get fooled by symptomps.
I was craving really bad for 5 months, when I started university the cravings got weaker, they are still there but I can live normally without nicotine.
It is possible, people, it really is.

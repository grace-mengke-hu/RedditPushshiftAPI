Running my first 5k on Thanksgiving!

I have been 78 days smoke free after smoking a pack a day for 20 years straight. Last week I ran a mile without stopping for the first time in my life. It was an amazing not feeling like I was about to die and gasping for air. That was enough to motivate me to push on. That next day, I managed to run 2 miles non-stop. Then the day after that, I hit 3 miles non-stop.

On my last 2 runs, I've been able to run 5k non-stop each time, trimming a minute off my mile pace, barely over a 9 minute mile currently. My initial goal was to run a 5k under 30 minutes but now it looks like I'll be stretching that goal even further. We'll see how my times end up during training leading up to Thanksgiving!

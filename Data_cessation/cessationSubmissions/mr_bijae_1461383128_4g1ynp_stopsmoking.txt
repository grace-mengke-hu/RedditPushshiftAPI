Three years ago today...

I was one day into my life as a non smoker. I was anxious. I was angry. I was frustrated, I was.... craving a fucking cigarette! 

I resisted. It was hard. It was VERY hard. It was impossible. 

I meditated. Or attempted. I couldn't focus because I wanted that cigarette so bad. 

I persisted.

I resisted the nicotine lozenge, "it's all in my head. I can do this". I'd read the books, I'd taken looks, 

Down this path before.

This time it's different.I know.. I KNOW... I want it all. 

I want to smoke this cig and have my dreams, but 

That, is not what is meant to be. 

These two lovers they don't belong together. 

My dreams, this reality, 

it is challenging, as you now see.

One can stay! one must go!

<blink>

which will you choose?

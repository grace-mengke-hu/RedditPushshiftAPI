My mom wants your help (she's a 40yr+ smoker)

Hello StopSmoking!

My mom has wanted to stop smoking, or at least, stop smoking regular cigarettes and move onto the e-cigs. She does want to stop smoking completely, but feels that the transition to e-cigs will make that easier.

She has no idea where to start. She has been smoking for the last 40 years. She lost her husband (my dad) to cancer about 3 years ago, and I know it eats at her that she could be next. She really doesn't know what to do. She smokes about a pack a day, has asthma, and COPD (amongst other issues). 

What helped you stop smoking? If you do use e-cigs (I don't know if anyone in this community does), but what brand do you use? I bought her one for Christmas, but she doesn't like the way it tastes... She wants one that tastes similar to Marlboro light. She feels that transitioning to an e-cig may make it easier for her to completely stop in the end.

The only downside is that she smokes when she's stressed, and well, I hate that she uses that as a crutch. "When things die down, I'll work on it." Well, we have had a stressful life for the last 10 years, and it isn't getting any better. What do you do if you're a stress smoker?

Tl;dr: What helped you stop smoking? If you smoke from stress, what helps you? Do you use e-cigs? If so, which brand do you use, and do you know of one that will taste similar/the same as Marlboro light?

Thanks for any help you can give me. She does want help, and I want to help her. I really don't want to be without a mom, when I've already lost a dad.

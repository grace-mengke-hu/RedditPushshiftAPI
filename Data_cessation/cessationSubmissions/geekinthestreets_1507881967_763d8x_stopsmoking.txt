1 Year!!!!

Wow. It's been a whole year. It's been a shitty year (see one of my [previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6ztx86/30_days_until_the_big_365/)). I've fucking done it though. So, here are the things that helped me get this far.

1. I had a good enough reason that I couldn't ignore. That changed how I thought about smoking. You can't do this without a change in how you think about smoking.

2. Vaping. Not a popular thing in here but it worked for me. I'm not saying it will work for everyone. I know loads of people in here like Allen Carr's book and cold turkey but neither of those things worked for me. We all need to find the way that works for us. Don't judge anyone for using a method you personally don't approve of. Your opinion is not fact. Neither is mine. I just know what my experience is.

3. Reading your stories. Every time I got a craving I'd come on here for some inspiration.

4. Sleep. Particularly when you have quitter's flu. Whenever you get a chance during that period I recommend it. If I hadn't done that then it would have been so much worse.

5. Be active. I went for walks to distract me from cravings. I even did a 26 mile charity walk. I couldn't have done that if I was still a smoker.

Good luck to all of you with your quits and thank you to all those whose stories helped me with mine.

Here's to the next year!!!!!!!

Restarting again today...

I had almost 2 months without any nicotine at all. Lots of stressful stuff and “what’s the worst that could happen” thinking and I smoked 10 cigs since Tuesday. I get into the cycle of being unable to hold myself accountable because there’s not really such an immediate noticeable health/social effect (unlike my old vices like hard drugs). I’m disappointed but trying not to beat myself up. My last smoke was last night at 6 pm. 

I’ve thrown away the rest of the pack and my e-cig I bought and my lighters. Wish me luck, again.

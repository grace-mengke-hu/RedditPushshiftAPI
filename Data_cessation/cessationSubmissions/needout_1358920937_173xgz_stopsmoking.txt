Mugged and stressed

Hey everyone! So I quit 16 days ago after smoking for 18 years at a pack a day. All my friends smoke still too. Anyways I've been unemployed since November and owe rent for this month plus soon to be next month. I was mugged tonight at gun point and had my smartphone and wallet stolen with the last of my money. YET, I still haven't smoked! So basically I'm soon to be homeless without much going for me but I will go down a nonsmoker! So keep it up guys and think of me if you start feeling "stressed", as it could be worse!

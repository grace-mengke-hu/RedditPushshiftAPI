WARNING: PREMATURE? After two solid weeks I wish I had another crippling habit I could slay!!!...oh shit. Would compulsively monitoring this subreddit qualify???

If I could've done it without /r/stopsmoking, it'd been nice if the last 12 times I tried to earnestly quit would've gotten that message! Seriously, y'all been lifesavers.

So when does it start to suck less?

I can get into my backstory and such if you guys want, but to be brief I've wanted to quit for a long time, mainly because of the expense. My hours were cut in half at work and that was the kick I needed to properly commit. I've tried a couple time to quit cold turkey but I could never make it through the day; the cravings and the disorientation were too much.

I bought a pack of nicotine gum and on day one had a few pieces and one cigarette, the next day a few pieces and half a cigarette, used just gum for a couple days and now I'm on day 10 of quitting, day 3 of no nicotine whatsoever.

And I feel lousy. I've been tired since the start, I have trouble sleeping, though not as bad I have some trouble focusing, and I'm just generally hazy. I honestly felt a lot healthier when smoking.

Redditors who have quit, when does it get better?

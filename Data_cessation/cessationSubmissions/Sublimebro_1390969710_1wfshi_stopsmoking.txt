I'm excited to be able to run again without wheezing for breath. (Question too)

Out of all the pros of quitting smoking (besides not having lung cancer) I think I'm most excited for my breathing to feel healthy again.

I have a question for all of you though.

Will my lungs be back to normal or will I always have a disadvantage to people that have never smoked because I smoked at one point in my life? Will my lungs repair themselves to that of a nonsmoker? (Smoked for 3 years at a pack a day)

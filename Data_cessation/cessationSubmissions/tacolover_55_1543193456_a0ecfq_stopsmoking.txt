2 Months smoke free today!

I started vaping when my girlfriend said "I love you, please don't take yourself from me". Now I am 2 months smoke free. Technically. I had half a cigarette 2 weeks ago and I was so happy. Because I realized I hated it!!!! It made me feel sick and I was disgusted by the taste. I used to go through a pack a day. Now I can't even make it through one without wanting to throw the disgusting thing out. You can quit.

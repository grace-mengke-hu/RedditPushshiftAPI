Was sick for 3 days and cravings seem to have diminished. How do I take advantage of this?

Had a stomach bug and the thought of cigs just made me sick. I only had 1 major craving 2 nights ago, and have only smoked about 8 in the last 4 days (been pushing a pack a day for a while now). So this is a rare opportunity to get out and I need to strike while the irons hot. I have small cravings but mostly due to habits, like smoking after eating or while driving. What are some things I could supplement for smoking in those situations? This is my ticket out and any help would be very appreciated. Preferably no nicotine related solutions like gums or what ever.

I slipped up after a great week :(

My boyfriend and I quit together last Sunday. We were actually excited to quit and tried to support each other the best we could. The physical withdrawal was brutal for me but I never actually *wanted* a cigarette until last night- we got into a huge fight because we've both been moody and I've definitely been kind of emotionally crazy despite my best efforts to calm down and breath through it (the anxiety I experienced during withdrawal was harsh). Anyway, he left all night and I was devastated and I made the stupid decision to buy a pack. And I smoked a few. And I feel like shit about myself because I made the promise to myself & other people to "never smoke again." UGH I'm so frustrated with myself. He doesn't know that I slipped up and I don't want to tell him because I'm ashamed and I don't want to disappoint him but when we count how many days we've gone I'm going to have to tell him or lie :( 

How long until the hyper emotional sensitivity wears off? Please, someone tell me I'm not crazy? :(

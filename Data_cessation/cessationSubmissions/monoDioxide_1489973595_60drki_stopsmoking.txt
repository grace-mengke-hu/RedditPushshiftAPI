Any long-time former smokers here?

Yikes... so I'm about to quit for the first time in several years after 30 years (!) of smoking. I had transitioned almost entirely to vaping for about 6 months but I travel a lot internationally and kept having my gear confiscated by customs. 

My longest nicotine free period was about 6 months about 15 years ago. One stressful situation and boom, I was back to smoking.

I'm dealing with my third cold this winter after not having had any colds in a decade. Saw my doc last week and he said to me - it's time.

So here I am. 35-45 smokes a day down to none ahead.

Any words of wisdom?

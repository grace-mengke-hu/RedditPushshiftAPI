Was going well but cravings are on the up...

In the last few weeks I have found that my cravings are increasing. Summer isn't helping as there's not much better than a pint in the beer garden with a cigarette. I also went mountain biking for the weekend with my smoker friends and loved being able to climb without the same wheezing they experienced but after the ride, I would've loved to have had a roll-up with them. 

I also have a work party coming up and to be honest, I used to like the excuse to go outside for a cigarette to get away from it for 5 minutes and hang out with the other smokers so that's not going to be easy. Basically, I'm finding triggers everywhere and it's starting to drive me a little bit insane. 

Any good ideas?

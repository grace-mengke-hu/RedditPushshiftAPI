Have any of you released post &gt;2 weeks?

I quit cold turkey a week ago today, it's my first time too. Though the temptations peaked around day 3, they still hover around me from time to time; &amp; from what I've read on this subreddit, the cravings almost completely go after the 2 week mark, so my question is- how often to people go back to smoking after quitting for 2 weeks or more?

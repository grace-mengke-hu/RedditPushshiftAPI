25 Days SMOKE FREE

Some days I donâ€™t even think about a cigarette!!
It helps being busy and immediately doing something else as soon as I get a craving.

The hardest is socializing. All my friends smoke! The more I have to drink the more I want to smoke so that is one are that needs works! 
But no going back. Cold turkey is the best choice!

What worked for you guys?

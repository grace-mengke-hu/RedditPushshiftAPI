Day 5 - My Body isn't aching anymore

Re-wrote this post countless time, and always ended up which huge walls of text. Here goes my story:

After the first 3 days, I have this feeling, a very good feeling. Even though I still had the occasional crave yesterday and today, they were more like temptations rather than craves. The substance craving is gone and I feel really good physically. My heart rate is down and jogging never felt easier, and I couldn't remember the last time I had this much energy throughout the day

So yeah; if you're going to do it, just do it. I went cold turkey, and prepared myself mentally that I will possible have the worst 3 days of my life. I almost did. Cutting down, vaping or any other NRT only makes the process worse and slows the detox down. I wanted to get it out of my system as fast as possible.

Now to stay away from the temptation, which is the same temptation that got me into this addiction, only now I know better. 

7 years, 20 a day smoker -> and now over 100 hours **smoke free**; and it feels really good.

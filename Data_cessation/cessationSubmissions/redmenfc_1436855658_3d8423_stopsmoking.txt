I've quit for months on end, but eventually always fallen off the wagon. This time, I'm trying really hard...

Every time I'd go out for a smoke, I'd take one of my closest friends with me for company. He didn't smoke, but he was always down to go stand outside, get some fresh air, while I destroyed my lungs. He'd tell me, jokingly, "You should stop smoking. If you don't, you'll be the first one to die in our circle of friends. You'll be depriving us of your company, leaving us alone." I would laugh it off, finish my cigarette and go about my day.

One week ago, he died. And all I can think of is this. And all I can do is realize that this might be the best chance and the most compelling reason to quit. I feel I owe it to him.

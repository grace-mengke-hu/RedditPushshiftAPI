Challenges after quitting smoking

Hey guys, want to start by congratulating everyone for taking the step to quit smoking. I’ve been a heavy smoker for years and I consider it to be one of the most challenging things I’ve done so far.  

I quit cigarettes around 3 months back and have been clean so far. Although I feel great in some aspects - like I feel I can breathe again, have more energy and don’t feel like I’m going to cough my lungs out, I’m facing challenges. My work involves a lot of reading and problem solving and i recently took up an competitive exam. Ever since I quit smoking, I feel like I’m unable to concentrate or think deeply. I feel dazed all the time and have started feeling depressed. It’s like my brain needs nicotine to think and focus. Studying for the exam was really difficult and barely managed to make it by dozing on way too much coffee. 

I’m not looking for a excuse to start smoking again. I know the pain I went through to quit and I know it’s the right decision. However, I can’t go on like this either. I want to know if others have faced the same thing and what was your solution to this.

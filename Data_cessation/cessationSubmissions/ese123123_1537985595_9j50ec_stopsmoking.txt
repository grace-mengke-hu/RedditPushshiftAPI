Addiction

 

Hey guys. Starting from last Monday (9/17) heres what my consumption looked like:

On Monday 9/17 I smoked a pack,

On Friday 9/21 I smoked a pack

On Saturday 9/22 I smoked a pack

Before that I didnt really smoke and it was a month after I smoked (socially). Now I am feeling some withdrawal symptoms. Is this legit addiction or all in my head? Ive never been addicted before. How long should these symptoms last. I only smoked for those 3 days and today is day 4 of withdrawal...

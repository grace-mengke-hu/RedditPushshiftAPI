Got 5 cigarettes left in my pack...

I've got five cigarettes left. I've been coughing, wheezing, and generating a lot of mucus in my lungs. Ive been smoking for about 12 years, really only the last seven or so seriously, smoking about 10 cigarettes a day. For most of this time, I've been extremely active and athletic, but stress and some injuries have caused me to consistently smoke 10 cigarettes a day for the last year or so and I haven't been running or exercising at all.  I need to quit and get back to my former self. My former self being someone who could run 50 miles a week, had a ton more energy than I do now, and wasn't reaching for a cigarette because I was stressed out. My dad, who has been smoking for 50+ years, recently switched to a vaporizer and hasn't had a cigarette in 3 weeks. If he can do it, I can do it. But I'm going to go for just quitting, not vaporizing, because I don't think that'll actually help me personally. I think I need to replace the addiction of smoking with a positive addiction, like getting back into running or doing quick intense workouts around my house. I'd appreciate any tips, words of motivation, especially from people who ran smoked and now run again or quit smoking and now run a lot.

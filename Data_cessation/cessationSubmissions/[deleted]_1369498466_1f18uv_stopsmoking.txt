Today is a true test for me.

Today I'm getting fitted for tuxes with my groomsmen. 2 out of these 3 guys smoke and I've been smoking cigs with my best man for 10 years. This is going to be maybe the truest test of willpower I've ever dealt with. Posting here to reinforce my mind to not give in after having an amazing 11 days. I will post again tonight when I get home to let you know how it went, I plan on not having to reset this badge.

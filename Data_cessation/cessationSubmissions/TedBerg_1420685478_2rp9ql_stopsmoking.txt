Pack a day for 8 years -> none in 2015

This is the first time I've been able to make it even a half day without a cigarette. 

The physical withdrawal is annoying but it passes quickly, and they're almost nonexistent now. Mentally, I had been catching myself thinking, "I really can't wait until this quitting thing is over so I can have a cigarette." It was strange to think of myself as a nonsmoker, and I had to reinforce in my head.

If you're reading this for motivation.. It's not that hard. It's really not. I dreaded it, I built it up so much in my head.. Getting over that dread was a bigger hurdle than the actual quitting. Stay busy, stay active, stay a nonsmoker.

*sigh* Restarting today.

I had 3 smokes last night after 8 days.. I gave in. Completely anxious all day. In hindsight I should have just laid down in bed and watch a couple of movies, instead of pacing around and worrying about it. 

oh well.. I have never gone 8 days in 13 years of my smoking ever. Here is to starting again! Wish me luck!

I've given in &amp; asked to bum a cigarette twice in the past 4 months &amp; both times my friend has said no 'bc you don't want to break the streak - you're doing so good!' &amp; I've said 'okay you're right,' and ended up not having a cig. I still feel disappointed in myself though

Both times I was super drunk. Both times it was the same person who's a smoker but *genuinely* cares that I managed to quit. Most of the time I give *her* shit for still smoking (even though she's cut down like crazy ever since I quit), but these couple of times I've just sort of broken down &amp; gone 'eh, what the fuck.' 

And like I said in the title, she says 'no,' and I let it go (I don't bother her for very long about it). 

But seriously, if it wasn't for her reaction, I definitely would've relapsed a couple times by now. Knowing that, it sort of... undermines how long I've been quit, you know? Like yeah, I'm 4 months quit... but I'd be 2 *weeks* quit if my buddy hadn't clamped down &amp; refused to bum her cigarettes... and when *I* was a smoker I was *always* bumming out to people who'd claimed they were quitting with a half-hearted "are you sure?" while digging into the pack to hand one off to them. 

I feel like I don't deserve to feel happy/proud of 4 months because of this. Like I *know* I've slipped &amp; I *would've* smoked if I'd been near a smoker that was anything like *me* when *I* was a smoker...

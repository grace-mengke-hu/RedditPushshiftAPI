My fiancé is a tad grumpy..

Okay so as mentioned in the first post I made in this sub, myself and my fiancé are quitting together. I'm not sure if its the brainfog, but her temper seems to be amping up a few notches once every few hours. It seems to coincide with the times we used to go out for a smoke. 

Any ideas on how I can stop her turning into She-Hulk? And/or.. me turning into a raging maniac?

OT: I don't know why but my touch typing skills have gone completely out of whack. I've only noticed this during typing up this post. Is this a side effect?

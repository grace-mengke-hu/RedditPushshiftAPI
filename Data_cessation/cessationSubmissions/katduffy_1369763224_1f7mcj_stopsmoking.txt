Any advice for vaping in public?

I just quit smoking 3 days ago.  So far so good thanks to the e-cig (vapor cigarette).  I'm going back to work tomorrow and we have a strict non-smoking policy in my office.  The smoking area is 1/2 way across the parking lot, far away from the building.  I'm not sure how to deal with it.  I don't want to go down to the smoking area b/c I'm not sure I can handle it yet, its too tempting to be around my smoking colleagues.  I haven't really left my house/car since I quit and worried about the politically correct issues of vaping in public.  Any suggestions/shared experiences would be helpful!

Smoker since the age of 15, I've quit for good (I hope)

Hey guys, my name is Lauren and I'm 22 and I think I'm quitting smoking for good. I've been smoking since the age of 15 (I live in France, it's quite common to get hooked at a young age) and I've noticed a progressive increase in my smoking for a year now. Nicotine cravings have been getting more and more severe, my fingers have been turning yellow, I've been feeling my heart and my lungs struggling and just in general smoking has been grossing me out more and more and I've been loving it less and less. I smoked a lot this weekend since I was at Pitchfork Fest in Paris and finished my cigarettes on sunday. The last one I smoked was out of desperation when I was grouping up the leftover tobacco on my desk (I smoked rolled cigarettes) and I just found myself pathetic.

I haven't smoked since yesterday, started running again today and am quitting booze for this month to try and get my life back on track because I don't want to be addicted and want to be a healthy young twenty something for the first time in my life. I guess I'm just posting this here for encouragement because I have tried quitting smoking so many times before and actually managed for a year when I was 18 but started up again when I started college.

If you guys have any tips on how to go out in the evenings around drinkers and smokers without relapsing or generally speaking hanging around with smokers (a lot of my friends are) without taking a puff I'm definitely interested !! Thanks for reading and send all the good vibes my way :)

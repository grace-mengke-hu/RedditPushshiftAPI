I came here for tips on how to quit. Instead I found something else.

It's about 6:14am where I am. Subscribed to this subreddit because I had a cigarette about an hour ago (couldn't sleep) and was feeling very guilty for having one. 

I was feeling **guilty**.

I've never felt guilty about smoking before. Never thought about quitting. (I'm 23. Started when I was 20. I know, how stupid, right?) 

So I came on here, clicked on "top" and then "all time", hoping to find some foolproof tips and tricks on how to quit. Instead, I read some success stories that made me happy for the people who quit and sad for the people who lost their loved ones to this stupid fucking stick. 

I don't know, but it sparked something in me to quit that no tip or trick could have done. So, as the sun rises, let it mark the first day of me going smoke free. I'm so thankful to have found this sub. I hope I succeed. For my sake and for my loved ones.


EDIT: thank you all VERY much. I'm loving the support and you'll are making day 1 a breeze. I am so glad to have found this sub. :)))))

EDIT II: I wish I could tell my dad that I quit today, but I know it would break his heart if he knew that i've been smoking these past few years. I want him to quit, too (he's been smoking for decades) and thought, ideally it'd be the both of us on the quitting train together. Maybe there's another way.

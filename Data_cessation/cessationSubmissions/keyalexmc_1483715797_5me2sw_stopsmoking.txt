Quit Day 5

I'm a 27 year old male that smoked a pack a day for about 8 years before quitting 4 days ago. When I first started smoking, it was one here or there at college when I was drinking or out with friends. I was confident at the time that I would never become a "real smoker." Oh how wrong I was. I didn't make a New Year's resolution to quit; I was up late with my best friend k and had a breakdown. She quit 2 months ago but I didn't have the courage to join her at the time. I started crying and told her I couldn't do it. That cigarettes had won. I was weak. She took me to task and has been incredibly supportive. I decided at that moment that I would give quitting a shot. I chose to use the patch and it's helped ease the cravings but I still find myself wanting to light up in the mornings, in the car, when I get stressed at work, etc. I also have an emergency bag that has toothpicks, straws, mints, and a Sherlock Holmes style pipe that I use to smoke this Native American smoking blend (no tobacco or nicotine) when I'm desperate. My thinking is an all-of-the-above approach is necessary, and it's worked so far for me! Excited to join this subreddit and connect with other non-smokers on their quit journey! Please send motivation. Have a feeling Day 5 is going to be rough.

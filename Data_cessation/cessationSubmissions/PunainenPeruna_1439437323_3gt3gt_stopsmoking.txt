Third day! : positive vibes

Day nr. 3.
Right now I only have positive vibes .
I feel happy and in peace.
I know it could get worse but at this exact moment I'm alright.
This far I have not had a single big craving. 
I can sit outside on the balcony for hours and only read .
Yesterday I stood on the balcony and (tried) watching stars . ( difficult in the city ) but I can't say I was not thinking about cigarettes, but I didn't want them .
I'm a really sensitive person and while nobody else believes in me but you guys it really helped . 
But I feel good , happy and almost healthy ( still a dry slimy feeling in my throat ) 

Today I will workout and keep reading my book and maybe play some mass effect 2 ... Yeah sounds good for me . 

I know there can be a struggle on day 3 . Maybe i will struggle later today but keep strong whenever you quit smoking now or 69 years ago . 

May the force be with you.

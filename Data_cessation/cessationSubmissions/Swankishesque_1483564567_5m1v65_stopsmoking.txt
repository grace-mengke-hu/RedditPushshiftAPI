As of today, 1/4/2017, it has been 1 year since I've had a cigarette.

I was a smoker for 28 years. I had made several attempts in the past to quit, but I always slipped up and found myself back where I was before.

 Last year, I became determined to quit for good. I was fed up with feeling nicotine had control over me; fed up with paying an arm and leg for a pack of smokes. Through will power, and nicotine patches the first 3 months, I've made it a whole year.

It hasn't necessarily been easy; there were plenty of times I almost started again. I still have dreams about smoking. But I've managed to stay focused and on course. I'm at that point now that when I smell cigarette smoke, I actually find it repulsing.

So to all of you who have made the resolution to quit, hang in there and don't give up. It won't be an easy ride, but the payoff is totally worth it.

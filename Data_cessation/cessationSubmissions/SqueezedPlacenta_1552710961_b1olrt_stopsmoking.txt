Crap

So I’ve quit nicotine in general for about 17 days, I felt really good about it and I was very proud about it. However I had a few drinks and decided that having a few drags from a vape would be alright and I got really bricked. Now it feels like I just lost everything and I don’t know what to do. Should I feel bad that I finally gave into my cravings? Did one time effect me that much? Should I dwell on this fact as much as I should? Any advice on this will help, thank you.

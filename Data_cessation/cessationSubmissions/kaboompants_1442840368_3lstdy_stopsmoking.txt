Unexpected benefits: confidence & getting Tango close

Hey SS, I have a bunch of reasons to be a nonsmoker, but a few unexpected & positive surprises hit me last night & I'd like to share.

I'm big in to Latin dancing. Primarily salsa & bachata, but was in an Argentinian Tango class last night @ a really great, low-lit, speakeasy-ish kinda bar. (For those not familiar, Arg Tango is often called "the dance of passion" - girl with a rose inbetween her lips, cocktail dresses with slits to the thigh etc).

In the past I was always a bit nervous about smelling bad, being in that close of an embrace with women I had just met.  But being smoke free for coming up on 2 weeks, the only smells on me were

1) My own cologne
2) Several womens' perfumes that had rubbed off on me.

That much more comfortable, I was really in to it on the dancefloor, and that confidence showed. I'm still very much a Tango beginner, but my dance card was full. One woman in particular, during a slower song, did the "close embrace", typically reserved for couples or dance partners that are very familiar with each other.

Benefits to embracing my life as a nonsmoker just keep adding up. :)

tl;dr
For those people thinking about it, just starting, or way beyond me - just a reminder/perspective that you can list out all the reasons to embrace your life as a nonsmoker.  Those are all good reasons.  But there will always be other good reasons that you hadn't even thought of.

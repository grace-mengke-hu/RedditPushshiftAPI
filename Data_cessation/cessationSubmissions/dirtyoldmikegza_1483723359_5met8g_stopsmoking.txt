Really jonesing right now... Been pissed off all day.

And I just got in a stupid Facebook argument and it got personal...I turned it off but I'm pretty angry and walking around trying to stay busy because I can't use cigarettes to calm down!  UPDATE: so the rage has largely passed..Talked to my sister about getting trolled...Owned up to the insanity of it, I felt good to admit I was bothered by something, rather than sucking it down and stuffing it away!

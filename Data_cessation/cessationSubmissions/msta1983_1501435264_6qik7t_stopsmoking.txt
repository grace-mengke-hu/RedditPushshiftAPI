Anyone else having Smoking fantasies???

17 days smoke free; working on day 18. So now I'm DREAMING about smoking. Last night, instead of Matt Damon whisking me off to a deserted island, I had a dream I went with my family to some amusement park and while they weren't noticing, I slipped away and had a smoke. The dream was SO realistic - I literally dreamt of just standing there having every puff of that cig - I woke up so disappointed in my self that "yesterday" I smoked after all the work I've done and all the effort I put into quitting. Then realizing OH WAIT! THAT WASN'T REAL! I was so relieved; I counted my cig jar money. Anyone else having Smoking fantasies???

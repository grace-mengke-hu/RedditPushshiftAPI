12 days 17 hours quitting.. or is it

Without all the background, I decided to quit. I set a date, I got my app and I got a vape. My hubby still smokes and I thought a vape with NO nicotine juice would be better than falling off. I can't take NRT due to other issues and   Now, today, I'm seeing posts/ comments about how vape isn't quitting, vape isn't good, vape is as good as smoking bla bla bla... So does this mean that 12 days and 17 hours of working thru cravings, insomnia, moods etc is just BS? FFS. sorry but wt?!!?!  yes ok vape isn't great, hasn't been around enuf yadayadayada...So ready to just light up and flip the bird at the holier than thou folk. Gosh to be as good and fab as them.ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ Surely as a means to an end, (the end being neither fags nor vape) its ok and not a waste?

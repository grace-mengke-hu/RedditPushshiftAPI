Don't smoke, not even once.

Have been drinking a lot recently and after three or four months of not smoking decided "hey, I'm a grown ass man..  I can smoke a cigarette when I drink, it's the only time I want one anyways and I never want it the next day so fuck it". Well, now I smoke just about every time I drink and it's left me feeling like shit and regretting every single time I have.  My point is that there is no excuses, one slip up and you're back smoking before you know it.  Day 1 once again.

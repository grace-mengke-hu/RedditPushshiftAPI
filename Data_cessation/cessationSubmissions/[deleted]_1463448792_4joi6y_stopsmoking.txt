Um k.

It's actually day 4. I'm antsy and I still want to smoke. This isn't how it feels when I first start, like a mindless compulsive impossibility. Now it just feels like I'm going to struggle forever. 

I even tapered back caffeine today and I guess that hasn't helped much. Or maybe that 1pm coffee was a mistake after all?

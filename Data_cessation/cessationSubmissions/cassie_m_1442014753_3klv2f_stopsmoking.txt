29/f back here after a yearâ€¦.

This Reddit helped me quit about a year back. I went from 10+ cigs a day down to zero for a few months before starting up again. I never went back to that 10-a-day habit, more like 2-3, but have been planning on attempting my second quit for a few months now. I work around seniors, and watching how some will suck on cigarettes long after they've developed hacking coughs was finally enough to motivate me again.

Advice I've heard about it being easier to quit the second time around was so true! And in a way, weening my habit down over the past year (where I would often go hours or a full day without smoking) made the prospect of a situation without a cigarette much more palatable. I just started my last semester of grad school so am hoping to distract myself with that. No drinking for the next little bit either (which is fine as I'm not a big drinker anyway), as my drunken brain is very good at rationalizing my way to a cigarette.

Good luck to you all and I will let you know how it goes. I can't believe I started smoking 7 years ago now. How relieved I am to have stopped.

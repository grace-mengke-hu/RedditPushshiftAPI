I'm quitting smoking today. Celebrate with me!

Hi everyone!

I've been living with this filth for the past 6 years. I've decided today's the big day. I'm just hoping some people of this community will hype me up a bit and get excited with me! 

Feel free to share your story here so we can all be proud of ourselves and celebrate!

Providing Inspiritaion

So one of my co-workers approached me today and asked me how long it took to beat the craving and I told her it was about three days for the physical and two weeks before I stopped worrying about it at all. She told me she was on day 8 and that I had inspired her to quit as I obliviously had done so well. It feels good to pass the benefit on.

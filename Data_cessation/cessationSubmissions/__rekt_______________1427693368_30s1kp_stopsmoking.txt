The trifecta

Ok kids, here we go. I am going to do the trifecta. Quitting smoking, nofap, and cutting out all junk/fast food. All 3 of these vices have consumed me for most of my life. I have been smoking for 3 years with endless unsuccessful quit attempts. Whenever I would try to quit smoking, I would then turn to binge eating and try to rationalize eating that way, but then I would feel bad about myself for eating so much that I would end up right back into smoking. I have also fapped excessively and that one needs to go too, as it has been a large source of depression and anxiety in my life. I know that quitting all 3 at once will be difficult, but as I have done before, I don't want to just replace one addiction with more of another. So anywho, I am going to knock out all 3, once and for all.

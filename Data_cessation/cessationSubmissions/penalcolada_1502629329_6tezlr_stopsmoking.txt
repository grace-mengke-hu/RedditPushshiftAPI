I think I've ruined Alan Carr for myself. Looking for advice.

29m, 15 years in the trap. 

The first time I listened to the EasyWay audiobook, it was a revelation and I successfully quit for several months. Fell back into the trap while drinking on my birthday with friends who smoke. 

I listened to the book again, stopped smoking for a week. I tried a 3rd time. Didn't last 2 days. It's been close to 2 years since then and, though I've started the book over a dozen times, I haven't finished it once. 

The words make sense but they no longer have the impact on me that they once did. I wish I could forget ever having experienced the book so I could hear it all again for the first time. Part of me is so desperate to feel that clarity and optimism.

Have any of you experienced this with Carr's method? Did you ever get your mojo back and, if you did, how did you pull it together?

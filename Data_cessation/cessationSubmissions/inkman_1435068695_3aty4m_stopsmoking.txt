Wow, /r/stopsmoking got mad. Maybe this will help.

Things I've learned in the last 24 hours:

1)  Quitting nicotine, quitting smoking, and quitting tobacco are all very different.  There are people from all three groups here.  These groups have different needs.  It's important to respect all three.  I myself need to work on this.

2)  "Quit" can mean a lot of different things.  It does not always mean nicotine cessation.

3)  Nobody knows the best way to do this.  It's very difficult, and sometimes it hurts really bad.  It's no wonder we lash out sometimes.  You're all a bunch of jerks.  ;) [kidding]

25 days and finally feeling results :)

In the throws of my addiction, at my worst, I never thought I'd make it this far.  Now I can't imagine living any other way! I'm finally breathing better, my sinuses are clearing up a bit, and I find myself taking deeper breaths, smelling things I didn't smell before, and in general my outlook has just become significantly more positive! 

I'm no longer using my eCigarette at all, and don't feel the need to.  I feel so free, and when I see my friends smoking, I mostly just feel sorry that they haven't been able to get out of the habit yet (though I don't push them, I'm not that kind of person).  I'm jogging or walking my dogs every day, and look forward to even bigger health benefits over the coming months!

For all of you struggling...stay strong, it's so worth it! Eat well, exercise a little bit every day, pick up a hobby, change your life! Quitting didn't just change me physically, it's changing me mentally, and for the better :) On the days you're feeling down, look at yourself in the mirror, and just say positive things.  "I can do this", "I look nice today", "I'm worth every bit of happiness in the world".  It sounds silly, but for someone who has suffered from deep bouts of depression, I can tell you that this was one of the most effective tools in my arsenal for not only quitting the habit, but for finding a way to live a happier life without cigarettes.

Thank you for all the support on this page, and I look forward to reading all of your posts of victory in the future!

Slight but important revelation

OK, I'm a textbook non-starter. Been telling friends and family for about a year that I'm "going to quit soon", like a warning. I've been reading Allen Carr's book and telling people this is it, this book is amazing and I'm GOING to quit. I'm rapidly approaching the final chapter and becoming anxious about the quit day.

However it hit me about 45 minutes ago that, as sick as I am of cigarettes, I am even more sick of agonizing **about** quitting. To quote a modern philosopher and wordsmith: "Git 'er dun"

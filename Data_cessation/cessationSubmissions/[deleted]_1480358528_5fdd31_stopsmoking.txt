I Didn't Realize How Much Fear Smoking Caused

Only on Day 4, but as I sit here (goofing off) at work, I noticed something interesting- I'm not as paranoid, terrified, anxious, worried or stressed out as I used to be. 

Not only did cigarettes literally cause those feelings, but I'm realizing all of the hiding, sneaking, covering-up and being afraid of getting "caught" I put myself through:

* Couldn't smoke on my apartment's property. Did anyway on my porch with a fan on exhaust in the porch window and a can of deodorizer next to it.  I was always in a state of fear that a neighbor would complain or the landlord would unexpectedly pop up.  I've had several close calls and they were the kind where your heart ended up in your toes.
* I practically hosed myself down with perfume everyday.  And not the cheap stuff.  I was always scared my customers would smell smoke on me.
* I smoked out the back door at work.  I was always running around with a can of air freshener because the smoke smell not only clung to me, but it came back inside with me.  I used to worry that either a customer would smell it or the bosses would smell it and I'd get accused of smoking indoors, which was not true.
* I think I developed a mild case of OCD regarding the extinguishing and disposal of cigarette butts.  Constantly checking to make sure the ashtray was dumped into the toilet and that nothing was still lit or smoldering.  Oh and when I'd fling one out my car window and then freak out, wondering if it blew back into the car.
* Monitoring how many cigarettes I had left, if they were enough to get me until the next morning when the stores opened, etc.  Even if I knew I had "enough", I always worried that it still wouldn't be enough.
* That "oh shit!!!" feeling if I left my cigarettes or lighters at home.  I think I have a mental map of all gas stations in a 50 mile radius.

I can't believe I lived like that for so long...

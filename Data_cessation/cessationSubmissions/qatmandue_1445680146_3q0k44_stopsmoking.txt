I'm struggling

It's been 2 days, but 2 months on chantix. This is the third time doing chantix but this time, it's different. 

The RX seems to be less powerful than it was the last two times... The pill is now free and white compared to the previous blue pill.

Anyone know the difference between the old  RX and now? Is it my imagination? I want to quit but the cravings are getting to me.

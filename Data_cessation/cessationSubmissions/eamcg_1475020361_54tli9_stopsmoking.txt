10 days in and still craving

Hello Redditers!
I'm writing this because I'm 10 days in and I'm still craving like mad and motivation is running low. The timelines I've read seem to suggest it gets easier around the 10-day mark but it seems harder if anything. Does anyone have any advice about how to break through?
Huge thanks

Sick

I had to have my wisdom teeth cut out a few days ago and the medication they gave me has made me so sick. But I can't help but smile because instead of making it worse by smoking (which I would of done a few months ago)  I'm actually resting and healing. I always smoked while I was sick and even when the doctors would tell me not to due to a surgery, I still would and it would take twice as long to recover. I am happy for so many reasons that I quit,  but today I am especially happy for that reason. If you are having a hard time quitting, don't give up. Know that you can do it. It is so hard to quit and it is so easy to make excuses to keep smoking but I promise you the cravings stop and it is so worth it.

I smoke every 1.5-2 hours and I'm about to start my first job soon, at 20 years old, I'm worried about going long hours without smoking?

I turn 20 in a week. I graduated a year ago from high school and was prescribed adderall until I found out I never had ADHD to begin with. Months of adderall misuse over the summer had me up to a 12 smokes a day. I quit adderall 2 months ago though still occasional take adderall or ritalin. I start to notice withdrawals after 3 hours.  
I'm worried about not being able to smoke since I may not have breaks for 4-6 hours at times. I hope it doesn't cause my first job to be a bad experience since I'm already anxious as it is and not smoking will increase that 10 fold along with anger and feeling spaced out. 

 Anyone have any advice or have gone through similar? Smoking was a mistake and I regret it already. I'm currently smoking less at around 7-8 a day. A part of me wants to stop right now and once I start my job in 1-2 weeks I'll feel mostly good but another part of me does not want to even attempt that :(

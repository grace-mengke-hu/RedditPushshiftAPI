Out of nicotine replacements, stressed and broke.

I'm in awful need of something cheap or free to do to stop me from getting a pack of smokes. I've been a heavy smoker for about 20 years. Ran out of nicotine five days ago. I feel like shit, and I'm so fucking insufferable that I'm trying to explain to my gf that I love her but please leave me alone for now since I dont want to hurt her by being a complete POS.

Any ideas welcome.

Slightly out of topic: why the fuck are cigarettes so much cheaper than all nicotine replacement shit out there.

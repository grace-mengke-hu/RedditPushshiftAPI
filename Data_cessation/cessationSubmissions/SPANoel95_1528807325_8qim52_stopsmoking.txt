Planning on Quitting

Hey all,

I've been lurking in this subreddit for a little while and I am planning to quit at the end of July. I know there is a strong feeling on this sub of 'it's never just one more' and that I should quit now, but I have my final exam at the end of July and I have a huge amount of work to do before my exam. Therefore I don't want to really add 'brain fog' and additional stress on top of what is already going to be the most testing part of my life, study wise, so far.

The question I have, is are there any ways to plan for quitting? Is there anything I can do to make the process easier when I do quit? I have a set day that I will quit and I want to make the process as easy as I can. Any feedback will be much appreciated. (I already have the smoke free app that I see a lot on this sub!)

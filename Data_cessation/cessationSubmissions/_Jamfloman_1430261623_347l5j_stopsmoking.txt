What're your best tips/methods to stop you from lighting up?

just found this sub, thought id check it out. been burning through a pack every day and a half or so for about 7 years. Lately I've been able to get through the week without feeling the need, or even the urge to light up sometimes by keeping myself occupied and trying to exercise. 

Then the weekend hits, and before i know it I'm drunk and surrounded by heavy smokers, thus i often cant help but be a bum. 

Anybody have some tips that maybe helped you out personally?

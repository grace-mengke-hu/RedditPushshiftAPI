My husband quit smoking. How can I support him?

The title says it all. My husband has been an on and off smoker for 20 years. I don't think his attempts to quit have lasted long. Maybe three months at the most a few years ago.

What usually happens is that he quits, is fine for three days, then gets cranky and sick because his lungs/throat are clearing. After he feels better, if he's still cranky, he will get annoyed with me or even pick a fight, then run back to smoking.

If he gets past ALL that then he'll backslide during a party, where he convinces himself he can just smoke one cigarette, then just smoke that night. OR he decides he'll only smoke when he drinks. OR whatever other excuses he comes up with. Then he starts withdrawals over and is cranky again.

I know it's a really tough thing. I think it's especially hard on him because I quit smoking over a year ago (9/11/11) and haven't looked back. To be honest, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't nearly this big a deal either. My addiction did not have nearly this much grasp on me.

We're on day 4, so he's cranky and sleeping in the bedroom. The kids have already annoyed him (the TV was too loud). I want to support him, but I also don't want to be a punching bag LONG term. 

He's quitting cold turkey. 

Any pointers are welcome. I was a cranky bitch for about a while when I quit smoking and he put up with me. I want to do the same for him.

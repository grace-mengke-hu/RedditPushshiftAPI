Two weeks... all of my warmth and personal charm is being unleashed.

Two weeks... and I've only made my fiance and my mom cry once. 

I've also only sworn and meant it HARD at co-workers or colleagues twice. On two separate occasions: I told the engineer who refused to listen that he could go have his tanty in his office and get the fuck out of mine. He did. I also told an unreasonable salesperson to suck my farts. Fortunately for all involved, he did not.

Remarkably, I'm still employed despite four flagrant incidences where I just didn't give a fuck. My boss ... I don't know. Maybe the write-up is in the works. My boss hasn't appreciated assertiveness in the past, maybe Boss just ignores outright aggression. I don't care, I'm prepared to eat dirt for the next few years if it means I get to preserve my sanity.

My landlord is next in line. I tried being nice. He's treated us well enough but his complacency and indifference chafes me. 

My crave episodes declined after I started expressing how I felt to people. Granted, I need to be more tactful, build more of a tolerance for the everyday annoyances that are a part of interacting with people... but I feel good. I feel good and fuck you. I don't know if this attitude is something new or just was repressed by vaping but I hope it goes away.

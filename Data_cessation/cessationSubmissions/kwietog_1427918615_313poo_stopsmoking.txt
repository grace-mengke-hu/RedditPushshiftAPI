Day 2, new challenge!

Finally I got into this. After my friend who smoked for 15 years suddenly stopped and is not smoking for 6 months already, I decided to do it as well. Started at 14, pretty much from 16-17 I've been smoking daily. Now, I'm 22 in May, so wish me strong will and a month smoke free for my birthday.

About the pic: Sober January was a huge success, so I've accepted new challenge today. 31/03 around 2-3am I had the last cigarette and make this note.

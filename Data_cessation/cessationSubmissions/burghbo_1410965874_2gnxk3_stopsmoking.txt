Had my last cigarette exactly one year ago

I have been lurking this subreddit for a year now. I have been amzazed at the strength and inspiration of the people here. For what it's worth, here is my story.

I remember sitting on my couch last year, just about to get up and have a cigarette outside, as I was talking (or them actually talking to me) to my two daughters (3yr old and 5yr old). They had just watched some princess movie and they were going on and on about how they were princesses too and I was the King and mommy was the Queen. I was just "uh huh", "ok honey", nodding my head just waiting for a moment I could dash out to have my smoke. The older one was telling me how her wedding to the prince was going to be and how i had to walk her down the aisle. At that very moment, I realized that I may not make it to their weddings if I continued to smoke. After 30 years of smoking, it was that moment that I quit.

The first few days were actually pretty easy. The determination I had (thinking of my girls growing up) was the driving force that overcame my addiction. However, a week in things got harder. That devil on my shoulder kept whispering, "Oh...just have one. One won't hurt." But, I have tried many times in the past and knew this wasnt true. I've quit for months at a time before and as always, that "one" was the one that hurt the most.

I struggled for the next week with it. Still craved a smoke every hour or so. My wife and family put up with my shitty moods. I didnt have a drink the whole time, knowing that would just make it that much worse. Many nights I sat eating a bag of chips watching our shows. My wife udnerstood my pain, she having quit four times for 9 months at a time, if you know what i mean. However, she continued to smoke, albeit outside out of respect for my state. 

Then one day, about two weeks in, everything changed. The cravings subsided. The moods got better. I even got a bit tipsy on a Friday night. That was a big breakthrough for me. Having some drinks without the smoking. Oh, I craved the cigarettes that night but I purposely drank a bit much that night to see how mentally prepared I was to stop the smoking. I won.

Since that first month, I completely conquered cigarettes. So much so, I had no problems with my wife's smoking. Even our Friday night game night with family, I had no problem with people smoking (windows open with fan). Truth be told, I did buy  some disposable e-cig for the next few months to help me through stressful moments but honestly, one e-cig lasted me a month. It was just a few puffs here and there. We went on vacation a couple of months ago and the kids were wearing on me and my wife bought me another e-cig. I still puff on that same e-cig here and there. Same e-cig for two months; pretty good if you ask me.

So, TL;DR, I am 45 years old and smoked for 30 years I quit cold turkey (more or less). Here are some tips/notes for those of you still struggling. I hope something strikes a chord for you.

- Your will is stronger than your addiction
- Don't listen to the naysayers, e-cigarettes are a great tool for quitting. Although I puff on one once in a while, I am only on my 4th one ever. My wife has since quit cigarettes but does smoke e-cigs. She is at seven months now (not pregnant this time) and still smokes the e-cigarettes regularly. 
- Didnt get bad coughs this time like previous attempts.
- I did have breathing problems though from the 3rd month to the 8th month or so. It was when i was breathing heavy (for what ever reason). I was hyperventilating. I am pretty sure this is from the oxygen levels going up in my blood and I wasnt used to it. A couple of years ago I was at the doctor and my oxygen level was around 90. I tested again a few months ago, it was at 96.
- I still love the smell of second hand smoke but cant stand the smell of it on someone.
- I gained 30+ pounds and 2-4 inches on my waist
- I challenged myself. Smoky bar. Hanging with the guys. Drunk nights. It gets easier each time. (the smoking...not drinking lol)
- I was also saving the $6 a day that i didnt buy a pack in a little hiding space. Had almost $500 saved up until my wife discovered it. Of course, we "needed" it for something.
- I kept that opened half a pack of Marlboros next to my keys for six months as temptation that I didnt give into (though I wouldnt suggest trying that)

I have been asked many times by people who ask me how i did it. I tell them all the same thing. The first thing is, you have got to "want" to quit smoking. You have to be at the point of absolutely wanting to quit and not just because its the healthy thing to do. I have tried quitting those times when I was sick and although I could last a few days, I always went back because I enjoyed it. The point is, if you truly want to quit like I did, once you are past the physcial addiction (doctors say a week...i say a month), the habit is so much easier to break.

6 months! I feel great again. But...dreams?

So I quit with the help of a vaporizer which I've been off for maybe two months now.  It's awesome.  I did gain about 10lbs since then with no change in diet or exercise but that's better than continuing to smoke.

What worries me is these damn dreams I'm getting. Almost every night I dream I break down and smoke.  Is that common?

No longer playing with butts

Ok, just had my last cig. Feel grateful it's over. I never want to have another butt in my hands. After 29 years, I  was never this determined before. Everyday leading up to this last one, I have had negative self talk about cigs and positive self talk to myself about being free of this since I decided on my birthday back in July. It's my birthday gift to me. 
I'm grateful for r/stopsmoking for being here.

3 WEEKS QUITBROS. LETS FUCKING GO.

Sorry for the caps, BUT I'M FUCKING EXCITED.

I have now drank and not smoked, been around smokers and not smoked, been drunk around smokers and not smoked, had stress and not smoked, had sex and not smoked, had stressful sex and not smoked, had sex with a cigarette and not smoked (that one might have been a dream).

I'm not saying I'm completely out of the woods yet, but I'm doing good and feeling great. I've started running and eating better to try to avoid the weightgain that supposedly comes with quitting and I'm holding it off for the time being. 

Also, I'm not sure what this is a function of, but I'm pooping a lot less than I was and I like it.

I love you guys.

1 year!

Just had to make a celebratory post commemorating my 1 year mark.

First smoked a cig when I was 12 years old!  Was smoking every day by age 14.  Shortly after my 30th birthday I finally decided I'd had enough and quit.  Used an ecig for about a week but still felt like I was addicted to nicotine and went cold turkey.

I still want one every single day.  Every evening when I'm driving home from work, and every time I drink a beer.  But I know that it's a fleeting feeling and I can overcome it.

Thanks a lot to this sub, it was really a great motivator and source of support :)

Is marijuana a viable tool when quitting?

I have seen a few people mention that smoking weed helped them with their quit on here. I had been a heavy then frequent then occasional marijuana smoker until I stopped altogether several months ago. I have been off cigs for 4 days now and am wondering if anyone has any personal experience. Thanks for any input.

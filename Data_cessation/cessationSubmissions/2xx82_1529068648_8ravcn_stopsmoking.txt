Day 7. Noticing a change in the character of cravings. The urges are becoming more clever

In the first few days after quitting, the urges were simple and brutish. They were physical. If cravings could talk, the ones from the first days would be saying "GIVE ME NICOTINE! RIGHT NOW! FUCKING GIVE ME NICOTINE RIGHT NOW!"

Today and yesterday they've been more crafty. It's been more like, "hey kid, this is about when you should light up. Remember how good it felt? Just one wouldn't hurt."

Anyone else notice this shift? Feels like this is about when I stop relying on sheer willpower alone and really get to implement some deprogramming/unbrainwashing.

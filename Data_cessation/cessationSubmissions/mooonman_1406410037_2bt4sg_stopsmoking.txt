It's not that hard guys! 14 days since last cig

Well, the first 4/5 days go by slowly and you count every single hour, but after that, time really flies! Just remember, there's nothing to lose when you quit smoking, there's only benefits. Hang tight the first few days, keep yourself busy, after that, you will occasionally think about cigarettes but you know you're not going to pick up smoking, because you'll be very proud of yourself and of what you've achieved. Reading posts on this subreddit has been very helpful, so thanks everyone!

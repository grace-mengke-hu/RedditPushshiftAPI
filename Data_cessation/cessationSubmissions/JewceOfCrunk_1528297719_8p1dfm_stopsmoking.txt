Here we go

So this will be attempt number who knows after many failed tries of quitting smoking for myself. To be fair most of those have been half hearted with little effort but the few I’ve focused and made an effort for I usually would make some progress.

This time though I am done. I am sick and know it wouldn’t be nearly as bad with lungs filling and damaged by smoking for the past 10 years (holy crap I can’t believe it’s been that long). I also look at my daughters and feel guilty for possibly cutting them short or possibly being an influence on them later in life, especially since they are sick as well right now and I wonder how much third hand smoke they are effected by even though it i try to minimize it as much as possible.

My biggest problem in the past was any time I would drink I would tend to break and wake up with a pack or a hangover that left me with no energy to fight a craving. Not that I’ve ever had a drinking problem but that shouldn’t be a problem as I have not been drinking for a couple of months and don’t plan to until I feel I have my cravings under control. Even then it won’t be too much to the point of letting my cravings get the best of me, or so I hope.

I plan to go cold turkey with no nicotine replacement but if that fails this time then I will definitely transition to a new plan. I do have the smoke free app and have done much reading thanks to lurking this sub so I think I am mentally prepared this time.

So here I go, wish me luck, and thanks for all the help preparing me to this point.

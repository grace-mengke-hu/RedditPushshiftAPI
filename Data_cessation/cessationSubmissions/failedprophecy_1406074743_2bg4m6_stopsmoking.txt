How do you deal with smoker friends?

I've quit smoking and I accept that in order to maintain this new healthy lifestyle, I will have to go on for the rest of my life without smoking anything ever again. But I don't know how or what to say to my smoker friends when they're smoking. Does anyone else feel like they are an unwanted presence around smokers who know you used to smoke?

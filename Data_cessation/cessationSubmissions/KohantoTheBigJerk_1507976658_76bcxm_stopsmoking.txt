I smoked for 10 years and quit 2 weeks ago, honestly it's thanks to you guys.

From when I was 14 until 24 on and off, mostly on. (I was not a smart kid)

I had no idea who Allen Carr was so thank you guys for turning my attention to his book, which helped a ton. Reading everyone's comments on here helps make the time tick away that much faster and kept me motivated. So thanks everybody, the battle isn't over but I feel like I've won.

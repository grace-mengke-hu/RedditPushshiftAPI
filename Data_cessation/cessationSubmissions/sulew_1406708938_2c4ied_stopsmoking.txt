I am an emotional wreck.

In the last 24 hours I have been through a whole range of emotions, but mainly I have just been angry. A big angry non smoker who just wants to smoke. Why is this so difficult? 

Yesterday I was very close to bursting into tears, I had to walk out of the office at one point and go get some actual fresh air. I was in a supermarket and spent 10 minutes walking back and forth to the cigarette counter. I must of looked like a loon (but at least a loon who doesn't smoke, right?) Then I got angry, real angry, an emotion that didn't disappear in my sleep and today I am just the same and I am about ready to hit someone in the face. 

Also is it just me or does your health seem worse since you quit? It's not even been 7 days, please tell me it gets better than this. 

TL;DR I am an angry person.

Struggling!!!

Holidays are a tough time for me!!! I stopped drinking Thanksgiving weekend and a few days later I stopped smoking cigs. This is my millionth time quitting of course but this time I want it to be for real. It's been two full weeks for me and I'm super emotional thinking very seriously about buying a pack and just having one cig today and keeping the pack for emergencies (mainly Christmas Day which can be a hard day for me). I know it's a terrible idea but aaaaaaggghhhh!!!! Lol. Thanks for listening

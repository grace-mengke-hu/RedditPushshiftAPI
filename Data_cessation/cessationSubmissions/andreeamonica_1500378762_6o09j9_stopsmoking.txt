Stopped smoking for the millionth time (long post)

Hi everyone,

Today I quit smoking AGAIN, as I am trying to do this for the last 5 years. It's been a long process and I keep on failing at becoming a non smoker. I get easily tempted, since I live with a smoker and I find myself all of a sudden in a shop buying a pack of cigs, even if I woke up feeling disgusted by them, hating the way they make me feel (dizzy, stomach pain, low energy, bad breath, indisposed, etc.). 
I tried Allen Carr's "easy" way to stop smoking, I failed, at the first party I attended I smoked almost one pack in 4 hours. Then I tried cold turkey method, I tried the "just 2 each morning with coffee" method, and many others, and I always end up in the same place.
Of course, seeing that I keep on trying and failing, it makes me hate myself for being so weak. I discovered this community through an app, I thought I never tried this method yet, and I really hope this time I'll succeed. If you have any tips & tricks, I'd be more than happy to read them.

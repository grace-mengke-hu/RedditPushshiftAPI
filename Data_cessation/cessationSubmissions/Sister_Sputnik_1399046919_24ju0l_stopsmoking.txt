This is my bazillionth day one! I hope I never see another. I could use some support and advice with my biggest challenge...

So, I smoke like a complete idiot, in that I don't do it every day. I think I'm a binge-smoker. I go days, even weeks -- even months -- without smoking. Then I'll smoke my head off if I'm working on a project or hanging out with friends who are smoking (especially if we're all drinking). It's hard for me to take my "day ones" or "day fives" seriously, because I see a lot of those. I guess I won't be too impressed with myself until my badge says 1 month. I think seeing that badge change will be a great touchstone for me.

The biggest challenge I have right now is that my best friend moved into my house for a couple months while she gets on her feet. Every afternoon, when she gets home from work, she sits on my patio until bedtime, with a couple bottles of wine (yes, a definitely wine problem here) and a pack of cigarettes -- and I go out and join her a 2-3 times a week, and we end up gabbing and smoking all night. Then the next morning, I want to hit my head against the wall all day for giving in. 

The days that I don't go out, I tend to hide in my room or pretend to be working on something. She'll usually try to come up with a reason I need to go outside to talk to her, "Can you come out here for just 2 minutes? I just want to ask you something..."

How do I even begin to navigate this?

My plan right now, since it's been so gorgeous out, is to find something to do when I'm outside with her -- water the plants, repot some stuff, brush the dog... Any other ideas or just some back up and support would be gratefully appreciated!

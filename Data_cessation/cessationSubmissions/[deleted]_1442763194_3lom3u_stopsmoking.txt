I little bit of encouragement from someone who just couldn't quit.

I am 26M and had been smoking cigarettes since I was 18. My fiancee whom I had met only a few short months after I started smoking had been asking me to quit for a very long time.

I cannot tell you how many times I said 'Baby i'm going to quit.' And I would.... for a week, a month maybe. I think at one point I actually quit for almost two months. 

But I would always start again, for some reason or another.

Then one day I just decided, for myself, that I wanted to quit. I no longer wanted to smoke. And that was it. It was that easy. I haven't smoked since.

I say all that to say, You cannot quit for someone else. You cannot quit to save money, And you cannot quit because it's unhealthy.

Those can all be reasons why you want to quit. But you have to have the desire to quit yourself. Just because you don't want to smoke anymore...

I know it sounds so 'Easy' but honestly. It was that easy for me. I know it won't work that way for everyone. But I just thought I'd finally share my quit story with /r/stopsmoking.

Keep your heads up, and quit for yourself.

Here we go, day 1.

Hi guys!

I've been subbed here for about 8 months now, and every single one of the posts has worn down my resolve to smoke gradually. I finally read the Allen Carr book that's gospel in these parts. I got to the last few pages where he says if you're still unsure to go back and re-read. So I did. I was still unsure and full of doubt.

So I thought "fuck it", threw my freshly purchased pouch of tobacco and what turned out to be an alarming amount of filters and rizlas in the bin last night. I kind of feel like this is cheating as I'm now 10 hours in and all I've done is slept. As Carr says, if I'd gone 10 hours in the course of the day I'd have definitely caved by now.

Sorry for the stream-of-consciousness style rambling, just felt I should introduce myself a little. 

To cigarettes - fuck you man, you suck.

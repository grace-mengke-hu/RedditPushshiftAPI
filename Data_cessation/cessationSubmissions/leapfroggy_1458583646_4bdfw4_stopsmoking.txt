10th-ish attempt at quitting, and I am miserable.

Hey everyone. I was a member of this sub a couple of attempts ago and had quit for 4 months, so I unsubscribed because I felt I didn't really need it anymore. I'm a week into a new attempt, and came back for some much-needed encouragement.

The posts about how miserable the first few days/weeks can be were the most helpful, so I thought I'd share:

I'm an emotional wreck... I have gut-wrenching cravings when I wake up, get in the car, after I eat, leave work, etc... I want to kill everything. I even cried today because I wanted to smoke so badly--at work, in front of everyone. 

Quitting does not feel like an accomplishment. It very much still feels like a loss. However, I know it is just the addiction making me feel that way--it is not the way I truly feel. Deep down I am optimistic and cant wait until the fog lifts and I feel free! 

So, if you're having a day like I am having, get through the moment and roll with the punches. I'm gonna go back to ignoring my murderous thoughts and annihilating some lollipops now.

I quit smoking at 9:24 PM last night. That last cigarette went out at that hour.

Today, July the 5th of 2014 is the beginning now of the first 24 hours QUIT of those damn cigarettes. I am still sort of nervous.

 I am really shoring up my courage to stay QUIT and NOT to even think of buying ANY new pack come 7AM in the morning when I go to the store.

They say being nervous is one of the side effects of quitting. I hope that this is not going to be as hard as I wonder if it really is. I knew last time I had tried and failed was it had been really hard then.

That is right, Mindset. That is what is helping me out with some Nicorette Gum.I am thinking in terms of WILL, Not Try."TRY" leads more often than not to failure. When you think "WILL, this means that you bear a higher "chance" of ACTUALLY succeeding!

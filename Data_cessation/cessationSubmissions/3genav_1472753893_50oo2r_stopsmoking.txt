So I caved last night.....

Was drinking with some friends, and someone offered me a cigarette. Seeing as this was my first one for about a month, and I felt that I could handle it, I took it..............and I hated it.

I seriously don't know how I managed to smoke half a pack of these things a day. I couldn't even finish it, it tasted so bad. 

Yes, I failed at the whole "never smoking again" thing, but the way I see it is it just reinforced why I wanted to quit and made me remember how gross these are.

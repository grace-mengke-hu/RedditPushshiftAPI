My Third attempt is going by without a sweat

The first two times I didn't really want to stop that was the problem. This time I legitimately HATE the cigarettes. I HATE how they make me feel, I HATE how they smell, and I HATE the ball and chain it drops around your ankles. When you can finally see through the Stockholm syndrome you've put yourself in it becomes clear that its nothing you want anymore.

Easy technique to stop cravings

I've created a free video course of a technique I used to stop my cravings 3 years ago.

This is a course I'm going to be giving away in exchange for people's emails eventually so I can sell them my stop smoking course once its all done.

You can download it for free here without opting into my email list.

It's a pretty simple technique to master.  Let me know how this works out for you.

Any advice on how to better structure it or improve it would be awesome!

Good luck!

Relapsed after 21 days

I was smoke free for 21 days and relapsed yesterday when I went out with friends for drinks. I controlled myself pretty well while I was drinking, but bummed one before going home. In the morning today, I smoked another one. I learnt my lesson and am quitting drinking now as well. I am confident that I can remain smoke free as I've never stayed smoke free for more than 3 days before. This experience taught me a lot and I am sure i will win this time. Wish me luck.

Just hit 4 week!

Smoked for 6 years (22 now), and this is the third longest amount of time I've ever gone without the smokes. And as opposed to the other times, I'm feeling really good about this one due to reading Allen Carr's book and browsing this subreddit. The one thing that did it in for me was realizing that at least over half my time spent smoking, I was constantly in a state of worrying about cigs ruining me long term and half-ass trying to quit and decided enough was enough. No more addiction, it's a bullshit way to live. Feels good to be free!

9 days, 12 hours and 20 odd minutes down.

So, since it started i've been smoking 20 cigs a day maybe more, due to the fact i smoked roll ups as they are cheaper that real ones. My drive to work is an hour long and was an excuse to cram three fags in on the way, and well. I ended up in a routine like a finely oiled machine. anyway  I decided to stop smoking after a long while of umming and arring. I don't really know what caused me to decide to quit but it's been one of the best decisions of my life so far. I've spent the last three years hiding it from my family that I was a smoker, thinking about it, I had so much guilt hiding it but in the back of my mind, no matter how hard i tried to mask my habit. They all definitely knew. I had been given an e-cig months ago and i always thought it to be a bit of a novelty with flashy lights and different flavours, but anyway I gave the e-cig a proper go. i had also downloaded an iOS app too. all i had to do was input how much I smoked and how much a packets of cigs cost me, how long i've been a smoker for. There have been times i've felt like giving up during the first few days but i think i'm coming to terms with it. i'm aiming to pack the e-cig in soon. i've never heard of Allen Carr or his book. I don't know if this is an American but the only Allan Carr i know is a comedian who wears glasses aha. I've found myself on numerous occasions looking at this app every time I have a craving. seeing that in 9 days i've saved Â£30 already is astonishing. I know that it is all down to me and for the first time in twenty years I need to pull myself together, get some willpower and beat this. i had tried quitting so many times before and crashed and burned within hours of quitting.  So here's to a smoke free life at the end of it.

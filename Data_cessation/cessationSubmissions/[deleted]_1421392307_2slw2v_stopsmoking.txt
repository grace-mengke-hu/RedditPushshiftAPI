Please help

I'm 20 years old and I've been smoking for 2 years. I know this is not as bad as most people on this subreddit but I still need some help as the addiction is just as strong. I'm not really sure what I'm asking in the post except for some positive reinforcement as I try to quit. I've been doing better lately (I was smoking a pack a day and today I've smoked 3 cigarettes. Basically I really need some suggestions on how to quit. Thanks to everyone in advance that helps on this long hard journey

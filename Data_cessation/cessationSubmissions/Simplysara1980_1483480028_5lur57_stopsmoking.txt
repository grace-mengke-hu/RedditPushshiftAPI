Actually easy?

This is the 2nd REAL attempt at quitting after a pack a day for 20 years. The first attempt was brutal and I didn't make it past 4 days. This time I expected a very difficult go, with plenty of fixation, but I'm on day 16 and have had very little trouble with the exception of a random craving. I'm so worried I'll just bottom out, out of nowhere, on something crazy like day 40. Has anyone else's quit actually been EASIER than they expected to the point it worried you?

Was prepared for day 3....

Not so much for day 4 &5. 

I heard the days to watch for were 3,7,14,21, and end of month 3. I knew all days would be tough, but those were the ones I was expecting to have to fight for it.   Day 3 came- I was prepared, had my battle gear on. Got through day 3 like a fucking warrior

Then day 4 came.. then day 5...  both were worse than day 3.  My badge says day 5 and it's correct. I haven't caved, I won't cave, but now I will be smarter.  It's an everyday thing, every day will be hard.

My boyfriend is a trigger, need advice.

I've been a smoker for about 3 years and am currently on day 3 of no smoking. This was a complete impromptu decision to quit. I went on a weekend trip with my family and did not even realize I wasn't smoking until I got home this morning. My plan upon getting back home was to go buy a pack when I thought to myself "its already been three days, maybe this is a good time to quit for good." As soon as I got home the cravings hit hard, unbearably so. It was like as soon as I told myself I wasnt going to have any more, my body suddenly craved them. I did some research and found that craving intensity is highest 3-5 days post quitting. It also said to figure out and avoid triggers.

So here is my problem. My boyfriend smokes in his apartment. He is an "ease into or out of things" kind of person while I am an impulsive "jump all in" individual. This means that he is quitting by cutting back, I'm going cold turkey. He said he will stop smoking in the apartment when I come over. But he is a trigger. Sitting in his apartment is a trigger whether he is smoking or not. That's, unfortunately, what we do: hang out and smoke and watch netflix or go out for a walk by the beach and smoke. Any advice on how to deal with this? I'm so on edge I feel like you can read the irritation in my text. I don't want to not see him but I don't want to take my irritation out on him either.

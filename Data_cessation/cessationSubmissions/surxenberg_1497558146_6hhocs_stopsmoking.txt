Day 12 and this is easy... very easy.

It really, truly, actually does get easier day by day.

Yes, it was terrible during the first few days, but, in hindsight, not that bad. Yes, I was agitated, yes, I felt bad, but no worse than a stomach virus.

The worst seems to be over after 2 weeks. I can only leave this message to any smoker out there:

Yes, the first 3-5 days are kind of awful. But it does get better, and at a very, very rapid pace. 3-5 days of suffering (which, once through, you won't even remember as being that bad) are sooooo worth it. do it. right here, right now.

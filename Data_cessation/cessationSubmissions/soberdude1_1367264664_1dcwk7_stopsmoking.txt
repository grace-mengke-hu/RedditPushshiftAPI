Withdrawal and Cravings!!

I see posts from people who are having a hard time with cravings and withdrawal. The first 100 times I quit and failed I did also. This time was so different. I read Allan Carrs book "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" and this time was so different. When I was finished with the book, I just became a non-smoker. I had no cravings, no withdrawal, NOTHING! I very highly recommend this book. I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 40 years. This time I quit, like I turned off a switch. If you think you're having cravings and withdrawal, read this book! Quit on the truth!

Random post. 512 freaking days.

I still can't believe I'm doing it still and making it happen. One day at a time folks. One day at a time...if I'm being honest with myself, I still want a cigg sometimes. I still crave them if I catch the wiff of a freshly lit Camel...Maybe if I make it to 70, I'll start smoking again :) Hah! No but seriously, the bummer of it is though, I feel literally no change in my body. I may have gained a pound or two as some do, but food taste the same, I have the same lung capacity, I still get winded during the same exercises etc. Gotta say, I feel a bit robbed 512 days into this experiment lol. Thought I would be feeling a lot healthier, and "tasting" food better. I dunno. Anyway what keeps me going is my 2 kids. Find what keeps you waking up in the morning, and make that the reason to quit, or keep going. Stay strong out there folks. I believe in you.

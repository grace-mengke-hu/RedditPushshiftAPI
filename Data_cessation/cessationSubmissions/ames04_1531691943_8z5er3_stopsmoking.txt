Day 8 and worried about the week ahead.

So I’m 8 smoke free. This is the longest I’ve been smoke free since first starting around 5 years ago!  I’m really proud of the achievement so far. However I’m worried about the week ahead. 

I’m still trying to get used to not smoking at work. I felt like my day was broken up with smoke breaks so now I’m sometimes there like what to do? I’m hoping with a bit of time I’ll be more productive!!!

Anyways, on Thursday I’ve got a work event in the evening. I’ve avoided alcohol this first week because I know I smoke way more after a wine or 4! But I’m not sure how Thursday will go. There’s gonna be about 15 of us out and around 5/6 of them smoke. We’re gonna be out for food n drinks and there will be countless trips outside and I’m scared that I’ll have a drink and then be craving like mad!!

I’m thinking to not drink so I stay focus but I also don’t want to be the only person not having a drink. Has anyone got any suggestions how they’ve handled not smoking when out/drinking??

Thanks guys!!

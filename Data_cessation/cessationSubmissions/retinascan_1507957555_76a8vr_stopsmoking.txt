Went to my goto bar tonight

First time being around smokers since in stopped smoking. These are smokers I would smoke with every Friday. The place has a running poker game, smoking indoors, and oldies music. 

Am I describing what would be the equivalent of heaven in a non-smoking town? It was. 

So I got there, brought some jolly rancher suckers in case. 

I usually drink beer but I switched up since I quit to vodka tonic. Got my tall v&amp;t. Sat down and talked to some friends. I’d usually light up almost instantly when I walked into the place. 

Happy to say that I had no cigarettes tonight and no second hand smoke because I didn’t go near the smokers area. 

Did I get some second hand? Probably but it wasn’t intentional and I don’t actually recall it. 

This was mostly a test for me. I won this time and that only makes me stronger. 

Now I’m home and eating some delicious McDonald’s before bed. 

Good night and good luck!

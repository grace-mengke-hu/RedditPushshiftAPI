Should I count myself cheating and re-count my smoking-free days counting?

Hi all, getting into my third weeks here being some-free. Tho', I had to admit, two days ago, I met some friends, smokers, who insisted to have a chat for our somewhat reunion occasion at smoking room. I felt like I wanted to escape but it would be real rude so I stay. I didn't smoke, tho the temptation was so huge as might many of you know.

After the occasion ended, we all went back home and on the next morning, I felt this sensation of my breath felt like I just had smoke. Not only in my breath, but I could almost feel it in my mouth, you know like the taste of cigar and everything. Also for the dizziness and light-head. I can't recall how I felt at night because I was too tired, but feeling that way in the morning makes doubt if I were really strict of being smoke-free. I didn't smoke, but I got exposure on approximately on the same amount of smoker at that night, that probably explain. But I might need second (third, or countless to be open), if I was really cheating and just need to re-count my smoking free days (as it shows in my flair). Also, do I really need to avoid such occasion of getting into a smoking-thick environment to really being smoking-free?

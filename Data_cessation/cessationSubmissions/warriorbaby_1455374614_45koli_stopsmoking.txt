nausea after quitting?

I quit about 5 days ago, but my nausea's been getting really bad. I heard that its a common withdrawal symptom, but my nausea is so bad that I can't concentrate on anything and it's hard to resist the temptation to smoke again. Has anyone experienced something similar? Any tips? Thanks :)

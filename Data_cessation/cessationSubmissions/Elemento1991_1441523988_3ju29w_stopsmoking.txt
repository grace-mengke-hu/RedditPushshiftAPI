Day 5 done, crazy insomnia. Did you guys have this?

What's up guys

I decided I was tired of being a slave to something and threw my vape cig out the window Monday. I already had some insomnia before but now it's aweful. My job is labor intensive and I worked about 50 hours this week and was in 85 degree weather all day for 13 hours Wednesday and still only slept for four hours. 

This morning (technically yesterday) I got up at six am, worked on the house until about 9-10 pm, with a few little breaks in there and am still up at 5 am and can't sleep. I'm super sore and exhausted but can't get a full nights rest to save my life. 

Did you guys suffer from insomnia, how long did it last?

Bad breath after I quit smoking. Had anyone else experienced this?

Hey guys! So I quit smoking cigarettes in May and since then I have noticed awful breath. It's a very strange smell I can't explain it but it's ruining my sex life and gives me anxiety when having day to day conversations with people around me. Has anyone else experienced this after quitting? Will this every go away? And how did you handle this? Thank you!!

Six Months Smoke Free

I never thought I'd get here. I tried countless times cold turkey. It didn't work for me. I had a million excuses and cheap reasons to light up a smoke. I finally tried the patch and for me, it worked. No part of me wants to smoke a cigarette. That smell. That taste. That ritual. It's all dead to me now. That feeling of going an entire day without even thinking of a cigarette has been the greatest relief of my life. I have been nicotine free for 4 months now. NRT works for some and it certainly has worked for me. Never stop quitting. I didn't, and I thank myself every day for it.

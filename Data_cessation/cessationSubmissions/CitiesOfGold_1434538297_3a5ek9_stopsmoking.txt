Any advice for GAD sufferer giving up?

Hello there, as you can tell from my title I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder around 18 months ago. At the time I had quit for 2.5 years after smoking for 16 years. I started smoking again after a bad patch around Christmas and new year. The addict bit of my brain gives me all the reasons not to quit today. "Let's use the rest of the baccy first "  "kids are ill, do it when they are better"  "it's summer, it's nice to sit outside" 

Basically the thought of quitting gives me anxiety but at the same time smoking also gives me anxiety. I have got myself stuck in a loop! Does anybody have anything useful for me? Looking forward to advice.

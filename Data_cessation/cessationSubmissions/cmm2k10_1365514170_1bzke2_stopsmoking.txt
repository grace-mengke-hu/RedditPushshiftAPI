Day #2

I am on day two of quitting smoking and putting food in my mouth instead is what I am trying not to do! I have had to consiously tell myself that I do not need the chips after dinner. UGGG.. I did go outside instead and play basketball with my 13 year old son. And not having to stop and say I am going to smoke was a nice change. I haven't told him I am trying to quit and I am not sure he even noticed. We will see how long it takes for him to realize Mom isn't smoking... :)

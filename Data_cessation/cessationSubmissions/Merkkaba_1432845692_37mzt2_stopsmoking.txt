A Gamer's Perspective

So for the past 4 days I've had these thoughts and experience points.  I play a lot of games so this might not resonate with a lot of people.  I now have added real life power ups and damage counters to the smoking habit:

* Every time I get a craving and don't smoke, I get XP.
* If I get a craving and I cave, I lose XP and get poisoned for 1 HP per turn.
* For every week I don't smoke for the first year, my stats go up.  Breathing gets better, smell, motivation, etc.
* Every year I don't smoke, I level-up.

This may seem weird or stupid,  but for the last two days the fear of losing XP has kept me from smoking.  Anyone else got any crazy stuff that helps them deal with cravings?

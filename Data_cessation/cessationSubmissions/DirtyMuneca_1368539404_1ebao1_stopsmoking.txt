Allergies ==> hardcore cravings?? anyone else?

Hey guys,
just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this, but it's primo allergy season here in NYC, and after about 75 days off nicotine and generally pretty mild cravings, I'm getting flooded with cravings the past two days, esp. in the AM, and they happen to coincide with pretty harsh allergy symptoms.  I'm getting that tingly body/head effect and that itchiness in the mouth, and my brain is like a stoge will calm this all down.  I dunno if it's just my brain confusing allergy symptoms for nic. withdrawl symptoms.  Anyone else getting similar issues or is it just me?  I'm gonna keep on keepin on, and I hope you do too.

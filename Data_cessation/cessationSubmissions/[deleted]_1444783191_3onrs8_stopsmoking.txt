72 hours cold turkey smoke free after 6 years

I decided it was time to quit. Currently 24 years old and looking forward to being a non-smoker for the rest of my 20's. I was smoking about a pack per day over the last 3 - 4 years, and it's taken enough of a toll. It's been a while coming, and I had planned for this, too. First I dropped coffee cold turkey, stopped smoking at work (but still managed in a pack per day?), and have been through enough conditioned withdrawals that I kind of knew what to expect. I know it's not over yet, but I've got the support of family and /r/stopsmoking so I'm feeling optimistic.

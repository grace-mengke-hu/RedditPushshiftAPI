Gum/oral health post quitting

Hey Y'all, 

First off thanks for taking the time to look over my post. I'm struggling to quit smoking (I'm 23 and have been smoking for 5 years) and I'm wondering how drastically gum health improves in the first few months after quitting?

Anyone see a reversal of gingivitis/mild periodontal disease post quitting. I have gingivitis despite being anal about taking care of my teeth. 

I'm going in for a deep cleaning (root planing and scaling) in two weeks and am gearing up to quit before the procedure and hope that my gums will improve in the months to come.

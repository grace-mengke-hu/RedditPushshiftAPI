Smokers always assume the solution is a cigarette

Smokers will even create problems for the cigarette to answer. 

I still catch myself mentally caught in my old ways where I'll be feeling some type of way and assume that a cigarette will fix that. 

When the relieving of nicotine withdrawal helps you associate cigarettes with a good feeling, you begin to think every bad  feeling can be solved by a cigarette. It gets to the point where it's not even bad feelings, it's whenever the thought of smoking a cigarette comes to mind. 

When you try to stop, you're creating anxiety because now all your "problems" don't have solutions. You can't answer everything with a cigarette anymore, and so many people just return to smoking. 

What would you do if you found out you had been taking medication that doesn't actually solve your medical condition? You'd stop taking it, right? 

Cigarettes don't actually make you feel better, in any way. They don't solve those cravings or urges to have a smoke. 

Whenever you feel a craving, remember that cigarettes aren't the right medicine to fix that.

Third attempt with Chantix. Permanent damage to my emotional ecosystem?

I'm on my third attempt to quit with Chantix.  It always works for at least a month or so.  It must be worth it since I do completely stop smoking for these periods of time.  I usually  start back up from a couple consecutive weekends of partying and then ppl at work will be smoking around me or things like that.  This is the first time I've sought additional support from places like this sub which sadly has offered a few strikingly somber reminders of why I'm trying to quit and my heart goes out to you who have provided those. My dad is always huffing and puffing from his COPD and it breaks my heart to imagine how difficult it must be to just get through his day. I don't want my dad to suffer.. Anyhow, I'm trying to avoid this for myself and my kids...you know the deal.  For me, Chantix just affects my dreams and this time, a little bit of gastro stuff.  Any irritability I just attribute to not smoking so that's going to happen by default.  Since the medication is obviously affecting something in my brain however, I've been wondering if repeated courses (3 in about 4 years) will have any permanent imprints on my brain chemicals like maybe some antidepressants have been rumored to do to some people. Also,  is my brain even really supposed to be completely intact after (after I successfully quit smoking this time) a nice long lifetime? Experiences? Thoughts?

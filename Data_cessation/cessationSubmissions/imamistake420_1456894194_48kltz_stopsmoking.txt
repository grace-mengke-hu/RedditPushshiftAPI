Almost missed my two year anniversary...

That's right!!  Two years!!

I want to say thank you to the academy, and to God, and my parents... Just messing around due to my happiness.

But seriously, this subreddit is one of the main reasons that I've accomplished what I have so far.

Thanks for all the support, and the best of results to everyone reading this.

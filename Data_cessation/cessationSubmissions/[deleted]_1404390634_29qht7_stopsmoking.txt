Lucky day 77 ...

So, today is day 77. I still have cravings though they are clearly not as intense. I took Chantix for awhile then took myself off of it.

If you take Chantix and have a history of depression/anxiety/psychosis I HIGHLY recommend you be very careful and follow your doctor's advice. DO NOT self medicate nor take yourself off it without a doctor's approval and guidance. You have to be weened off. Taking yourself off it too quickly can lead to serious mental problems. I ended up in a psych ward because of my not following the doctor's instructions.

A lot of people will say, "Look! Proof Chantix is ebil!!" Trust me. It's not. It works as prescribed and it helped keep me off nicotine. I'm now 2 1/2 months free from smoking and all nicotine. The problem wasn't the pill.. the problem was me. Follow your doctor's instructions and be careful if you have a history of mental illness. You'll be fine.

In any case, I'm alive and well and smoke free.

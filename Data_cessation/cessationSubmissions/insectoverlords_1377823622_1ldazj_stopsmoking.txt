How to deal with the insomnia?

This evening (it's pretty late in UK time) marks my first whole day without smoking. The day before last I didn't have many, and seemed to suffer awful insomnia as a result. Tonight it's the same all over, just restlessness and nerves and definitely no sleep. How did you fine folks (at least those who had post-smoking insomnia) deal with it?

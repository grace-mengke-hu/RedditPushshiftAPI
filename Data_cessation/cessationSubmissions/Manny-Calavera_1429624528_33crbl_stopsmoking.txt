I'm quitting. And this time i'm serious about it.

I started smoking at 21 years of age (8 years ago) and i think it's time to take back control of my life. I smoked my last cigarrete last night, 14 hours and 5 minutes ago. I still had 2 cigarretes in the pack, but i decided to throw them away. I'm really tired of waking up with a dry mouth and throat, like if i had been eating sand in the desert, i'm tired of coughing, and i want to enjoy going to a caf√© or a restaurant without going to the front door to smoke. And i also don't want to give more money to the tobacco industry.

The bigger problem will be to always have something to keep my mind off the cigarretes. I think i'm going to install some games on my Nexus 5 to keep me entertained whenever i'm craving for a cigarrete when i'm outside. At home i have my pc and lots of games to play. I think this will help.

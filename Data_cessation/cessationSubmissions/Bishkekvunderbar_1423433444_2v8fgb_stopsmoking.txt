One month down

And it feels awesome. I've gone 31 days without smoking after a half-pack a day for ten years. To all those out there that want to quit, or are in early days, it does get easier. The physical shittiness subsides and the rage gets better every week. I feel healthier than I have in years. If I can do it you can too!

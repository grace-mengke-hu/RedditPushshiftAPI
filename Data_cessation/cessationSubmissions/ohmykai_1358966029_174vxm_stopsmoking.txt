Here goes nothing... [Day 1]

My NYE resolution to myself. To spend 2013 free of nicotine. I spent the last 23 days gearing up for this. Taking vitamins, learning new habits, reducing smoking to a minimum. This morning I woke up without a lick of nicotine in the house, all the funds in my super supportive lady's wallet, and prepared to tackle this. The hours are going by slow and my anxiety is through the roof but I've got this. I've got this.

I'm new here folks. I may need some support. I may not. Just knowing my Reddit family has my back bumps up my confidence 100 fold.

Wish me luck!

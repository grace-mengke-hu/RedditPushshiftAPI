A Round of Applause for /u/shinnytrina

Can we please have a round of applause for /u/shinnytrina. She posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2xyydb/my_biggest_wake_up_call/)  14 days ago. Today she earns her 2 week badge. As we speak she is streaking through the park (so close your eyes) trying to surpass the previous 17 day run.

I am so proud of her. Let's all show her our love.

Is using an e-cig/vape okay while trying to quit or counter-productive?

Hi there, 
I have officially made it 48 hours without smoking a cigarette which is far longer than I ever made it in the 6 years I was smoking. Wahoo! Still sucks so much! Still really wish I could smoke! But not going to cave!

Anyway, Nicotine gum has really been quite helpful when I am craving one but I have also been using a e-cig/vape about 3-4 times a day. I have promised myself and am sticking to only use them outside for a 5 minute break as a way to help with my desire for outdoor time/smoking break. I am still very cautious of e-cigs/vapes and don't really trust most of the marketing as I don't know what chemicals are in them. Obviously smoking cigarettes is incredibly bad for you as well so I am not claiming cigs are any better. However, I am worried I will just transfer my habit from cigarettes to vapes/e-cigs which I really don't want to do. Does anyone have any suggestions or experience with this?? Is it better to just bite the bullet and spend more money on more gums or is this a valid approach? Definitely think I have some sort of oral fixation as I used to smoke at times when I really didn't even want a cigarette out of habit. Any suggestions are really helpful! This subreddit has already been a huge help for me!

Tips for quitting smoking at age 16?

I'm 16 years old, 125 pounds, 5'11. I've been smoking for about a year and a half, I'm trying to quit smoking with my girlfriend who is 17. I've quit several times before, the longest time being 12 days. I relapsed due to hanging out with some friends who were smoking, and I thought smokonh a cigarette would enhance the situation. I guess one role aside from the physical addiction that keeps me hooked is the psychological addiction. I don't really play sports and I'm skinny, but I'm not weak, I just don't feel like I have anything to make me special. I am very intelligent though. I guess the addiction runs deeper than I think it does. Does anyone that has been in my situation have any tips or helpf info? I'm tired of feeling like shit all the time. My just hurts constantly and I have a smokers cough. Thanks.

Resetting after 40

I was a non-smoker for 40 days, 40 fucking days. Yesterday was the first time I drank since "quitting" and I completely underestimated the effects of alcohol on my inhibition. Back at Day 1, smoking that one cigarette is never worth it, actually kind of glad I got that out of my system...totally not worth it.

Missing the social opportunities smoking gave me - advice please?

So, I'm pretty good at dealing with cravings now, and I'm finding other ways to respond to stress that aren't smoking.

The only thing that's making me really miss smoking is the socialising opportunities it gave me. It seems like all the best conversations I had with friends was in the smoking area, and I've had a lot of interesting conversations with strangers with the opener "you got a light?". It seems like the best places in pubs and clubs are the smoking area, and it feels a bit weird to just be hanging around there when I don't smoke anymore. Most of my coworkers (and boss) smokes too, and it seemed like the best conversations happened when we went out to smoke. I miss it.

Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone else have any advice on how to get past this please?

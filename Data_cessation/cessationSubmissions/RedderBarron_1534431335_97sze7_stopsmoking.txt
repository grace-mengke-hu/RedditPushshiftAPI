1 month 13 days off cigarettes. 3 days off nicotine.

So i stopped smoking over a month ago and switched to vaping only. And a few days ago i started vaping only the zero nicotine e-juice. I've been reducing the nicotine intake over the month from 12mg to 6mg to mixing the 6mg with 0mg at 1/2 then 1/3 to wean myself off it. 

I just realized i only puffed the vape a couple times today, both times with no nicotine. 

Considering that only almost a month and a half ago i was smoking one every hour like clockwork like i had for the past 7 years, this is pretty crazy for me.

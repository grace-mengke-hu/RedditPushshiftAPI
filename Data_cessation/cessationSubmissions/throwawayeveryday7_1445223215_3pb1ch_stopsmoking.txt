I keep failing! Does this mean I don't really want to quit? Maybe I'm not ready?

Hi forum,

I've tried for a few days to quit. I've tried before but this time I feel like I am really trying and I'm still failing.

Does this mean I'm not ready? Does this mean I don't really want to quit? I don't know why I keep failing.  I just want a cigarette and I forget that I want to quit. Maybe I don't really want to quit?  

I've tried bunches of times in the past, but usually just for a day or two and then I say "nah I'll do it later."  But now I have tried for 4 days and I am still failing.  I've never tried for this long and failed.  

What does this mean? This is bad newsâ€¦.maybe I don't want to quit? I feel better when I quit though. I mean, I have withdrawal, but I feel less crappy. To be clear, I have smoked a bit (6-9 cigarettes) each day.  That is half the normal amount, or about half but not quite half (was smoking 12-14.)  But even with fewer cigarettes, I can tell that I feel better. But I'm still smoking, I'm not not smoking.  

Even though I feel better when I don't smoke. But I forget this, at least 6-9 times per day.  I've never tried this hard and I'm still failing.  Does this mean I don't want to stop really? Ok I'll stop repeating myself.

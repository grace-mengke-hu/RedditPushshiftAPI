Day 14 and I am struggling as my gums seem much worse with an e cig. Has anyone else found this?

I am on day 14. Have been using an e cig, 11mg nicotine and I puff on it whenever I want a real cig (about 10 times a day). My gums are receeding from 25 years of smoking but they seem much, much worse since I have stopped real cigs and have been using the e cig. My teeth are huge now and the bottom ones are wobbling. Know I need to stop the e cig. I could cut down on the juice strenght but I don't see the point as I will just puff on it more. Has anyone else found that there gums are worse? Am seriously desperate for a real cig as I am so worried about my teeth dropping out.. stupid or what as its the smokes that have caused this in the first place. I have tried to go cold turkey in the past but I spent the whole time crying and thinking of ways to kill myself, nicotine replacement in patches gives me horrendous nightmares, gum makes my mouth hurt to the extent that I can't eat and Champix made my behaviour really strange. I want to stop but I don't/ can't.

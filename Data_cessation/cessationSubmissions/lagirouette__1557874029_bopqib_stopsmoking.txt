1 week in

A week ago today I smoked my last cigarette. It has not been an easy week. I had a small cycling accident, saw all my family (which is not always easy tbh) and I was fighting pms (this shit can be bad!!). I felt like I deserved a cigarette with all this stress. But I did not cave. I cried a lot. Felt like shit, ate like shit, but I did not smoke. I know the fight is far from being over. Iâ€™ll probably fight all my life due to my tendency to addiction. But I know I can do this. Thank you to everybody on this sub for sharing your stories, it truly is inspiring.

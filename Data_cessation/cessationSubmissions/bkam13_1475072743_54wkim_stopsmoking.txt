Over a week smoke free!

Hey guys, I just wanted to give y'all an update on everything.

I have not smoked a cigarette in over a week. Using the QuitNow! app on Android, I learned I have avoided over 100 cigarettes in that week. Wow....

I am also feeling much better than last week. I am no longer coughing, the tightness in my chest is much better. Still some sinus drainage, but that's alright with me.

I will admit that I thought about smoking (I don't think it was a craving, but rather a random thought) and the thought disgusted me. As I walk out of work at night I pass by a place where people smoke and I smell it every night. It does nothing for me.

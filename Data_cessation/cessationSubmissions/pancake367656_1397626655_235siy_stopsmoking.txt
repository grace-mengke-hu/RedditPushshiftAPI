Need help stopping

I've been smoking for about 2 years now, hadn't thought it was a problem or became an addiction until not too long ago. I want to stop each time throwing away the pack for the day, but the very next day i always go back to buy a new one to just take one. I repeat the process as i keep throwing away packs only to need to buy one the next day just to have that one. Can I get any advice? I am always for quitting right now, but i know tomorrow i'm going to really want to go back to that corner store and buy another one.

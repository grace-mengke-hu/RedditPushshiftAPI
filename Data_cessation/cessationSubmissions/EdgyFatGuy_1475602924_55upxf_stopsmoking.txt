Stop smoking as a student

Hi i tried to stop smoking my money away several times now and it doesnt work! 
Schooldays are so stressfull and learning for class tests is exhausting af. I can calm down with a cigarette but thats the thing i want to quit.
Please help me with advices. Are there any students here with the same problems who actually made it?

Day 4 - Found a full pack in my bag

Just a funny little story. I was at work putting things in my purse and found a full unopened pack of cigarettes in my purse. I guess I had forgotten about them when I was quitting. Ended up giving them to my coworker.  

Of course I had a moment of "I could just burn through this pack and then be done with it." But I know that's a lie. It's never just one cigarette. Next thing I know I'd be flushing 50k down the toilet. 

I can't wait till these cravings die down so I can enjoy my freedom without the annoying empty feeling.

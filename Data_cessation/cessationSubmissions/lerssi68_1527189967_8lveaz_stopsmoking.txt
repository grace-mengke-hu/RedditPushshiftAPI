Resetting my badge for the last time

Yep. I have said that like 1000 times, but this time my decision is final.

I’m tired of being out of breath while not even doing anything. My girlfriend is sick and tired of our apartment smelling like smoke, although I smoke on the balcony a lot of the smoke gets in. I am also done with the feeling of having to buy a new pack while I could use the money for something much more reasonable.

The thing is, most of my quits have failed at the point I have nothing to do and I get really bored. That’s when the cravings really kick in. I could use some tips for these situations, the ”waiting for the craving to pass” -method hasn’t really been working for me...

Oh, and fuck you Philip Morris.

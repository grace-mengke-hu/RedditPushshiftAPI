2th day stopping to smoke, stuffs harder than i anticipated...(duh, i know shut up :P)

Hey reddit, as you can read in the title: second day for me. Problem is that i have been feeling like arse for the entire day. I missed the first hour of college and i can't concentrate on my assignments (making 3D models) for more that 10 minutes at a time if at all.
i guess this is normal but god damn it sucks. Not gonna let it get to me tho :).
how are you people doing?

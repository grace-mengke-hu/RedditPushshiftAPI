How this subreddit helped me build a quit smoking app

It has been over two years since my last cigarette. Like many of you, this subreddit was my best friend during those painstaking months. I can't thank you guys enough for the honesty and support that was shared over the course of my journey. As a software designer, I was inspired to use what I've learned from that experience to build QuitCharge, which launched today in the Google Play and App Store (free).

I'd love to hear what you guys think. Like I said, it's been your honesty and compassion that have helped me get this far.

Thank you friends,
Dustin
2 years and 8 months quit

*If you make it far enough in the process you'll notice a little homage I've paid to this subreddit in the trophy section ;)

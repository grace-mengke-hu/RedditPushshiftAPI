Proud of myself

After 25 years of smoking 1-2 packs a day and more attempts to quit than I care to admit, I'm a little over three weeks in and I am just proud of myself.  I've not told anyone, apart from my girl and my dad, so no one is giving me pats on the back or kudos....could care less...I'm doing this for me.

There is absolutely nothing that I am aware of to be a more illuminatingly bad idea than smoking cigarettes.

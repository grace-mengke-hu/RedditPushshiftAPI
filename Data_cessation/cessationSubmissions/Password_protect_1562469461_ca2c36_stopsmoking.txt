sniffing ashtrays and smokers. ðŸ˜®

That sounds so gross and it is... I sniff people and if I see an ashtray I sniff it ðŸ˜–
I want to check if I like the smell or not.
I hate it but continue to check every time I see someone smoking or just walking next to someone to see if they smell. If I see an ashtray I do the same but discreetly. 

Do others do this??? Is it a sign Iâ€™m being led by the cigarette monster?? I really donâ€™t like the smell and it makes me feel happy to smell it as not like it. But Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s the addiction wanting me to put the smell in my mind. I donâ€™t know ðŸ¤”  
One of my main reasons to quit was due to the smell and trying to hide it. Being embarrassed by it. 

I started at 26yo then smoked for 12 years. Im 3 weeks in since quit.  Using no nic vape and patch NRT. 
I never really been a nasal smell type of person. I donâ€™t react to smells usually but this is weird.., 
Advice please......

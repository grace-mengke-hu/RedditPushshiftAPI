I'm stopping, here's how it feels.

My strategy was to stop buying packs on the 10th of February, give myself 2 weeks where I could still accept cigarettes from friends and then cold turkey. Therefore I haven't smoked since the 24th of February.

What I'm noticing so far:
- Breaks at work are much more enjoyable since I'm not in the rush to eat drink and smoke all in 15 minutes.
- I smell good
- Stressful situations where I couldn't smoke for a while (inside, family...) are not stressful anymore
- Money (a pack never lasted me more than 48 hours)
- My teeth, I can't recall a time where I've seen then that white (I also started caring more about dental hygiene since I stopped, brush and floss everyday.)
- My car smells like roses
- Taste buds are coming back

I started caring more about my teeth on purpose to stop smoking. I've seen such a difference from almost a month of better dental care that now it feels like littiing up would ruin everything. Also, when I see a friend who still smokes, I'll ask him for a cig, shove it my mouth and play with my lighter close to it while still never lighting it. I feel it's good training to bring yourself to milliseconds from the satisfaction point, but then abandon the idea.

I had been a smoker for 3 years, started at 16. Hopefully I'll stay true to this post.

And hopefully, some of my tips will help another quiting :)

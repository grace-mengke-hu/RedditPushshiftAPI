Going to the doctor tomorrow for smoking cessation.

What can I expect? I'm a 10 year smoker, I've tried to quit a handful of times. Never made it past a month. I figured seeing a health professional would help. Told myself I'd quit before I turned 26, and my 26th birthday is the 30th. Thought I'd get in one more appointment before I'm off my parents healthcare plan.

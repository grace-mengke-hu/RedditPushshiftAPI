Accomplished a massive goal last night

Last night, after a long week in law school, I went out for a couple drinks, which always makes me nervous in terms of not smoking. I played pool at a bar which allows smoking inside and didn't ask for ONE cigarette. After a few more drinks, the cravings started to get stronger but I told myself I am going to learn to drink without smoking. 

So, I bought some really greasy fries. I'm extremely proud of myself.

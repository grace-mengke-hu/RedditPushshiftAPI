today is my 11th day of no smoking.... however my 2nd full day with no help from my stupid spray thing

So i am a little less on edge today than yesterday. I quit smoking 10 days ago... however i bought the nocorette spray thing. It does cut the edge off... it does make the cravings go away ... however it also gives you nicotine. 

I feel tremendously better than i did 10 days ago. Lots of positive changes health wise and just feeling better. But yesterday.... i tried to not take the spray at all and i had the worse cravings i could imagine. I posted here, talked to friends, my significant other, .... everything made me just want to blow up and yell...

I even went outside with my coworker and just stood close and cigarette smelled amazing... but i stayed strong....

I managed to come home smoke free and spray free.... Went to a movie... calmed down and was ok.

Today i am so much better and have less cravings... however they are still there.


I can do this .... 

especially without the spray.... soon the battle will be easier.

The big 1 month

I’m posting here to share that I have made one month being free from smoking cigarettes!! Yes, I am very proud of myself, but mostly I’m posting to give others who are in the very beginning of this journey. I would like to say to you please share how far you have gotten today, and in a months time I challenge you to post the big 1 month. You’ve got this!!

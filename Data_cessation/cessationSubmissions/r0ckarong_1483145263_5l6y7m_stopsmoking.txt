I just don't know how to put this. 2016 is a blister skinned wrist chafe of a dick bothering year.

I have been sober for more than two years. Then two weeks ago I got talking to my boss (who is awesome) and couldn't help myself smoking during the conversation because I was so damn drunk.

Then today I was reminded of a lot of the bullshit that 2016 has given the world and put myself into perspective. My wife is fucking mad at me for smoking but I told her: "I'm going to do this now, because if this years is to be remembered for fuck-shit this doesn't matter". She was annoyed but couldn't say anything because she pulled something similar with my brother last new years eve and smoked (we both quit around the same time). 

I feel bad, the thing that I do feel is that I do NOT WANT to pick this crap up as a habit ever again. Then again have you watched the news and shit? I feel like I kind of add this onto my shit for the last days of the year because I'm planning to forego it all anyway. I am good at that. I know I can stop smoking. Just why the fuck is all that political crap going on around the world affect me so much even though my life is going so well apart from it?

This shit is annoying. I am over it most of the time, but then when I get wasted and have some makebelieve "milestone" to reach I get nervous.

What can I do? I know I can beat it. I know that I have. How do I move this into an unacceptable place in my past?

Your lords bless you and a nice 2017 if you may.

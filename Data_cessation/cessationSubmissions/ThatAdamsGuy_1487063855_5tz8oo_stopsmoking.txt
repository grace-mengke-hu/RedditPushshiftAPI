A day and a half in - advice?

Tried quitting in the past, best I've done is a week and a half before going back. Think my worst times are up at uni - a good number of friends smoke and I find it hard to resist when they offer one - or I'll just ask for one. 

Any tips to deal with friends smoking and not being tempted by that?

Third day today. Gonna crack.

I really want to buy just one more pack of cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarettes to vape to cessation altogether. I'm looking for any reason to justify the purchase of another pack and I know that's the opposite of my goals here but I just love cigarettes. I don't know if I was ready to quit.

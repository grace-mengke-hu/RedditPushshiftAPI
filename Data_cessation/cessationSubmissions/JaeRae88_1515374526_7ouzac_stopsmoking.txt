Fight for your life

I have been a smoker on and off for 14 years. I’m also an RN who sees the terrible things it does to people over time. And yet I would still pick it back up. As long I didn’t do it around my son, I thought , I was fine.  And then more recently my dad died suddenly of a heart attack last April at the young age of 59. He didn’t seem sick at all, he was active , happy and  and seemed healthy. But... He was a smoker.  He told me  2 weeks before he died that he was going to quit on his 60 Birthday, which was just shy of a month away. Losing him has been the most difficult thing My family haas ever gone through. He will never have the chance to see his precious grand children who are all under the age of 4 grow up. And all at the price of smoking. I have decided to fight for my own life , and that fight includes putting down the cigarettes once and for all. I hope that my dad’s story motivates many to quit as well. We all hear these stories and think that it will never happen to us. But it most definitely can. Save yourself from yourself, put them down once and for all.

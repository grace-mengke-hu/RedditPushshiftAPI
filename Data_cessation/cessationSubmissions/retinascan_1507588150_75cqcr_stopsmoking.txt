Any tips for being around friends who smoke while drinking?

I'm at 10 days. Pretty happy about it. Last week, I went out of town and hung out with some coworkers. Had many drinks but no cigarettes. Pretty happy about that too. 

My question/request is what are your tips for when you hang out with friends who do smoke and if you're drinking at the same time.

This is really the only scenario i'm worried about. I'll have to face it sooner or later.

My first thought was to go out with just one friend who smokes occasionally (meaning he bummed smokes off me) and test my resolve. If it doesn't work or the pressure is too much, i'll back out of it.

I don't know when this might happen but I want to be ready and have a plan ready for when it does happen.

Thoughts?

And thanks for all the support.

I started qutting yesterday

Hello guy, i'm new here, i just google a reedit for people trying to quit smoking, read up the rules and decide to post this here.

Here is my short story.

I've been smoking since 2011, almost 8 years now, I've been a heavy smoker most of the time (lately a pack last me around 3 days when before it lasted me 1 single day) however, yesterday i decided it was about time to quit it, i graduated from college 2 years ago I've been working and i'm in the first healthy relationship of my life, things are looking shiny.

Let's hope this feeling last me a lifetime.

P.s. I found it is the most difficult to say no to a cigarette when im drinking or when im out with my friend, so if anyone has a tip for this, i'll love to read it.

Greeting from Nicaragua.

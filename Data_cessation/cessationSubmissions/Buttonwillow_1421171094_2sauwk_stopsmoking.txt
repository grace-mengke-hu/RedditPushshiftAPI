When will I start feeling better?

Thankfully quitting for me has been pretty easy for some reason this time around. Even with a smoker husband and mother, I've only had two real bad moments where I wanted to cave, but thankfully I was able to keep it together.  

I'm curious when I'm going to start feeling better though. I know about the insomnia issues and the quitter's flu, but it's really wearing on me. I'm not sick, I'm just perpetually in the state of almost getting sick. Dry cough and dry tickling throat, random ear aches, mild sore throat, and headaches. To top it off I'm almost always tired but when I go to bed I sleep so good but only for about an hour and a half at a time. I force myself to go back to sleep but it leads to a very restless night and causes me to be tired in the morning.

I know I'm still early on in my quitting, and I'm certainly not considering relapsing; mentally I'm feeling great about quitting. I'm just curious if there's a general timeline before I start feeling better. If I'm going to get sick, I wish it would just get it over with. I have all this free time but I'm too run down to enjoy it.

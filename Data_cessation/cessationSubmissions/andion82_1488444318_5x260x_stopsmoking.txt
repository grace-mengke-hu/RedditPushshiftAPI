Two years! I decided to make a BBQ for my friends with some of the money saved.

Obligatory yearly post :)


I want to thank all the /r/stopsmoking community. It's not that I relied on the sub that much for direct support. But reading all the people's achievements... the positive attitude, trying to encourage others is a way stronger support than I think it would be. People after you telling you to quit did not work before... this did.


My friends were the ones that suffered my starting bad mood, so after two years I decided to make a BBQ for them.


I know it would be rather improbable, but I want to extend the invitation to the people of the sub. If for any reason you are around NW Spain and feel like coming you will be more than welcomed to join us. The BBQ will be March 11th at midday on the wonderful Barbeque area of Beo, near Malpica (Galicia, Spain): https://goo.gl/maps/7jKHxqLTnRn just ask me for directions or any change of plans ^_^

Thank you all!

Seeking advice for overcoming depressive episodes...

For some quitters here, their biggest trigger might be drinking. For others, it may be stressful events. For me, it is depression. 

I have suffered from clinical depression all my life. While I have learned to manage it effectively on a day to day basis, there remain periodic episodes which are quite severe. 

In past quits, depression has always led me back to smoking. When all feels hopeless and life seems meaningless it is very difficult to find reasons to stay quit and live healthy. So far in this quit, I've managed to overcome the darkness - but I recognize that this is the number one problem for me going forward. 

I'd appreciate any tips, experiences, or suggestions in regards to overcoming addiction while being clinically depressed.

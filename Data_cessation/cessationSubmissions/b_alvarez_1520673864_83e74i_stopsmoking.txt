Stress levels

Hi all,

First of all, a big thank you to all you warriors posting on here, replying to others, and generally creating a supportive and empowering atmosphere. I've just completed my 12th day thanks in no small part to you guys.

My question is for those a bit further along: when do you actually notice reduced stress levels? I understand that cigarettes are actually a pretty shitty coping mechanism as they create the additional stress of addiction, so what I'm wondering is, when does that recede? At what point have you noticed you're generally a more relaxed person? Does this even happen? As it stands, even though i only get a few actual cravings a day, the only thing really keeping me sane is working out, which obviously i can't do all day. 

TL:DR How long does it take for stress levels to drop?

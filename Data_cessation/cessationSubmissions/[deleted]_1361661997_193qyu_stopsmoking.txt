Wow, 2 days in! 

It's getting easier. I feel cleaner, healthier, and much more happier. I remember the past few times I've tried quitting, there was this emptiness I kept feeling and I kept thinking that smoking was going to fulfill that void. Well now I've definitely realized that void was caused from smoking and the only way to get rid of that emptiness is to finally give up the nicotine. I can't wait until I can finally feel freed from the imprisonment caused by cigarettes.

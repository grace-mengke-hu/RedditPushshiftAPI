Two weeks today!

I'm proud to say I've made it through the first two weeks!  I can't say it's getting any easier though... in fact, cravings are almost as bad now as they were in the beginning, and I'm thinking about smoking all the time (although I feel confident that I won't).  Anyway, I feel healthier already, so that's what I'm focusing on. :)

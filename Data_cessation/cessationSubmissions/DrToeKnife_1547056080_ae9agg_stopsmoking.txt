Day 8.

I've gone a month and I've gone 12 days. Now I've gone 8 days. I feel reborn. I forgot how fucking AMAZING I feel without cigs. I have an insane amount of energy. I used to sit on my porch for hours and drink/smoke cigs. Without those things I'm forced to be productive. Literally every facet of life improves tremendously when you stop poisoning yourself. Go figure. Anyone can do it. 

Instead of Nike: Just do it
For me it's Nico: Just don't do it

Hehehe cheers

Smoking my last cigarette. Need your motivation.

I'm in my mid-late twenties. Been smoking for a little over 10 years. I have 1 cigarette left that I'll be smoking sometime in the next hour. Going cold turkey with no replacements. My fiance is quitting too - he already had his last one. I'm posting here for accountability and so I can remind myself later that I actually want/need to do this. 

I'm just going to randomly type out some thoughts below. Please post anything you can think of that might help me keep going! 

I don't have the money for it. My breath is awful. My tongue is nasty, my teeth are stained, and gums receding. I hate running out in the middle of events to smoke. I want to have babies one day so I'm going to have to quit anyway. Fiance has a daughter and she doesn't need to see this bad example from me. I should be someone she looks up to. My nephew shouldn't grow up seeing me smoke either. I had an aunt who smoked and, as a kid, I wanted her to stop and even asked her to stop a few times.  I don't want to be my aunt. I want to feel clean again and not covered in a film of blech with toxic insides. I want to cough without the nasty stuff coming up. I want to be able to get close to people or have conversation without self-consciously holding my breath. I want to stop being in this continuous loop of needing nicotine and feeling guilty about slowly killing myself. All I have to do is NOT SMOKE.

Things to fill my time, or to "change gears": cleaning/organizing, yard work, walks, stationary bike, stretching, mindful breathing, eating (need to gain weight anyway,) reading, coloring, reddit...

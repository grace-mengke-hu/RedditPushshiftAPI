8 months I feel amazing.

I quit on Christmas eve last year. I had a lot of cravings at first, but not a single day goes by now where I dont regret quitting sooner.

Everything feels great. I have more energy than ever before, I am able to concentrate at work more than I was ever able to. My house is clean, my wallet is thicker (saved over roughly $2,000 so far by not smoking!) sex is a lot more enjoyable, and mornings are so much easier to deal with.

Anyone out there reading this, keep it up! I know how terribly tough it can be, especially when you first quit. I never thought I would be able to quit, i smoked a pack a day for 10 years. Dont give up, and lets enjoy life without sacrificing our bodies!

Day 9. Day 9 is not fun.

Haven't smoked in 9 days and made it through having a few beers with smoker friends this weekend but damn today is a Monday of all Mondays. Working a double shift and just craving a cigarette like crazy. I know I don't actually want a cigarette but my brain and lungs are doing their best to tell me that I do.

Right now I'm on what would usually be my smoke break and instead I am sucking on a pen cap and reading all of your success stories on this subreddit. Just gotta survive and advance another day right?

Smoke "free" for over a month, I remember why I liked cigarettes

I switched to the Juul a little over a month ago. Since then, I haven't bought a pack, but I **have** smoked a couple of cigarettes, namely when I went out with friends and they had cigs and offered me. I never really intended to quit smoking, I just intended to quit regularly smoking, but not mind the occasional cigarette, like some of my friends are.

However, today I've been really missing cigarettes. I surfed /r/cigarettes for a bit and looking at all the different brands and blends brought back to me why I liked smoking: I enjoy it. Not to mention, I've been feeling slightly *off* for the past few days (not making excuses here, but I am diagnosed with bipolar, so while I've been stable for a while, I think the stress of the end of the semester is starting to trigger some things in me), with the addition of finals stress, and it's these ingredients that led me to smoke in the first place.

Kinda just venting here, I guess.

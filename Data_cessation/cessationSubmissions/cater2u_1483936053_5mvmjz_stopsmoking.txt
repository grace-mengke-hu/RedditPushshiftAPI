Haven't smoked in 3+ weeks but going back to school tomorrow...

I've been on break and since I'm around my family, I had the self comtrol to stop smoking so that they wouldn't know that I smoked. My parents are super straight edge and would be heartbroken if I do anything they consider bad such as drinking or smoking. I've wanted to quit for a while now (social smoker turned closet smoker) so this was a good opportunity.

I'm going back to school tomorrow and now I'm scared because I will no longer have my family around me. My self control will be so low. I even keep making plans of smoking in my head and then realize that no! I quit! Wtf brain.

Especially being in college, I see a lot of smokers (mostly when everyone is drunk and craving), and I'm scared to be around that environment again. I know I could just not go out and stay home all the time but that's also not a really great option for me socially. Also, when midterms or stressful events occur, it will be so hard for me not to give in. I have such low self control when it comes to smoking.

I'm scared and worried :( any tips?

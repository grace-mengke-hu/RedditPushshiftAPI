2 1/2 weeks, so far -- smooth sailing.

So wife and I decided to quit when we went on vacation to Portland, OR.  We did just that July 23 at the airport, had  plastic bag with our cigarettes, ashtrays, lighters, everything smoking related from the house.  Scurried our way to the smoking section of the airport, and had our last one.  Wasn't even that enjoyable and not even sure I smoked the whole thing. We put them out and throughb the bag away.  Got on the plane.  

I have to say, it has been wonderful.  After we decided a specific day I came to this subreddit and say all the ppl recommending Easyway to stop smoking by Allen Carr.  Bought the bundle of that book and the one for women for the wife.  It was great,  next day in Portland, it was about noon or so when I realized that I had forgotten to remember to not think about not smoking.  It quite nice, ever day since, at random times I will think, oh yeah I'm a non smoker now.  Even though it has been 2.5 weeks, it already feels like a lifetime ago when I smoked.   Had I know it was going to be this easy I would have done this years ago.    

Thank you everyone that recommended that book, it truly made a difference for my wife and I.

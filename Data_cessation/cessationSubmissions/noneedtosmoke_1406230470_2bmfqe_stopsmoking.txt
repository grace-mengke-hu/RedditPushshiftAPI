Have decided to quit, need help with the next step

Hi everyone, 

I am have been lurking around on this subreddit for a month now I am almost 19 and I started smoking about 2 years ago. I recently quit smoking hash which I was addicted to for about 1 year. I am 54 days sober and when I decided to quit hash I also decided that I would quit smoking after I was done with slight withdrawals and when I was sure I wouldn't go back to hash. I am sure about that now and for the past month I have been tapering down the no of cigarettes I smoke each day.

At my extreme I used to smoke pack a day but for the past month I have not gone above 10 cigarettes a day and for the last two weeks only smoke 3-5 cigarettes a day. I have decided to quit on 28th July,2014 and this will be my first time ever deciding to quit seriously I did try to quit almost 1.5 years ago but relapsed after 2 days but I am more motivated this time and quitting hash has given me the ability to say I can do it.

I want to know what are some of the best ways I could resist an urge whenever I am tempted to smoke? How long does a urge really last ? How long do the withdrawals last and what can I expect ? Is there any alternative thing I could eat/do whenever I feel the need to smoke?

I would really appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction and explain to me what I am going up against and how to be prepared for it. 


How some of you battle with the urge ? Are the first weeks the worst , does it get easier after a few weeks or not?

I think it's finally time...

I've been watching you all post your success stories and I'm having a hard time putting out that "final cigarette" do any of you have any tips for my final smoke? What kind of things keep you going? What are your tricks for the cravings? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

P.s. My quit date is Monday. One week for weening myself. Or should I just go cold turkey?

Successful quitters: What was your strategy?

I've tried and failed and tried again before failing again. How the hell did you do it? I know there's no one blanket solution and that everyone is different - so I'm hoping that if some of you share your methods that something may stick for those of us who are still struggling...thanks in advance!

Just dooo eeet!!

Hi Reddit,
I've been a smoker for 12 years now. I've attempted to "quit" smoking several times over the last two years. I find it hard to break the habitual mental addiction. I use smoking to distract myself from many things like social awkwardness, tasks at hand and emotional issues. I've found all the reasons to quit, hygiene, health and living in a non smoking house. I've tried weening, it doesn't work for me personally. I'm hoping that this forum will give me a support group and somewhere to rant when craving and using quitting as another way to be a do-er and motivated person who sticks to what they say they'll do. I KNOW I can do it, I know it's all in my head and if I WANT to quit I WILL and I won't let the mental side kick in.

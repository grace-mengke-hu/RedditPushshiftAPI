85 Days

Just returning from a one month vacation in the sunny south. It is great to be smoke free and not constantly be planning the next fix. 3600kms each way. No extra stops or standing around a corner power smoking to satisfy that nicotine monster. I smoked 40 years and finally decided I had to take control of my life, not let nicotine be in charge, my biggest regret is that I waited so long. Believe me you new quitters it does get easier... Hang in there, one craving, one hour, one day at a time...you can do it!!
Bonus was an extra $400.00 that I had to spend on whatever I wantedðŸ˜Š

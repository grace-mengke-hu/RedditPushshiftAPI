Three weeks! Woooohooooo!

Three weeks is a big deal to me, I remember all the times I tried to quit, failed and felt so hopless. It's not just reaching three weeks, it's the fact that I'm here and feel 100% confident I'm done smoking forever. 

I was nicotines bitch for so long, it feels nice to kick it out of my life for good.

Day 12 - Close to 'end'? Next up the smartphone addiction.

The constant to frequent to sometimes thoughts about smoking have ended. Now I suppose I need to be cautious of the more sneaky and sudden temptations, cravings and rationalisations that could pop up. I think quitting smoking has already been very important and it could be a turning point in my life as now I'm considering a lot more choices I make and have made regarding my health. I've had a horrible flu which has just ended making me feel miserable and I'm still recovering of that right now. 

But I actually look forward to exercising again after this, and I've got so much more time to read now too! Next step would be tackling my smart phone addiction, that's going to be a tough one. Does anyone have any experience or advice on this?

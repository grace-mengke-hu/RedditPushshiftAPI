21 days smoke free, yet I was at 600+ days 2 years earlier ...

I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2bh98e/617_days_holy_crap_does_time_fly_or_what/) I made two years ago that makes me cringe as I read it today.

Basically I was telling people here that I was free of smoking for 600+ days and they could do it too, while at the same time telling them that I took a stick occasionally while drinking.

It sounds arrogant but in my defense I know I meant well. I truly believed that I had the habit 'beat'. 

However today I am at 21 days smoke-free and 27 days drink-free and I know that I am an addict and the addict inside me will always want another puff or a sip. Just a puff or a sip and it's a slippery slope that gets faster and faster. Quitting has to be complete and for life or it does not work, for me.

That experience was painful, but I'm thankful for that humbling experience now.

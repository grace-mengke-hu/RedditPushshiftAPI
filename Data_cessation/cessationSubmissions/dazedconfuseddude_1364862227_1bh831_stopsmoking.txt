7 Days....

FUCK YOU BEAST! 

I've climbed the mountain that is week one. 

Shit was simple. 

I realize, after reading a lot of other posts, that the game now becomes a matter of vigilance. 

I cannot be lulled into a sense of security. The BEAST is strong. The BEAST is patient. It will wait until it thinks I let my guard down and then it will use all in its power to convince me to smoke.

NEVER AGAIN.

This is the hardest I've worked to over come an addiction. I will never stumble backwards into it. 

NOTHING GOOD COMES FROM CIGARETTES. 

That's the thing to remember. Any association of cigs and good stuff IS LIES. TRICKERY!

NOTHING GOOD COMES FROM SMOKING.

Hello, my name is Dazed Dude and I am a non-smoker.

So, i quit. I'm 25, and i was a smoker for a decade.

Yep. Started at 15, and just realize i hurt myself for a big one.

Bad skin color, yellow-ish teeth, and cigs smell like shit.

Quitted a week ago, but "just 1 sig" turned into 2 packages. Attempt 2 was 2 days ago. Not a single one for 2 days.

Not much, but i'm trying. Still feel the addiction, scratchy feeling inside my lungs. 

Started to eat like crazy.

Any advice will be great. Thanks bros

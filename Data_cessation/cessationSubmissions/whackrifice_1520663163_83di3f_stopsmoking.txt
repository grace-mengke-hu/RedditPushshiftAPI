This week was my last as a smoker

From the beginning, smoking didn't seem like anything special, and soon after I started, I hated it. But I smoked at least 15,000 cigarettes. At least 700 packs. At least $4000. Burned and piled up on my porch, flushed into storm drains, sucked into my neighbors' houses, poisoning me for hours every day. And I got... a mild lightheadedness, maybe once every 1000 or so? A excuse to go outside or be alone? A guarantee that I'll get off of this disappointing ride 30 years early? It's pitiful. I pity myself and every smoker I see. My grandma lived 21 years after my grandpa died, and talked about him all the time. I don't want to imagine my wife doing that, but she's going to if I don't stop this shit right now. So I don't know if it's for myself, the earth, my neighbor's beautiful little girl, my family, to say "Fuck you" to tobacco companies for killing millions of people for profit, but I'm done with it, I'm not going to miss it, it's going to get easier, and it's going to be the best choice I'll ever make.

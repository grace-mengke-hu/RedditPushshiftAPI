Feeling good about my plan of quitting

So i move to new city 3 weeks from now, the day i move i quit, no more smokes. I leave smoking behind me and but my vision to things i actually enjoy, but there is still one thing that stresses me out, what to do if i feel like i gonna relapse and i'm at work, should i stop drinking coffee at the morning or just stick to it

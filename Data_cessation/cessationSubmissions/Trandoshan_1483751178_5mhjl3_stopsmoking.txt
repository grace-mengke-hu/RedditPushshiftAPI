I could really use some advice

About 5 days ago I cut nicotine out of my life. I smoked for two years, but then became an avid vaper for 3-4 years. Since I used vaping to get me off cigarettes I never really got off nicotine until I decided it was time recently. 

I was doing great for the first few days, 0mg juice in my vape stopped the cravings, but two days ago I started having almost constant anxiety attacks. I've never had them prior to this, and boy are they sending me through hell. I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub since this is about smoking cigarettes, but if anyone here has been through this, I need advice.

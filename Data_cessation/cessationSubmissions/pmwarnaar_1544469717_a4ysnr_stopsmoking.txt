Stopped smoking, now at it again due to circumstances

I am 20 and smoked for about 4 years about a pack of cigarettes a day. Last year I slowly quit it and I didn't smoke for 6 months until october. But then some personal stuff happened, I found out my ex SO was cheating on me with a girl for a few weeks. The same day I found out I bought cigarettes again and have been smoking since. I KNOW my life will get better if I quit, but right now my self esteem is low and I am having trouble with a lot of depressive thoughts. Also, my ADD kind of doubles the effects in some ways. 

I just found this sub, do you have any advice on how to quit smoking AND be able to cope with all the stress and feelings of insecurity?

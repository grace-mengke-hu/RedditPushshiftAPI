Three months, friends and neighbors!

Woot woot! I don't come on this sub as often as I used to, which is a little lame because it really meant a lot to me in the beginning to see people further ahead than me. I'll try and come in here a little more often, but I don't think about smoking as often. I used to hop on here whenever I had a craving and I don't do that anymore.

Anyway, I'm glad it's easier now, but there are still pitfalls to watch out for. 

My roommate came back from an extended vacation about a month ago and she's an intense smoker so our whole downstairs always smells like smoke, even though she smokes on the back porch with the door closed. But guess what? It smells disgusting and that's what I concentrate on when I smell it. Ew! That smells gross! I used to smell like that all the time!

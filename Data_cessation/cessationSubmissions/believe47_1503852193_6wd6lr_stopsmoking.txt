Smoking with lung disease

I found out that I had a lung disease several weeks ago and I had not smoked cigarettes in over a year. A few weeks after finding out I bought my first pack since then I have smoked six packs of cigarettes. I can barely breathe from the scarring on my lungs but I want to do something crazy like smoke a cigarette or even Vape it must stop

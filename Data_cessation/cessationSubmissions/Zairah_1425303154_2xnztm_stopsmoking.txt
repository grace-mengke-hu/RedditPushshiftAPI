Nicotine Patch...I'm scared to take it off!

So I had my wisdom teeth removed 5 days ago. What better time to quit, right? I bought the patch and promptly stuck it on after the surgery. I have cheated and gone outside a few times, maybe 4 times total,  but each time I had literally a drag, questioned why I ever liked smoking and came back inside. 

I have been faithfully reapplying the patch every morning. Honestly I'm scared to take it off. How bad will the withdraw feel? I always felt like quitting the actual habit of smoking would be harder than the nicotine withdraw but now faced with it I'm not so sure.

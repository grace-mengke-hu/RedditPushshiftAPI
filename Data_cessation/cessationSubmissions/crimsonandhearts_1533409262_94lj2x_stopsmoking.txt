24 days and 490 cigarettes NOT smoked! *chantix*

Hey guys! 
You may remember me from the chantix updates. 
Well, I got 24 days under my belt and I’m never going back. I took chantix for a little over 2 weeks only. I stopped taking it because of the weird nightmares I was getting (I would have dreams people around me turned into life size cigarettes, lol)  I’ve had almost zero cravings for one. The smell of them makes me nauseous. 

One thing I have noticed though, is the amount of emotions that we cram down when we smoke. Since quitting, I’ve noticed I’ve actually had to deal with the emotions I had been cramming down for so long. That’s been difficult but it’s good.

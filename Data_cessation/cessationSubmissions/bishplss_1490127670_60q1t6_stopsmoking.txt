I'm out of tobacco and flat broke so I guess I'm giving quitting a go.

Been smoking for... jeez, almost ten years now. Never really made a serious attempt  before, always telling myself that I should cut down before I go cold turkey. Well now I literally can't get cigarettes until at least two days from now and if I can make it that long I may as well keep it going!

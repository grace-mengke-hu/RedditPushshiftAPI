Cold Turkey'ed like 2 weeks ago and failed. Back on track again, 4 days in a row already.

Well here I am again. Even though my score seems nice, it's not entirely true. Still, 4 days without them cigarrettes. Wish me luck again.

I feel way better this time though. I changed a lot the way I eat and it made a major difference. Besides, quitted some behaviors that used to make me smoke, like playing DoTA lol :P. Also, the major change was sports; I just came back into jiujitsu training, 3 days in a row now. I feel absolutely exhausted and it's amazing how it makes me literally disgust even the smell of cigarettes.

can feel my lungs expanding.

Btw, how do I refresh my nonsmoking status? Shall I just msg the bot like I never had one? 

Thanks!

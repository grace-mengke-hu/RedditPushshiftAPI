Trying again...

I'm 31. I have some pretty serious heart issues (I have had a pacemaker for two years; have already had three open heart surgeries and will have to have more as I get older). I -need- to quit smoking. I actually managed for about eight months a couple of years ago! But I made the mistake of thinking "Oh, it's been eight months; just one won't hurt". Now I'm smoking between half and one full pack a day... and I'm having trouble quitting again because A) I like the way my cigarettes taste; B) ALL the other adults in my house except one smoke, so there's -tons- of "Wanna come smoke with me?" and very little "Stay inside. You're trying to quit", and C) I feel like nicotine helps me stay calmer when I'm extremely stressed out and/or depressed. 

But I need to quit. I -know- I need to quit. So I'm trying again. Any and all tips, tricks, encouragement... anything at all would be helpful. Thanks, guys. :)

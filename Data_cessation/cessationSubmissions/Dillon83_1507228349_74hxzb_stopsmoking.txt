3 weeks in, wanted to check in and share.

So it’s been 3 weeks and I’ve had some bad days and some good. I am proud of how far I’ve come and you all should be too. I also quit all drugs and drinking about 8.5 months ago. This has been without a doubt the most challenging time in my life. A somewhat short stint with benzos at the end of my usage has left me with some lingering symptoms which cigs were making much worse which definitely helped in my choice to quit. On my better days I am truly enjoying the simple things more, I feel more connected to my family and friends but I am tired. Tired of feeling so raw and although quitting cigs has done many positives it’s also left me open to new emotional upheaval. Some say the 3s hurt the most and Tuesday night was my official 3 weeks mark. I woke up today after a full night of nightmares and it’s just been one of those days where you feel completely unhinged.....I’m hoping this is my body adjusting and craving for something and not my new normal and with time will get better and easier. I know this isn’t just about smoking and I hope that isn’t against the rules but I hope you are all doing well and stay strong today.

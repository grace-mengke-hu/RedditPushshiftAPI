Heading towards Day 10

I can't tell you how helpful this subreddit is. Thank you all!

I get some wicked cravings but I feel stronger and better about myself every time I ride it out. Today was a little up and down (ugh, the holidays) but I glanced in the rear view mirror this morning and realized that the whites of my eyes were....well, white! I can't say I ever noticed they weren't while I was a smoker, but the difference is obvious. I find the little things like that can be really helpful to stay motivated.

Keep it going, everyone!

Feeling like a complete failure this morning

I had my first drink since stopping smoking last night and boy did it make me want to smoke. Its the first time I really wanted one. I thought about them all night and I didnt really enjoy myself. I even picked up my boyfriends tobacco and began to roll myself one!!

Luckily he took them out of of my hands and he dug out my old vaper instead, so I had a little go on that until I didnt want one anymore.

But I feel really down this morning that A. I wasnt able to control myself when drinking and B. That I vaped nicotine when I had gone 9 days cold turkey before.

Argh. I posted earlier that it all seemed too easy and too good to be true and now its starting to hit that this isnt easy at all.

Still, massive brownie points to my boyfriend this morning. At least it wasnt a cigarette and I dont have to reset my badge. I dont think im ready to drink just yet...

I'm not a purist [3 months]

I don't smoke anymore. Now dont get me wrong, the last time I smoked a cigarette was 2 weeks ago but I don't smoke. How? It is jst that smoking ine cigarette means that you are a "smoker" again. Now don't get me wrong, the first weeks you simply have to abstain from it or you wont be able to stop yourself from getting into a habit again.

I see it like this: If you are someone who watches what they eat very carefully to stay healthy, you don't stop doing that just becuse you ate a piece of cake yesterday. 

Everytime I smoke, it tastes less like I remember it. Everytime it tastes worse. But some nights I just want a cigarette badly and I let myself have one. But I am not a smoker. My clothes don't smell like smoke, my room doesn't, and neither does my breath. There is never a lighter in my pocket anymore, and I wouldn't be able to find a cigarette at home anywhere. 

EDIT:

Since there have been many strongly worded responses to this post I must add that this does not work for many people. Aparrently the risk of "relapse" is too great to be driving this raod. In my opinion though the concept of relapse implies that there is some kind of barrier broken each time I smoke tobacco, and that I then helplessly fall back into smoking. I will probably come back here once I have a year on my clock to keep you guys posted how it worked for me.

EDIT 2:

I am starting to think that I might accidentally get people to start smoking again. I thought about aking this post down, but then again, the kinds of people who start smoking again by reading this would find similar ideas to read about somewhere else so I am leaving it up since the number of responses I got to this pos suggest that there is a demand for discussing this topic. It is up to the mods to decide if that is ok.  Anyway this post was not meant to loosen any grip any of you might have upon your habit and should be taken with ha big grain of salt.

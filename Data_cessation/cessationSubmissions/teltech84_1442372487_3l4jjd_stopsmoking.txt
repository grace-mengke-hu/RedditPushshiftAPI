Champix and oversleeping

I've been taking champix for 8.5 weeks and have been smoke free since july 25th.  Cravings are mostly gone although i'm having trouble getting out of bed.  The thing I normally do when I wake up is put the kettle on to make a pot of coffee and go out on my deck and puff back 2 then have another one while I drink coffee....  I don't know if it's me getting frustrated that I can't have those smokes or something with the medication.  Ever since I started taking the 1mg dose I'm sleeping for 12 hours, waking up at 9:30-10 when I used to wake up at 5:30.... anyone else experience this or can offer some advice?

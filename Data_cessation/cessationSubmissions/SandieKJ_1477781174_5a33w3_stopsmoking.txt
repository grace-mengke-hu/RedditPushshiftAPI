Winning the battle ......

Feeling such a range of emotions.  Have had an argument tonight with my ex.  This is a massive test for me.  Desperately want a cigarette as I smoke when stressed but absolutely determined not to give in.  I know I will wake up and be so proud of myself for not giving in.  Still, right now my willpower is being tested to the max.  Distracting myself isn't easy as anger normally leads to smoking.  I refuse to make a poor decision that will lead to me feeling awful tomorrow.  And I know I will hate the taste of it too.  Day 13 approaching - need to believe I can do this ......  Come on girl !!!!!

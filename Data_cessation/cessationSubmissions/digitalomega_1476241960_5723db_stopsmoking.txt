First full day without nicotine.

Greetings all! I am currently 37 and have smoked 10-20 cigs a day for the last 19 years. I have "quit smoking" a handful of times in the past, but these attempts usually only last a few days. 

My lungs aren't the strongest. Even as a kid and prior to smoking, I had trouble breathing and would have frequent coughing fits due to chronic congestion. Obviously, smoking has only exacerbated this, and it's become progressively worse over the years.

So, I stopped. Friday was the last day that I smoked my typical amount. Then I had 2 or 3 each day on Saturday, Sunday, and yesterday. It's almost sleepy time, so I think it is now safe to say that today is my first full day without nicotine and I don't want to look back. I want to be done. I want to be healthier. I want to be here on this plane of existence for as long as possible for my baby girl.

Even though it's been such a small amount of time, my lungs already feel so much better.

Thank you to all of you for your posts. They are very inspirational, and I will be checking back here whenever the cravings rear their ugly heads. I've already had a couple rough ones, but something tells me that I ain't seen nothin' yet. :)

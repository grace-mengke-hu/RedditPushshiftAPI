When the benefits aren't salient

I have a hard time justifying why I'm keeping myself from a smoke. Today was one of those days filled with minor disappointments and frequent annoyances.

Part of me feels like having a cigarette would be the one thing I could do and have some damn control over. I know it wouldn't really help anything, but I don't know what people do on days like today if they don't go have cigarettes and unwind.

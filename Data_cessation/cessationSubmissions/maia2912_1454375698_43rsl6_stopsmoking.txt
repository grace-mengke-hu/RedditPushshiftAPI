switching from coffee to tea the first two weeks really helped me

I had a huge trigger with coffee. I know this from previous attempts. I truly feel that making different teas in the morning really helped with this. This is the longest i have quit so I just thought i would pass this along. I hope this helps someone else!~35 years smoker.

10 years of smoking. Probably about time to give up the ego and ask for a hand

I’m 23 and started smoking cigarettes as a young impressionable fool. Since then I can’t remember not having smoke in my lungs. I feel horrible. And it feels like I’ve tried everything.
Recently after spring cleaning mishap I accidentally donated my Vape to Goodwill and I decided that it was time for me to get serious and ask for help. I’ve gotten clear of just about everything in the book when it comes to addiction except I just can’t seem to get myself to stop smoking. Weed and cigarettes are really the only two things I smoke, but even with weed I have comfortably limited myself and successfully stopped for certain periods of time.
I picked up smoking weed as a way of quitting a lot of other drugs. And similarly use THC to medicate my anxiety, however after a few months I’ve successfully been able to medicate myself using edibles only.
It feels like all that truly remains is my destructive relationship with Nikki Teen

No nicotine for a week.

I quit smoking cigarettes about 8 months ago and switched to a Juul thinking it will help me quit. Fast forward 8 months and Iâ€™m pounding down more nicotine than ever before. So I finally trashed that a week ago and holy heck nicotine withdrawals suck. I finally had my first good nights sleep since I quit last night which was cool.

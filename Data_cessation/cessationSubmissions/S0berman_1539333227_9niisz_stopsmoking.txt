I am desperate :(

Really want to quit smoking. I've read Easyway like 5 times, and I mostly understand it. I think my main reasons for failure is responding to triggers. I get an overwhelming sense of panic when I wake up each morning after making a promise to quit the night before. 

I dunno what to do really. I guess I should grow a spine and just let the cravings pass.

What helped you to quit r/stopsmoking? Please share any advice you have. Smoking is horrible.

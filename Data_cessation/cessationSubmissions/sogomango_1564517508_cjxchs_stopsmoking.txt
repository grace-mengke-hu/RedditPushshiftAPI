Third real time trying to quit

I know this is a common post, but this is my third time trying to quit cigarettes/vapes after 10 years of smoking. Previously I've tried gum, lozenges, patches and I've made it a week or two weeks at most. This time, I think I'm going to just stop cold turkey. I know it's going to be miserable and hard, but I'm an incredibly healthy person in every other way and I can't justify it anymore. Any advice to keep me going?

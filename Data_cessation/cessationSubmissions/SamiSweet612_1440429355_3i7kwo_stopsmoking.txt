2 Month Mark!!

Whoo hoo! I made it two months! Thanks to this subreddit and all of you for your support through the toughest of times. I feel incredibly confident that I will never take a single puff of another cigarette however I don't think it will ever be 'easy'. Every day I make the choice to not smoke, and I plan to continue doing so until hopefully one day it is ingrained in my mind permanently.

Quit smoking 2 1/2 months ago after 22yrs pack a day habit.

  I’m happy to say that after what seemed impossible is now a reality.    I’m 38 now and have smoked a pack a day (more with beer) since I was 16.   I’ve been smoke free for 2 1/2 months.   Sadly though it took terrible news to quit.   

I really loved smoking, I mean it was a huge part of my life.   Driving, work breaks, coffee, and my favorite was smoking with my wife.  We smoked together, we talked/spent time and enjoyed this terrible addiction together.    So what changed, why did I quit?

My wife’s mother who I absolutely adore was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and sadly it’s spread.   So I quit, not cold turkey I use lozenges (7-8) a day.    I quit for for all the people I love.  I quit because  I’m a father, and a husband, and a son.   I knew that I had to quit for my wife who still smokes, I used my quitting so when the time comes it’s easier for her when she is ready.  So I quit for everyone else instead of me, and it worked.    

I still sit with my wife while she smokes and even though I want her to quit, it’s her decision to make and I never press the subject.   She is under a huge amount of stress with her mother and sadly her father passed 4 years ago.   We all quit for different reasons.   

Since I’ve quit I’ve noticed several things health wise.  That are awesome and annoying.  

The good:  breathing, libido, taste, sleeping, motivation, saving money, has all improved.  

The bad (but good) I’m having weird body tingles and almost what can be described as Parkinson like shakes that are annoying.  They come and go and my dr says it’s basically my blood supply and nervous system coming back to life.   Has anyone else experienced this? 

Keep up the good fight, prayers for my mother in law, and send good vibes to help my wife quit.

Not letting it get me again.

2 years ago I quit for 10 months and It felt so good! Once I started again I was disappointed in myself. I got in to a serious relationship and felt like smoking again wasn’t a big deal as I wasn’t smoking a lot (2-5 a day) a few months ago the women who I thought I was going to marry one day cheated on me and left me for the guy she cheated on me with. It was and still is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with in my life. As time went on I noticed I was smoking a lot more (a pack or even more) a day. 18 days ago I smoked what I hope is my last cigarette. Although it still sucks, quitting has actually gave me something to look forward to in such a dark time in my life! I started when I was 14 and now I’m 22. Hopefully this time it sticks!

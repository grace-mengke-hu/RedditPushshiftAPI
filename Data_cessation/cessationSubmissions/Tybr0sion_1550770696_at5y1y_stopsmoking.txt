Just a few tips to fight cravings that have helped me.

So I'm on my third day without smoking a cigarette and I've been eating chocolate like a motherfucker lol. Like most people I would always want a cigarette after eating. I would only smoke at work as well, going on a total of maybe three breaks including my lunch to have a cigarette. I have found that doing literally anything else to occupy my time and staying away from the smokers area is really working.

I've been eating those little Hershey's nuggets instead of smoking. It's not the healthiest alternative but it's something. Even just occupying my time by browsing Reddit or anything is helping to. That's the main thing you have to do to quit. Fight those cravings. Look at your phone, read a book, play a game, eat candy, something. It works.

Aww hells yeah...

my friend and I (formerly 1 pack/day smokers) were having a few beers two days ago. We both had the same amount left in our packs, and decided at the same time that we were done with smoking. We're usually very big "talkers" that never follow through with anything, so we talked about our first smoke, we talked about why we kept doing it, and then we talked about how much we wanted to quit. Yesterday (day one) was extremely hard for both of us, but we're on to day two now and feeling a shit ton better than yesterday. I am so stoked that it's working out! It can be done. Positivity and the right attitude is key. We kept each other honest, and talk about it when the cravings hit. 

Thanks to you guys for support and being able to vent!

First full day passed

 Today I have gone 24 hours smoke free (actually it is over 30 at the time of typing this) and aside from a bit of a runny nose and a small stomach ache I feel great. I really want to list a few accomplishments:

 Last night I was drinking beer, and didn't smoke. I think it's impressive considering the link between the two.

I work at a convenience store and sell cigarettes all day to people who smell like smoke. Yet I am okay.

My roommate smokes... in his room. I could smell it last night. So far still okay. I have to admit that was difficult though. Not because I was envious but it made sleeping difficult.

Finally, there is an open pack of cigarettes beside me that my store manager left here. I haven't looked at them. I didn't look at them yesterday either.

My 72 hour post!

Well. It hasn't quite been 72 hours yet. In just three hours it will be. I know I'll get there. I am sitting at work until 9pm tonight. 

It's been pretty easy. Not as easy as the first time I quit. 

The first time I quit after smoking about a pack a day for four years. I quit for two years. Honestly I was only able to quit because I had just been in an abusive relationship, and had to move back in with my parents. I lost my job, so my parents were literally putting gas in my car so I could find another job. I didn't buy cigarettes during this time, I felt as if it would have been disrespectful to them and the help they were giving me to get my life back together after the abuse. 

I quit cold turkey for two years. 

About a year ago, I was driving my best friend and her boyfriend from the airport, she had just paid to have him flown in. They meet online. He offered me a smoke. I was a little uneasy with him in the car, so my anxiety got the better of me and I smoked with them. My two years of nonsmoking went down the drain from there. It was sad. I had almost zero cravings during those two years. 

I have had attempts at quitting since that day. I think the longest was for about three weeks. I don't remember why I started again after that. 

I go on a ton of family vacations with the boyfriends family. Hiding my habit wasn't easy, and honestly he was even getting frustrated with me. 

We have another vacation coming. At the end of November. No more excuses to break away from the group. I'm not going to give back in this time. I have regretted it each and everytime.

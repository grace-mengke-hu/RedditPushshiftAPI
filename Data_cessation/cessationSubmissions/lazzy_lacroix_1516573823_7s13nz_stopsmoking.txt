28 Days Slip Up

I had a slip up. Made it to 4 weeks, went out 2 nights in a row (not drinking) and had a crazy urge to smoke both nights. Ended up giving in and had 1 smoke. Didn't taste good at all, was very dry and awful. Didn't give it a second thought. Now having small thoughts about smoking, and I'm here to hold myself accountable to this community in a way I've never done before. I love not smoking. I really don't want to return to that way of life.

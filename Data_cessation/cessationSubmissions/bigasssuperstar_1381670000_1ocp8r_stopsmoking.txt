Quit when she got pregnant; started again when cancer treatment went badly

Quit cold turkey when wife got pregnant in Aug 2012. During c-section delivery in April of this year, docs found her full of cancer. Six months on, baby's awesome and she's finishing up chemo after a brutal series of treatments, surgeries and setbacks. A few weeks ago after another emergency hospital admission and peak of stress and general shitstorminess, I bought half a pack of smokes. Have been smoking a few daily since then. Hiding it. She'd surely kill me if she knew. How to handle?

I'm so done and over it. Let's hope I can stick to it.

I've decided I'm quitting. Effective immediately. And I'm doing it in the middle of a pack this time which I'm convinced will carry more weight in my mind than quitting when I've smoked through an entire pack. 

I've decided that I'm fucking sick of coughing all the time. 

I'm sick of smelling like smoke.

And I hate the way I use smoking as an emotional crutch. 

Sad? Smoke. Mad? Smoke. Annoyed? Smoke. Fighting with best friend? Two smokes. Having a wonderful day? Celebratory smoke.

And then there's all the pointless excuses to smoke.

Just ate a meal? Smoke. Have time before my next class? Smoke. Waiting for a table to leave on a slow night at work? Smoke. Just woke up? Smoke...with something to drink so I don't get queasy. Drinking/at the bar/at a party/just finished a drink? SMOKE.

It's a shitty pattern. And I'm done.

Plus I hate going out in the cold just because I feel like I need a cigarette.

Please. Please wish me luck.

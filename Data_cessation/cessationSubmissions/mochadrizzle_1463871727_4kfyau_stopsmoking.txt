13 days done.

13 days done after quitting cold turkey. I smoked primarily when driving. Driving now is hard for me. Every time I get in my car the feeling of reaching down for the lighter hits me. The rest has been pretty easy so I have been trying to stay out of my car as much as possible. Any suggestions?

As of 18th February, I am a non-smoker.

Hey guys,

Just a little backstory, I started smoking about a year ago when I enlisted into the army. It was a very stressful environment and smoking helped me get away from everything and have a quiet moment to myself. I knew it was unhealthy, but it worked, so I stuck with it.

Fast forward a year later, I've just met a really wonderful lady and things were going really well, till I found out that smoking was essentially a deal-breaker for her. Not wanting to lie to her, I told her the truth, and promised that I would quit if it meant I got to see her again.

So, here I am now. This definitely won't be easy, but it'll definitely be worth it in the end. Can't wait to share my success with you guys! ðŸ˜ƒ

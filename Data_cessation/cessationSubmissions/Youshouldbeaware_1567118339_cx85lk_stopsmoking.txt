Thinking it’s going to be easy for me

I’m going to stop smoking after this week. I’ve been a almost daily smoker for more than 3 years now. Some days I can go without a smoke, some days with  2 or 3, but most of the days, I’ve smoked somewhere around 7/10 cigarettes. Because I have quite a couple of days a month I won’t smoke at all or just a few, I figured that quitting smoking won’t be that hard for me. But.. Now the stopping-date is closing in, I’m wondering if I’m thinking to little about it. I’m addicted after all. Anybody who had the same thought quitting? I know it’s going to be different for everybody, but I would really like some insight of some fellow (not anymore) smokers who had the same thought as me!

Made it a full week and with a road trip!

Spent the Saturday on a road trip down to Chicago. Craving was strong in the morning, this is my first road trip in many years without smoking and knowing I wouldn't. I was crabby right away in the a.m. Once we got to the hotel I had another craving. We went into the city via train and walked around- people smoking everywhere. Another craving. Went and had a couple beers at the bar and then had dinner- door was open and smoke smell wafted through- craving strong after eating and a few beers. After that we saw the Hamilton musical and I was too excited to bother with cravings. Rest of the night was just fine! Super pumped about this.

My resolve is iron strong right now. The stop smoking app is really cool- Its an ear to bitch to, an encourager when you need one, an interface of progress you can look at. 

I have a feeling week 2 is going to be more challenging. But I've got this! I made it through a concert and road trip- thats a huge obstacle I fucking VAULTED over!

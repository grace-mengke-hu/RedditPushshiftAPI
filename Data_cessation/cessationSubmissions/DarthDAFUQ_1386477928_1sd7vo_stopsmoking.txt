Since I've stopped smoking 6 days ago..

I've realized that non smokers actually have a nicer life.

Nice smelling clothes, nice seats in restaurants, nice taste in your mouth when you wake up in the mornings lol noticed that one today, it's so weird because I've smoked my whole adult life and I never knew till this week how for 7 years I've been missing out on the "NICE" things in life.

Are there any more surprises I'm in for?

I think it is time to say goodbye to r/stopsmoking

I am on month 5 and a rarely think of smoking anymore... I am out enjoying the money I save from not smoking anymore and living a little more life with my kiddos.  So I think it has come to the point where this sub Reddit is no longer encouraging me and has turned into a reminder of something I would love to never think about again....

Good Luck everyone!  You can totally do it! I did :)

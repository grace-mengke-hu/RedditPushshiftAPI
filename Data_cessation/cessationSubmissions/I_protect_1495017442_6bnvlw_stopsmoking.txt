How damaged is my health after smoking for 1.5 yearsâ€‹?

I smoked a single cigarette a day for the past 18 months but I quit yesterday.
 
Assuming there's a definite answer:

How much did I damage my health?

Are these damages reversible?

What can I do to reverse any damages, if possible?

What irreversible damages did I cause to my body?



Thanks for the help.

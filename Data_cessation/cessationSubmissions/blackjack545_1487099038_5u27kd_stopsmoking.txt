I have to reset my badge today.

I was doing extremely well.  I was about four months out and feeling great.  I could be around smokers and not get cravings, go out drinking and not want a smoke, and go into gas stations without hesitation.

But I had one of those days.  Got into a bad argument with the parents and was feeling pretty existential.  I just graduated college and am having the "what the fuck am I doing with my life" blues, and cigarettes have always been my go-to when life gets me down in that type of way; when there is a problem that has no clear and direct solution.

After a week I have regressed back to smoking 5-7 a day.  Has anybody else had any setbacks like this?  I'm worried because quitting sucked and now I'm gonna have to go through the whole damn show again.

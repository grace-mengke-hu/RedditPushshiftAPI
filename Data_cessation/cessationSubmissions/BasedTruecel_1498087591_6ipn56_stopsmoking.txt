Here's my little problem. I have absolutely no desire to smoke whatsoever after reading Allen Carr's book. Only problem is, when I see anything related to smoking either in real life, or some simulation like a video game or movie, it gets my cravings going. How do I avoid this?

How can I look at cigarettes, people smoking, cigarettes being portrayed as something good, fun, and enjoyable, without craving them? I remember I was able to one time I quit, but it's been almost a month and looking at anything resembling cigarettes (like a cigarette pack sitting on the table, or a lit cigarette in an ash tray on a game or movie) or looking at it being glorified in a movie or video game gets me craving them, even though I want to be done with them 100%. I absolutely hate them, but again, seeing that crap gets me going again, and I don't know why.

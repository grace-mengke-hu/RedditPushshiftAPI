Six months -- still great!

Hey. I've been a non-smoker for six months now. I still get cravings but most of the time it just seems so stupid that I ever spent so much time and money on it.

All the good things are still good. I smell better, I feel better, I don't have to factor in smoking breaks whenever I plan even the simplest things. Non-smoking life is just great.

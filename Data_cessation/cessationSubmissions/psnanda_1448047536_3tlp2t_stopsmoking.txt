Quitting smoking from today

I recently found about this subreddit. I am quitting smoking today! I was inclined to buy a e ciggarette to help me quit smoking but realized thats gonna cost me a lot of $$. Instead i bought a pack of ice breakers and have 1 mint everytime i want to have a smoke...

Lets see how this follows. I started smoking in January 2013...Its been long now..dont want my lungs to be tar filled !

mark my date : 20th nov 2015

Thanks guys to motivate me. I went thru a couiple of posts and am very happy for people who chose life over smoke

Day 1 for the nth time

So today is day 1 for me yet again. I'm 39 years old and have been smoking a pack a day since I was 14. I've quit many times. The most successful stretch was three years(!); although this may seem like a great accomplishment, it's discouraging to me lately as I feel that starting again is inevitable. I'm fighting hard against that though. I want to say thanks to all of you in this community, although I don't post I do read a lot and your stories of similar struggles are an encouragement. Here's to day 1, with uneven emotions, fatigue, and lots of gum! 

edit: I have reset my flair so it should show properly soon
edit 2: thanks all for the kind words, they are very appreciated! Almost through the first day!

How many times have you quit before this one? Why is this time different?

Personally I've quit 4-5 times. The reason this time will stick is because now I know one drunken puff is just as dangerous as me going to buy a carton right now and smoke the whole thing right away.

There is no "one puff". There is smoking or no smoking.

20 Days, frustratingly happy.

Day 20 cold turkey! So far it seems to be getting a little easier, but occasionally still really want one. I was also a pretty heavy drinker, but have also been 20 days sober. I quit drinking for now to get past quitting cigarettes, since the two go so well together. I really want to have some drinks, but I do not want to crack since I have been doing so well. Ugh!

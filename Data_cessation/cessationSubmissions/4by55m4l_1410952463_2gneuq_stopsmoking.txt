Just Over A Month Again - Didn't Even Notice

Just over a month ago and after a couple of failed 2-3 month stints I decided to use Allen Carr's method and it worked wonders for me. Unlike before when I felt deprived and that I was missing something important in my life I now feel completely free. That was reinforced today when I opened my quit tracker and it read 1 month, 1 week - I thought it had only been like 2 weeks! Such a great feeling of freedom, now I just need to make sure it stays long term. Something feels different though this time. Thanks for the advice to try EasyWay and all the support!

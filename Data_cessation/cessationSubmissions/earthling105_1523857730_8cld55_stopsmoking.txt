Dear r/stopsmoking - this is my second major quit attempt

About a year ago, I [posted on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/5xr5n2/i_quit_and_i_know_ill_never_smoke_again/) and was very (almost arrogantly) confident that I'd not smoke again.

Well, I lasted just over a month. It was frustrating and I didn't have the heart to come here and post an update because I felt stupid (and kinda glad that I could continue smoking. Nicotine does weird shit to you).

Now a year and at least 7000 cigarettes later (that converts to approximately $1600 where I'm from), I've decided to fuck it just do it one more time.

Planning to battle cravings with these 3 methods:

- Step 1: Do some light exercise (the dopamine released mitigates craving)
- Step 2: Drink some coffee/ chew normal gum
- Step 3 - Chew nicotine gum

Any advice/words of encouragement would be nice.

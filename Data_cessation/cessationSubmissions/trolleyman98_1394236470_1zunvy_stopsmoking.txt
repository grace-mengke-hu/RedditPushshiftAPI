Day 3: Sucks, but getting better

I have finally made it to day three of being tobacco free! Unfortunately, I'd be lying if I told you I expected to get this far. I'd also be lying if I said that it's been easy. I have felt constantly tense the last 48 hours, and some of the cravings I have been getting are rough. I have also had high levels of irritability and have found myself lashing out at people. I feel bad about this, but I know its only a temporary feeling and the people that become my unintentional victims also understand this. To combat the cravings, I have found that chewing on things helps take my mind of it. Whether its a stick of gum, a straw, or the pencil/marker at my desk, I've found this makes it a lot more tolerable. 

And through all the crappiness that I've felt emotionally, I have felt GREAT physically. I don't know if how I feel is an actual effect or just placebo, but I've noticed a few positives:

-My taste and smell have noticeably improved. As a result, I have begun to notice that my apartment has a slight undertone of smoke, even though I've never smoked inside. My car has the same undertone.

-I am no longer self-conscious about how I smell and no longer fear smelling like a smoke stack. 

-This goes with the first one, but I've noticed my food has a taste now. Example: I was never able to taste the minty-ness of my toothpaste. I always felt the tingle on my tongue and my brain simply associated that with mint. The other day brushing my teeth, I noticed how flavorful it was! 

-I find that it is also noticeably easier to catch my breath.

I know these may seem like menial things, but it is cool to see results so soon after quitting, and has been great for morale and motivation. When the cravings make me wanna crack, I simply take a deep breath, and that's all I need to keep going. Mentally, I feel like Andy Dufresne from The Shawkshank Redemption. I know I have to trudge through a couple miles of shit, but I know something great lies on the other side.

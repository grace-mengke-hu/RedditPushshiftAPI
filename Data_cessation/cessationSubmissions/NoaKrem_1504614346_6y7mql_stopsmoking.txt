3 days, forst reddit post.

Hi, 
So I'm 27 y.o and been smoking for 11 years. 
It's not like something happened that made me quit, just going onto healthier way of living...

I think me and my bf are gonna break up today, really think its gonna trigger me into smoking again.

I have a lump in my throat since I quit, that doesn't fade away.

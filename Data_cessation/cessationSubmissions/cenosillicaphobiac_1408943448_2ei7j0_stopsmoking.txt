Wedding weekend.

It was my friends wedding this week.  The whole week was eventful, Friday was the bachelor party (I posted about it before) Saturday rehearsal dinner, Sunday the wedding, outdoors, 6 hrs for me because I was one of the groomsmen.

Lots of potential triggers.  Friday was bad because we were in a casino and strip club that both allow indoor smoking.  I was playing blackjack with smokers on either side.

Saturday was pretty easy, the members of the wedding party that smoke I don't know, so I just didn't go outside when they did, no biggie.

Tonight had all of my smoker friends hanging out drinking and having fun until they closed down the bar on us.

At no point during the weekend, even drunk, stoned, in a casino with nobody I knew close by to chastise me and tonight, around my long time smoking buddies, did I feel a real urge to smoke.  I no longer mind being around smokers, I find what they do to be pointless, but I don't care that they do it, and it certainly doesn't affect me.  I even told my wife that if she wants to have a smoke on special occasions with our friends, she can.  She can obviously handle it, I can't, so I won't join her, but her smoking won't impact me. 

I handled the whole thing like a non smoker, it felt great.

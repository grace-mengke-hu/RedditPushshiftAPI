The fuck am I supposed to do now?

I’m craving like hell. I’m shaking and literally itchy af for nicotine. I haven’t touched a cig/sheesha/hash for a month and I haven’t taken any nicotine for 6 days. I gotta study for my physics exam Tom but I can’t focus for shit. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

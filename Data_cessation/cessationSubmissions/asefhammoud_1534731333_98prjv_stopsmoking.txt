I do and don't want to quit

A large part of me enjoys smoking but an even bigger part of me is reaaallyyy starting to feel the poison in my body. I want to quit, but I don't want to go cold turkey!
Anyone figure out a good system for cutting down before quitting?? The intention is there, I 100% want to quit in the coming months but I need to ease into it or I know I'll relapse immediately.

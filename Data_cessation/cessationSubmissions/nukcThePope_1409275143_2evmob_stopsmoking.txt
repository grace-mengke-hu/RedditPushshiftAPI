The things that addicts say

I have heard a lot of excuses, probably not all of them, from myself and others. I was thinking of making a nice list of them here for everyone to see and recognize for what they are, excuses to smoke. Feel free to add more, as I'm sure you recognize them.

* Now is not a good time to quit. I will quit when I feel better, or when my divorce / exam / situation at work or home is better. 
* I will quit when I'm 18, 21, 25, 30, 35, 40, or 60 (most likely when you're dead). This includes the "I will quit next week / month" excuse.
* I enjoy smoking (systematically choking myself with carcinogenic chemicals is very special to me).
* I'm so addicted that I can't quit. I have tried it before, and failed, and now I'm afraid to fail again.
* The one after meal / drinks / sex / toke is special for me. I will never be able to enjoy a meal / drink / sex / toke again without it.
* I control my habit. I do not smoke as much as person X. He / she is out of control. (It's just a habit it's cool, I feel alive. I'm not an addict baby, that's a lie).
* I can cut back. This ones includes, I can smoke only when I drink, only when I bum from others, only when ...
* I just have one more, that will be the last one.
* My cat died, I am now entitled to smoking even though I quit for four years.
* I lost my ecig, so I bought a pack of smokes.
* By the time I get cancer they will be able to cure it.
* My grandfather smoked six packs a day and he lived until 168 years old.
* I can't concentrate without smokes, I will get fat, and I need it to relax. I will get depressed. I have anxiety, and I am OCD.
* You're just saying this because you don't smoke anymore, and you want to, but you can't.
* I will always miss smoking in my life, I might as well smoke.

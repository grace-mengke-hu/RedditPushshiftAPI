Such an easy decision...

It's been a bit more than 5 days. I've smoked sporadically for the last 4 years. There's never been a time that I didn't smoke it was just that one day I'd smoke 2 and the next it would be 15.

 It worked out that I quit on the 1st so I guess it's an easy date to remember.

I still have a pack and a half left just sitting there. Temptation. But I haven't had major cravings aside from being agitated and cranky.

I had no thought of wanting to quit. It's weird. It came on like I was planning on making dinner. 

My father smoked 2 packs a day for 27 years and quit cold turkey about 6 years ago. He says that he had a few puffs of a cigarette once when we were going through a tough time and that it made him vomit.

I'm hoping to be like that come a couple of years.

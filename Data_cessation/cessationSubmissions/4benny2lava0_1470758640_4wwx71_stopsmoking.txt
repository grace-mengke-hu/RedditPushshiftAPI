I would read all these posts about people quitting and feel like I was too weak

Well I did it five days ago to start a job in a non smoking office. I guess I like money more than I like cigarettes. Cravings are a bitch tho. Strangely enough I do not crave when around other smokers. I Am in AA so there's a lot.

Driving and alone time are difficult but I can handle it. Just put nicotine where I put alcohol, heroin, and benzodiazepines.

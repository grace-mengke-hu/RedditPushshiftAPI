A small treat

I'm using the money I've set aside every time i went to use it on cigs and suprising my bf with dinner at one of our favorite but super pricey restaurants. It feels good. It's hard to believe it's already been over a month. I've come so far since my last post and even though it's a huge struggle still, it feels so much more feasible. Thank you all for your support! This sub has been a tremendous help.

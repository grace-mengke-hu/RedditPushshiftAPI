Day 23

I had a terrible, awful day yesterday. And today feels great. I can't keep up. 

I'm feeling like I can stop counting days when I hit #30. Till then, watching every day accumulate keeps me going.

The one thing that's really getting old is that I'm so goddamned irritable! I wasn't at all until the past 3-4 days. Now I just want to scream at the tiniest things. 

If anyone's got tips for dealing with the irritation, or an idea of when it might level out, it's much appreciated. I know we're all different.

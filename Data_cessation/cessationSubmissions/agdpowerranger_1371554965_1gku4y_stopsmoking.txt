Ran Yesterday.

Yesterday I went to the gym, which I've had a membership to for some time. I usually don't go, as I'm outrageously lazy. However, yesterday I went, thinking I'd get some cardio done now that I've been quit for 2 months.

For the first time in **years**, I ran for 30 minutes without feeling like I was about to die. More than that, I felt like I could have kept going. I wasn't out of breathe, my chest didn't hurt, and I felt amazing afterwards.

This morning, I'm noticing that I am coughing a bit more than I have been the last few days, but I take that as a good sign, that I'm finally breaking this stuff inside of me up and I'm getting healthier. I quit for financial reasons mostly, but this is the best feeling I've had since I quit. I can breathe, I can run again! It's incredible how good this feels.

How the fuck are day 4 and 5 worse than day 2 and 3

Yet I'm feeling more clear. It seems like I can remember things that I usually couldn't remember lol. 

It seems I also see much better how full of shit people are and myself being full of shit too but the last thing is hardest to see. I'm nerved out because of this. It's like you get new abilities that come with new responsbilities or am I just retarded? It's much easier to keep living in the mud. At the same time I think the more we smoke cigs the bigger is the void we create. People can tell us how ''chill'' we are while we are doing it but we are just falling deeper into a fucking void-hole.

People just get on my nerves.  Even being by myself is weird. My thoughts are contradictory and like someone else is acting out through me, some hateful idiot tired of everything.. Yet I see if I continue this path of smoking I'm only feeding that hateful idiot hitler who is going to come out and if he comes out in 20-40 years later and fucks my ass it's going to be a bad fucking time. LOL

Did this happen to you?

I have quit cold turkey for over a week now, and I get less cravings every single day. I was smoking half a pack a day for four years. I can now go hours without even thinking about cigs. But since I quit, i've been drowning in a wave of depression. The slightest inconveniences send me spiraling into a pit of despair. I tell myself that an issue can easily be fixed, but I cant help but feel hopeless. I prepared myself for the fits of anger and rage, but is depression also part of quitting? Or have I been self medicating with nicotine, and the smoking cessation has revealed issues that were previously dormant. Please let me know what some of your experiences were when you began to stop smoking.

Like losing a good friend

I am on day 6 quit. 26 years smoking. From all the posts here, I was expecting the first three days to be real hard physically. What I did not expect was the palpable sadness whenever I was reminded that my cigarette buddies were no more. 

After each meal, or some other trigger, I would start to smile in anticipation of meeting my buddies, but then quickly realize they’re gone. No more. And this deep hurt and feeling of loss happens. 

It’s only for a few seconds, but enough to get my full attention. I learned though, that if I acknowledge it, I can go through it and keep from failing.

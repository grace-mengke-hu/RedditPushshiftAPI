85hrs! small accomplishments

I would like to thank everyone for posting and sharing their struggle and of course for the endless amount of tips. I really needed those these first 3 days. I know its not a lot of days but I'm taking it one day at a time. First time cold turkey. I have smoked for 11 years quit 2 years ago for 4 months with gums, but been thinking of quitting for a while. Three days ago I just decided not to buy another pack. Today feels like a good day. I will be going out into the world for the first as a non smoker today. Wish me luck.

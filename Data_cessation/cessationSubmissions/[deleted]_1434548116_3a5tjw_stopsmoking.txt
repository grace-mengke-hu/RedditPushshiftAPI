66 days!

..without a cigarette!

But I won't lie, I have craved one a lot. I bought myself an electronical cigarette yesterday (e-juice is nicotine free). My craving for cigarettes is completely gone, I'm actually surprised how effective it has been.

But is it wrong that I replaced it with an electronical one? What  do you guys think?

Edit: apparently I can't count either, 68 days ;)

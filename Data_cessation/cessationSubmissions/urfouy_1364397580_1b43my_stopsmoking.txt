What are your ridiculous justifications for smoking just one more?

It occurred to me that everyone's inner voice tells them a different thing in order to justify just one more cigarette.  Oftentimes, these thoughts are almost comically nonsensical.  For me, it's a reward thing.  My mind says, "Wow!  You haven't had a cigarette for 219 days!  You deserve a cigarette for that accomplishment!"  

Let's hear some of yours.  What does your inner voice tell you, and why is it totally wrong?  Maybe we can help each other identify triggers.

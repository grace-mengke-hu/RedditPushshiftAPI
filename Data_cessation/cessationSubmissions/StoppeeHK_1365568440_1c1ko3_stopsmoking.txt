Day 7, and it's my birthday!

Well yesterday I had a hateful day. Having given up several times previously, I remember now that, paradoxically, it can sometimes get harder the longer you don't smoke, once the initial zeal and determination have gone.  I am not using any nicotine replacement devices, but have smoked a couple of herbal cigarettes - is that bad??!!! I am enjoying being able to breathe easier, the clean feeling of my teeth, the pride in myself each time I don't cave in to the temptation. I'm using the SmokeFree app and love that my oxygen levels etc are the same as a non-smoker, but anxiously waiting for the risk of heart attack and lung cancer markers to decrease - currently not even 1% less likely than for a non-smoker! Thanks to everyone on here who is helping keep me strong.

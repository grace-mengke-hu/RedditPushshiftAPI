30 days smoke free, with a one time relapse

Have gone 30 days without smoking, except for a few puffs on a joint two weeks ago. Taste was bloody awful, disgusting. l Reset my Smoke Free app, and started counting again. Wish I hadn’t relapsed but I think my brain needed confirmation that cigarettes taste as bad as they smell.
My father can barely walk 50 meters without being completely exhausted thanks to a lifetime of smoking. I don’t want to be like that, it’s awful. One of my father’s best friends is in and out of the emergency room because of acute respiratory problems after a life of cigarettes... no thanks.

This is just a message to encourage others quitting that if I did it, you can too.
I tried quitting twice before and both times I started again at the three month mark so this time I’m staying very cautious and have already marked the 3 month quit date in my calendar so I can be extra cautious.

To those struggling to quit or who haven’t decided to yet, all I can share is this anecdote. I work in a vineyard with very steep slopes. When I was a smoker going from the lowest point to the highest on foot, a steep but short walk up, I would be completely out of breath not even half way through.
Now I can go up the hill with a light jog and get to the top without even breaking a sweat !!! Let me tell you, it’s an incredibly powerful feeling coming from a wheezing coughing zero energy cigarette slave !!! I’m free !!!

Lost two folks to smoking this week

Sorry to be somber, but lost an uncle to lung cancer from life long smoking this week, at age 62. Unreal and whole family is crushed.  We also lost a family friend this week as well, 2 days after uncle passed away.  He too was a heavy smoker, had COPD, and never woke up after going to bed.

Sobering and heart breaking. If you are thinking of quitting, please give it your best effort.

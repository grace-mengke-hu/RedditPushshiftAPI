Keep it up, you can do it!

I was on tabacco rolling papers,  +30 a day, 20 years. 

Now I am clean (cold turkey 24 november 2014) for 1,5 years! 

Thanks to you all. This forum really kept me going. 

For those out there who are still on the cigarette: do it! STFU and do it. Embrace /accept the fact that your mind will tell you all sorts of bullshit. 

I really thought I wouldn't heal from my addiction ever, and even now I have hard moments (my doctor says: 2,5 years is needed to really reset the brain...), but it is very good to do right now. It will get better! For everyone. 

Do it!

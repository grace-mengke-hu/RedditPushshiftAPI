I'm 27 years old. I have been smoke-free for 227 days after smoking for 10 years.

I just wanted to share this with everyone. I know my story isn't unique but I hope someone can connect with it. 

I started smoking for a lot of reasons. I really just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I was curious. I can remember being 16-17 and physically smoking several times a day to try to become addicted. I know it was a weird thing to do, but it seemed so interesting to me. 

Before long, I didn't even realize that I was. 

I swayed up and down from 1/2 pack to 1 pack day depending on where and what I was doing. I tried vaping for a while, and it worked for a few months, but I fell off that wagon. 

The last month I could really feel it in my chest. I woke up every morning coughing and hacking and actually kind of struggling to breath. I knew enough was enough. I was only 27 but I knew if I smoked 10 more years my life would end because of a silly teenage curiosity. That morning I had a flight to catch; a long one. I sat at an airport in London, smoked a cigarette on the curb and got on my plane. 

I landed at home 10 hours later and made the choice on the way over never to ever smoke again because I really really wanted to quit. 

I have been successful because I:

1. Have never accepted excuses to smoke. "It's just one and I'm drinking, nobody cares right!?" 
2. Took on feeling sorry for other smokers when I would see how stressed they were for a drag as little as 2 or 3 days after I quit. 
3. Immediately recognized the health and financial benefits in less than a month. 

Good luck to everyone! I firmly believe if you're ready to honestly quit, you will. Just stop. Now. 

Have a great day.

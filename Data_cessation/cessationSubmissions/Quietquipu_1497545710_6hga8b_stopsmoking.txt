Today is the day!

I've been smoking for 12 years and I am now committed to successfully quitting. I am tired of waking up panicked thinking I have cancer or that there is a blood clot working it's way to my heart. I am tired of gasping for breath after walking a few blocks. I am tired of being ashamed of my nasty habit and trying to hide it from my family and co-workers. I am tired of being dependent on cigarettes to soothe my anxieties and depression. And at 30 I am so not ready for the ramifications of smoking on aging.

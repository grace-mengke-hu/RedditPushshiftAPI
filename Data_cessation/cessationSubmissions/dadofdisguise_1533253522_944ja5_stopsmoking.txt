The good smells, oh my!

I will hit  75 days in a few hours and I can't believe I've made it this far! Quitting was such a good decision for my life and I wanted to share a funny thing that happened.

 I haven't had any sense of smell in years due to the smoking and it's really bothered me from time to time, but I was standing in the shower getting ready for work today and it just hit me all of a sudden. I thought, what is that smell? I haven't smelled anything in years and I realized it was the shampoo I was using. Wham,  all of a sudden I could smell again? What?? I was totally in shock and started smelling anything I could get my hands on like the  body wash, candles, powders,  just anything. I'm at work now and it's a good thing I work alone in the building because I've been running around like a mad man smelling anything and everything I can, LOL! What an amazing feeling to have this sense back again. I just wanted to share another benefit to quitting. Now, I'm off to see what else I can sniff out! Best of luck to all the new quitters out there you can do this!!

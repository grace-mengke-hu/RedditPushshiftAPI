A present to myself.

My birthday was this last Sunday, and my gift to myself was to finally be free of nicotine. That day was the first day in a long time where I actually felt like I accomplished something worthwhile...I feel like a new person. I'm exercising again, saving more money for my future....hell, I'm even going back to school next month. My mother, who has smoked since 1974, decided to quit cold turkey last week, and I couldn't be more proud of her! 

When you quit, you don't just stop smoking cigarettes, you're getting rid of a part of yourself that has done nothing but hold you back.

3 weeks since I quit, I feel dizzy, lightheaded and tightening in my chest. Too paranoid

Ok let me start by saying going to the doc isn't an option right now.
I am 31 and have been hearing too many news of cardiac arrest so now every slight symptom I have related to it, I go berserk! 
It looks like I have anxiety attack but it feels so real at the moment. It is not a constant thing which makes me feel stupid. My anxiety needs to be controlled as well. Did anyone else feel so paranoid or go through similar withdrawal? Anything to put my mind at ease?

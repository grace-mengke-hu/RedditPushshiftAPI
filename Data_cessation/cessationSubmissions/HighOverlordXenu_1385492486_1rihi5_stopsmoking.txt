How long until food tastes right again?

Girlfriend quit about a week ago, and she's really starting to complain of a bad taste in her mouth and the fact that nothing tastes good. Even Nutella, essentially her favorite food in the world, tastes unbearably bad.

I know that this is normal, but given that American Thanksgiving is the day after tomorrow, is there any hope her taste buds will be back to normal in time? If not, how long does it usually take to heal?

complicated mental health issues and stopping smoking

hello you lovely people, i have got a quick question for you all. I have severe ocd and cptsd, and the symptoms just drive me up a wall when i try to quit. I quit for a week, for two weeks and for about 3 weeks at different points in time. every time I quit, the things i was struggling daily got worse. when i started back again, they got even worse for the first week, then I slowly got back to the "managable" state. I was wondering if any of you struggled with something like this.

I hate smoking and I really would like to quit. I feel immense guilt every time I light one, i feel disgusting and shitty, but the predicament im in makes me continue smoking. I would appreciate some tips and tricks from you all.

2 and a half months smoke free, and still getting intense cravings. Advice from any long term quitters?

As title says, I'm still getting the odd intense craving a couple of times a week. I quit 2 and a half months ago after smoking for 8 years, and haven't touched a single cigarette since. Do long term quitters still get cravings, or do they fully go away?

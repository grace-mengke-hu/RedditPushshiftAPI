1 year today

Today (July 25th) marks one year smoke free for me.  However, it also marks two other important anniversaries.

Today also marks one year since my wonderful aunt was admitted to the hospital with breathing difficulties, later to be found to be caused by a mass in her left lung.  That lung was removed in October of last year.  Coincidentally, today is also this aunt's birthday.  I found out about the hospital after I had started to quit.  

This lovely, brave, creative, kooky aunt died this past May, just a couple of days after my birthday.  Even with the operation and chemo, the cancer spread to her bones and her body just couldn't fight it any longer.  

The stress, the guilt, the fear, all of it made me want to smoke again over the months.  I fell into a deep depression for months, something I'm barely working my way out of right now.  I saw a lot of myself in this aunt, and I feel like I failed her when she needed me most.  

I took this energy and started to live a most physically healthy life.  I'm happy to say I stayed away from smoking, and have lost about 35 lbs in the last 4 months.  I'm working on my mental health, too, but that is more of a process.  Going to the gym 6x a week gives me an outlet for my anxious energy and provides a sense of accomplishment (it also reduces the hours sitting around thinking about...everything).  Being more conscious of what I'm eating gives me a sense of control and power.  I'm not dieting exactly, just making better choices and spending time researching and cooking.  

It's possible to do it.  And it's totally worth it.

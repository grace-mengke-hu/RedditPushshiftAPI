A big win for me.

Today, I was enjoying a drink with my best friend. He and I have smoked the same brand since high-school, when we started smoking together. He offered me a cig and I turned him down. I feel unbelievably proud of myself and suddenly quitting doesn't feel so difficult. I am 10 days without a cigarette.

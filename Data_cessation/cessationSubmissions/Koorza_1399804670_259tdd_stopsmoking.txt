Question about withdrawal symptoms

For the first time in my live I have managed to quit for almost 2 weeks. 

I didn't really experience much of the withdrawal symptoms. But lately I'm experiencing dizzyness and nausea when sitting down, as well as weird stomach cramps. expecially when I am hungry. I also have difficulties concentration. Could those be withdrawal symptoms? 

I did some major life changes since I quit smoking and I thought those symptoms were because of those changes. I didn't even made the connection that it might be because of the qutting.

Also went to my doc. She told me I have low blood pressure and gave me pills, but they make me feel weird and I would prefer not to take them.

6 Years since I last had a smoke.

[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/flwqu/tried_chantix_it_is_really_is_working_for_me/) to all of you dealing with struggles it gets better. I know its hard but if you can keep it up there is a light at the end of that tunnel. To those who don't like chantix I have a friend who also quit with welbutrin. Don't be afraid to seek help from a doctor if what you are trying is not working for you.

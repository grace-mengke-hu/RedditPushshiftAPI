Cigarette Alternatives?

Two weeks ago I woke up hungover and frustrated with myself and I soaked my half-pack of Turkish Golds and said I was quitting. I've been doing fine, although I had a puff off of my friends Spirit in a moment of weakness. I think I've realized that I really do supremely enjoy the taste of tobacco, but I don't have the money or inclination to continue smoking cigarettes habitually. I thought maybe smoking a tobacco pipe once a week, whilst reading a book or having friends over might be a more suitable alternative. Has anyone had any success with this sort of method, or would they suggest it to others?

Slipping into Madness

But I'd rather be a volatile explosive maniac bouncing off the walls and talking a mile a minute than deal with another fit of coughing.

I've read this is the worst day. I hope this is the worst day. Except days four, and five. Well SCREW THEM! How about that, future days? FUCK YOU AND YOUR TEMPTATION.

It's all quite funny. The brain takes time to re-wire itself, I guess.

I feel like running outside in the cold in my boxers and screaming up and down the street as I flail my arms frantically while I foam at the mouth BLARGHGARHGAHRGAHGRHAGRHG.

If it comes down to it, I'm going to choose that over having another smoke.

Anyway, I had to vent. I hope you guys are all staying strong in your resolutions!

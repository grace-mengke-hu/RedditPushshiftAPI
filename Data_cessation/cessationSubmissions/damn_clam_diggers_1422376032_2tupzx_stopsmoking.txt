You know what? I'M DONE.

I have always known of this subreddit but never came here once. When i decided it was "time to quit" cigarettes I knew I would come here. I came here just five minutes ago and read a thing or two. What the hell is this "time to quit" shit, shawty?? The time is now. I have smoked since I was fifteen I am 22. My last cigarette was thirty minutes ago at 10 a.m., 1/27/15.
Knowing this post is here, and somebody has read it, will 100% deter me from having another "just one more" smoke ever again. All four of my biological grandparents have died of cancer and even if that is my fate, why add any more fuel to that fire? I will be tough. I know..... but i can do it and I will. Heading to work 12-10, not taking my cigarettes with me.
Will be on afterwards. 

I cannot post this on my main from mobile, idk why. It says "too many links submitted recently" but that is not the case.  Anyways good luck, and I'm here to stay. Will support  others, as well as rely on support from others,  as we all take a giant step in improving our short lives.

EDIT: twelve hours down. So far it's a little strenuous, i know the worst will be first thing after I wake up. I made it through a shit day at work unscathed, maybe a little cranky but I try not to  project those feelings outwards to other people. I told my coworkers DO NOT BUM ME CIGARETTES NO MATTER HOW MUCH I BEG!

back to zero

I made it a little over a week. and I let myself give into the "I'm stressed and I'm having 2 cigarettes and then I'm done!" and then I did the same thing the next day. and the next.

So now i know. for real. not even once. (and yes, I've read Allen Carr). Anyway, requested to have my badge removed and a new one. I AM NOT A SMOKER!

my anxiety is killing my btw. ugh.

24 days!

I made it through the holidays! I almost had a moment of weakness when my cousin (who knew I had quit) offered me a cigarette. I declined and her response was "Good job! I'm going to go tell your mom I'm proud of you!" wtf? 

I joined a gym and today will be my first time going. I'm really nervous, but it's exciting that I can actually breathe and make positive changes in my life.

Day 365, no ciggs. This could be you in one year. AMA (if you want).

I smoked for the better part of ten years and after a lot of putting off I decided to quit last year on August 16th (AMA about this process). It was tough at first but at a certain point the good feelings that come from succeeding begin to outweigh the shitty feelings that come along with quitting. You would be amazed what quitting does for your self-esteem, not to mention the impact on your health and personal finances. I estimate that I saved about $1,456 over the past year by not smoking, money that I then used to take two sweet-ass vacations in California and Florida. I'm even dating a girl right now who told me I would have had zero chance with her as a smoker. YOU CAN DO THIS!!! Don't let cigarettes make you a slave. Man the fuck up and take control of your universe. Your success or failure is completely in your hands.

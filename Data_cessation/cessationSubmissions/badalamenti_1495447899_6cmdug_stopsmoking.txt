After 3 weeks, i'm kind of angry all the time. Advice?

 So i'm 25 days smoke free now. It's been quite a journey so far. I feel better health wise, i can breathe easier, i can exercise easier (i started gym on the day 1 of quitting), i can taste everything, i can drive my car with my windows closed and feel nice and clean (one of the biggest problems of mine was that i felt dirty, inside and outside of my body). 
 That being said, i feel like i'm losing it at this Getting Angry Really Fast game. My dad says something that i don't like - i begin to have an attitude immediately, the dealer doesn't have an item on stock - i begin to get angry and leave the work undone. I'm 26 and smoked for 7 years, the pack a day deal.  
 As context, we struggle with some financial problems, working at a new house and next year i've planned a wedding with my girlfriend. Everything is stressful, but i feel that this is the way life is and i have to change myself somehow. I blame the cigarettes for this, am i wrong?
 Any advice, any thought, anything is welcomed.  
Thanks!

NOPE, my story

Well I was told to tell my story, kind of, I think, anyways, I started smoking when I was 15, I'm 23 now, it started after school, I had an older friend who smoked, who I smoked with, it carried into high school where I took welding and woodshop which took 4 hours out of my day, so I've smoked a decent amount, recently my niece (I say recently but she's 1 1/2 now) damn time flies, I want to be around to watch her grow up, my health wasn't anything I ever took into consideration until she was born, I just threw away my probably 40th quiting pack, but this time I can feel it in my heart that I mean it, I want to stop, so thanks for yalls time

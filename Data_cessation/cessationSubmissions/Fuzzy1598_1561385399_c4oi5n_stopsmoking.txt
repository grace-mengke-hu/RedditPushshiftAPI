Greatest Test!

Yesterday was the greatest test I had so far. My good friend came up to visit for a day trip, and I met him at his parents house. 4 out of the five people that where there smoked. It was difficult telling myself no but I made it through! I was proud to go home and tell my wife I didnt even have a single puff!

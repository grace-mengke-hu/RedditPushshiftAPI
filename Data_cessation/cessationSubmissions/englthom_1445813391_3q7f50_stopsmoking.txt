Day 5 and my job is stressing me out.

I'm on my fifth attempt to quit in the last year and it's hard. My biggest trigger is work. I hate my job and have been unsuccessful in finding a job that will pay me on a similar scale. I used to smoke on every break just to stay sane. It's really wearing me out, but I'm  just trying to stay strong.

Does anyone have advice to quitting in this kind of environment?

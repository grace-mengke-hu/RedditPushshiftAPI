Any people who quit their daily smoking habits enjoy the casual cigar without being full blown addicted to cigs again?

Hey 3 months with no cigs/tobacco/etc. Sending good vibes to all who are trying to stop!!! Feels great but canâ€™t help but daydream about the occasional blunt on the beach. Do you guys ever indulge in the occasional cigar/blunt?

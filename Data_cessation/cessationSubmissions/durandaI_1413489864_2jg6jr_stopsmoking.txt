69 days in

I have an infection in the root of one of my molars. It's been killing me for about a week, finally got it fixed today. The minds a funny thing... since the pain was gradual, there was never a point where I thought 'now it's unbearable', instead, it slowly crept in until it became so overwhelming that all I could do, even with pain killers, was sit and keep my head to one side against a pillow and just basically experience the pain. 

For a day and a half, my life was the pain, and it was so strange, you kind of just slip away around the pain until the pain is the rule of your life. This isn't the first time I've been in constant pain, but it was the most intense.

This all took just a week, the process. From my tooth being kinda sore to being incapacitated. Then I went in today, and they numbed up my tooth, and they took out most of the infection, and now I'm on a course of antibiotics and my tooth is going to get better (still need to re-crown it though)

Most importantly, though, I *feel* better. Oh, my god, it feels so much better. Like I'm alive again, though I know that sounds really dramatic, it's true. I hadn't eaten in two days and I've been inhaling food nonstop since I got home. 

And I feel so elated right now, it's hard to really express it. The pain had, briefly, become the rule of my life. Now that it's not there anymore.

Plus, I'm not smoking cigarettes anymore. So I got that going for me, which is nice.

DAE Try to Justify?

I know it's the nicotine. I know it's trying to f*** with my head. Yet, I can't help but sit here and think "Maybe I'm just not ready to quit right now, and I just can't do it yet. I'm not all in." It's like I'm trying to come up with excuses that will let me smoke. 

Part of it is the main reason I am quitting is because of the negative health risks. The thing is though, I eat right and lift weights 5 days a week so otherwise I'm healthy, and being only 26 years old - the risk of negative health is so far away, It's hard to see it. 

Why can't I just smoke and NOT potentially die? This is the crap going through my head today.

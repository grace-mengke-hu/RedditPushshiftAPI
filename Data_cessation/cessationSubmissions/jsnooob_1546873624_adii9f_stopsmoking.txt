10 months in and I still think smoking is good

So like the title says its been about 10 months I've smoked and its been great (physically). I can breathe easy, no more chest pains and anxiety. I've put on a couple of pounds but that's okay.

Advantages all over but I can't get rid of this voice in my head that tells me smoking is awesome and relaxing. It happens almost on a daily basis and most of the times I seem to agree. It is just willpower that has been holding me back and worried about consequences when that gives away.

I read posts all the time about people who say they realized how useless smoking is in a few days or weeks. And I here at 10 months still have the cravings.

What is happening? I feel this is all at a mental level and want to get rid of it, any tips?

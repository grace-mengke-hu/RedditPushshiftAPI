What does it mean ‘you get your taste/smell back’ and what’s up with the 3rd day?

I’m only 1 day and 16 hours without the cig. But i can see people saying that the 3rd was the biggest struggle.. honestly it’s hard now and I can’t imagine that I will get through the 3rd day as today was really hard for me.. and what is with that I got my taste back.. like what’s different? Is it really that noticeable difference in taste or smell ?

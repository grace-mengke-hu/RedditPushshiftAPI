I start my journey tomorrow

Today after 4 years of using nicotine products I went to the doctor because I am ready to quit and willing to do whatever it takes to kick my habit. I was prescribed Chantix and I begin taking it tomorrow morning. I am excited but also a bit nervous, the side effects list is very long and I do have a history of depression and anxiety. I’m worried my symptoms might worsen or come back so I will be very aware of my mental state during this process. I will be on here frequently during my journey. Your help and support will go a long way ❤️

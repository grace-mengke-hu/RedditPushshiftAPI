Thinking About Quitting

I started smoking at 16, and smoked for about a year-and-a-half until I got pregnant and quit cold turkey. I started again in late 2011, and have been smoking since (except for 11 days in 2012 when I tried the patch), so about 6 and a half years total.
I want to quit because I'm worried about long-term health consequences, and I don't want my son to grow up with a smoker mom.

For at least a year now, I have been smoking only half a cigarette each time I go out to smoke, and just recently, I've forced myself to only smoke every hour or less, which equals 8 full cigarettes a day. Once I get used to this amount, I'm not really sure where to go from here. Do I cut it down to 1/4 of a cigarette every hour, or half a cigarette every 1.5 hours? Is tapering even a legitimate way to quit? I'm open to vaping (in fact that's how my husband quit), but I just don't like how you don't get the satisfaction of finishing an e-cig like you do a real one, plus I like the taste of real cigarettes. Is there any way to make this easier?

I also deal with anxiety and am a stay-at-home-mom/wife, so smoking is both calming and eases my boredom, so I need something to do in place of smoking. 

Any advice, tips, stories (except for telling me how horrible it is for my body), etc. are appreciated!

11 days strong!

15 years as a smoker, I only quit once for a good 8 months then somehow slid back down the slope. I have confidence that if you truly want it, you can have the freedom from cigarettes. 
As a nudge of encouragement to all of you out there, last night I resisted my first encounter with a smoker friend. Boy was it seemingly delicious to possibly partake in a little smoke with him but after my 11 day progress I had the motivation to hang on! The holiday tomorrow will be difficult but I have a vape to get me through. If you have to vape, patch, chew, eat or exercise, just DO it! Once you get through the first couple months (I tell myself also) you will feel healthier than you even know!

This time feels so different, I feel free rather than inhibited!

I’ve been a smoker for about 5 years, starting in my late teens working at Taco Bell. I have a family history of lung disease, my mother always smoked and I hated it, my grandparents detest it, and honestly I’ve hated it too. My car would reek because I only smoked while driving and during work, and it was embarrassing giving people rides. I love to smell good and wear perfume, but smoke would always overpower my curated scents. I’ve tried quitting many times before, half heartedly without doing any habit changing or support, and of course failed. After changing so many things in my life the last four or so months, smoking is really the last devil on my back to throw off. My mental state is clear with therapy, introspection, and self-care, and my body is becoming vibrant through low carb vegan eating, adaptogens and nootropics. I just wanted to share my hope for finally quitting literally poisoning myself every day with you guys. 

I want to encourage other people to look inward and make lists of why you like smoking, and why you hate it and be totally honest with yourself. There are parts of smoking I absolutely love, mainly the social aspect of it. Being truthful leads to identifying the weaknesses that lead of relapse, and once you know what’s holding you back, you can conquer it. You can’t fight what you don’t know. Coming to terms with that and making the choice to not smoke feels empowering and triumphant. Choosing freedom from addiction is a marvelous thing, remember that.

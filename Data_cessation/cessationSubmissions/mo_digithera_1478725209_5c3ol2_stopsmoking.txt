Introducing Quit Genius, the worlds first CBT Quit Smoking app. We are looking for smokers to test out the app!

Hey my name is Mo, I'm a doctor from London, and I'm one of the creators of Quit Genius. **Quit Genius is the worldâ€™s first personalised CBT app designed to help you quit smoking.** You can find out more at http://www.quitgenius.com/

We have essentially created a 4 stage programme that will last around 4 weeks, and uses CBT (or cognitive behavioural therapy) to help you quit. We believe that CBT is one of the most powerful and effective methods to help you quit **FOR GOOD**. The challenge was if we could do it all through an app.

We are getting ready to launch early next year but at the moment we are looking for any smoker to help us test out the app.
We will give you a FREE copy of the app if you agree to give us some feedback after using it! Currently we only support iOS; so it only works with iPhones and iPads!

So if you are, or know of any smoker who **wants to quit**, who **wants to try out this amazing new app**, and wants to help us make the best quit smoking app out there, please comment or private message me your **email** and preferably your apple ID, and I can get a copy of the app over to you.

Thank you, and best of luck with quitting!

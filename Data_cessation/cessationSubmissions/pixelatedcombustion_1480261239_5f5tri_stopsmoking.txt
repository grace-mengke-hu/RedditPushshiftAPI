46th day. Not a good day.

I have been quit for 46 days and the cravings seem to be getting worse recently. It probably doesn't help that my boyfriend still smokes in the house. I am getting stressed and angry about the smallest of things and can't help but to lash out at whoever is nearest. I want to kill my boyfriend and throw myself down the stairs. I'm a depressed loser anyway and smoking probably isn't the worst thing I could do.

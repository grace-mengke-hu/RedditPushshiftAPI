I just went through a bad breakup. I need the strength to quit!

My ex honestly brought out the worst in me. He happened to be a smoker too, and I knew that as long as I was with him, I’d be struggling to quit. 

I’ve tried to quit twice before. The longest I’ve gone is 10 days, then I got in a terrible fight with the ex and I was right back to smoking again.

What has been the most successful method for you guys? I know the mindset is a huge part of the battle, but I’m struggling to kick the habit. I’ve tried a vape pen, and I was also on Wellbutrin at some point but had to quit because it was nearly impossible to sleep or eat.

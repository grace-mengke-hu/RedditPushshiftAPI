Holy shit I want a smoke today

Today is the first day that I can't get smoking out of my mind.  I drink a liter of water and my brain says "SMOKE", I have a green tea and my brain screams "SMOKE MOTHERFUCKER".  I'm chewing through all my gum and cant stop fidgeting.  I was thinking the worst was over, but I am now learning it isn't.  I am not going to give in though, I like being a non-smoker too much.

Edit: I feel much better now.  Went for a nice big lunch and it tasted excellent.  Thanks for the support, you guys/gals are great!!

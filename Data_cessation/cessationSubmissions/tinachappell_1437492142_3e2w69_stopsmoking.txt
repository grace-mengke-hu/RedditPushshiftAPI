Mind over matter

I am 23 days smoke free.....I am using the Smoke Free Beta app and it suggested i post the things that has helped me resist smoking. Out of all the different tricks i have tried, the one that has helped the most was just me telling myself that something as small as a cigarette, tobacco rolled in paperwill not have have control over me!!!! Good luck to all that are quitting.....

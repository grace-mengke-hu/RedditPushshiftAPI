A real live display of willpower!

So I'm finally taking this step in my long list of many that will make me the man I want to/should be. I've been on the Step 1 nicotine patches for 1 week and even then I succumbed on 3 seperate times and smoked a cigarette. (In one case even while still wearing the patch, smh.) 

Well I decided yesterday that I will continue without the patch today and actually decide to quit  smoking cold turkey. I'm not gonna lie, today was a very stressful day and I wanted to smoke badly.

My mom wants me to quit and wants to be supportive and all, but also isn't really that aggressive in stopping me from smoking. This afternoon she offered me a cigarette and I took it, but just held it and kinda rolled it through my fingers. I did not smoke it. :) I feel pretty good about it. Day 1 but hey it's been a tremendous change from a week ago and even more drastic from a month ago. 

Keep it up guys, I have terrible willpower usually, but I did it today. So can you.

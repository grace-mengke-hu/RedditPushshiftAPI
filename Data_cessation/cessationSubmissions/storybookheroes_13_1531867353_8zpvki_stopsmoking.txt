I need help and support please!

Hi guys. I’m angry at myself because after five months of no smoking I did the dumbest thing I could. I hung out with a friend who is a chain smoker and thought I could have just one and be fine,  and that’s not true. I’m angry that I gave in, and now I’m starting all over again. Any support would be great right now. I appreciate it!!

Quit Cold Turkey 

I haven't had a cigarette in 3 weeks now. I haven't even really craved one. I got really sick with strep-bronchitis and got over it last week or so, and  still not craving. I'm 24 and started at 18, usually a pack every 3 days, so not a crazy heavy smoker but still. Has anyone else quit cold turkey?

edit: but i didn't quit smoking weed.

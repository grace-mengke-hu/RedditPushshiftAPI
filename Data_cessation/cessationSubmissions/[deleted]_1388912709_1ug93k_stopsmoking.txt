welp, starting over (would've been 85 days :-( )

They say don't even have one. Welp, that's how it started for me. I had about 65 days cold turkey quit under my belt and someone left a quarter pack at my house. I decided to smoke one, just to see... 

I felt dizzy and poisoned, but kind of buzzed. It was interesting. 

The next day, I didn't have any cravings, so I did it again. Just one. Still dizzy and buzzy. 

Third day, tried again, for fun. Maybe I can have an occasional smoke, I thought. The dizzy and poisoned feeling left and it felt natural again. 

A few days passed and I thought, "I want to smoke a pack today and then quit again. I'm a grown adult-I can do this if I want!"  

One pack turned into two packs a week, which led to a VERY quick downslope of smoking two full packs a day again. 

I enjoyed a *couple* of those cigarettes, but mostly they were awful and I was enjoying the feeling of keeping the cravings at bay. That's stupid. 

So, back to quitting again and that DELICIOUS FREEDOM of not having constant cravings all day long anymore. I miss that.

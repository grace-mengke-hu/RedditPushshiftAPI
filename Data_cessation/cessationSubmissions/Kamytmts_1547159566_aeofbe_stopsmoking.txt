Quitting when you have the flu somehow makes the first week easier!

I’ve tried a lot during this past year but I always give up after 3 days! I always make such a big deal, plan something and smoke a ceremonial last cigarette and write than the exact time and stuff but end up not sticking to it. There was one time that I made it to two weeks cause my mom was staying over but relapsed as soon as she left. 

This time, I was planning on quitting for good after finals but a few days ago, I woke up and realised I’ve gotten the flu. I only had one cigarette left and I was so sick the thought of going out in this cold to buy more was dreadful. I smoked my only cigarette and it felt awful; as it always does while having the flu. And I was like that’s it! This is the best time to quit, no fucking ceremonies needed!!

The first 3 days are always hard but this time it wasn’t hard cause I was so sick I wasn’t even thinking about cigarettes and as a result I had no craving. Also, the flu was irritating and shitty enough so withdrawal irritability didn’t even cross my mind! And now that I’m better, I feel like this time is different, i feel like this time I won’t relapse!

So if you’re trying to quit and flu makes you lose your craving, you should try quitting this winter! If you’re about to have a crappy week because of the flu, better add the crappiness of quitting on top of it and just get done with it!

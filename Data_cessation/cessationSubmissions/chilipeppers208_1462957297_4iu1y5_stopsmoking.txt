Messed up

I had been tobacco free for a month and a half until last night, when I bummed cigarettes from the good part of the night. I had just finished my last college final so I felt justified in a way. But of course it's no real reason to ever smoke. I guess it's time to pick up the pieces and start over. Wish me luck

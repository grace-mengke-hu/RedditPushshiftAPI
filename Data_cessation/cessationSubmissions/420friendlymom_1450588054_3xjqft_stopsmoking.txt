Failed at day 6

I have been using a vape pen and I basically just suck on that thing 24/7 when I'm not working and now the weekend hit and I was with a friend, who has successfully quit. Got home and had a smoke didn't even try to stop myself. 
I'm so mad at myself now. And honestly the cigarette didn't even satisfy how I'm feeling. So I hope I can just let the slip up slide. 

i think I need to try some more nicotine alternatives. I have tried the inhaler ... nope. I can't imagine a patch helping.
Wellbutrin was added to my med list last year which is supposed to help. But this sucks. 

This post is totally all over the place. Quitting sucks. Advice needed lol

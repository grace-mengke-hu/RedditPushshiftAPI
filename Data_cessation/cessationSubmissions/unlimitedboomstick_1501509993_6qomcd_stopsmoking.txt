Over a week and then I relapsed.

I was cigarette free for over a week and then I screwed up this morning.  I've been running a fever and light headed for the last day and a half.  I thought it might be withdrawl so I bought a pack. Smoked 3 and threw it away.  I regret it now but at least i know.  Plus they taste completely, unbelievably terrible to me now. I can do this.  Anybody else have something similar happen to them?

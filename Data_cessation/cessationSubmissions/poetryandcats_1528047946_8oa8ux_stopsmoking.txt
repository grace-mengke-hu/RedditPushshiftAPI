I can never make it one day.

I have a serious lack of direction in my life, and upon waking up I easily have three cigs within the first hour of the day. About a pack a day for 3 or so years now.

I’m 21, I’m healthy, I’m active, but I’m insanely impulsive and have a terrible line of addiction in all parts of my family. I feel so dependent on nicotine and I hate this dependence. I got a cheap vape, but it really doesn’t cover all that dirty smoky pleasure a cig hits you on the face with.

I feel so weak, like I’ll never be able to stop. But I really want to. This is mostly just a rant I guess, but I’d love some advice for anyone who’s ever tried weaning unsuccessfully, and feels cold turkey is the only option.

6 weeks and very depressed

Hey everyone,

I am currently in therapy, so I have this base covered. 

Since I stopped Smoking, I started loathing my Job, which I Had for a year now. 

I feel a lot of anxiety especially social anxiety and I tend to hide inside and feel very vulnerable to everything.

My main problem is that my Job needs me to be tough which was fine before. But now I want to cry at the smallest issue. 

So my question is: will this get better at some Point? Did anyone experience something similar? 

I am unsure If I should ask my doctor for new antidepressants or wait for it to get better (let's say for another 6 weeks or so)

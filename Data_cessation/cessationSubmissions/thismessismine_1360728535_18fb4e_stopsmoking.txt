How long do you think I should avoid drinking?

I'm about to attempt to quit again after a few failed attempts in the past.  Most of my attempts failed because I slipped up while drinking, but I didn't want to stop drinking on weekends because I am a college student and where's the fun in that?  I know it's personal and will vary depending on the person, but give me your best shot--how long do you think I should try to avoid drinking for to make quitting smoking more successful?  I am to the point where I want to quit so badly that I am willing to stop drinking for a while, too, but I don't know how long I should do so before allowing myself to drink again.  I want to be able to drink without smoking, of course.  Thanks!

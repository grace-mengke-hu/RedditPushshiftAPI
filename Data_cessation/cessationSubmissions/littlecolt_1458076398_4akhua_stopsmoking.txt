Well, here I go again...

So, I had been a long time quitter, with an exception, in that I had been using an ecig. I used the ecig exclusively for a long time, working down my nicotine levels gradually. Unfortunately, it seemed like as I got into lower and lower nicotine juices, I vaped more and more, to the point where I was vaping several times an hour. I would puff a few times every 10-15 minutes, really.

When I noticed how frequent I was vaping, which still irritates the throat when that frequent, I decided I was just sick of it all. I started forcing myself to wait longer and longer between.

Then, last week, I have no idea what possessed me, but I bummed a cigarette from a friend, and bam. I was buying a pack that night, cursing to myself as I smoked another. That pack is all smoked up now, and today marks me quitting again.

I told that friend not to bum me smokes anymore. He said no problem.

So I am back on my vape a little, but still trying to keep my vaping down to once an hour max. My ejuice is 2mg/ml. (I mix 4mg/ml with 0 nicotine juice to make 2mg juice, which isn't normally sold at the place I go. Anyway...)

After a couple more days, I will be out of nicotine-containing juice, and I do not plan to buy more. I have a couple bottles of 0 nicotine juice still, and I will probably go through it for the flavor of it, but after that, I plan to put away my vaping equipment. I'm going to toss the coil out of my tank so it's not usable.

So... this is day one of no smoking once again, and I will soon be nicotine free.

Wish me luck. I'll need it, and a lot of willpower.

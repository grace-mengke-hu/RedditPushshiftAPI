One month

Smoked daily from 15 to 29. Today is one month cold turkey quit. 
  I almost can't believe how much I smoked when I look at my app. I live with two smokers and somehow can't recall the last time I wanted to join them outside for a cigarette. 
  I still check in here to read and comment, but not out of desperation... just one of many new downtime activities.

   If you're still contemplating, just starting out, or wondering if it'll always suck to quit... just stick it out for a month and see for yourself- it's totally worth it.

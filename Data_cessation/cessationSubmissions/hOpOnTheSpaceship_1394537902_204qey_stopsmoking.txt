Fricken relapse after 14 days

So I got a really bad cold/cough two weeks ago and had no desire whatsoever to smoke for the next week because I was so miserable. Week number two was a little trickier but I was still feeling good about being a nonsmoker. Then I woke up this morning and could not shake the desire to smoke for some reason, it was really bizarre. So on my walk into work I bought a pack and smoked one and it tasted god awful, but I finished it anyway. Now I'm at work and all I can think about is how I want another when I get off. So needless to say I'm feeling pretty depressed right now, especially since I was doing so good. I feel I just threw the past two weeks down the drain and now I'm back at square one and it's going to be even harder to kick it this time. It's a terrible and helpless feeling. It's hard to believe that a substance as simple as nicotine can cause such complicated emotions and has the capability to ruin one's day. I hate it.

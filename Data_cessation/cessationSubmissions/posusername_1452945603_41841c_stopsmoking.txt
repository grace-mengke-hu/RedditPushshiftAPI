Day Four of Chantix

Hey guys! I started taking Chantix recently (four days ago, as the title states lol) hoping it'll help me finally quit this horrible habit. I'm scared, excited and optimistic but mostly scared. Not entirely sure why I'm so scared but there it is, I've finally *said* it out loud. My quit date is the 20th and I'm looking forward to adding my 1 day badge. I just wish it wasn't so damn scary. I guess smoking for 10 years does that; cigarettes have been just about the only constant in my life for that time. Enough is enough though... I need to improve myself. I want to be a completely different person within 5 years (my 25th birthday was on the 4th) and this is my first step. Wish me luck, guys! I'm going to need it.

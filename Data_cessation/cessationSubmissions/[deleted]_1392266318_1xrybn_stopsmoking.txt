How To More Efficiently Regulate Blood Sugar

So, here I am, going on day 23 and it's getting so much easier at this point. My guard isn't completely down, but I'm confident I've seen the worst of this. My main problem now is learning to regulate my blood sugar, which is something I took for granted due to nicotine's lovely insulin resistance side effect. Anytime I find myself irritable, depressed, or foggy minded, I eventually realize...it's my blood sugar! Sidenote:  Thanks to Joel Spitzer for pointing that out on his website, otherwise I would've never guessed it! Anyways, I'm asking how should I more efficiently regulate my blood sugar? I don't want to have to get pissed off, depressed, or foggy minded to realize it's time to go get something to eat!

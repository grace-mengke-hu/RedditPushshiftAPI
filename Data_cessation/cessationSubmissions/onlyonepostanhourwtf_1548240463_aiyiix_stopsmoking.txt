Girlfriend broke up with me. Found out she's been talking to other people. Quit partly for her. Have nobody to talk to. Felt like giving up and just smoking a pack and drinking tonight...

Going through the subreddit just looking to see if anything by some miracle would make me change my mind and read a post where someone mentioned that "Life will always have its ups and downs, smoking cannot change that" and thats exactly what I needed to hear. I knew that, but just seeing it said by someone else just really made a connection for me.

Emotional things will happen. The cigarette wont heal the pain, it will just numb it. I have to be able to handle life and emotional times without using substances. I will not smoke.

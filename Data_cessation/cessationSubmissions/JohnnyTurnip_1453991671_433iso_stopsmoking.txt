Day 5 - back to work and feeling the itch

Recently had a scare with a blood clot and I put it down to smoking. Gone cold turkey and on day 5 but the itch is getting to me. Any tips on how to beat the cravings while at work? just 5 puffs on a cig right now seems like heaven and all I need but I am not going to do it!

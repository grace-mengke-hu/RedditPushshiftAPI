23 days FREE!

I thought it was normal to feel old at 35.  I thought I was just a weak person with no willpower and that was part of my personality.  I had to plan social occasions so that I could still smoke.  I had to hide smoking from members of my family.  I must've stunk like a skunk around my kids - who didn't know me any other way. I smoked filterless for 16 years - what a frikkin WASTE!!! Then I discovered I was ashamed of all of that.
I have changed ALL of that.  I have taken back control of my life.  I have discovered that I have more willpower than I ever gave myself credit for. I have discovered I love to take long walks in the sunshine and breathe fresh air deep into my lungs. I have discovered the freedom of going wherever without the worry of not smoking holding me back. I feel FREE! No more excuses, no more secrets, no more regrets.  If I can get here folks, then so can you. Stay strong fellow quitters - life can be better than you ever imagined.

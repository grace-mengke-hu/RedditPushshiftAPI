I now know I can do this.

I throw parties quite often, like every weekend. All my friends smoke with the exception of my girl friend. I had 6 people at my house for a little party this past Friday and all of them smoke. I always smoke when I drink, but I didn't this time. They would go smoke every 30 or so minutes but I wouldn't, yes it was hard, yes it sucked, yes I wanted one. I didn't act on my urge and I'm proud of myself for that.

I know I can do this, cold turkey. I can do this, I will do this.

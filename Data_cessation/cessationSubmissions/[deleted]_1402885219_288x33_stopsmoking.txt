Incredibly cig'd out mind has pushed my motivation to it's action point

TL;DR: EFFFFF CIGS!

Finally, this will be my 4th time seriously attempting to quit, and I'm feeling quite confident in myself. I'm sick and tired of attempting to clear my throat at night.. smelling like cigs.. hiding my addiction from people.. feeling short of breathe.. and craving such an expensive habit. I broke what was left of my remaining pack with my bestfriend who also expressed a need to quit. We're both in this together, and we both understand we aren't leaning on each other for a break-down, but more towards support. Thanks for listening to this rant of mine! EFFFFFF cigs.

What will help you to give up smoking?

Push yourself to a new limit. Do long distance running. Make your heart pump hard and you can feels your heart talking. "If I'm not a smoker, I can run faster."

That's me during my first marathon last 2 weeks. I managed to complete it within 4 hours and 30 min. Since that day, I never have another puff.

How does a drunk stop smoking?

I'm an alcoholic, so I'm not real big on my own health.   My fianc√© has developed some heart trouble that landed us in the ER.  He has to stop smoking, so I do as well.  

I'd smoke myself to death, but I love him, and he won't stop unless I do.  

Is it impossible to quit for someone you love, and is it impossible to quit when you drink.  My habit is to take a hoot then smoke, and it's hard to fight that. 

Also, do I have to tackle alcohol at the same time?

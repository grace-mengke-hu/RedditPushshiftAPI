Short lapse

Hey all.
So last night after 2-3 weeks of abstinence, my mind fooled me and I lit up a smoke. I only took 2-3 puffs then I broke the rest of it, took the rest of the pack, broke it all and threw it away. It was only 2-3 puffs. I felt absolutely guilty and retarded. I felt mad at myself for about half an hour. I felt ashamed. The one thing I learned is that urges are strongest the longer you stay up. If you're awake at night by yourself and you're already tired, your mind can play tricks on you, and make stupid decisions. And even though I knew I should of been in bed, I stayed up an extra 45 minutes to make sure something I was downloading properly finished. I knew I should of went to bed early but I stayed up and my mind got the best of me. 
So, always listen to your gut. I know I'll go stronger from now, because the guilt and shame was really motivating for me. I never want to feel that way again. I never want to feel so pathetic. I never want to lie myself. When I say I want to do something, I want to do it and stick to my word. What kind of man am I if I can't be organized and have fortitude when things get a little bit tough?
Anyways I thought I would share. It helps me to get it off my chest.
Stay strong quitters! Never give in. It's never worth it! Not a single puff! Ever!

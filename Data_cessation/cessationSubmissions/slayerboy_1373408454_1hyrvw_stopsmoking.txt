ADD/ADHD masked by smoking?

Is it possible that I may have had ADD/ADHD for quite a while but smoking either masked it or caused it? At first I thought it might have been withdrawals, but the more I think about it, the more it seems like it's more of a lack being able to focus on something.

When I first quit, it felt like my brain was on fire and stopped working. But after not experiencing them for a week and just having them come back last night and today, it's more my brain just not processing anything and me getting pissed off about it, sometimes violently because it's rage inducing to not be able to concentrate for me at times. It's seemingly random and there's no rhyme or reason to when or why it happens.

I had zero problems with concentrating while smoking. And don't take this to mean I'm going to even think about smoking again. I quit with EasyWay, it's going to take a lot more than a lack of concentration to get me to poison myself ever again.

Anyone else experience this when they quit?

This time, will be the last time

I have for a long time considered stopping. Now is the time! 

I know I have to do other things, to distract me from my old habit; but what do I do when I suddenly stand outside with my friends, who still smoke? That is the time I get the most cravings..

Btw. I am 19 year old, and have smoked since i was 17-18. I really just want to stop, I dont want to be that guy; who smoked his whole life away!!

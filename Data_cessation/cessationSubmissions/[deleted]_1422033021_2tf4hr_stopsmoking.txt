Quitting smoking and dieting...

I'm trying hard to quit and I find myself craving tons of sweets.  This is hurting the weight loss I was currently on.  Anyone have any tips for dealing with cravings without being a total pig? 

Ex.  I ate an entire pack of Starburst (share size) in less than an hour and still went and bought more.

How much time do you think you waste smoking?

Stop and think about that. If you smoke 20 cigarettes a day, and you smoke them at a fast pace, you're probably taking at least 3-4 minutes a cigarette. that's between 60-80 minutes a day. 

Assume now you smoke slowly, and have to walk somewhere to smoke, and in total it takes you 10 minutes a cigarette from start to finish. You're wasting 200 minutes a day.

That is anywhere between 1 hour to 4 hours you're wasting on smoking a day. Assume you sleep for 8 hours, and you work for 8 hours, you're left with 8 hours of "you" time.

That means half of your free time is spent smoking. 

So one day late in the future when you're close to death, do you want to look back & tell yourself that you spent half of your free time smoking? Probably not.

if you're a smoker, now is the time to take control of your time again. If you're a successful non smoker, think about the TIME you have gained back in your life since you stopped.

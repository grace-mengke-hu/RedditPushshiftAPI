I've been working on creating a quitting plan to stop smoking. What tips can you give me to help me really quit for good?

I have tried quitting multiple times but I have always relapsed. I want to quit because my asthma has been getting worse and I don't want to get cancer or die earlier then I should. I find escaping smoking really hard because my girlfriend and a lot of my co-workers smoke so I am always around smokers. After a lot of thought as to what my new years resolution would be I decided I would quit smoking because I remember being younger and never needing a puff after a meal or to enjoy time with friends. I get depressed every time I relapse because I feel like a weak minded idiot for having such low self control. This is my first time coming to this subreddit however over the long period of time I have been with reddit I have been helped a lot in other ways and met great people. I have given myself till next Thursday to develop a plan to to really quit for good and would love some help from this community to make sure my goal is achieved.

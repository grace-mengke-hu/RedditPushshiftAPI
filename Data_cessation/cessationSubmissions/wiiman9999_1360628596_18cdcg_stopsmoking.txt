I've made a decision today. 

I haven't been smoking long, only about 4 months, but I've always found them to be comforting. I've decided today that it wasn't smart of me to start, so I'm quitting today. I just had the last of my pack, and decided I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I'm really quite excited, and just wanted to tell someone. :)

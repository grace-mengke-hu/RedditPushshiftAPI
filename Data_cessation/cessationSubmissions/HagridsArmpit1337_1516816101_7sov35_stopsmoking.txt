Hardly feel withdrawals

So I've quit for 5 days now and I hardly feel any withdrawals other than getting angry quickly when talking to people and a bit harder to concentrate/ foggy feeling, is this because I've only been smoking about 10 cigarettes a day for about a year? if so does that mean the withdrawals for me won't last as long as they do for most people that have been smoking for much longer?

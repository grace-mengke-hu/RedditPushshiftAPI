2 days and 6 hours in I had a cigarette, definitely don't want another one

As the title said, I quit two days and 6 hours ago now. I have an extremely good reason to quit (health related, private though) so I was able to stay away from smoking. Strangely enough I didn't have a single moment yet where it was like a mental need for a cigarette, I was only bored and felt like smoking would give me something to do. I found toothpicks to be very helpful. 

I had a cigarette about 10 minutes ago because I had a really eventful day and just felt like I wanted to smoke to confirm that I don't want to smoke. It tasted like shit, smelled like shit, made me dizzy and now my head hurts. I most certainly do not feel like smoking again. 

I'm also lucky to have a good support system in place, one of my friends even quit with me when he found out I'm quitting today. 

Another huge motivator is that thinking back on the last couple years, literally every single health problem I had has its roots in smoking exclusively, come to think of it if I was never a smoker I'd be healthy as hell. It's funny how at age 14 me and all my friends thought smoking was the coolest shit ever, now at nearly 19 we'd all love to go back and slap the life out of our younger selves for making that decision. 

Let's fuck it up!

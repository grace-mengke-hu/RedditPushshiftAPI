Reduction in sweating from quitting?

So in recent years while being a smoker, I noticed a significant increase in sweating during exercise and even while being just mildly warm. I almost had too have a fan pointed at my face 24/7 to be comfortable. I'm on day 17 of being nicotine free and I've noticed the excessive sweating has calmed down a lot. This is clearly a good thing but unexpected nonetheless. Did anyone else experience this phenomenon?

If you got sick after quitting smoking, it doesn't mean quitting smoking got you sick

A good rule of thumb is if you would go to a doctor over your symptoms if you weren't quitting, you should go to a doctor if you are quitting too. If you have a cold with bad symptoms, odds are good that smoking a cigarette won't cure them, and its completely unrelated.

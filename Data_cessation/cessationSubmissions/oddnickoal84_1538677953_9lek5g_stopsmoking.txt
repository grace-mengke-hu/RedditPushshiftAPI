My mom won’t stop smoking.

Hello, I am 16 and my mom is 39. She has been smoking since she was 15(?) and has tried stopping twice, that I know of. First time was about 4 years ago cold turkey and It lasted around 1 month. Last time was around a year ago, she used nicotine patches and it worked great. Until she forgot to bring them with her one day and had a craving. She decided to go grab some and smoke one but then got addicted again, and even worse. She smoked around 10 a day for about 8 months and then went to around 5. So far, she plans on getting nicotine patches but still buys at least 5 packs a week. I saw a headline a few weeks ago that said “If you stop smoking before 40 you’ll have 10+ years added to your life” as well as many other health benefits. But, she won’t stop.

Do any of you have any tips or things I could do/say? Thanks.

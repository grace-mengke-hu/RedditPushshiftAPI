One week down! I think I'm really doing this!

Went out drinking and didn't have a smoke? Check!

Went to a casino and didn't have a puff? Check!

Hung out with friends who smoked and didn't even take a cut? Check!!!

This sub Reddit has made this a lot easier for me. I still have some major hurdles to get pass but I believe I can cut cigarettes out of my life once and for all.

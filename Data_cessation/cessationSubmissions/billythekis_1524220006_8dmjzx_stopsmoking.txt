Need helpful advice on quitting this nasty habit! Argghhh...

So basically I’m a 25 yo male who works night shifts, I’ve been smoking on off now for about 5 years, I’ve been smoking daily for a few solid years now it actually shocked me when I thought about it. The first thing I do in the morning is have a cig and last thing I do is have one. I’m about a pack a day smoker, and I’ve now fully had enough! I rely on smokes to get me through stressful situations and to deal with day to day life which is scary. I’m totally hooked on them argh! Every day I say this is my last packet but always buy another. What’s are the best things to do to stop smoking !!!

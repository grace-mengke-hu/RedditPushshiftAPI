Had a terrible night at work.

So I work at a night club, and tonight was by far the worst night I've ever had in my 8 months there. I came back and my roommate was still awake, and I was bitching like a motherfucker. During my rant he pulled out two cigs and offered one (He smokes). And I was just like "No thanks." And then I realized that it had never crossed my mind to have a cig throughout this terrible night, or afterward while I was ranting. Pretty cool. It does get easier guys.
edit: And thanks for being here. This subreddit has helped a great deal.

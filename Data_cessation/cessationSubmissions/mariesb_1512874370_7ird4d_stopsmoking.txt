Cutting patches

Hey, I’m five days into using nicotine patches with the highest dose. This morning I wanted to go down a dose so I decided to cut a patch in half and use that, but I read today that exposure to air makes them less effective. If I keep the plastic backing on the part I’m not using, and then apply it the next day, will it make a huge difference in effectiveness?

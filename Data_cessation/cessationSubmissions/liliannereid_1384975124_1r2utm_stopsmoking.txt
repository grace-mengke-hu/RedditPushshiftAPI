On third day, not doing so well.

Feeling very restless, angry and annoyed - really want to shout at everyone around me and at the same time I just want to lie down and cry. It's difficult to sink into tasks enough to detach. I really feel like the only thing that could help me right now is a smoke. God, I hate it, I hate this. But!! It's the tobacco that got me here, so I'm going to hate the tobacco instead of me not smoking any of it. Stupid tobacco. Fucking tobacco. Shithead tobacco.

First time, long time...

Hi all, 

I think I've officially quit smoking. I've been lurking here for weeks and trying to figure out a plan to quit like I have so many times before. (Even quit for 6 months straight once... but succumbed to it for another two years after one drag of a friends smoke.)   

But today when my SO and I went to WaWa (shout out to those in the know) I just didn't want to buy a pack. 

Lately, after almost a decade of smoking they've been tasting gross and pissing me off. I think I'm just kind of over it. I'll miss the faux rock and roll image of it but at the end of the day it's really just got me annoyed.

TL;DR: How do I keep up the quit smoking momentum? Especially considering almost all my friends and live in SO smoke. I shared my last smoke with my SO this morning around 8am EST and haven't smoke since. (2:27est at time of writing)

You lot are pretty cool. Thanks for the sub!

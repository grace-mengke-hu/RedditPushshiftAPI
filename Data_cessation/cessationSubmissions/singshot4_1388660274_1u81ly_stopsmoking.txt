one month!

Will you look at that, it's been a month already! to everyone on here keep pushing especially you beginners, the first week is hell but after that you can taste the freedom and my god does it taste and feel awesome! Food smells and tasted much better, which is good because you appetite will soon come back. Breathing and sleeping and running all just so much easier now. I wish you all a happy new year and to those who have just started, my advice is to use this subreddit some of the supportive people on the internet!

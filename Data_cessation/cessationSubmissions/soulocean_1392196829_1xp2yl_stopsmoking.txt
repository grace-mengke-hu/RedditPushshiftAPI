Almost 2 months smoke free

Well, not exactly, as I did smoke 2 sticks about 10 days in. Nonetheless, it's still 280++ cigarettes not smoked.

First off, I have to say that I have smoked for 10 years, roughly 5 sticks a day. It was a good pastime, with many distinctly different 'benefits', from waking me up to relaxing my mind.  

The thought to quit smoking started after learning how 2 of my friends quit smoking. One month later, I started reducing smoking only one a day on my current pack and basically stopped after finishing that pack.

The first 2 weeks were fine and I could withstand the cravings, which goes off by itself after 5 minutes (I actually look at a stopwatch or listen to a song while waiting for the craving to subside). It is the hard times that the cravings are extremely strong. 

The day I gave in to the cravings was on the night my girlfriend broke up with me (we got back together a week later). Met up with my friend later that night and took 2 cigarettes from him. The first stick felt good in the first few seconds, but the 'high' quickly subside; the second stick just taste horrible and made me nauseous. I realised that I no longer like it.

The cravings basically stopped after the day and I also stopped avoiding smoking premises and smokers as the best way to solve problems is by confronting them, not avoid them.  This is actually the longest time I have not smoked despite quitting several times.

Anyway, I'm will be starting my new job next Monday, which will undoubtedly be more stressful than my previous job.  Just wondering how do you guys cope with the cravings that came during the stressful/ difficult times?

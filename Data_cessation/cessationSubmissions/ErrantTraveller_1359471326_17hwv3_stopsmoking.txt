Resetting my badge today.

Well /r/stopsmoking, I have to apologize to you.  I know that that I said I was done and that we could do this together, but I let you down.  I was having a pretty wild time this weekend, and ended up succumbing to temptation.  I'm so pissed with myself about this, but the real pain was sending the message to the badge bot to reset my start date.

But I'm not done, and I'm not going to let this beat me.  I've started again, and it's not fun, but I am sincere about this commitment to quitting.  I realize in the short and long term I'm going to have to change some of my habits to make this work.

Luckily I'm surrounded by good people who care about me.  One of my coworkers offered to take me out for a couple bottles of wine if I could make it too months.  My parents and brothers are totally supportive, even when I stumble.  And I know that all of you will be there for me, as long as I don't give up.

Thanks /r/smoking.  Thanks for being there for me.

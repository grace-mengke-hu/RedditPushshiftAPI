Near death experience really scared me today, I am going to quit smoking for good this time...

I've been smoking since 17, I'm now 31 years old. I don't considered myself a chain smoker, a pack usually last me 2-3 days. I've been feeling some lightheadedness and having a hard time breathing for a few weeks but I thought it was the allergy or lack of sleep.

Today, I almost blacked out for not being able to breath and I seriously thought I was going to die. It's at the last moment you realize how you really value your life... Or maybe I am just a pussy who is afraid of death.

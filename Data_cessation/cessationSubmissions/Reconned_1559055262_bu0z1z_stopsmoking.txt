I got fined yesterday. I'm done.

For smoking under a shelter in my country, I got a fine for S$200 (as a first-time offender). After many attempts at quitting, it's become a "I'll do it tomorrow, or next week or next month" thing. 

But man, after the process of being caught and the fine, I'm tired of this. I tried to think of all the good things that smoking brings me, but there really isn't, and I don't want to drag my loved ones down with this damn habit. 

Wish me luck. I'm coming back, my friends.

I did it. But Now I feel like I have anger issues.

Hi all. 26 years old. Been smoking since I was 17. Smoked a pack a day for probably 5 years. I "quit" here and there for various girlfriends. By "quit" I mean I chewed the 2mg nicotine gum. 

It's time for me to stop for a few reasons: 

1) Everyone I fucking know has gotten cancer recently.
2) I just bought a house and now I define the term "house-poor"
3) It's not cool anymore and everyone shits on the guy standing outside the restaurant smoking. And finally,
4) I met a *mega super awesome* lady who isn't cool with it. 

The sucky thing is how much I enjoyed it. I loved smoking. I had a 10 minute commute to work and I'd smoke two cigarettes back to back. If I was on a trip to New York to visit relatives I'd smoke probably 6 or 7. It was fun. It's the best thing after a few beers or with your morning coffee. But whatever. It's time.

Anyway, when the ball dropped on Jan 1st I had my last bit of nicotine. I haven't had ANY nicotine in my body for 10 days. The first few days sucked real bad, but the last 4 or so have been pretty good.

The only problem is that my temper has been affected by this. I'm a really easy going guy. But I've been snapping at some of my employees over stupid little shit, and getting all frustrated at normal stuff that goes on at work. I even barked at my dad the other day over something ridiculous. Let me reiterate, I'm a REAL easygoing guy and this is concerning to me because I don't want to be Mr. Crankypants.

Does this end? I've been sucking on peppermint lifesavers but they don't quite calm the angst like nicotine did!

Thank you in advance.

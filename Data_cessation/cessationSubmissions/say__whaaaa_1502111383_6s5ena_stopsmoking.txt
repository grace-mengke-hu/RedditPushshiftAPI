Try and try again.

I quit. Gave in. Quit. Gave in. Quit. Gave in.
Damn you spliffs.
Damn you NYC-where everyone still numbs their pain away as if nonexistence is a better way to live.
Today I quit everything and will never look back. 
I have to quit tobacco, weed, and alcohol.
I think I'm too weak to fuck around with any of them. I have to honest with myself about it.
It's always been all or nothing, and for me to kick this-it has to be nothing.
What is the fear I have to being healthy?
Im praying the less energy I put towards telling myself, "I'm quitting" and change the dialogue in the mind to, "I quit" will help shift it in my mind to the future and less of the "future is so far away and right now I'm struggling." My habit has more power than I thought it did.
It's actually quit depressing quitting, as joyful as it is. No one tells you about the sleepless nights or the emotions which surface. The fear tied into,
"Well what do I do now?"
Time to get off t he hamster wheel.
If we embrace the unknown with "anything is better as a nonsmoker" I think we'll all be okay.

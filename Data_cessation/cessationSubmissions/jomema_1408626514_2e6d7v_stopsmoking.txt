11 hours in! This is my 9:00 work break and I'm here...not outside smoking.

I watched [Allen Carr's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP1ykPUTk_Q) last night and it was amazing. I was actually laughing at how cheesy it was and feeling my perspective shift at the same time. I've never come to terms with the addiction factor. I've always associated my craving with needing a cig, not withdrawal. It's so simple and obvious now, and dealing with this mornings craving was manageable.

Next break is around lunch, I might not be here for it. I'm going to go home and eat lunch with my daughter before coming back. If I don't see you then reddit, I'll see you at my 2:00 ET break.

Thanks again for the support and tonight I plan on reading more into this subbreddit and everyone's stories.

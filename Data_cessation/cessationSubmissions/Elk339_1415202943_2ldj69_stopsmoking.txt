Had to join reddit for this sub reddit

I've used reddit a fair bit in the past but never posted or joined up. Have been visiting the stop smoking sub reddit everyday since I quit 13 days and counting :) just want to say it's really helped to see all of your stories and advice. 

I quit at the same time as my wife but her father had a heart attack 2 days ago and started again. 

All of my friends smoke so don't really have anyone or anywhere to celebrate what a massive achievement I feel getting this far is. Love how positive I feel about quitting at the moment.

Anyway thanks to everyone and to those thinking of quitting it's totally worth it!

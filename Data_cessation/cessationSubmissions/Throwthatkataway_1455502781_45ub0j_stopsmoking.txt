post nasal drip?

It's day 14 (I think) and one of the things that really pushed me to quit was that I was absolutely sick of the post nasal drip. I thought it would have cleared by now, but nope. 

I feel like it's coming from the sinuses on the left hand side of my face, but I'm not experiencing sinus pain, pressure or even a stuffy nose, really. Maybe a little but nothing too noticeable. But the mucus constantly sliding down my throat is driving me crazy. 

I have a sinus rinse bottle and packets of saline stuff, and my gym membership starts tomorrow so I'm going to hit the steam room hard, every day before work. 

Anything else I should do? Anyone know how long it'll last?

Thanks in advance,

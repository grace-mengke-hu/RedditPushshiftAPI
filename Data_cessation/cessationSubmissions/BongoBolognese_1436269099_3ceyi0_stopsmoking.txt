God Damn It! I Missed my Anniversary!

It was my goal to be here after 365 days and brag about how great I am. I missed. Guess that's a good sign.

Thank you /r/stopsmoking. This is the most incredible subreddit ever. To everyone who has just quit: One year went over faster than I could ever imagine.

I will be back on day 720 ;)

3 freaking weeks!

I will hit the 3 week mark in 3 days and I couldn't be happier, I even forgot that I used to smoke until I was cleaning out my car and found a half-full packet! Which I threw into the bin bag without a second glance.

Safe to say, I'm insanely proud of myself, but I won't lie, the first week and a half was harder than I thought and I did slip up while I was out in a beer garden, I smoked about half a cigarette before feeling like shit and giving it to my friend. 

That slip up wasn't all bad though, it did make me realize that I *really* don't enjoy smoking anymore, if I feel guilty about having half why would I start smoking full-time again?

I had a good plan going too, for work I kept a packet of normal chewing gum in my pocket whenever I needed one, at home I had a VERY LARGE packet of lollipops and in my car I had an inhaler without the nicotine thing in it (it was just the tube), and those things must have worked well because only yesterday I noticed that I didn't have chewing gum in my pocket for the past couple of days, haven't had a lollipop in a week and also haven't used my inhaler tube for about two weeks.

If your thinking about quitting, you should do it, I won't bullshit, it's hard but if you want to do something for yourself once in your life, do this.


Also thank you to this subreddit, all of your stories and experiences have really, really helped through these tough couple of weeks, good luck to all of you and a big thank you!

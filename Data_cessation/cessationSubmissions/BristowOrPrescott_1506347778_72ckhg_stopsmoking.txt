Day 1

Hi everyone- 

I quit smoking today. So, today is the first day. It's long been something I've kept (not very well) a secret. But, after many failed attempts, I thought I might need to share this with some folks- which brought me here. 

I wanted to put into writing my reasons for quitting:

- It feels like a burden. I feel really limited by it. I'm constantly stepping away from things or cutting them short or managing my day to allow for smoking. Like, I'll come up with some dumb reason that I need to take a separate car so that I can smoke on the way there and the way home. I'll come up with fake errands that I HAVE to run at 9:00 at night, just so I can have a cigarette. 
- I've long done the thing where I say "Oh, I only smoke when I drink". Drinking has been how I get away with smoking around friends. But, this has turned ugly as now I will drink SO I can smoke with out judgement. So, I'm drinking more and then smoking more. It's awful and I'm bloated. 
- I have this whole bizarre economy around smoking. I have to have mouthwash in my car and febreeze and an extra shirt because I don't want anyone I work with to know. Not only am I throwing away a TON of money on cigarettes but I'm also spending all this money on my smoking accouterments. I feel like crazy person. 
- I don't like it any more. I used to say "oh man, that's good" when I'd take a drag. But now, I'm like "well, I gotta do this". It nags at me. 
- A big reason- I have a kid. To be clear- I don't smoke near my child. But, I know that when it comes to smoking- I am constantly breaking my own rules- always making smoking more accessible even though I SWORE I wouldn't smoke here or at that time or with that person. I will not do that now. 

OK, so those are my reasons why. 

Here's how I'm doing it:

- I'm taking long walks during the times when I typically smoke (lunch breaks, right when I get home, etc.)
- I'm driving with my windows all the way down. 
- I do have the gum for cravings. 
- Playing with my kid a lot. 
- Drinking a ton of water. 

Any other ideas?

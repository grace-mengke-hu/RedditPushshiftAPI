Still with the cravings...

It's been almost nine months since I quit smoking and still there are cravings so intense I find myself wallet in hand, ready to head out to the nearest gas station. Everything I read said "Just hang in there, the cravings will subside." They listed all the medically relevant information about nicotine leaving your system and how once "the terrible threes" were past, how the cravings would subside. But it's so not true for me. 

I've tried everything I (or google) can think of; removed temptations, modified how I do activities that trigger cravings, everything I could to change my situation from when I was a smoker. Still I will be sitting watching a show, playing a game, doing something that never caused a craving before and - boom - want one so bad I can barely think of anything else. 

I don't want to slip back into smoking. I keep thinking I could allow myself to have just that one (because I will *totally* be able to have just one cigarette and throw the rest of the pack away, one won't make me start smoking again - or at least that's what my brain keeps telling me). But I know my willpower is extremely weak once I cave.

I'm posting here because I'm hoping, maybe, putting it into words will help.

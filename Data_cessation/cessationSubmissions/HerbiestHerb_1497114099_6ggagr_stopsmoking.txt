2 months

Hey everyone! 2 months smoke free!!!! Whoohooo!!!! It honestly doesn't even seem as if it has been that long. Feels like I quit merely weeks ago. Yet when I was smoking, a few days or a week without seemed infinitely longer.  It's still an ongoing battle to not fall into old habits, but I've been successful thus far. 

Last night was was exceptionally difficult. My band played a gig last night that was anything but great. Murphy's Law was in full effect. I was extremely angry and embarrassed about it afterwards. I wanted nothing more than to say fuck it and buy a pack and get absolutely smashed at the bar, but I didn't. I left the venue, went to del taco and spite ate. I've never been more proud of myself. I overcame the urge.

This subreddit has been a cornerstone to my success and I would like to thank everyone for their support and advice.

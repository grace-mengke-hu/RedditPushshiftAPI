Update: 2 weeks

So this morning I got the emergency appointment at my acupuncturist and I feel fantastic right now. I'm going to be detoxing a whole lot this week. I got another plant, an ivy. Picture to come. I came so so close to vaping because I missed smoking but I only procrastinated. I took so long thinking about it that I forgot how badly I wanted smoke in my lungs and carried on. I think about it twice a day now and sometimes I realize I have gone hours not thinking about it and I get so proud. Ups and downs but week two is over. Two battles won. But the war is still waging

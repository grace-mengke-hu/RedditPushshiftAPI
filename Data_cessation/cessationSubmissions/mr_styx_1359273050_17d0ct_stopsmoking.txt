how to deal with being irritable?

i've been pretty much coasting for the past 7 days, most of the cravings and shit i can deal with... but this is the first time i've gotten irritable, and i don't know how to deal with it. i feel so violently angry and have zero coping mechanisms for this... what the fuck can i do?

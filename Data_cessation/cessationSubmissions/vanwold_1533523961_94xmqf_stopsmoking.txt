46 hours

I have decided to quit, again. I have "successfully" quit twice before, once for 2 yrs, once for 9 mos. I am 35 now and have been smoking 18 yrs. I can feel it in my lunvs and chest. It was hurting to breathe in the  morning.  I do not want an oxygen tank at 50. This time, I went cokd turkey, during a girls weekend with 3 of my best friends, all of whom are non/ex smokers. The cravings sucked, but being with great friends made it easy. Now it's Sunday night, the bofriend is home, and he smokes. I was having such an intense craving, I debated on hitting his just once. I was telling myself, I deserve one for doing so good! But then I found this sub, and I wrote this rambling post instead. And now, the craving has passed. It will be back, but I am determined to reach my first goal of 48 hrs, and then 60 hrs. Then 1 week, then 2 weeks.... Once I get the nicotine out of my system, I know the cravings get easier for me and I am almost free of it!! I do not want to start this hard work all over again!! Sorry to ramble, but thanks for the space to get it out!!

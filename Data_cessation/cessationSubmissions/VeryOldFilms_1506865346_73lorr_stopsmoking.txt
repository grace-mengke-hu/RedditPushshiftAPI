28 days in and sudden strong cravings

I've been doing very well since quitting. I quit both alcohol and cigarettes at almost the same time. I'm 32 days alcohol free and 28 days cigarette/nicotine free. Cold turkey with both.

Today, and yesterday, I started to get strong cravings for cigarettes. At one point I was telling myself it's ok to have 1 smoke to relieve the cravings. I didn't. Today is the same. The cravings eventually go away but when they happen it's hard to ignore.

I try to think of the reasons why I quit. My heartrate is now down to 60bpm thanks to quitting and exercise. While I smoked it was 87bpm resting. So that's one reason to not start. During the peak cravings though it's almost like the benefits are not important.

Any advice for battling through?

Scared that it's going too well...

I've been smoking for around 10 years and I've been wanting to quit for a while. I've been over a 20 a day smoker for around 5 of those years. Finally decided to bite the bullet one afternoon and just stopped half way through the day! 
I'm on my 4th day now and I've not touched a cigarette since. I've tried before and never managed it and always given into the cravings shortly after. I'm not on any NRT and although I've had cravings they've not been as extreme as I anticipated and I've been able to push through them. I've been feeling good about it and I'm not pining after cigarettes. 

I know it's not going to be an easy ride for a long time but should I expect a hump soon? I'm scared I get complacent and it 'creeps up' on me.

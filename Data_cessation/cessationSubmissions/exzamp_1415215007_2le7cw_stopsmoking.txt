I'm 22 and very disapointed about my life

My father as smoked since he was a teen and i've grown to dislike tobaco. I was offered a cig for the first time when i was 15 to wich I replied 'not today' (maibe that was a bad sign). At the age of 18 I've started smoking at college, hiding it from my parents and gf. As I dont smoke at home i manage to keep it under 2 packs per week but i just cant stop. Every morning i'm on the bus i feel the rush, 'I ll buy a pack and smoke just one with coffe'.. yeah right, four years have passed. Subconciently I dispise people smoking and convince myself i can just quit any day. From time to time reality hits me and I feel very disgusting about myself.
Here i am on the bus walking home with a pack of cig my father asked me to buy for him and another for myself. No, no, no, no. This is it, i dont want to be like my father, I need help.

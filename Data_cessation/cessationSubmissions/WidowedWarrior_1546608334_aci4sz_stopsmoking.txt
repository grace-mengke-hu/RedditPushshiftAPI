I started Zyban, but I don't understand how this will help me quit next week?

I started on Zyban last week, and supposed to actually quit next week. But I don't understand how this RX will help me to quit? Will cigarettes taste bad or something like that? Has anyone that quit with Zyban also used the patches at the same time? I considered doing that too, Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!

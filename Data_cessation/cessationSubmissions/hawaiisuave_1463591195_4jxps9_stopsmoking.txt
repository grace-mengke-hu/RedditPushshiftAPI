almost smoked last night

Last night I went out with my girlfriend to catch game 1 of the Raptors/Cavaliers playoff series. We had some beers together and when we left I asked her for a cigarette. This was the first time since quitting that I held a cig in my hand and as soon as I felt it between my fingers the craving vanished and I returned it to her. 

I'm glad I didn't smoke it but I feel a little guilty for coming so dangerously close. It was also strange to me that the physical sensation of holding the cigarette in my hand was what ended my craving. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

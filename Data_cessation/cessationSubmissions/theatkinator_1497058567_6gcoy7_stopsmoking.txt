This has got to stop......

Hey reddit, I've been smoking for the past what.... 12 years..... I'm only 22 years old.

I have been telling myself:

 "hey I'll stop when I finish X or after Y" 

I've just come to terms with the fact that it has to stop now.... or I don't think I ever will.

I know it will be tough but I need to, It will change my whole life for the better!

Please wish me luck!

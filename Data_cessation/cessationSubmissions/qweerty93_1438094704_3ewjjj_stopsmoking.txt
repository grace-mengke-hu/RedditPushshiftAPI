Stopped smoking almost by accident, struggling with cravings but want to remain stopped

Apologies in advice, this might be a bit rambly.

I've been smoking daily for about 5 years. My parents think I've quit so whenever I go home I don't smoke at all, and manage fine. I've always found that I'm okay with stopping as long as there's no opportunity for me to smoke, but the minute there's an opportunity, I smoke. I suppose I'm essentially saying I have no willpower.

I found out last week that one of my old friends from school has cancer. Not smoking related or anything. We're in our early 20s and this sort of jolted things into perspective for me. I felt a bit disgusted by myself whenever I smoked. I spent the weekend with my boyfriend and decided to stay over at his to work at home so I wouldn't have to go outside and therefore be tempted to smoke.

I've come home now and it's almost 72 hours since my last cigarette and I feel quite headachey and desperate to smoke, even though I don't really want to.

My question here is for people who've quit - is it better for me to just power through at this point or do nicotine replacements help at this stage?

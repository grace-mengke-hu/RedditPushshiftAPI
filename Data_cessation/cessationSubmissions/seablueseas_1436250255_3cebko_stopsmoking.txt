The Big 5 0

I still get strong cravings, I still am envious of other smokers, I still have a pack of smokes hidden in my home, but I am still not giving in to temptation.
I can't believe that I have made it this far, and no matter how strong my cravings get, I NEVER want to be a smoker again.
I feel like the reason why this quit has been a success, is down to me making a whole lifestyle change. Working towards a life of fitness and health leaves no room for the death sticks. They no longer have a place in my new life.

So thanks everyone for making up this great community, and I know we can beat the smokes together once and for all.

Do the cravings ever go away?

I haven’t smoked for over 2 years but every single day is a fight. I don’t feel smoke-free, even though I don’t smoke. I’m still addicted, so it seems. The cravings, while definitely not as severe as the first few months, still occur, and it hurts.

Is the reality that you have to constantly refrain from smoking even after not smoking for years? Is this my life now?

Will the cravings ever go away? Will I ever be able to just forget about smoking like it never happened? 

I don’t want to think about all of this, but I do. I don’t want to “envy” every random smoker I meet, if that makes any sense. It probably doesn’t because smoking is bad, but I enjoyed smoking and even after all these years I still do.

My biggest dream is the invention of “healthy smoking”, but I know that will never happen. I don’t want anything smoking-related in my thoughts, in my dreams. But it’s there.

Does it ever go away?

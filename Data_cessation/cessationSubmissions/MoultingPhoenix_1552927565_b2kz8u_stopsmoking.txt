Accelerating your Quit?

Hi all, I'm now 4 days and change into my quit and am feeling... pretty damn good, really? After the really horrendous first day, it's become a lot easier.

I'm using 21 mg patches at the moment and am considering stopping the patch use in order to get it over with rather than adjust downward over a period of 3 months. Does anyone have any suggestions/warnings against possibly doing this? I haven't decided either way as of yet, but I will be seriously considering it over the next few days.

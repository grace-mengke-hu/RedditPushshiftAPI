To quit or not to quit, that is the question.

So I’ve been here before, twice! Both times I made it exactly 3 weeks before booze and nights out tripped me up. Am doing dry January so I’m thinking this is the ideal time to try again, but I’m just scared I’ll fail again, or be really moody and horrible again! I used patches last time and they did help but I am allergic to them, please give me some advice friends x

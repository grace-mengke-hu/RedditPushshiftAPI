I'm a non smoker now.

After receiving the recommendation yesterday to read "the book", I did so. I smoked today, but after finishing I have made my solemn vow. I will never ever touch anything nicotine related again. 


Threw out my ashtrays and the pack that was still half full. I am a non smoker.

a HATE a DAY #2

So yesterday was the beginning of a relationship with reddit/stopsmoking. Because of the extra time that I have since I've quit, I've decided to post 1 thing I hate about it everyday.

#2. I Hate smoking because while it's raining and I'm driving I have to crack my window to ash, the ashes end up sticking to the side of my black car and it stays there until I go get the damn thing washed. I don't like to broadcast that I'm a smoker when I'm not smoking....and I like having a clean ride. 
also having to ash thru a tiny cracked window increases the risk of missing the crack and smoldering the cigarette against the sill which can and has in the past burnt the hell outta some nice clothes and has nearly caused a crash.

damn I hate smoking.

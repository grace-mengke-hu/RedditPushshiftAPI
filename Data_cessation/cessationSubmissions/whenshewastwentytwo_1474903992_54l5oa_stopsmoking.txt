Day 4 and it's the hardest yet. How did you make it through your first week smoke-free?

Maybe its because its a Monday, maybe it's because I heard the first 3 days were the worst and I expected to feel better today. Whatever it is, this is the hardest day yet. I just found this reddit and am so excited to have a community to support me through this. 

I started smoking just about 4 years ago. About 2 years in, I switched to e-cigarettes and was happily vaping, although I still had a few cigarettes each month. It took me some time to accept the fact that despite the switch from smoke to vapor, my lungs were not healing. Sick of the side effects and helpless dependency, I finally decided to quit. I considered the patch or nicotine gum, but because I didn't want to postpone the inevitable, I decided to go cold turkey. I have been using marijuana to deal with cravings (that's a habit to kick another day), but it just isn't the same. In fact, it tends to make things worse when my cravings are stress-induced.

So tell me, what helped you get through your first week smoke free?

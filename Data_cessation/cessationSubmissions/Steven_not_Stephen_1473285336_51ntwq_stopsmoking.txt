How do you stay smoke free?

I'm a month and a half into this thing and god damn was it hard, and of course I am no where near out of the woods yet. But I get worried that the chance of a relapse is still really high even after a couple of years. It seems like there are just sooo many stories from people saying "I quit for 5 years and ended up starting again" etc. Hell, even my dad (7 years free now) would go for years without smoking only to end up smoking AGAIN for two or 3 years. So the question is for those of you with a little time under your belt now, How do you keep your guard up?

Haven't gotten my sleeping in check yet...

Went to bed around 8, fell asleep quickly. Wide awake at midnight.

Feeling restless.

I know I'm not using the term right (Sorry UK.) But I think I have a case of the nigglies.

I'm sick of gum, and I'm sick of candy.

I don't have an urge to smoke, I am just...I don't know. In a lull.

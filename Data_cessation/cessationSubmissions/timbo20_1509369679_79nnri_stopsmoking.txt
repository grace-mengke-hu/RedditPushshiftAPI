Day 21!

What has worked for me is to keep reminding myself everything I’m feeling or thinking is the drug trying to control me. I don’t want to be controlled. It helped me realize this is a major addiction. One that you can over come fairly easily if you stay quit. Keep reminding yourself this is part of the process and I have come way to far to start over yet again!

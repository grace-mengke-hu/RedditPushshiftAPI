A Little bit of Monotony

Hi guys, it's been 5 days and my breathing and energy levels have improved drastically but here's the thing. I'm not moving from my seat at work cause i'm trying to avoid the smoking areas downstairs, and worst of all i have no idea what to do, i go talk to colleagues, grab a snack and that's it. What do you do during breaks? It's a stupid question but i've really forgotten what to do other than smoke during these empty pockets of time.

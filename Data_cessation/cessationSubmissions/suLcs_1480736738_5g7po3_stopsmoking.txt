Cigarette free for over a month, still get cravings

I have been smoke free for about a month now. I smoked for 1 year prior.

I still get cravings. I think I crave the act of smoking itself instead of the drug. (Maybe similar to how gamblers remain addicted even though there is no physical drug associated with gambling)

Is there a resource I can find on this? I hope this feeling will go away eventually, to how I felt before I started smoking in the first place.

Thought I was over the cravings after 1 month, but they came back?

I quit a month ago after 9 years. I was sick with the flu and didn't want to smoke for a week. Once I got better I found I had enough of a headstart on nicotine to quit. I caved when drinking about 2.5 weeks in. I smoked 4 but I didn't smoke since then. The 5 or 6 days after that were really hard, but I got through them and I thought I was in the clear. Now I find that I'm craving them more and more each day. Is this normal? Does it ever end?

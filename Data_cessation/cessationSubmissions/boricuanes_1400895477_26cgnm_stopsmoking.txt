On 81 Days

I was the typical quitter. I tried many times to stop smoking, lasting as much as a year without a smoke around 2006-07. I started up again when I went home (moved away about 18 months before) for my 30th birthday. My wife organized a surprise party for me so I was with old friends, many who were smokers. I broke that night, bumming smokes from everyone. The next morning, I decided to buy a pack and rationalized that it would only be one pack. And I'm sure you all know how that story turns out.

I'm not sure why but this time feels much different. This quit happened by accident. I caught some nasty bug and ended up in bed for two days, barely eating, high fever, nasty headaches, alternating chills and hot flashes, etc. When it started I had about 5-6 smokes in my pack and of course I didn't have any for those two days. 

On the third day, I was still not close to 100% but I went back to work. I pulled out a cigarette as I approached work, popped the filter between my lips and I was a little apprehensive. I knew that this was addiction at its worst. No way in hell that makes it to my mouth for any reason other than my body needed it. So I lit the end, inhaled, coughed up a lung and threw the cigarette away. This was monumental - I actually did not want that smoke. I quit, on the spot, with no intention, forethought, etc. It just happened. When I got to work, I gave away the rest of my pack.

I had some cravings during the first couple of weeks but nothing compared to my previous attempts to quit. This time they were very brief and only triggered by seeing smokers or drinking coffee. 

I usually only come to this sub to see where my badge is because It's nice seeing that number increase. I'm posting today because when I do visit, I rarely see a quit story that is as accidental as mine so I thought somebody might benefit or be interested in it. 

Good luck to all of you.

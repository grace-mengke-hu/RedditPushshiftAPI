Spending tomorrow with my smoker sister

My sister is coming to visit me tomorrow.  I haven't told her I quit smoking.  I hope she doesn't try to smoke in my car lol! We basically started smoking together. I'm not worried that I'll smoke(I'm never smoking again!). I just feel anxious and I don't  really know why! What is this?!?!

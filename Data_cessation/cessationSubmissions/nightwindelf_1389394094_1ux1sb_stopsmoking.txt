I quit smoking, but the rest of my life hasn't

My doctor put me on Chantix and it's working rather well. My urges to smoke have decreased dramatically in a matter of a week. I went from half a pack per day to caving once today (my last day before the dose doubles).

I have a bit of a problem, though. My car still smells like smoke. Aside from vacuuming and blowing out the vents, does anyone have any tips for removing the smoke smell? Do products like Febreeze really work?

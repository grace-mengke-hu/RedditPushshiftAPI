Today is the day... just smoked my last

I have tried, patches, gum and tablets in the past but no more, today it will be will power and a strong mindset!!!

I have a 3 year old daughter and a 3 week old son, I have to see them grow up.  I have to be able to play with them without losing my breath.

Today is THE day!!!

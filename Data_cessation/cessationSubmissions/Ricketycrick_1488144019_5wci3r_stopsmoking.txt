To those who quit, does at any point your brain become lively again?

I've been quit for I think 10 days now. And while the worst of it appears to be over, and I appear to be able to function at a decent pace I.E not bedridden. I'm still beyond pessimistic, angry, stressed, and stupid. I can't seem to put together a single coherent thought.

I'm just starting to have serious doubts that cigarettes are the only thing that is working against me. I'm not super unhealthy, but I definitely could be healthier (cutting out fast food, masturbation) 

I guess what I'm asking is 10 days too early to tell, did anyone else quit cigarettes without radically changing their life and still find comfort?

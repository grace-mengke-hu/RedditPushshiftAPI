Day 1 - long-time smoker

Today is day 1 for me. I started smoking almost 34 years ago. I've quit a handful of times with two quits of 6 months - once 22 years ago and the other time 17 years ago.

I am not sure what I'm going to do. I have the patch, gum and e-cig kit/juice on hand. I'd been prepared to use the patch with the occassional gum as needed but I'm thinking of just going cold turkey to get it over with sooner.

I've read Carr's book many times and listened to a few of his audios. I get what he says but my "but..." list is very long ;)

I lost 80 pounds last year (although I'm up about 8 pounds still from vacation/flu/holidays in December). So I'm hoping quitting now won't cause me to to regain more. That said, getting my weight under control was such a huge accomplishment for me, I feel ready to tackle anything now!

Any words of wisdom?

Edit notes: I ended up having exchanges with friends who are healthcare professionals (2 doctors, 1 nurse, 1 psych) and am going to do a CBT program the next 2 weeks and booked to go on vacation on Feb 5th. I think going through hell week alone and in a different environment will be the best thing for me. One of the immediate advantages is that I obviously can't smoke flying and for the past few years, I've not smoked for several hours after air travel.

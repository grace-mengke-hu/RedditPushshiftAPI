I could also just not quit entirely how about that

I smoke roughly 3/4 a pack / day since I've been 14 or some shit.
I haven't smoked for 4 days now and really it was a lot easier than I expected. Every time I want to smoke I just don't. The thing is I didn't actually plan on quitting, I was just kinda disgusted one evening and told myself I wouldn't smoke for at least 2 days, and then after 2 days had passed I was like yeah let's see how long this keeps being fun.. and now I'm actually not sure if I really want to quit entirely, can't I just develop my habits into being an occasional smoker? like 2-3 cigarettes a week? I imagine it would cost even more willpower than quitting entirely but I don't think willpower is my issue here but rather incentive, as shocking as that comes to me. I just really fucking enjoy smoking what can I say. Are there people at all who are successful with this? "quitting" habitual smoking and turning into recreational smokers?

People have told me how incredibly hard nicotine withdrawal is and I gotta say I kinda disagree. And people have said I can't just smoke occasionally because I'm so addicted to nicotine. But can I still believe them?

If I wanted to do this, how long should I wait to get out of that initial addiction loop?

Like I get my neurons are linked up for life and it's always gonna be an addictive substance for me but really I think that's okay with me and I could control it.

now gimme your worst and tell me how wrong I am cause this is really just fucking excuses to myself, cheers for putting up with my shit.

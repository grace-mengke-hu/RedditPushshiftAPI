I decided to take back control today.

I was on my way to work this morning and noticed I only had 2 cigs left in my pack. I checked my bank account and realized that it was already pretty much depleted, and I wouldn't have more money until Friday. I was doing math in my head trying to figure out if I was going to have enough to buy the packs I would need for the rest of the week and figured I would just have to cut out any additional spending until I got paid to make it work. 

Then I got mad and realized I shouldn't be broke. If I didn't have a pack a day habit I would have plenty of money left in my account. I almost bought my "last" pack at the gas station, then decided; No. *This* pack is going to be my last pack. I smoked one cig before I went into work and my last on a break. The rest of the day dragged on and I already got hit with withdraws really bad. Instead of caving and bumming a smoke to take the edge off or going and getting a pack, I got the patch right after work instead. 

I know I can do this now. I am done being a slave to my addiction.

The boyfriend and I broke up on Monday... gave in, and had a cigarette last night.

So, we broke up, because he didn't care about me or my family enough, to come to my family dinner. I was really starting to fall for this guy. Which is why I'm so heartbroken. In a moment of weakness, I bummed a cigarette off of a friend, last night. And I want another one. I don't know why I am doing this to myself... I know that cigarettes don't help stress, but it felt so good! And know I hate myself.

147 days smoke-free, here's my experience quitting.

Today is my 147th day tobacco-free after smoking for over ten years. According to my app, I have avoided 1,183 cigarettes and saved over $400. I just got back from a run and in all honesty, I have never felt better. I can't turn back the clock but at least I know I'm not damaging my body further.

For people who are just starting out or wanting to start, I can tell you that the first 24 hours is the hardest but it gets so much easier from there. Every now and then you get a craving but it's nothing like what it is when you're physically dependent. It's more like "man, I could really go for a chocolate bar right now" not, "I need a cigarette or I'll rip my skin off". 

If you're wondering, I did it cold turkey, no cessation aids except regular ol' chewing gum, which I stopped doing after a couple of weeks. I caved once when I was fired from my job a few months ago; bought a pack, smoked two cigs and threw the pack away. It's an asterisk on my record but frankly I'm not all that concerned about it. 

I absolutely never thought I could quit and was positive that it would one day kill me. If I can do it, so can you.

Finally got this!

I'm not good at this, so please bear with me. Also on mobile and a posting noob, so apologies in advance for formatting issues. I've been smoking for 23 years, most of that time at a pack per day, but in the past decade it's been more like one to two packs per day. I've tried to quit several times. The most noticeable quit was basic training, but that was not exactly of my own volition. Several quit attempts (and many years) later, I swallowed my pride and asked my gp for help. I was prescribed wellbutrin, and instructed to taper down my smoking until quit day. Well, I didn't taper, but I did quit on the scheduled day. I smoked my last nasty cigarette on April 6. 3 days later I hosted a birthday party for my son. Amazingly, I did not have cravings or any desire to smoke. I thank my low nic vape for that. I am now the longest since I was 15 without a smoke, and all by my own choice! Best feeling ever is when your kid tells you they are proud of you. I think this is it guys! :)

Love this sub, it's amazing :)

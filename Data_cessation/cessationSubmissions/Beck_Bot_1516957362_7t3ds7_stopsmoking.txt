Why did you quit smoking?

Hello all!

I'm new to reddit and NEW to quitting smoking. I've made it to day 10 and am really, REALLY struggling, so I was hoping some of you could share with me the reasons that you quit. I made a list, but I'm sure I've overlooked things, so I was thinking that some new reasons will help keep me motivated and smoke free!

Thank you so much for the help and congratulations to all of us for kicking this habit in the butt!

Cheers,

Becca

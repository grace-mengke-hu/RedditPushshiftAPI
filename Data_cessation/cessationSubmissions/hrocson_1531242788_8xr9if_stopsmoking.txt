Do disposable filters work for weaning off cigarettes?

I am talking about the filters you put on a cigarette that supposedly cut back  the level of nicotine/tar/etc. They are good for 3 or 4 uses. The reviews on the products I'm looking at online all sound too good to be true. Do they help with quitting? Do they make the cigarettes lighter?

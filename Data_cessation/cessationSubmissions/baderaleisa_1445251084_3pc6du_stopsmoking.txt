stopped for good

I've decided to quit smoking again and this time I've used nicotine patches for five days as well as champix, what I noticed with champix is that in the first couple of days I couldn't sleep as easy as I used to but now everything is fine, the cravings aren't as many as I first started, now its been a week nicotine free.

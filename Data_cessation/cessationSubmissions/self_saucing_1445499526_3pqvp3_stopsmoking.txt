2 years today!

I smoked heavily for nearly 2 decades, I thought I'd be a slave forever.

At first it was hard, really hard. I came here for support, spoiled myself rotten, and got to bed every night smoke-free.

It got easier, and easier, and easier. Now I never even think about it.

If I can do it, you can too. If you're in your early days - my heart goes out to you. I'm proud of you. It will never be this hard again, *just keep going*. Your future self will be so thankful to you.

You got this. 

Keep on keeping on awesome people.

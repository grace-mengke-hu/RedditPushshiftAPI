The next time I'm drinking. What to avoid?

I posted a while back wondering if people had success weaning themselves off the fags or just going cold turkey. Two weeks ago I decided to take the plunge and go cold turkey and I haven't looked back, especially when it comes to cardio intensive workouts, which I used to despise, but now I just hate them because they're boring.

Anyway, having completed my finals and looking forward to a summer of parties, camping, festivals and a bit of work, I was wondering how you guys coped with social situations, especially parties where lots of people smoke? How did you react if a joint was being passed around? I understand the chemical mechanism where the brain seeks the alkaline nicotine to balance out the acidic carbs ingested or the urine building in the bladder but I'm more worried about drunkenly having a smoke and buying a pack or something like that. Also would the mechanism of smoking a joint bring back the physical craving of having a smoke in hand?

Time to put down the cigarettes again

I’ve tried to stop smoking multiple times (unsuccessfully) and have gone as far to hide my habit from my mother and girlfriend (both who are extremely against smoking). 

If I’m able to stop smoking then I’ll be able to stop spending so much money and finally spend it on something more productive.

Wish me luck!

A day shy of 6 months...

and I'm still hanging in.  

In the last 6 months, I have accomplished more physically than I have in my years of smoking.   

I've become a serious gym rat, and I was able to swim a mile today.   

The money I saved by quitting smoking has enabled me to afford dental work to fix the damage done by smoking.  

You guys are all amazing.  Everyone here has what it takes to quit.   6 months is a major milestone for me.  I am no longer afraid to be out in social situations with other smokers.  The temptation is simply non existent.   I am much happier than I once was.  Quitting smoking was one of the more difficult challenges I have faced in my life, but it was also the most important decision so far.  

Thanks, you guys.

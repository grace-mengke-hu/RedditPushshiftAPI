Another day, another attempt - but I have an idea..!

I need to stop smoking, among health and other things I'm just plain fed up of it! The way I stink after each cig, my car stinks, I get headaches, I'm fat and need to slim down and can't really walk up the stairs without being out of breath. But mostly I'm just sick and tired of being tied to something all day every day. And I kid myself thinking 'I can do a few hours or even a day without a cig, I'm fine', but I'm still addicted.

So despite many unsuccessful attempts in the past (plus some slightly successful attemps of up to 6 months), I'm giving it another go. But this time I plan to use Reddit to help. I figure each time I crave a nicotine boost I'm going to turn to this forum and make sure I post a positive comment to help someone else, which in turn will help remind me of why I'm doing it. Hopefully all the while occupying my mind until the crave has gone.

Has anybody else done anything similar with 'distraction' techniques? Do they work?

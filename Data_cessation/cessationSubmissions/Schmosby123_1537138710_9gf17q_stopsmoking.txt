I'm fucking tired of trying to quit. I don't even last 2 days. I'm making this post so I fucking stick to what I decide.

Health is important, and I don't wanna die. Fuck this shit makes me feel so stupid. I never knew I was addicted, but I am. I've been smoking for 2 years(not heavily though, just 1 cigarette everyday), and it's kinda pissing me off how even though I know how harmful it could be I still never stopped. I just joined this sub and I hope this post puts an end to my stupidity, and I also hope the damage I've done to myself is reversible. Good luck to myself and everyone else here, we can do it We *have to* do it, because it's just dumb.

I QUIT.

There, I did it.
Fuck wall of texts, so here's a short version:
Started when I was 14 trying to make new friends, Now I'm 20 with a lot of regrets.
Used to be fit, now im 40 pounds overweight.
I've tried to quit plenty of times, but this time I'll head over to /r/fitness so I can physically realize how much of a moron I've been.

Wish me Luck

I'm joining you guys. Again.

Hello. 

I quit smoking a year and a half ago, and it was great, I was about 11 months tobacco free.. Then me and my SO broke up. It was messy, and well, I went back to the old habit. Never smoked much, about 2 to 4 cigs a day, but still...

So today I'm joining you guys once again. I smoked a cig earlier today and it felt disgusting. So I just threw the whole pack away (lighter too, fuck it). Let's see how this week goes, but I'm confident on myself - the first time I went cold turkey as well. Hoping it lasts more this time. :)

Dealing with the "Tangled" feeling of the stress with no smoke.

Life is working against me when I quit smoking, almost like Im swimming against a current when usually life is going with the flow. When I quit smoking stress, pressure and anger are the first things I notice. By "Tangled", it's like your muscles are so uncomfortable anywhere , each muscle needs extra brain power to move and  cause unintended accidents with every movement. It's a painful experience that literally will burn your muscles and cause the brain extreme claustrophobia. Waking up to my first movement tripping on a laptop charger, walking on freezing water from the bathroom almost slipping, hitting my shoulder on the door on the way out of the bathroom. How do I deal with this, this is not ordinary clumsiness (I wouldn't even classify it as clumsy)? This feeling usually causes me to snap at others without hesitation. (Oh and I workout, eat healthy, do yoga and still have these physical muscle uncomfortablies)

I'm having a really tough time quitting.

To start off I used to smoke marlboro smooths for around four years. I quit using chantix about three years ago and it worked really well for me. Well two years ago I started smoking djarum cloves with friends using the "well it isn't a cig" justification and now I've been hooked on them for pretty much the entire two years. My problem is that the chantix is really seriously upsetting my stomach for an hour and a half at a time after taking it and therefore I'm not consistent with it and it isn't working. My wife hates that I smoke but she is unbelievably great about it. She knows it's an addiction and isn't my conscious choice to just do something she hates. I want to quit these things but as you all know I still have that mental desire to not quit because I do like it. Any help you guys can throw my way would be awesome! Thanks!

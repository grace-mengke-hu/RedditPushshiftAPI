Patch advice please.

Quit cold turkey 3-4 days and broke down and bought patches (quit because severe asthma flair) and I went with the 14mg patch. When I was a smoker I was a pack and a half to pack a day ultra light.

My advice- now that I’m feeling better I’m craving obsessively and my anxiety is through the roof. I’m at day 16, day 12ish using the patch. My question- should I stick this out using the 14mg or should I step up to 21mg and see how it goes? I do take the patch off at night as I wasn’t sleeping well. TIA!

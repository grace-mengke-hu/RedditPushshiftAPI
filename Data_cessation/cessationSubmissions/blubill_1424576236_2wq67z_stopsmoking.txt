Day 1....

I have been meaning to quit smoking for a long time now.  Pretty much everyone at work smokes so it's going to be hard to turn them down when they all go outside, but I just don't want to do it anymore.  I recently married an amazing woman and I just CAN'T give up even a second of the time that I could have with her because of this stupid addiction.  I smoked my last cigarette yesterday after work and it's been a full 24 hours now.  It's been harder than I thought, but I'm trying to stay strong.  Don't really know what I'm expecting to happen by posting this, I guess I just need to get my thoughts out.  If anyone else is in the same place as me let's stay strong together and beat this.

I posted here a while ago talking about quitting smoking...

So I'm back again... last time didn't go as planned but I'm back. Recently went on a vacation for a few days and used it as an excuse to help get the first couple days under my belt. Help me reddit! Making it through today will make it 5 days in a row!

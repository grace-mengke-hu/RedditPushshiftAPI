Day 5 cold turkey and it's tough

I just wanted to post to say you're not alone if you're struggling. I'm struggling too. It's hard.

I've smoked for 15 years and wanted to quit almost the entire time. I've been really dedicating myself to it lately. I've quit and relapsed constantly for the past month or two. Now I'm on day 5 again and pushing a week - no patch, no e-cig, nothing. There's a lot of ways I want to improve my life, but I've decided to put everything else aside and ONLY focus on quitting smoking. I can eat whatever I want, play as much video games after work, etc. Just no smoking!  


I've realized that my desire to smoke isn't going to go away anytime soon, and that I'm making a sacrifice in the present for a better future. It's been easier once I've framed it that way. I'm making a sacrifice to improve myself. Sacrifice is hard.

I can feel the benefits already. I'm sleeping easier. I can do push-ups or go running without feeling like I'm going to have a heart-attack. My heart-rate BPM has dropped significantly.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I'm just stressed. Stay strong!

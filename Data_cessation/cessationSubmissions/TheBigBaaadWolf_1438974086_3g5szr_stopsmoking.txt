Unexpected Side Effects

Hi Guys,

Trying to quit for the third time now. Previous two attempts lasted around 3 months. I can't recall how I got back into it but that's in the past. 
Main question here is does anyone else get lots of mouth ulcers when they quit? 
The previous two attempts I would have 6-9 at any one point, making eating and talking difficult. I accept that'll it'll happen again, just wondering if there's anyone who found a way to deal with them or help in anyway. I'm on day 2/3 and can already feel one starting on my tongue.

Thanks in advance!

Any other ex-smokers successfully quit on ADHD medicaton?

So I take Adderall daily for my ADD. Smoking a cig on Adderall or Vyvanse is the greatest feeling ever. Currently craving a cig and that feeling of amazingness. Any tips? Didn't take it all weekend I'm around 80 hours in and didn't take it yesterday because my professor cancelled class. I'm really close to craving idk what to do, and I work tonight and I always used to smoke at work. First shift since I quit. I'm freaking out

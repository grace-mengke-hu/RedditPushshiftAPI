Back again, 3 month long relapse after a 150 day quit

Hi guys and gals.  This subreddit was really important in my prior success.  Nothing really caused my relapse other than hubris, I just thought I was stronger and quit really focusing on staying quit and next thing you know I had a cigarette in my hand.  It's been a stressful 3 months because I'm now trying to hide it from everyone, I started smoking again at work, but only in my car, and now it stinks, and I stink, and people suspect I'm smoking again, and when people that don't smell it congratulate me on not smoking I feel like absolute garbage.  My wife acts like she doesn't know but she must.

Anyway, enough about the weakness, I'm at 72 hrs without a smoke, doing a great job of reminding myself that while buying a pack would be so easy, it's the last thing in the world that I want to do.  This time is a little bit easier because for the last 3 months it's common for me to go 16-20 hrs without a smoke because of the hiding it thing.  

Don't hate me for being weak.

Day 1: 36 hours.

I am a stressed out medical student. I picked up smoking from an ex boyfriend of mine. From there when I would study, I would find myself smoking cigarettes here and again. Eventually, I started to crave them and crave them. I realized that both as a future doctor as well as a person, I couldn't continue this. I decided to make a change. I threw out all of the tobacco in my house and purchased the patch to control cravings. Today as of now I'm 36 hrs without a cigarette. I got the patch (level 2) and it's amazing how much it kills cravings. Yes it has nicotine, but the goal is to titrate down to level 3 and then eventually quit completely. 

I'm excited to see how this progresses.

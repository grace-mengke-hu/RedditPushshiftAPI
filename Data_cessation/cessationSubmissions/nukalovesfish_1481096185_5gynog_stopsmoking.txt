10 days now, very depressed.

I quit cigarettes for good now. I am never going back to nicotine no matter how strong the craving. I assumed this would be more of a defined timeline, first 1 week you feel bad and it gets better after that. But the reality is not that at all. After 10 days of quitting now. I am very irritable, and very depressed. I have no interest in anything or anyone. I am always sad and feel life is empty and worthless. I know I need to wait it out. I tried talking to people about it but they don't get it. So I am reaching out to you guys. Have you also felt depressed after the first week?

What did you do to make it better?

P.S. Sorry for the bad English and thank you in advance :)

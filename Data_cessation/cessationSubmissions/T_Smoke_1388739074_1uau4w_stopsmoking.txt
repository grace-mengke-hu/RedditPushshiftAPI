I see a lot of success stories on here, which is great but i feel like people don't share their failures. Let me share thisafternoon's failure.

To set the scene, i'm standing outside with a cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other 4 days from having my last smoke. To even get to this point is amazing to me and i'm proud of myself. On the same coin though i'm right back to where i was 4 days earlier. 

So i've got the two heavyweights duking it out in my head. The nicotine starved brain VS my rational brain. The bullshit excuses running wild, my rational side somehow beating them down at every corner. Unfortunately i'd somehow set my mind to smoke this cigarette. So the rational side of my brain had some work to do. I was standing there for about an hour like a goddamn psychopath. Staring into the distance and letting my mind argue with itself incessantly. At some points putting the lighter and cigarette back in my pocket and taking it back out again. At some points lifting it to my lips and dry inhaling. I seriously couldnt have placed bets on which would prevail.  

After about an hour of almost walking back inside, almost lighting up. I ended up taking a puff like i was taking a shot of alcohol. I lit up and inhaled so fucking fast it was as if i thought someone would smack it away from me if i did it slower. INSTANT headspin, it felt good. That's the fucking worst thing too. It feels so good.. It's such a perfect predator. So now i'm sitting here, i threw my cigarette out after a few puffs and a shitty high. I'm pissed off. Cigarettes are Such an evil son of a bitch that it will not only kill you but it will make you put your head in it's jaws and push it's teeth down all the while smiling. Well fuck that. Life's bad enough without giving time to that kind of evil. Fuck that kind of evil. I'm back on the horse. Back to day one. But i'm ready to kick the shit out of that son of a bitch no matter how many times it manages to take pieces out of me.

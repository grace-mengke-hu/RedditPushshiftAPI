Health issues after quitting?

So, I quit smoking. I 'quit' the first week of October after being sick of getting bronchitis every time it got cold out (and this round being the worst I had ever had...). I cut myself out from a pack a day to 4 or 5 on the weekends, none whatsoever at all during the week. Got myself a vaporizer and honestly hardly used it.

Then I got some bronchitis again in mid December, was given a steroid inhaler (which somehow got thrown out while the apartment was being cleaned after about a week) and an albuterol inhaler, that I hardly used at all. This mid-december quitting bout, I quit completely, haven't touched a smoke since December 13th.

I have had some consistent phlegm in the mornings since then, and this past weekend I began having some difficulty taking a full breath (though that has kinda sidelined after a day or so) with some semi-productive coughing.

But really, I'm not looking for any medical advice really, but am more wondering if anyone else went through a period of total crap health issues AFTER quitting smoking? 

(I am making a huge change in my life... I have to say after being a pack a day red smoking for over 10 years and quitting I feel empowered to tackle other things in my life, so it's been really great so far)

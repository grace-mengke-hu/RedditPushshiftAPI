Mission from my Smoke Free App

List of things that has worked so far on my journey. 22 days smoke free!!

• The 5 D's: 1)Distract: Change whatever activity I'm doing.  2)Delay: I tell myself, "I can smoke tomorrow if I choose, but for now, I will not smoke."  3)Discuss: Talk with someone in my support system  4) Deep breath: I take 4 deep breaths while counting 4 on inhale, hold for 4, and exhale for 4.  5)Drink water: I keep a water bottle with me at all times. I also like the kind that I have to suck the water out...a grown-up baby bottle hahaha! It helps with oral fixation that I had with cigarettes. 

• Having support. 
• Being present and mindful 
• Change my routines... especially mornings and after meals! 
• Having a game plan for tough situations. Write them down on index cards and carry them in purse or wallet. 
• Write down the names of my support system and beside each name, jot a few things they would say to me during tough situations. This is VERY helpful when I either cannot call them or am in a dead zone of cell service. I live in a rural area, so I have a lot of dead zones. 
• Excercise! Even a leisurely walk can turn around my stinking thinking! 
• Stay as thankful as I possibly can. Making a daily gratitude list is so powerful, it still amazes me. 
• I chew on a cinnamon stick...this helps a lot while driving.

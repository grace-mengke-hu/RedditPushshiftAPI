I'm free

Hello, fellow non-smokers!

The first time I've quit for good was this April, I've lasted 2 months and a bit, however, while on a trip I've let doubt inside my mind and relapsed. I've since smoked daily until today, when I finally went through Allen Carr's book again and I know, that today I've smoked the last cigarette in my life, only this time, I'm not touching anything including nicotine at all. Feels great to finally be free of this filth and even though it's only been an hour, I feel happy that I've made this decision. I know that it is easy to stop smoking, because I've already done it and now I know what kind of triggers to expect and the most important fact, that you must never doubt your decision to quit. Anyone can quit smoking if you put your mind into it! Sorry for the rant, but I've had to put my thoughts out there. Best of luck fellow non-smokers and be strong! Every day WILL get better when you rid yourself of the nicotine. Godspeed!

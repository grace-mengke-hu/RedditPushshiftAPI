5th day of the second try.

Yes, indeed. Cravings are weaker and less in time, I cope with them drinking a glass of water, 8 glasses a day they say is the ideal, I think I reach this number. Coffee replaced by a mild herbs tea, not bad at all. Other problems of life make me nervous, sometimes I feel a cigarette could solve them, but it is just an illusion. I installed two apps in my phone giving me badges and information about my non smoking condition. There are some even free. I also distract myself playing some mind video game at the time craving is getting strong. It helps. So water, no coffee, distraction. I think I love win in the end. I wish only not having stressful issues in the near future, I need to calm at this period of my life.

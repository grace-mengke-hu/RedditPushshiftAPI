Ok! 24 hours and I haven't killed anyone yet.

It got a little rough before bed. And my hand was just itching to hold a smoke with my coffee this morning. 

It's ok. My kids are cheering me, my sister that lives with me immediately volunteered to go back to vaping so there wouldn't be cigarettes around me. 

You know, I really can do this. And we just might all survive.

The best and the worst 100 days of my life

I am finally here. 100 days. I quit cold turkey after 9 years of smoking a pack a day. It's been a hard and stressful 100 days. But i fought through all those triggers and so glad i never took a puff. Although there are strange unexpected triggers every now and then, i have eliminated pretty much every regular trigger. 
The first month was really hard and i spent about 40 days constantly worried that i have to not smoke. Things changed after that and i stopped thinking about smoking. Now i hardly think about it. To those in the early days of quitting, stick to it. It gets so much better and easier. 
I open this subreddit first thing in the morning. It's sort of become a habit. It used to be facebook that i would open first thing in the morning. Now it's this. Another bad habit gone :)
Seriously, couldn't have done it without you guys. Cheers!

101 days without nicotine!

It has been 100 days since my last cigarette -- I quit with The Book and never looked back.

Honestly, quitting cold turkey after being a pack-a-day smoker for the better part of a decade was not the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Don't get me wrong, the first three days were a bitch and the first three weeks were a bit of a struggle, but it gets easier every single day.

To anyone struggling, just quitting, or afraid to try: you got this!

Edit: Thanks for all the kind words everyone! Right back atcha :)

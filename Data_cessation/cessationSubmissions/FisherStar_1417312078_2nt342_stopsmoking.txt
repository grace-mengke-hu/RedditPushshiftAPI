Help with a problem after quitting.

So I would like to start off by saying I have quit 5 times in the past, usually for lengths varying between 4 and 9 months using Chantix. 

I, like a lot of others, am going to try once again this time using the patch. Now here's where I am a little worried.  The last time I quit I had an unusual problem that I never experienced the other times. I would wake up with an incredibly bad case of my arms falling asleep to the point where it was almost unbearably painful.  This would happen anywhere from 1-3 times each night.  Has anyone experienced this?  If so, how did you handle it?

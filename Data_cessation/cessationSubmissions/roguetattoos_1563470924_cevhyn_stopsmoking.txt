How did you keep drawing?

Or painting, coding, whatever it was you smoked while doing? 
I had my last cigarette last night, my last spliff, probably the last blunt for a long while.
For 3/4 of my life, I wake up, and smoke, drink coffee, and draw. It is so linked together and every time I’ve tried to quit it’s been the justification to restart.
I’ve got literally no private space other than the stank ash pile of my porch...

Shoot I’m just complaining I suppose, and looking for some support.

I don’t even want to tell my partner I stopped-every time I’ve tried before they’ve had some crisis within a day or two that made me not give a shit about my own effort to stop. They say they want to help however they can, but I feel like I can count on them to collapse somehow if I get weak. Perhaps this is a problem for relationships sub rather than smoking :)

In any case(thanks for reading), how do you creatives keep it up after quitting smoking, if smoking was linked to the creation &lt;-tl/dr

Have a great day everyone

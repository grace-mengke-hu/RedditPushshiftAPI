Well tomorrow is the day...

After 5 and a half years, tomorrow is finally the day I'm done. Got 3 cigarettes left in my pack that I'm smoking tonight and then when I wake up tomorrow I have nothing to reach for to light up. I know it will be difficult, I know I'll have the cravings, but I also know I can do this!

Edit: Day 2 down. My god is it difficult. The cravings are difficult, and I'm definitely feeling the lack of nicotine in my body, but I have to say it is manageable. If I'm keeping myself distracted I can ignore the cravings, but when I find myself in a moment where I have nothing to do the cravings can get overwhelming but Ive been able to make it this far so I can keep going. I have yet to go buy a pack of cigarettes. I've yet to even consider going to buy a cigarette. So as hard as this is for me, I consider this a win. Tomorrow I'll wake up, my badge will say 2 days down, and I'll do this again; and I'll succeed again.

The cravings WILL go away: Quitting with the patch AND nico-gum.

At the recommendation of my doctor, I quit using the patch and nicorette at the same time. The patch gives you a nice even dose throughout the day, and the gum is for cravings. 


Weeks 1-4: 14mg patch + 2mg gum

Weeks 5-6: 14mg patch

Weeks 7-8: 7mg patch

Then I was home free, as of a day or two ago.


My greatest fear was that the craving would never go away. That I'd always get the urge randomly throughout the day. I have discovered, however, that even after a short 2 months, I have totally kicked it. I don't think about cigarettes at all. Triggers affected me minimally, and the effect diminishes every day.

But, perhaps the most important part of this was that I quit drinking at the same time. Every other time I tried to quit, getting drunk eventually ruined it for me. I intend to avoid alcohol until 2015, and possibly longer than that, if things keep going the way they are. I instituted a strong weightlifting program that I do every day, along with a healthier diet. The benefits are AWESOME. I'm in a much better mood on a day-to-day basis, much more clever, social, and fun. I will never go back. I used to lie awake on rare nights thinking about my heart slowly decaying in my chest and my lungs shriveling up, knowing that I will pay for my lifetime of smoking not with my life, but with my livelihood. It is such a relief to have this problem taken care of. If you haven't tried it yet, adopt my method. No alcohol, no drugs, no cigarettes. Use the patch and the gum. When you ween off the nicotine gum, switch to sugarless gum so you can keep your mouth busy.

Just do it. It works.

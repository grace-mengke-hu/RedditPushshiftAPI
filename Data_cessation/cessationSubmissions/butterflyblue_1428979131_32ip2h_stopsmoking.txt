90 days...

I totally spaced and missed it.  If it hadn't been for another user having their 90 days today I probably wouldn't have remembered at all....In a way I think it's exactly how it should be.  I'm forgetting that life and replaced it with something far more important...breathing!  Boy did I forget what it was like to take a real breath! and it's not just breathing deep, It's also catching it when you're winded.  I never realized how much I struggled.

8 days, and I feel like death. Please help

[UPDATE]: I'm on Day 13- yeehaw! And today is the first day since my freak out that I feel human- my only remaining weird symptom is my scalp is super sensitive.. (wtf is that?) 

I haven't gone to a doctor- TBH not only am I am doctor-phobic, but I also don't have health insurance and I'm unemployed in a foreign country and don't quite understand the medical system here or have go-to healthcare providers. I PROMISE I will if have any repeat symptoms. 

But thanks for the support along this quitting journey.

Hello peoples. Longtime lurker.

I am on day 8 of non smoking. ANd I *think* I have quitters flu, but I need a little support because this is awful.

Some background info:
I once quit narcotics cold turkey and went through withdrawals (10+ years ago but still)
I've had dengue fever living in Central America. That shit is painful.
I have quite a high pain tolerance
I've quit smoking several times before to less than dependable results. I remember a smokers flu situation before but I was traveling in Angola for work so could've been anything.
I currently live in South Africa.
My levels of smoking varied on a daily basis but normally it was 3-5 Rollies and on drinking nights it was 10+ (which was maybe 2x/week)
I'm 39F smoking off/on for 21 years

Symptoms for the past few days and current symptoms
Fever
Chills
Sweats
Body aches 
Painful urination
Hyper sensitive skin and scalp (reminded me of Dengue)
Constipation and then diarrhea 
Joint pain
Insomnia
Stomach pain and tenderness/bloating

Have been treating with:
-a pain tablet which is a combination aspirin, ibuprofen and tiny bit of codeine, and works pretty well
-LOTS of fluids, juices, parsley ginger and lemon tea, and water like a mofo.

I know quitters flu is a "thing" but I don't have barely any nasal, respiratory or coughing or sinus issues. The symptoms online and other threads don't really match my experience entirely.

I just googled my symptoms and noticed a few things that made me slightly freak (okay I'm not a hypchondriac but we all do it).. So I thought of a few more causes for concern- it's springtime and I have a lot of ticks on my property.. My puppy brings them inside and I have been notably bitten once about two weeks ago but did not have the rash, or bullseye effect around the bite mark and also - Lyme disease is not common in South Africa and has a very low instance of occurance. BUt there is something else called tick bite fever which is similar to the symptoms I have & could occur here.

Other web MD related suggestions are Malaria (low occurance where I live- but it is Africa), West Nile Virus (also low)...

Can anyone tell me that this quitters flu is real or should I go to a doctor? 

PS- I hate the doctor.

Tl;Dr | is my quitters flu real or is it something else?

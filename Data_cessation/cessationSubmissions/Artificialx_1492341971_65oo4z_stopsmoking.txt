For those of you starting your journey, keep at it. I was where you were once, now 1 year down today!

I feel so proud of making it this far. I still occasionally dream about smoking. I still get the urge now and again.

But those early days are a distant memory now and the urges are more than manageable. 

We all start at day one. Hang in there peeps!

1/2 day rant, please ignore.

So I went out and bought myself an mp3 player for 14 bucks and change today, because fuck you Apple.  I'm never touching an apple product ever again.

I was behind the fattest, ugliest, most distracted parent in the drivethrough at the McD's earlier today.  Brat bouncing around, unbelted in the back seats, her juggling her cellphone to dig for one bill to pay for her food.  Standing there on the ramp -no fucking reason- for way too long before rolling forward.

And I get beeped at on the way home.  I'm at the stop, going to make a left.  I'm facing a dude coming at me going straight.  One  ped crossing the street in front of him, hone guy crossing on my left.  I'M 4th in line for right of way for fucks sake!  The asshole behind me gives me the cattle-prod beep.  FUCK YOU IT AIN'T MY TURN!!

...
Anyway, 14 bucks for an mp3 player.  Looks like a cheap piece of plastic, but doesn't sound any worse than that 5th ipod I lost a year ago, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  I went for a walk earlier, haven't done that in forever.

Wife just asked me if I'm going to be typing all day lone because god forbid I interrupt a rerun she's only seen 159 fucking times!  I don't even watch that idiot box and I can quote the episode verbatim! Fuck you!

Anyway, haven't had any nicotine since around 8-ish last night.  I think my family is starting to suspect.

Quit with the power of NOPE.

I quit for the last time. I learned that simply putting my mind away from cigarettes helps. I normally cave through convincing myself to smoke; Usually by telling myself I deserve one, or I haven't had one in forever, etc. Lately whenever I crave a cigarette I just shout nope! In my head of course. 

For example, my friend was chain smoking cigarettes in front of me.

"I could use one of those." I thought. "NOPE. NopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNope." 

I don't give myself the chance to consider a cigarette. 

"NopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNopeNope. Haha Nope without spaces also looks like open. opeN."

And before I know it, my mind is already thinking about other things.

I feel very good since quitting.

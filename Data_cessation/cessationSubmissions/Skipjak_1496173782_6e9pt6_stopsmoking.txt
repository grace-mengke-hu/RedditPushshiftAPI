Time for another attempt, not giving up dammit!

I managed to quit last year and didn't smoke for three months. Then spring came and I figured one cigarette or spliff every now and then wouldn't hurt. Now here I am, smoking 15 cigarettes a day again. 

I was planning to quit tomorrow morning, but I ran out of rolling papers just now, so I figured tonight is the night. I'm really happy I'm going to quit again. I really enjoyed all the delights of being smoke-free those first three months, and I can't wait to enjoy them again, this time for good.

Thanks to my previous quit, I have a pretty good idea of how to get through the harsh withdrawal in the first week (lollipops, LOTS of excercise and LOTS of tea, and videogames and reading to keep my mind occupied)
I also know what my biggest culprits are: making the mistake of smoking spliffs (weed + tobacco), and my mind glamourizing smoking (If I see an attractive woman smoking, I instantly want to smoke too). I plan to counter this through mindfulness. I've been practicing excercises in mindfulness the past few weeks, and I feel like I have a better grip on myself and my thoughts.

I'm scared and excited at the same time. Wish me luck!

Lost time regained!

After nearly a year of not smoking it feels amazing to be where I’m at. I don’t vape or do any replacement therapy at all either so all of the time that I spent standing out on my front porch, standing outside at work, standing on a street corner, standing...wherever is suddenly my time.

According to my smoke free app I have not smoked approximately 7000 cigarettes. The app suggests that each cigarette not smoked saves you 5 minutes of your day. Which means that in the last year I have saved myself around 600 hours, yes, HOURS, of wasted time.

That’s around 1 hour and 40 minutes a day. What would you do if you had that much extra time in your day? Not getting enough sleep at night? I’m sure 1 hour and 40 minutes of extra sleep would help. Been wanting to hit the gym but don’t seem to have the time? 1 hour and 40 minutes is plenty of time. Work deadlines seem too short and you feel like you just don’t have enough time in the day? 1 hour and 40 minutes extra every is a good amount of time to split between that next project and a cup of tea to help you relax and focus.

It’s amazing how much time we waste and then justify it by saying it helps us relax and take the edge off of stress. In reality, managing our time better would alleviate that stress.

How much time have you regained since you stopped? My app uses this formula: Multiply how many days it’s been since you stopped by how many cigarettes you used to smoke per day. Then multiply that product by 5 and that will give you how many minutes you’ve saved.

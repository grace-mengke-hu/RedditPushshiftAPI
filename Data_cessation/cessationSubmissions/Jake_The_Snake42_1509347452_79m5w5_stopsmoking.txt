Withdrawal effects worse on bipolar people?

Hi everyone, currently standing outside my college dorm at 3 am in the cold ass Michigan weather smoking realizing after 3 years it's time to stop. However, I'm worried that the effects of withdrawal could be more serious on me as I have bipolar disorder? I don't know if it's my brain trying to get me to back off quitting or if this is a serious worry. I don't want to miss class due to this. Any other bipolar quitter with advice?

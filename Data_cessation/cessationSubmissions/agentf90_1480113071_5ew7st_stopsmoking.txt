Some tips that work for me...

Mainly i try to replace that endorphin rush from nicotine with something else.

I find coffee helps. I go to a local coffee shop and order a mocha or something else yummy. Cold brew, nitros, i don't care as long as I like it. $4 is nothing to pay instead of smoking.

I make it a personal challenge to find the cheapest best tasting street tacos in town. I will go to 3 different shops and buy one at each one.

jerk off when nobody is looking.

Having to restart after 140 days

So today I got some bad news, and because of that I have brought a pack after 140 days smoke free.

To me this isn't falling off the wagon this is a bump in the road, sadly it sets me back to 0 days. Oh well, these things happen. Guess I will be on here a bit more often again.

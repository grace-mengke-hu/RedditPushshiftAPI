I hate the Man i becoming.

It the same cycle, I quit for 3-4 weeks, but the side effects are always the same.

When I hit one month mark, I look at smokers at a shame and feel sorry for them, when I talk to someone who recently smoked I think to myself that he smells like death.

And guys, i REALLY DON’T WANT THAT.

When I stop smoking I get this habit of eating my  tips of the TOGO coffee cups and when I back from work and seeing them in my car make me look at myself in disgust way.

I also become snob as ****, my confidence raise and I feel like a douchebag like i was in my teens, and man I wanna grow up from that already.

I’m 26 and I know this IS the time where we shape ourselves the most, I really want to be non smoker, but the man I becoming is just not me, a fucking other snob version and i have a some kind of good heart. I look at people at same level, but when I quit, I make classes for every person, and it’s like I’m more in my head, cause the cigarettes are not giving me anything except they are relaxing me , and that’s true as the sun.

Today also the day I lay off the joints cause ya can’t quit both at the same time and on the other hand, I can’t smoke clean green cause it damn too expensive....

Maybe that are just symptoms of withdrawals? cause when I’m on one month mark I’m thinking to myself that this is how I’m gonna live, criticism, doubt,negative thoughts... and man for real I have like 0 negative thoughts, and when they come I just replace them with my goals in life and I’m back on track... but as soon as I fall my crutch......my nicotine chemical is like the negative winning ....

Considering register to the gym for almost 2 weeks and always find excuses.... maybe today is the day??

Guys?! I REALLY NEED hear similar stories to mine so I can relate and stick with my decision....

Thanks!

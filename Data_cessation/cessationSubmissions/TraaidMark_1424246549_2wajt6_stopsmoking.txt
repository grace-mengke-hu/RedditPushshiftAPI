Day 27

Very almost 30 days. I forgot about this whole thing. Thought about it again this morning and had to go count the days. So while I'm at it, lemme update here.

Day 27 and I don't smoke anymore. I haven't cheated once. I don't want to smoke. Cravings are like once maybe twice a day and so vague that most of the time I don't realise them at all.

We go out OFTEN, and for about the first few minutes I want to have a smoke with this lovely beer I'm having. It's easy to stay strong though, and 30 minutes later I'm having more than enough fun and don't even realise that I'm not smoking.

I now cycle and run and lift. I used to only cycle, but now I want to get strong too! :-) Lost a good few KG's. Down to 100kg from 105kg. Got some muscles growing, and I feel lighter and stronger than I have in months.

Overall it was a rough trip, not unbearable or even that hard. Just rough. But it seems we made it through the storm!

For those following in my footsteps:

- Get your head in the right gear. This is the most important thing in the world. Your head will determine your success.
- Take it easy and keep things simple.
- Do fun stuff every day. It breaks the pressure and well... fun things are fun.
- The biggest thing I had to deal with was the irrational anger. It lasts a few days, but feels like years. I strongly suggest you go get something to calm you down. I wen't with an over the counter relaxation drops. I would have liked something stronger, but was too lazy to go through the effort of getting it, which I guess means I didn't need it too much.

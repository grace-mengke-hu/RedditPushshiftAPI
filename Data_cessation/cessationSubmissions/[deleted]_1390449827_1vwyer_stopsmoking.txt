How bad is your sleeping pattern?

I'm on day 26 and I really don't think I've had a "normal" sleep for that time. For example, it's 4am right now and I'm wide awake. Sometimes I have naps during the day or evening depending on when I'm off. Basically, there is no consistency. Has anybody else experienced this when quitting?

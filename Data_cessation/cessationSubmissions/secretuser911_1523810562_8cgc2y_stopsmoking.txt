Can't Believe I Made It This Far (Also, quitting made me realize I have a stomach disease/disorder)

So I honestly forgot what day I am on for awhile because I don't have the urge to check anymore or to keep tabs (Its day 9). My cravings are more like annoying thoughts and are association/old routine based. 

Also, quitting smoking messed up my digestion so badly that I started getting a pain on my left side. The pain didn't stop, and I became worried. My friend kept telling me that I was just constipated, but I wanted to be safe so I went to the ER. 

Turns out I have diverticulitis and one of them became infected/inflamed, most likely due to the constipation that came from quitting smoking. I don't know how long I've had it, but I have to see a GI next week to make sure its healing/discuss the disorder more. 

I've lost 3-4 pounds since smoking, and I'm thinking its because of this. I've had hardly any appetite and the infection has taken my mind off smoking too. Anyhoo - Stay healthy y'all and keep up the good work!

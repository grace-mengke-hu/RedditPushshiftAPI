real nicotine junks and the problem with e-cigarettes

Hi everyone,

I made some huge mistakes and therefore want to share my experience hoping that others won't repeat it (that easily).

1. First, and you can skip this, I want to introduce you to my nicotine addiction. I began smoking at age of 16 but never was a big cigarette-smoker until i began to smoke weed and, as stupidally usually in Germany, i mixed it with tobaco. As cannabis never brought me in big troubles i wanted to stop smoking, especially stop to smoke tobacco but continue with weedconsumption. So i bought a vaporizer (for weed only) to separate nicotine from cannabis addiction. So i vaped my weed and bought an e-cigarette for nicotine(only). Soon I realised that i wasn't that much weed addicted because I skipped it every now and then. 

&amp;#x200B;

But i used the e-cigarette more and more. End of my workday i saw me using e-cigarette the whole time!! It was low dosed nicotine fluid but i used it at least 4 hours a day!! Imagine how long a cigarette will take (\~4mins\*30 cigs/day =120mins). But I thought it is no problem because I don't inhale or lets say very very less of the bad burning substances which cause cancer and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Some day, it was in my depressed phase of quitting weed after more than 15 years (another story), i didn't buy nicotine fluid because i was not able to leave the house due to my depression. Last day with nocotine fluid was a wednesday. From Thursday on i just smoked e-cigarette fluid without nicotine and i had no problems. Friday evening i began to feel like i am in a rollercoaster for at least an hour. On saturday i woke up too early having soo hard headaches and i felt like i drive a rollercoaster for an hour, 2 hours only headaches, then again rollercoaster. I felt like i have the flu of my life and considered to go to hospital because i felt terrible ill. I feared to have a  pneumoteritis because of the rollercoaster feeling and exhausting feelings (from doing nothing). On sunday the same thing, and aditionally like the days before, i still couldnt go to the toilet.

As i described my problems to a good friend on sunday, he told me that these are the typical withdrawals from a heavy nicotine addiction!! I couldn't believe. Rollercoasting some hours a day, 4 days in total, were due to the abscence of nicotine!!! He was right i searched the internet and found similar stories from people who smoked up to 5 (!!) packs of  strong cigarettes without filter!!! The (physical) withdrawals including headaches took me in total 3 weeks. The first time after, i think 6 days, i wanted to sh\*t, i also vomited simultaenously. Crazy. Psychical symptomps like irritation, aggression, ultimateviley bad mood and pure hate took about 5 weeks in total.

&amp;#x200B;

So long story, here is my conclusion and warning from e-cigarette containing nicotine smoking:

Even though i had a low dose (2mg of nicotine per ml), I inhaled soo strong and soo often that the real intake of nicotine was like i smoked 5 packs of strong cigarettes (before e-cigarette it was maximum 1 cigarette (+weed) per day!!). That means even you think you do low dose and even if you do not inhale that much like i did, the nicotine intake depends ultimately from your inhaling technique!! So you never can compare it to a certain amount of cigarettes unless you measure the nicotine content in your blood after smoking. Be aware.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!So for real junky-types like i am, don't do e-cigarettes with nicotine.!&lt;

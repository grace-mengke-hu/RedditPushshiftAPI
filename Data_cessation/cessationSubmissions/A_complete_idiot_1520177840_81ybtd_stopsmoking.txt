First vacation smoke free. It's awesome! Few things you all should be looking forward too.

At two months smoke free I'm having almost no cravings, and had a few wins along they way this week.   Hopefully it will motivate some of you. 

1.  Flying.   Holy shit.   Not thinking about smoking for a 3 hour flight, getting though security as late as possible, huffing down that last butt at the sky cab.  So freeing! 


2.  Hanging at the he pool.  Now it's without having to leave every half hour.  I used to spend half my vacation jonsing. 

3.  Going out drinking.  I love waking up in the am not feeling like an ashtray 


4.  Hotels.   Traveling down three floors at 1am used to be so degrading. 

5.  Concerts.   Not being "that guy" at concerts that everyone hates cause you stink. 

6.  Non smoking signs.  They are every where on vacation.  I realized every time I saw them it's a little reminder that I have a problem and should feel bad because I am not welcome.   No more!

Edit.  I forgot!  Fucking Bees!  They love smokers.  So great to see a bee fly right past not thinking about me...

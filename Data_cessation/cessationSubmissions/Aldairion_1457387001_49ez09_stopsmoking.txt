The Grass is Back!

In my backyard there's a little slab of concrete in the back corner that served as a smoke spot for my old room mate and me. We'd smoke while pacing back and forth between the slab and my back door, which wore down the grass into a little dirt pathway. 

I've been completely smoke free for a few months, and my room mate moved away a little before that - just this past weekend while playing with my dog in my backyard, I noticed that our little dirt path had disappeared under some fresh green grass! 

It was just a cool little mark of victory to notice; thought I'd share!

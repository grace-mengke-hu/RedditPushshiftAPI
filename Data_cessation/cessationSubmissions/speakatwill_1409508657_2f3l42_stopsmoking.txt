The Best 35 Days.

I have quit smoking and it has been 35 days since I smoked my last cigarette. I deliberately remember saying this is my last cigarette and I have been able to stay strong on my word since then. The first 2 weeks were a bit hard but after that it was easy and I realized how I made such a good decision. I am about to be 19 soon and I am very thankful to all of the people here who have helped me quit before my 19th birthday this was one of my goals and I am very happy to have achieved it. 



A cigarette urge usually lasts 5-7 mins so if you can somehow distract yourself in that time the urge will end. I don't even get an urge any more its all mental now and physical urge is absolutely gone. I don't miss cigarettes I do sometimes miss the thought of smoke coming out of my mouth but other then that nothing.

My health has improved drastically I am able to eat more (Good for me) as I am skinny. 
My skin is much better( less wrinkles and fairer) 

My lips colour have started to improve towards pinkish. 

Overall sense of achievement and positivity surrounds me. I am more disciplined and have increased self esteem and confidence. 

I had smoked for 2 years before I finally decided to quit on 27 July and people its really not that hard once you understand why cigarettes absolutely have no benefit whatsoever and its all just excuses you give yourself which are not based on facts it will be easier for you to make your brain give up the addiction it will be easier to control the urges. 

Stay strong, Stay healthy Stay Positive. 


Thank you so much people. This Subreddit has changed my life for good and I try to help as much people quit smoking as I can.

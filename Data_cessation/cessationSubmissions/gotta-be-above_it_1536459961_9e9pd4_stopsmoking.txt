Time to stop

I've quit drinking, I've quit smoking pot, I've quit watching porn. Cigarettes has proven a taller task than all the latter in my experience, but I know I can do this. Especially since I've gotten those addictions out of the way and made it through all of them. It starts right now. Just gotta not smoke right now and keep not smoking right now. You'll be seeing me around, thanks for being here!!

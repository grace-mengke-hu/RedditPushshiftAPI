Damn the torpedos! Full speed ahead!

This is war! It would take 5 minutes, 5 minutes I could be at the store. Row's and row's of tobacco, cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco just sitting there. You know what, let it sit there. It would be fleeting at best and i'd be exactly where I was before only more depressed.

My life and my health is too important to trade it for tobacco. It only took 2 weeks for the doors to start opening. My skin look's better as do my teeth. I started jogging again. With the money I saved in this short period I bought myself new work out gear, running shoes and track suits. I can feel my body getting healthier with each step.
Instead of poisoning myself i'm pampering myself, massages, steams, swimming etc....So that tobacco can sit there, i'm done with it.

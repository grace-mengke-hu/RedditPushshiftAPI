I'm asking for a little encouragement.

I'm on day 5. Day 1 &amp; 2 were a piece of cake. Even day 3 wasn't bad! Day 4,  only time I had a craving was driving on my way home from work after a stressful 10 hours. And now here we are on day 5 and need some encouragement. I got this in the bag and I'm not going to give in. I just really need to hear from you guys, because I'd rather jump into a pit of mating alligators right now than be going through this craving.

I'm still going to be victorious. Can someone find me a pit of alligators?

Quitting smoking is the best decision ever

January 2015 I quit smoking and started working out. I didn't had specific goals at that time, but I wanted to be generally more healthy. It was very tough initially and pushed through, It has been over an year now and when I look back the decision to quit smoking has been my best decision since. I went from 75kg (BMI - 27.5) to 57.5kg (BMI-21.1) and I run almost every day a minimum of 3k. I can run 5km in 25min and can do 10k in about 55mins and generally look and feel way better than I used to. Progress picture [here](http://i.imgur.com/u6EmnCs.jpg)

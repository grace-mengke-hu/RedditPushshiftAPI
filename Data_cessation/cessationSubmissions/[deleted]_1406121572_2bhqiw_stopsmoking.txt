3 weeks and sailing :) Hang in there

First cigarette at age 11. Half-pack+ daily starting at age 15. Smoked for twenty years. Quit many many times, then finally quit for 10 years, after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Sailed for ten years as a happy non-smoker.

Should have known better, but ten years later I got overconfident and thought the odd smoke at a party would be harmless. One smoke at one party led to the next. Then a pack on a holiday. Then a pack now and then. You get the picture.

Had a heck of a time quitting again. Thanks Allen Carr but lightening only strikes once. Found this reddit group and it seems to be doing the trick. Inspired by others. Feedback keeping me honest. 3 weeks smoke free and sailing happily. Feeling very confident I won't be fooled again.

Hang in there folks. As Carr says, the so-called "pleasure" of smoking is just the relief from withdrawal symptoms caused by the last cigarette. It is the pleasure of being a non-smoker, something non-smokers enjoy all the time. I know this to be true.

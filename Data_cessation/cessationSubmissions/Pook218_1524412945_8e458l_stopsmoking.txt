Day 1 with patch

Currently on day one with step two 14 mg patches. I’ve smoked for the last twelve years and I’m just ready to be done. My daughter is starting to notice my habit, I’m beginning to hate the smell that’s constantly surrounding me, and I’m ready to find a healthier way to deal with my anxiety. So far, so good. I find myself feeling panicky but not as much as my previous attempts of quitting cold turkey. So... hey, y’all.

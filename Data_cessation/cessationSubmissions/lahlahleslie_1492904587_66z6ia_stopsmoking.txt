First Day

Almost have my first day under my belt and it feels good. In reality, it hasn't been so bad...you know, the fear of feening and that voice in your head that can talk you into just having one...ive been able to resist and just go about my day.  It's mostly been spent at home, laying low,  and succeeding so far.

Taking it one hour at a time helps and a deep breath when the thought or urge comes. I can do this. 14 years too long spent on that junk.

My motivation is building a family and so far I haven't been able to get pregnant. Hoping that by taking this huge leap, my body will heal and do the things I've been wishing for.

Day 2, I'm coming for you!

8 days and beat a major craving today. Keep on going!

I'm at 8 days. For the last few months, the longest I could get past was 2 days max. 

I feel like I am on a good streak and getting stronger with each passing day.

I had a major craving today, which didnt want to leave my mind, but I eventually got on with my day... and I am sooooooooooo damn happy I didnt cave it. 

Keep on going you guys, you got this!!!

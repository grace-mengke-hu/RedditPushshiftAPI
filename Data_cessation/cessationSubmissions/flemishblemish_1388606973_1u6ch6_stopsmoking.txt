Surrounded by so many cigarettes last night

But I didn't take a single puff!

I was at a huge rave/concert for NYE and not only did my group decide to stand by the fog machine (unnnghh), but there were tons of people smoking and passing cigarettes all around me (this is at an indoor event, mind you).

Not only did I not take a single puff, I seriously had to leave the crowd and watch from afar because the smell and the haze was waaayy too much for me to handle. If I'd been in the same situation only a month ago, I would have been lighting up along with the rest of them, not even thinking about it. Instead, I was covering my face, coughing, and itching to get out of my clothes as soon as I got home, because they smelled so strongly like smoke. 

So here's to 10—almost 11—days free of cigarettes! Whether you're just starting your life as a non-smoker today, or you've been smoke free for years, stay strong and happy new year! **We can do it!**

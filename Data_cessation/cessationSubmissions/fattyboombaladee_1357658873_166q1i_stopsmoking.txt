21 years of smoking and so many attempts.  Why is this time so easy?  

I really wanted to quit all those other times, through the patch, the gum, hypnosis, e-cigs...but i never made it more than a day or two.  I'm on 7 days now...and haven't had even one craving. Cold turkey this time.  

You just have to know that you are done, I think.  I'm not a smoker anymore. Good luck, and may the force be with all of you.  It doesn't have to be hard.  Just think of all the awesome shit that will happen once you are done with coffin nails.

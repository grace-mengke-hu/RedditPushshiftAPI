3 weeks in, my contract to a lifetime smoke free!

Here it is-my commitment to a nonsmoking future. I hereby declare to myself and anyone who stumbles across this note that I will never put another cigarette between my lips. I will never inhale some deadly smoke into my lungs. I won't compromise my life, my health, my time on earth for a silly little stick of toxins. I'm stronger than that. I don't need to depend on these chemicals to get through the day or a tough time or a bit of emotion. I'm not an addict. I can stay smoke free. I WILL stay smoke free. This is a promise, one I refuse to break. I am making myself responsible, in front of you and you and you as witnesses, for this decision. I have quit smoking. I won't go back. Here's to smoke free forever. Of course it wont be easy all the time. I will struggle and crave and be desperate for relief. Im not saying that wont happen. Ill be tempted for sure, thats out of my control. But i am saying i wont give in. I will fight and i will succeed. Im strong, im determined, im unstoppable. This is my contract to the world and I can't go back now. Signed, me.

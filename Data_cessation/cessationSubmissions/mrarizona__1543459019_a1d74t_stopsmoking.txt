[Question] Got some questions for stopping!

Okay hey. I‘m smoking for (only) 2 years but since 1 year I‘ve been smoking a pack in 1-2 days. 

I‘m feeling my lungs already. Breathing problems especially when I wake up and for the last two weeks I‘ve been coughing a lot.

I mainly smoked because I had fun doing it, but now I want to stop.

I‘ve quit a few times already and it lasted 1-2 months but I always started again when it got really stressful at work.

How do you courage yourself to quit smoking and then don’t start again?

How do you manage stressful days?

How long will it take to breathe freely again?

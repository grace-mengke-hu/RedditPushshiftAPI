Should I finish this pack?

Should I smoke all of this pack before quitting or should I just throw them away and quit? 
Also, any tips on quitting when other people around you still smoke? I find having easy access to more cigarettes always pulls me back in.
Hopefully I can get my badge tomorrow and keep it!

The Three Day Curse

Hi all! 

I started smoking about a half pack a day over the past year after having a move to a new country, death in the family, and becoming sick with autoimmune issues due to the stress. I am trying to quit, and my fellow smokers in the family who’ve been quitting recently seem to be able to power through. 

I’ve been using the “smoke free” app, GABA supplements, nicotine gum, etc, and no matter what, on the third day the anxiety has kicked me hard and I cave and buy a new pack. Have any of you got some advice? Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.

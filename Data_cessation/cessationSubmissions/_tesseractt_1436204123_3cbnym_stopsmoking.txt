Just need to rant a bit.

Hi everyone. This is my first post on /r/stopsmoking but I've lurked here and there over the past year or so. 

First off, some information about myself. I am 20 years old, I started smoking when I was 12, and was a pack a day smoker for about 5 years. I quit smoking on November 1st, 2014 and haven't had a single cigarette since then. This is the longest I have ever gone without a single smoke and this is the first time I've ever truly felt like I didn't NEED cigarettes.

Now here's where the rant begins.

I've tried almost every method there is for quitting. I tried cold turkey, patches, gum, etc. The only method that has actually worked for me is vaping. Now I don't know how a lot of the people on this sub feel about vaping, but for me it saved my life yet all I fucking hear from people around me when I tell them I haven't smoked in 8 months is, "well you're still vaping so it doesn't really count." No, fuck you. This is the most difficult thing I've ever gone through. More difficult than depression and pill addiction and a whole lot more shit. I'm finally proud of myself for keeping to my word and finally trying to live a better life.

According to the app I downloaded, here are my stats:

Days without smoking: 246

Cigarettes not smoked: 4941

Money saved: $1,358

Thank you for anyone who reads this. As all of you know, this is a difficult thing to go through and its just nice to find a community where I can blow off some steam.

I've quit smoking regularly, and now only smoke when tired/stressed.

Working 70-80 hours a week, waking up at 5am when I've gone to sleep at 3am, and working all day, sometimes I get exhausted and I chug energy drinks and smoke ciggs to stay awake.  Plus, when I have something in my mouth smoking while driving down the road, I'm less likely to doze off and swerve/crash.  I've had several times I've blinked, closed my eyes for just a few seconds and I was nearly in a crash....

Is there a better alternative?

I used to smoke regularly, but now I only seem to smoke when stressed (emotially), when tired (physically), or when I'm doing other substances (More healthy, less regular, non-addictive substances that I won't mention here).  

I find when I have a pack, I smoke it.  I wish they sold 1/2 packs or 1/4 packs for uncommitted smokers that just want to get through a day/3 day long stint of working doubles....

I've gotten to the point where I can taste how horrible they are...

Plus, I don't even like ciggs anymore because they spray all those chemicals onto them that make them burn evenly and the stuff so it goes out when you drop them, makes them go out in your hand if you're not taking a puff every 15 seconds, which is way too fast and causes you to increase smoking...

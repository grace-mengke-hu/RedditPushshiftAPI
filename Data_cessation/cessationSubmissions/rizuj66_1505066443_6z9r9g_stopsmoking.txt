Can't study!!

Permission to vent....damn it....i have one month to write an assignment, first since quitting. I get very stressed writing, and taking a smoke break helped me think. Have tried taking a bottle of water break but this is not working.  Also my new addiction of exercise is way more fun than studying....quitting is great for my health but totally lousy for my Masters degree....!!

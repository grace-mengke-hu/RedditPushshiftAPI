Please help! Feel like smoking again.

Hey guys. Mostly been lurking on this subreddit. I decided to quit 33 days ago and found it quite manageable. I quit because I started getting chest pains and because I had to change some bad things in my life. 

I'm now in the second stage of changing things in my life. I have to sharply cut my intake of caffeine, eat only healthy food and change my sleep patterns after two years of bad habits. 

It's only been a day and I'm already beginning to feel like picking up a cigarette (only one. Just to help deal with everything that's changing, says my mind) and today, I took two drags of a cigarette before throwing it away. 

I know I won't relapse completely, but I don't want to smoke at all. I've felt good this last month and more energetic and more optimistic. 

Does anyone have any tips they could give me or anything to suggest that would help me out? I'm going a little crazy.

Thanks guys.

1 week and still going...

So I'm quitting with my boyfriend for his health and its been 1 week and not so bad so far but I'm worried that when I go into social situations where my friends smoke that I am going to be tempted to smoke. 
How have other people dealt with this? Are gum and patches worth considering?

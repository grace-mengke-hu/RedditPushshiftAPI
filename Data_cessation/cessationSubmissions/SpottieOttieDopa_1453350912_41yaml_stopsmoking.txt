What happens when I stop taking Champix/Chantix?

I've been doing pretty well so far, quitting has been way easier than I thought it would be. I've been taking Champix/Chantix and I read The Easy Way, both of which have been helpful. I just wanted to hear about other people experience when they stop taking the Champix/Chantix. If they had more cravings or more intense cravings? I'm still going to keep taking it for a 5 or 9 more weeks.

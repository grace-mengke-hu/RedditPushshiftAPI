Raging

Came out of work today absolutely fucking raging and what did I do............put Spotify on n listened to some angry rock music, that’s what I did. It wasn’t until I was reflecting on the day later that I realised that in my raging moments I had no thoughts of smoking or buying cigarettes, I now consider this a small victory as times like that normally lead to my quit attempt being derailed, i think if we can conquer the psychology of cigarettes being our go to or our safe place to get us through difficult times then the battle is half won already. Hope u are all doing well and having some success on your quit journeys, let’s keep fighting, we can do this 👍

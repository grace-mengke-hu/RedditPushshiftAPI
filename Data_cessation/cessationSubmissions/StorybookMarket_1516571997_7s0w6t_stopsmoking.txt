How to support my husband while he quits?

He's a long-time smoker. He went from smoking Marlboros to roll your owns which saves quite a bit of money, but now we are expecting a child in August and he really wants to quit for his health. Today is day one and I just feel so horrible for him, I've never smoked and I can't imagine the withdrawals... 


What can I do, as a spouse, to support him?

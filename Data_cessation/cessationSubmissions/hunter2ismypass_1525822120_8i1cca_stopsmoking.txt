Depression

Today I was on day 4 of cold turkey but the depression got to me. It got pretty bad this afternoon so I caved in and bought a pack.

I realize that depression is part of quitting smoking but it seemed like it got pretty bad. Is it normal for it to get this bad?

I wasn't suicidal but wasn't happy about being alive. I do suffer from clinical depression but my meds keep it under control pretty well. At this point I don't know if the nicotine and MAOIs (in cigarettes) were helping to keep my depression under control or if it's purely depression from the withdrawal.

Or perhaps the lack of nicotine and or other chemicals means I would need a dose adjustment for my meds.

20 days off after 25 years

It is not my first attempt, having smoked 20+ for 25 years, but I want it to be the last.

I am grateful to and humbled by all of you sharing your stories and your support and your kindness.

What helped me a lot is going for walks, especially into nature. Also, observing the changes in my metabolism has shown me the harm of my addiction in more drastic ways than on my previous attempts: poor sleep, constipation, concentration problems.... Time to overcome them to leave them behind!

Thank you all!

In 2 minutes it will be a day. Last cig was at 4:45 am CST on the 13th of June, MMXV.

and I'm doing so-so. this is the first time that i've ever tried to quit seriously but yesterday something happened that made me put them down for good (i hope). i felt a small, sickening heart-skip when I got to the end of the second cigarette of a two-smoke work break - it was just a tiny twinge but I was like, feeling it in my heart and brain. the poison. i want to free myself of the reliance of knowing when and what i'll be doing when i'm smoking. wish me luck.

Edit: still smoke free at 11:30 pm on the 15th of June!

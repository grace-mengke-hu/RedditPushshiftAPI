Forgot I even stopped.

It's been since April 21st I believe (not sure) since I quit smoking. 
I've been getting over a bout of Bronchitis but other than that I have felt fantastic. A few mood swings here and there but I don't wake up with dull headaches every day. 
I have no urges to smoke and I should hope so because most of my friends smoke anyway. 
I feel great and the decision to quit was easy and the results came even easier. 
It's felt so good that I forgot I ever smoked.

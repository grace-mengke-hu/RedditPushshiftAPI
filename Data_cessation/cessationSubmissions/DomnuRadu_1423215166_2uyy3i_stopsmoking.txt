motivational tips & tricks

Hi guys,

After 30 years of (heavy) smoking I am now clean for 5 days :) The only problem I have is to keep myself motivated. I know is for my health but am I really going to "undo" 30 years of smoking? It's not about the money because I can afford smoking. It's not about "feeling better" because I was feeling perfect before. I don't really know why I am doing this but I try to keep on going. The biggest question I have is: OK, I'm 45 so I stop smoking, drinking and in a while I will also forget about sex probably ... and ... what's left? It's true I am really in a dark mood those days but still ... Do you have any good motivational tips and tricks?

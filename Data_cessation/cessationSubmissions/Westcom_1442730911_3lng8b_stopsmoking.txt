My last vice. And also the hardest.

So here's the deal reddit...

Two years ago, on my 30th birthday, I decided I needed to get my shit together. I was addicted to drugs, alcohol, caffeine, severely obese and of course a smoker. I've done the rehab thing (over two years sober now), I'm no longer caffeine dependant, and after losing 60 lbs recently, I'm near my goal weight.

The only thing left is smoking. 

But this one intimidates me the most, and I don't know why. I have failed at this task so often in the past, that I'm not feeling optimistic about my success.

Reddit helped me lose the weight, so I thought I should check out this sub for some helpful hints from you quitters!

Any tips and tricks to help my success would be greatly appreciated. I read somewhere on reddit that people in this sub have been known to read some book that really helped them out (or I'm sadly mistaken/confused).

Either way, I'm open to hear all of your ideas to try what I haven't tried I'm the past! 

Thanks all!

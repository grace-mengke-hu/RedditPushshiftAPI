Behvioral Illness & Quitting Smoking [xpost from r/mentalhealth]

I'm 25 years old and have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADD. I was diagnosed around 3.5 years ago, and I've been a regular cigarette smoker for 10 years. In 1 hour I will reach 63 days without a cigarette after abruptly stopping. I had been thinking about quitting for some time, and on October 10th I had a friend make a very inspirational facebook status about quitting. That day I found a pdf of Alan Carr's famous book and read the whole thing in a day and smoked the last 4 in my pack.


Obviously at first it was tough, but it was suprisingly way easier than I though it would be. The last 2 weeks have been a breeze, but then this weekend I could not get the thought out of my mind, I even had dreams where I was smoking again and I remember not really being disappointed with myself, I felt as though it was bound to happen at some point.


I remember when I was first diagnosed being told not to stop smoking for the time being, as added stress would not be good for someone fresh out of a voluntary hospitalization. Does anyone else have experience with mental illness and quiting tobacco use?


For what it's worth I am an avid mmj user. I know there are articles written discussing the risks of marijuana inducing psychosis in some bipolar patients, but I've found nothing but positive effects from my cannabis consumption.

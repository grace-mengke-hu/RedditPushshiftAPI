I just poured water on my pack.

I've never done that before. I want to wake up tomorrow a non smoker. I'm 36 and have been smoking a pack a day for going on 23 years. I can't quit for anything, at the most twice and only a week long at that. My son turned 11 last week and all he wanted was for me to quit. That's what he's wanted for the last three birthdays. These things are killing me. I just hope tomorrow I don't want to go to the store or find a reason why I need another one. I've been lurking forever and I'm hoping if I post tonight that I'm quitting that I'll stick to it. Please wish me luck you guys!

Getting a jump start on my New Years resolution

So I've been smoking for about 5-6 years on and  off, mostly on. My longest periods without nicotine have been about 9 months. But I just came home from university and I hate smoking around my parents, mostly my mom, she doesn't know I smoke regularly. 

But being home I'm about 2 days without a smoke, I feel like I can really do the long haul, and this is a good time to go for it. I'm really concerned that I'll relapse in another day, because mom goes back to work and I'll have the house to myself, and also in a week I'm going on a big trip with friends to go ski, and have never skied without smoking.

Not really sure where I'm going with this post, just looking to vent my thoughts I suppose.

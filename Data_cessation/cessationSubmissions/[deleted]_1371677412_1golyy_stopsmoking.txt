its day 4 and its killing me

hey stopsmoking,
already quit numerous times but always started again. Most of the time im going back to smoking when im in a stressfull situatoin or one is comming up. But my biggest problem is the amount i smoke if i do. Depanding on the stress i smoke 10 to 20 cig a day. Im only 22 and i dont want to hurt myself and my body anymore. 

Its day 4 and i allready prepared an ashtray and looked around my apartment for some cigarettes..	luckily didnt find any
.. 

(Excuse my english, its not my first language)

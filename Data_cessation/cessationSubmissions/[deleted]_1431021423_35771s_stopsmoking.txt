60 days!!

I promised /u/hiimdecision that I would post on my 60th day and here it is! I've had some pretty bad cravings recently but I have never caved! One thing I will say is that even when life through obstacles my way and life has got me down, I just remember how long it's been since I smoked and I feel so proud it overpowers all the negative feelings. 

I have turned to this sub in my time of need and I can't be more grateful for you all. Thanks for the constant and continued support! Let's not smoke today

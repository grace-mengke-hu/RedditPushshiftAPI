I keep having these dreams since I quit smoking... anyone else?

So it's been a little over a month, and so far so good. One thing I will note however is that I've been having weird dreams.
First, during the night between day 3 and day 4, I had one of the worst nightmares of my life. After thinking about it the next morning and doing research, I read that on average, nicotine takes 3-4 days to completely evacuate the system. So maybe that was the last of the nicotine in my body putting up a fight? Interesting...

Next, every other night or so, in my dream I realise that I'm smoking a cigarette. It's not like I'm enjoying it or anything, it's just the habit. And I realise "shit, I'm smoking... I'm not supposed to be smoking. Why did I do this?" And I feel so incredibly disappointed in myself. It's so nice to wake up in the morning to realise that I haven't let myself down. It also lets me know that if I do start smoking again, the only person I'm really letting down is myself. I'll have done all this hard work for nothing.

I'm curious, do you guys have dreams like that? nightmares?

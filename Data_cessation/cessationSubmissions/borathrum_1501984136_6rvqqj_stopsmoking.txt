3rd day in and I feel great.

I quit because of the chest pains I got recently and I thought it was due to the smoking habit i had for 3+ years. I had trouble even when I was walking fast and I was feeling that my breathing was not enough for my lungs. Today i needed to catch a bus and had to run. God that was something different. I was not out of breath easily and I did not feel tired after 30 seconds. I actually felt great and might turn this into a habit for my health and stamina. Running made me feel real good after a loooong time. I can't believe how long I poisoned my veins and lungs.

Are nicotine amounts in vaping (to substitute smoking) differential or is nicotine negative to the body regardless of the amount?

36 days in and doing really well. I have a vape pen that I use while driving or when Ive been drinking. My question is, is the amount of nicotine important or is the fact that Im taking in nicotine bad plain and simple? I started off at 6mg (for a 30ml bottle) and have tapered down to 2mg (30ml)... and the 30ml bottle will last me at least 2-3 months. Im debating my next bottle being 0mg, but I don't know if Im still 'hooked' on nicotine or if the amount is so small that its basically a placebo effect at this point. Anyone have any insight?

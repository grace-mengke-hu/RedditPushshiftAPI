I'll never smoke when I'm sober, ever.

I'll probably ramble, feel like letting it out a bit.

I'm a 22 year old man who started smoking half a pack regularly for the past 7ish months. I had never smoked when I was sober before getting into a B-school, the academic stress combined with my girlfriend leaving me was the perfect recipe for me to start smoking to help with the 'stress'. Being surrounded by smokers didn't help either. I would smoke a fag or two when drinking, slowly I found myself smoking 5-6 a day. I hated myself and what I had become, the constant cravings, the self-disgust that came after lighting one up and worst of all, how I began to love smoking.

I had always been athletic, and for the past 2-3 months I started noticing the waist of my pants stretching, I also felt out of breath simply by climbing up a couple flights of stairs. 

My finances also started dwindling and I resolved to quit smoking. The longest I went without smoking was 4 days a couple months ago, the stress had me lighting up again. But this time, I have resolved to quit smoking for good, I smoked my final (sober) cigarette last night, downloaded the smoke free and Prana breathe apps. It hasn't been 24 hours yet, but I have successfully resisted cravings since then, I hope this continues to happen.The one thing that surprised me was, smoking doesn't relieve stress, it exacerbates the condition. 

I went through a lot of posts on this sub, and after seeing decade long, 2 pack-a-day smokers successfully quit, I know I can do it too. I start an internship in 2 days and I really don't wanna be among the smokers, and I don't want to relapse because of the stress of starting a new job, I hope I make it. To any new quitters, we can do it!

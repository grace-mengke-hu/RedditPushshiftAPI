checking in after a long while

Haven't been to this sub in a while, but just wanted to share my experience from 850+ days.

I still feel cravings, although they are lower than they have ever been. Especially if I smell someone smoking...the smell draws me in. I'm learning that this is a constant battle, and I'll probably have cravings until I die. Right now I get 1-2 cravings a week, and they pass very quickly thankfully. Don't let this be discouraging though! The cravings now are EASILY manageable, although they exist.

Something that helped me quit was downloading the QuitNow! app on my phone. Seeing the number of days go up was a constant reminder of my accomplishment, and helpful when I was having intense cravings. I still have it, and look at it every now and then. 

I used to get intense cravings whenever I would enter a gas station and see all the tobacco products. Now, it doesn't phase me. The only thing that seems to trigger a craving is actually smelling smoke. 

To all those that have just recently quit, you got this! I know you've probably experienced and/or read this before, but the cravings are most intense at the beginning, but if you can push through, it constantly gets easier.

Interestingly enough, I'm having a harder time quitting marijuana. Good thing there's /r/leaves  for that.

9 days. Just had a cigarette.

Fought urges all week then, don’t know what happened. Gave in, had a cigarette. Currently lightheaded and feeling guilty. 
Posting moreso to encourage those who want to give in to the cravings. Don’t! It doesn’t feel good. I feel like shit. All those feelings of guilt, shame and disgust came flooding back. The cravings feel better mentally than giving in to the urge does.
I was doing so well but must reset my counter to day 1. Yuck, but I got this. You do too. 
Onward and upward!

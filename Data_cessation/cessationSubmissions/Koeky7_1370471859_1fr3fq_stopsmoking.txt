Today was hard

Hello people!


Today was a really bad day. I got a job at a supermarket (not fulltime, to pay my school money). And normally I just fill the shelves. But not today! Today I had to sell tobacco at the service desk of the store. I have never touched so many packs of cigarettes in 1 day. The Luckies looked so nice! Also Camel has a limited edition pack because they are 100 years. The pack looked very nice. I really wanted one. But I stayed strong! 


Good luck with quitting! :D

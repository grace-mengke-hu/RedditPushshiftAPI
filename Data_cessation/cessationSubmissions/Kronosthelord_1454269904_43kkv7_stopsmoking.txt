Chest pain/ pull after four days of quitting

Hey guys. I posted here long ago, but couldn't bring myself to quit. I realised then that I was quitting for others and not myself. A few days ago, a stabbing pain when I bent down or lay down made me realise the effect it was having on me and I decided to quit. It's been 4 days and I don't feel like having one unless I'm alone and have a more of time to waste. 

That's just me wanting to share my story with a few people who won't assume I'll fail, though. 

I've been going through this chest pain/ pull for the last few hours. I haven't puffed a cigarette, haven't done any strenuous physical activity that might have caused this and the only strain I can think of causing to my body was eating too much  in the afternoon. 

Does this happen to everyone or is this something I have to get checked immediately? I'm a little FREAKED out, but was told that the lungs repair themselves after quitting and it causes pain. Could someone please help?

Thanks a lot, guys.

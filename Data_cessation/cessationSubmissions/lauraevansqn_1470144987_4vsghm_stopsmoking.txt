I can't believe it's finally been a year without a cigarette.

Never thought a phone app would be the one tool to actually help me quit smoking. 

QuitNow! App has helped me find inspiration to quit smoking by showing me really key data points. How many cigarettes I haven't smoked and how much money i've saved (shopping time! <3 ). And how my body is changing and improving.

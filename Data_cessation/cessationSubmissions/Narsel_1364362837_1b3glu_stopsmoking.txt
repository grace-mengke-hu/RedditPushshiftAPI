Attempting to quit whilst backpacking..

Due to a few issues (health, fitness etc) I want to quit, badly. I don't like how i'm controlled by this addiction but it's a horrible addiction none the less. One of the worst things about deciding to quit at this point in my life is that i'm currently backpacking, and literally everyone i've met smokes. Specifically in hostels where chances are you're gonna be hanging out with other backpackers who smoke away regardless of anyone else. 

Basically, I need some tips/motivation too help me. Fire away reddit, i'm a long time browser and this is my first post.

Whoa 3 weeks! Hot dog!

Hey cool I did a thing! Last quit attempt went 41 days. This time is gonna stick forever. I "liked" smoking, but I like "not smoking" more.

A few more things I've learned:

*Smoking isn't super cool and bad-ass anymore
*It is possible to wake up without a headache
*Not smoking cigarettes will lead to more not smoking, and eventually become the norm
*Your brain remembers the good ol' days, but so do most racists
*You can go outside and enjoy the weather without a cigarette
*No really
*You can
*Just go outside and take a deep breath and hold it in and you'll feel out of breath... you know... like you would have if you smoked.

Has anyone used supplements or medications/drugs to help quit smoking?

Just curious if anyone has tried supplements or meds to help withdrawal and quitting.

I feel like I'm missing the feel good chemicals in my brain when I don't smoke.. 

I've tried lots of ways to quit, successful once, now back on the insanity train. 

Google came up with nac, murcuna priens, tyrosine, and some stronger prescribed meds like wellbutrin.

Any advice or stories would be awesome.

Thanks

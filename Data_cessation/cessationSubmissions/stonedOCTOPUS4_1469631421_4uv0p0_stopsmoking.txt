Been smoking for 8 years and quit yesterday.

This is my first post on Reddit, sorry if I do anything wrong. 
I have a question for people who have quit and haven't have a cigarette in awhile. What helped you best with quitting? Ive been wanting to quit for awhile and my GF has wanted it for awhile now too. Her birthday was 2 days ago and one of the gifts I gave her was to quit smoking. What sucks is in a few weeks from now, she leaves for college in a different country. I dont have a single friend where I live since they all moved away and i struggle with depression pretty badly. What helped me get through days of not seeing my GF last year when she was in school was to smoke. I really dont want to get back to smoking and i am just curious what has helped others. Thanks everyone

I got this Shit

So i'm unemployed and have been a pack a day smoker for nearly 3 years.

Due to aforementioned unemployment, I ran out of money last Sunday and couldn't buy a pack.

decided to just quit, as that's much easier to deal with then picking butts off the ground in the backyard (though I could probably get a lot.)

Well that day I decided to quit seemed to be the first bad day I'd had in months, (this always seems to happen.) My Netflix and PS+ subscription ended. And the girl I had been dating since roughly December decided to break things off. 3 first world problems coupled with a sudden drop in nicotine levels suddenly don't feel like first world problems...

I just find it weird that the days seem worse when i'm quitting, like is that just a me thing or what?


Any way, i'm doing okay now. I've had 5 cigarettes in 3 days (compared to 60 I think that's good.) And I've started jogging in the mornings (fuck that Shit. I really hope it gets easier.)

Tomorrow is going to be my first day nicotine free, i'm honestly excited. The withdrawal symptoms I get after merely a few hours feel like a boring high (seriously what's with my lungs feeling underwater?) So i'm excited to see how that plays out.

I just wanted to post here after I subscribed. And I apologize if this wasn't the best of reads, I honestly don't even feel like my brain is firing on all cylinders.

Hopefully I can have good news for you guys, I honestly haven't gone more than about 18 hours without a smoke since I started. So it's probably not going to be fun, but I don't want to rely on a substance to feel human anymore, and I really think not having the means to buy smokes is going to be a lot of help.

I'll stop ranting now! I promise.

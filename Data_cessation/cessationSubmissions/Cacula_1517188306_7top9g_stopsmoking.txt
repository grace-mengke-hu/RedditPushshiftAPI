Want to quit, any advice?

I've been smoking for about 5 years. I want to quit due to health and financial reasons. It's become far too expensive to smoke in Australia haha

But I just don't know if I can. It's do embedded into my lifestyle that I don't know if I can do it.

Any tips for cravings? Does nicotine gum work? Or patches?

Cheers

Weird Cravings

I think my brain tapped into a new area of mental triggers that I haven't fought off yet. I don't know if it has something to do with the weather changing or something.

I'm fine all day at work and never think about smoking, even when Im around the people I used to smoke with. 

However, for the last 2 nights when I am at home playing games or watching TV, out of nowhere I will get a really intense craving for a smoke, almost as intense as the first week. 

I haven't caved, and just tried not to think about it and continued snacking on my grapes and peanuts...

but, holy shit these have been strong cravings...

I just needed to vent this one out here and see if others have experienced anything like it at around this time in their quit.

Cheers!

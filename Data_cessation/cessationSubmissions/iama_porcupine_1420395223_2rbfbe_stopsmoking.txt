Just a few things that have helped me...

I'm on day 4. Here are a couple of things I've done so far that have seemed to help a bit: 

Obvious #1 - throw out/hide from plain sight lighters/matches/ashtrays and cig boxes. 

#2 - do your laundry & clean up your space. everything will be fresh. I noticed my winter coats smell like smoke- I'm going to get them dry cleaned. It's really made a difference with me so far. I actually notice that what I'm wearing smells great. 

#3- I switched to tea. I loved a coffee & a smoke. I'm just not certain I can handle a coffee- yet. Although, I'm taking in less cream and less sugar this way! Win/win.

#4 Water- and lots of it. 

Anyways- just a few of my suggestions. I feel fantastic. I have energy. I woke up this morning and actually wanted breakfast- something that I haven't had in a while. 

Good luck everybody! The cravings always go away!

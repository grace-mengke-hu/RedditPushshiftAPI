Strongest craving since quitting

It's been 24 hours and all I want to do is smoke again, I hate myself, I hate what I'm eating (healthy shit except the occasional ramen), hate where I'm at in life, old and still in college, no friends, interests seem lame, even my favorite albums sound boring and dreadful.

I want to smoke a whole pack, simultaneously eat pizza and chug sodas laying down on the grass in a park nearby; have the last few while on a swing. 

Idiotic I know, how is that gonna make anything better? It seems like nothing matters and it's pointless prolonging this miserable existence if it's going to be this empty, after 70 fucking days, cravings came and I got onto the next thing, but currently it feels like an endless episode that I needed to share with others, perhaps come back to my sanity seeing how little sense this train of thought have gotten.
